The impact on the richness, diversity, and evenness of plant species derived from descriptive statistical analyses was shown to initially increase, and then decrease, with an increase in harvesting intensity. The most critical impacts were on the richness, diversity, and evenness of shrub and herb species.

Fifth year growth and survival of five commonly planted tree species were contrasted in canopy gaps (single-tree to 5000 m(2)), in the forest understory and in the open conditions of a clear-cut. There were strong and consistent trends in growth response among the tree species as gap size increased. Growth of all the species increased rapidly from small single-tree gaps to about 1000 m(2) gaps, but thereafter, showed little change up to 5000 m(2). Tree size and current growth rates for all species were highest in full open conditions. Performance of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the most light-demanding species, exceeded that of all other species in large gaps (1001-5000 m(2)) and clearcuts. In large and medium gaps (301-1000 m(2)), the largest trees of all species were found in the middle gap position and there was little difference between the sunny north and shady south positions, except for lodgepole pine which clearly grew poorly in the south position. Total size and growth rates of all species were nearly identical in small gaps (20-300 m(2)) and again in the forest understory. The light advantage expected off the north end of high latitude gaps was not a benefit for tree growth, suggesting that below-ground effects of canopy edge trees have an important influence on seedling growth in these forests.

Additionally, we described vegetation structure and recorded ground temperature and humidity during the sampling period.

The response of spiders on each stratum showed interesting trends; opposite to the general pattern, in young plantations the ground strata exhibited a rich and distinctive spider assemblage while herbaceous strata showed similar diversity (richness and species composition) in all three plantation ages. Our results showed a rapid increase in spider richness in the first 6-7 years after plantation and a subsequent stabilization. Also, the proportion of native species in plantations increased from 6% in the first years to 34% and then remained constant until cutting age (11-12 years). Differences in species composition were mainly due to both differences in richness and species composition in young plantations, while in middle-aged and mature plantations it was mainly due to species replacement. The increase in prey abundance (and probably the increase in vegetation complexity and the decrease of extreme microclimatic conditions) through the plantation cycle increase the suitability for native forest species.

We used pitfall traps to sample beetles in burned P.nigra forests in Catalonia (Spain). Since fire dramatically alters forest structure and composition and beetles follow vegetation changes, we expected drastic changes in beetle composition and abundance immediately after fire. Because P.nigra forests do not recover after fire, we also expected beetles in burned and unburned areas to differ along a chronosequence. Beetle abundance per plot increased in canopy-fire-burned areas, but per plot species richness, diversity, and dominance were not affected by fire.

How species communities are affected by management is a key question in ecology and nature conservation.

In forests, management has been shown to have an overall negative effect on ant communities in tropical and a positive effect in boreal forests. However, in temperate forests, it is unclear what components of forest management affect ant communities and how. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of forest management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in 150 temperate forest stands in three regions in Germany. Using a multi-model inference approach and structural equation models, we analyzed the effects of 18 variables, including variables of forest management, forest structure, arthropod diversity, and biomass, as well as abiotic factors, on ant species richness, abundance, and functional trait diversity (Rao's Q) based on morphological (FDM) and life-history traits (FDLH). In total, we found 28 ant species occurring on 120 plots. Main direct effects of forest management on ant abundance and species richness were caused by tree species selection, measured as dominant tree species. The main positive indirect effect was mediated by a reduced canopy cover with an increasing proportion of oak and pine, resulting in a higher temperature amplitude. Due to the low number of species in two regions, we analyzed functional diversity for the most ant species diverse region only. FDLH was affected positively by tree harvesting and negatively by structural complexity. FDM showed no response to forest management, potentially due to the low morphological diversity of temperate forest ants. Our results show that forest management practices in temperate forests strongly impact ant community structure.

Species richness significantly increased at PT0.5 and decreased at PT2.5 (p < 0.05). Photosynthetic characteristics of new and old leaves of three dominant species (Woodwardia japonica (Linn. f.)

Host specificity was evaluated using the index of host specificity (Si), and the number of isolated species, total isolation frequency, and the diversity index were calculated. From just one to several host-specific species were recognized in all host tree species at all sites. The total isolation frequency of all fungal species on Quercus myrsinaefolia, Quercus serrata, and Chamaecyparis obtusa and the total isolation frequency of host-specific species on Q. myrsinaefolia, Q. serrata, and Eurya japonica were significantly lower in Kashiwa than in the rural forests. The similarity indices (nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and C-MH) of endophytic communities among different tree species were higher in Kashiwa, as many tree species shared the same fungal species in the suburban forest. Endophytic fungi with a broad host range were grouped into four clusters suggesting their preference for conifer/broadleaves and evergreen/deciduous trees. Forest fragmentation and isolation by urbanization have been shown to cause the decline of host-specific fungal species and a decrease in 3 diversity of endophytic communities, i.e., endophytic communities associated with tree leaves in suburban forests were found to be depauperate.

The vegetation in Luquan, Qiongzhusi, and Xishan near Kunming, central Yunnan, exhibits, in a limited area, a range of stages of plant succession that are widely encountered throughout the broader region, and thus affords a special opportunity for a comprehensive study. We analyzed the successional sequence of these various plant communities. They ranged from pioneer coniferous and/or pioneer deciduous broad-leaved stands to pre-mature semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved stands, through mixed coniferous and broad-leaved or mixed deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved stands. The succession proceeded from pioneer coniferous Pinus and Keteleeria, and deciduous Platycarya and Alnus, to late-successional evergreen broad-leaved Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis. Two regeneration types of woody species in either the early successional (15-50 years), the mid-successional (40-80 years), or the late-successional (80-180 years) stage were classified. Relatively high species diversity was found in the seral phase at the three study sites. The late-successional stage was commonest where human disturbance was least evident. Poor soil chemical properties under pioneer Pinus were seen as a limitation to plant growth, while the abundance of Alnus at the early stage led to an improved level of organic matter and nitrogen.",0.501469574,NA

Nonetheless, the potential for species' range shift responses has recently become severely limited, as exceptionally fast temperature changes coincide with a high degree of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. This study provides rare insights into the effects current temperature increases have on pristine temperate forest ecosystems, using the forests of Changbai Mountain, NE China, as a case study. On the northern slopes of the mountain at elevations between 750 and 2100 m, the composition of trees, shrubs and herbaceous species was recorded on 60 plots in 1963 and 2006/07. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to establish the response of plant diversity and plant distribution patterns to environmental conditions. Climatic factors proved important in explaining the spatio-temporal trends within the vegetation. The composition of dominant trees remained mostly unchanged over the last 43 years, reflecting a very slow response of the forest canopy to environmental change. The composition of young trees, shrubs and herb species showed varied changes in the different forest types. A homogeneous species composition in the cohort of regenerating trees indicates an increased future uniformity in the mixed broadleaved and coniferous forest. The understory vegetation of high elevation birch forests was invaded by floristic elements of the lower-elevation coniferous forests.

It was established in 1960 to protect the virgin Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) mixed hardwood forest, a typical temperate forest of northeast China. Studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forest (800-1700 m a.s.l.) were conducted in 1963 and in 2006. The aim of this comparison was to assess the long-term effects of the protected status on plant biodiversity during the intervening 43 years. The research was carried out in three forest types: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found to differ for the same elevations and forest types after the 43-year interval, while the beta diversity indicated by the Cody index depicted the altitudinal patterns of plant species gain and loss. The floral compositional pattern and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layer, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF. However, originally dominant species, such as Pinus koraiensis, tended to decline, the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers showed a trend to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the understory fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. A comparison of the alpha diversity indices among the three forest types reveals that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased, and some rare and medicinal species disappeared. Meteorological records show that climate has changed significantly in this 43-year intervening period, and information collected from another field survey found that the most severe human disturbances to the CNR forests stemmed from the exploitation of Ginseng roots and Korean pine nuts.","",NA,"0?",10,2009,"10.1007/s11258-008-9504-0",60,"The Changbaishan Nature Reserve (CNR) is the largest protected temperate forest in the world.

The floral compositional pattern and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layer, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF. However, originally dominant species, such as Pinus koraiensis, tended to decline, the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers showed a trend to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the understory fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. A comparison of the alpha diversity indices among the three forest types reveals that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased, and some rare and medicinal species disappeared.

We tested community assembly hypotheses in a disturbance gradient in a logged mixed conifer-hardwood forest complex in southern Brazil. If abiotic heterogeneity was strong enough (Selection hypothesis), we expected niche clustering and reduced niche overlap between species and between ecological groups, phylogenetic clustering, significant beta-diversity departure from a random expectation after controlling for alpha-diversity variation, and non-random trait distribution due to abiotic filtering and limiting similarity. Null expectations were predicted under the Neutral hypothesis. Under the Quasi-Neutral hypothesis, we expected niche clustering and reduced niche overlap as in the Selection hypothesis, but random phylogenetic distribution, random beta-diversity variation, and random trait distribution due to niche-based specialization but weak habitat matching resulting from dispersal limitation and drift. We used a series of null models to provide an integrative evaluation of community assembly including species abundances, environmental preferences, phylogenetic relatedness, and trait distribution.

Location: Taiwan. Methods: A data set of 9822 vegetation plots with environmental characteristics recorded in the field or derived from digital maps in GIS was compiled from historical literature and an extensive field survey. Using expert knowledge, 6574 of these plots were used to build a classification into broad vegetation types. The units of the resulting classification were formally defined using a Cocktail determination key, which can be used for the automatic assignment of new vegetation plots to these vegetation types. Results: Twelve vegetation types of zonal forests and nine types of azonal forests were distinguished. Zonal types in the subtropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Juniperus subalpine coniferous woodland, Abies-Tsuga upper-montane coniferous forest, Chamaecyparis montane mixed cloud forest, Fagus montane deciduous broad-leaved cloud forest, Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Machilus-Castanopsis sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Phoebe-Machilus sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest and Ficus-Machilus semi-evergreen foothill forest.

Mycorrhizal root colonization did not differ between ecosystems in May. In October, however, the native stand (FN) presented a higher colonization than the planted forest (R), and the root colonization was more intense than in May. When considering both sampling periods and forests, 27 species of AM fungi, with higher numbers of spores in FN than in R were found. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) indicated Shannon's diversity index as the ecological attribute that contributed the most to distinguish between forest ecosystems, with higher value of H in FN in relation to R. CDA showed to be a useful tool for the study of ecological attributes.",0.710446724,NA

The forms of input N might be responsible for this controversy. This study aims to explore the effects of NH4 (+) (reduced N) and NO3 (-) (oxidized N) on soil CO2 flux and the underlying microbial mechanisms. An N addition experiment, two N fertilizers (NH4Cl and NaNO3) and two rates (40 and 120 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), was carried out in a slash pine plantation of southern China. Soil-atmospheric CO2 exchange, soil microbial biomass, and community composition were measured using static chamber-gas chromatography and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses in the active growing and nonactive growing seasons, respectively. Low level of NaNO3 addition significantly increased soil CO2 flux in the active growing season, whereas other N treatments did not change soil CO2 flux. High level of NH4Cl addition significantly reduced soil fungal biomass (fungal PLFA) and changed microbial community composition (ratio of fungal to bacterial (F/B) PLFAs).

We observed a pronounced effect of ants on CO2 emission, and the effect varied with ant species. The mean CO2 emissions were 2.4 times higher in P. capellini nests than in the reference soils, while those in nests of O. transversa and P. affinis were 2.0 and 1.6 folds, respectively. The contribution of total CO2 flux from nests of three ant species comprised 0.01-0.54% of total annual CO2 efflux fromthe forest floor.

To answer these questions we described the spatial pattern of recent tree establishment below and above the present treeline in northern Ecuador. Also, we experimentally transplanted seedlings into the alpine vegetation (paramo) and the forest, and investigated the effect of shade, neighboring plants, and substrate on their survival. The number of naturally occurring tree sprouts (seedlings, saplings and ramets) was highest just outside the forest, and decreased with distance to the forest edge. However, only two species that were radiation-tolerant made up these high numbers, while other species were rare or absent in the pairamo.

In Yunnan, the EBLF is commonly replaced by plantations of exotic fast-growing Eucalyptus to produce industrial wood, oil, pulp and fuel. The result has been reduced plant diversity, and great loss of soil nutrients by erosion and runoff, as compared to the EBLF. Seventy-six plant species in the area have been ranked as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable. Their condition is seen as largely attributable to habitat loss or degradation. A clear understanding of ecological features and succession pathways of the EBLF can lead to more effective conservation and management of these fragile forests and the mountain ecosystems.",0.595955022,NA

We compared plant composition, height growth, and indices of resource availability in gaps to the forest as a whole in four old-growth stands. In our study, there were no appreciable compositional differences between gaps and the forest as a whole. However, the relative height growth rate of saplings and seedlings was greater in gaps and was significantly different in three of the four old-growth communities studied. There were also significant differences in the response of species to gaps; birches grew faster than balsam fr which grew faster than spruce. The initial stage of vegetation recovery in the spruce-fir forest was dominated by advance regeneration of balsam fir. Much of the recovery in the hardwood-conifer transition zone will depend on the response of spruce, and therefore the closure rate of gaps will be constrained by the slow growth of spruce advance regeneration. In both forest types, the shortage of mineral soil seedbed restricted birch establishment and limited its role in vegetation recovery. Throughout the subalpine community, a large fraction of the potential radiation reached the understory regardless of canopy status (means ranged from 19% to 32% of potential radiation). In fact, gaps received less light on average than random points in the understory. Judging from indices of fine root growth, belowground resources were enriched in gaps relative to the forest as a whole. The lack of quantitative light gaps and the higher fine-root density in gaps suggest that the observed response of the trees resulted from changes in belowground resources or qualitative changes in the light regime.

The results showed that decomposition rates were the same for all combinations of amendments and sites, meaning that both sites had microbial communities equally capable or adapted to decompose plant substrates it had not previously encountered, despite marked differences in soil microbial communities between sites and the chemistry of the two litter types. Initial M. laosensis litter was of lower lignin content and C:N ratio and decomposed faster in the first 8 months than C. lanceolata litter under either M. laosensis or C. lanceolata forest. Litter decomposition was significantly slower in the environment from which it was derived between month 8 and month 16. This could be attributed to the exceptionally poor decomposition of M. laosensis litter which was significantly higher lingnin content at month 8 under M. laosensis than under C. lanceolata due to the impact of site on preferential degradation of litter C.

In the subtropical region, soil enzyme activities were lower in the primary forests than in the secondary forests and microbial PLFAs did not differ significantly between primary and secondary forests. Different compositions of the tree species may cause variations in soil microbial communities and enzyme activities. Our results showed that the main controls on soil microbes and functions vary in different climatic zones and that the effects of soil moisture content, soil temperature, clay content, and the soil N / P ratio were considerable.

New Zealand's old growth evergreen temperate forests are largely comprised of long-lived, slow-growing tree species typically growing in cool, humid conditions; collectively these conditions are thought to promote accumulation of high deadwood stocks. We estimated deadwood biomass and volume in New Zealand's forests and compared these stocks with published values from other broadleaved evergreen temperate forests. Mean deadwood biomass in New Zealand was 54 Mg ha(-1) but ranged across plots from 0 to 550 Mg ha(-1). Mean deadwood volume was 158 m(3) ha(-1) and ranged across plots from 0 to 1890 m(3) ha(-1). Fallen logs accounted for 63% of total deadwood volume and 65% of total deadwood biomass, with standing dead trees being the remainder. Each piece of deadwood was classified into one of three broad decay classes and >40% of deadwood was fallen logs of the intermediate decay class. Deadwood biomass and volume varied 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively, among forest types and was greatest in broadleaved forests, dominated by Weinmannia racemosa (Cunoniaceae), Metrosideros umbellata (Myrtaceae) and Metrosideros robusta, and broad leaf-Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) forests supporting the large tree species Nothofagus fusca. Deadwood biomass and volume were least in broadleaf-conifer admixtures. We used structural equation models to determine whether deadwood biomass could be predicted from climate and environment (vapor pressure deficit, elevation and slope), live tree biomass, forest composition (captured by two ordination axes), wood density of live trees, and tree size (a proxy for stand age). The model that best fit the data retained only vapor pressure deficit, live tree biomass and the first ordination axis as predictors of deadwood biomass.

Impacts of the removal of native vegetation and its destruction by the deposition of mine wastes are compounded by fire, which has dramatically reduced and fragmented the original cover. A new threat evaluation of these conifers, now being incorporated into the IUCN Red List, is presented. A conservation action plan is proposed to ensure their long term survival. Four species are classified as Critically Endangered (CR), 13 Endangered (EN), 6 Vulnerable (VU), 7 Nearly Threatened (NT) and 11 Least Concern. Wetland habitats contain two threatened species (i.e., CR, EN or VU), all inadequately protected in a single reserve. High altitude forest and maquis (a characteristic scrub-like vegetation) have four threatened and three NT conifers only partially encompassed in protected areas, some open to mining.

This alteration in phosphorus dynamics must be considered when assessing the ecological consequence of moso bamboo invasion in subtropical China. Context Moso bamboo is a native species that commonly invades into adjacent forests in Asia. Such invasions may significantly alter soil chemical characteristics because moso bamboo has very different traits compared with the tree species it displaces. However, few studies have investigated the effects of moso bamboo invasion on soil phosphorus (P) dynamics.

Specifically, we quantified soil total P, available P, acid phosphatase activity (APA), and microbial biomass P (MBP) in moso bamboo-invaded coniferous stands and compared them to uninvaded stands and pure moso bamboo stands. Methods We compared seasonal dynamics of soil P (e.g., total P, available P, APA, and MBP) over a 24-month period among three stand types at Lushan mountain in subtropical China: Cryptomeria japonica plantation (CR), Cryptomeria japonica plantation invaded by Phyllostachys edulis (PH-CR), and Phyllostachys edulis stand (PH).

Here, we used data on naturalized conifers (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) from sixty temperate and subtropical regions and five continents to test how environmental and socio-economic conditions of recipient areas as well as introduction efforts affect naturalization probabilities. We collated 18 predictor variables for each region describing environmental, biogeographic and socio-economic conditions as well as a measure of the macro-climatic match with the species' native ranges, and the extent to which alien conifers are used in commercial forestry. Naturalization probabilities across all species and regions were then related to these predictor variables by means of generalized linear mixed models. For both Pinaceae and Cupressaceae, naturalization probabilities were generally higher in the Southern Hemisphere, and increased with indicators of habitat diversity of the recipient region.

The composition of the successive plant assemblages suggests that a subtropical arid climate generally prevailed in the Iberian Peninsula during Jurassic-Cretaceous, although palaeobotanical and sedimentological evidences suggest that the climate was not uniform through the whole interval and that were two episodes in the Tithonian-Berriasian and Aptian-Albian periods of pronounced dry and/or arid environmental conditions. The composition and structure of the vegetation was not only affected by evolutionary changes but also by successive global geographical and climate changes. Hence, significant changes in the distribution of continental areas during the Mesozoic resulted in the latitudinal or sublatitudinal extensions of the climatic belts. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The results from six broad-leaved and four conifer species (seven deciduous, three evergreen) documented that the species effect was not significant in contrast to tissue-specific and spatial differences in the canopy. Year-to-year differences were not large but still significant. Our analysis confirmed a significant difference between delta C-13 of foliage collected in the upper and lower canopy, but revealed no systematic differences with respect to azimuthal directions in tree crowns of the broad-leaved trees, as opposed to the conifers, which show clear differences between the sun-exposed and the shaded side. Tissue-specific differences were significant, despite surprisingly similar mean values for most tissue types. Such tissue effect was largely due to young branch xylem, which exhibited a systematic less negative deviation from the other tissue types. These findings were consistent across the species tested and provided some guidelines towards a representative sampling strategy for 13 C analysis. (c) 2005 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Understory roots contribute substantially to total forest fine-root biomass, but the strategy of function-based fine root placement between trees and understory species at the plant community level is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the differences between trees and understory plants in the deployment of fine roots. We collected fine roots of trees and understory species in two subtropical coniferous forests, sorted the fine roots into absorptive and transport roots, determined the vertical placement of these two types of fine roots, and examined the abiotic and biotic factors that may regulate the horizontal allocation of fine roots. We found that the contribution of absorptive shrub roots to absorptive roots of the woody plants was higher than the contribution of total shrub fine roots to the total fine roots of the woody plants in the topsoil. Understory plants allocated a greater proportion of their absorptive roots to transport roots (Ratio(A/T)) and more total fine-root biomass than trees in the topsoil. Trees had a lower Ratio(A/T) in the topsoil; but increased their contribution of fine-root biomass to the total fine-root biomass and Ratio(A/T) with depth.

The NF soil had many more dynamic N transformations than the plantation soil due to the combination of multiple species and layers and, thus, stimulation of microbial activity and alteration of C and N pool sizes in favor of the N transformations by soil microbes. The net rate of N and N-15 transformation demonstrated differences in N dynamic related to the variation in tree species between the two ecosystems. Conclusions The change of land use and trees species had significant impacts on soil nutrients and N cycling processes. The plantation had larger losses of N than the NF. The NO3--N and (NO3-)-N-15-N dominated in the mineral N and N-15 pools in both forest ecosystems. Recommendations and perspectives Native forest soil had strong N dynamic compared with the plantation soil. Composition of multiple tree species with different ecological niches in the plantation could promote the soil ecosystem sustainability. The N-15 isotope dilution technique in the field can be quite useful for studying in situ mineral N-15 transformations and fate to further understand actual N dynamics in natural forest soils.",0.650800866,NA

","Late Paleozoic continental warming of a cold tropical basin and floristic change in western Pangea An increase in mineral crystallization temperatures of similar to 13 +/- 3 degrees C is preserved in paleosol profiles (ancient soils) within a stratigraphic interval of <40 m thickness in Permo-Carboniferous strata in western equatorial Pangea (modern north-central Texas). Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian soil-mineral crystallization temperatures are estimated through the study interval with oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of paleopedogenic phyllosilicates and hematites taken from paleosol profiles. Considering monthly soil- and air-temperature measurements from modern equatorial Africa, phyllosilicate crystallization temperatures likely exceed surface air temperatures by similar to 2 +/- 2 degrees C. Furthermore, the warming trend emerges from Pennsylvanian-age soil mineral crystallization temperatures, which are substantially cooler than soil temperatures observed in the modern lowland tropics, to Permian-age soil mineral crystallization temperatures, which are equivalent to, or slightly exceed, soil temperatures observed in modern lowland tropics. This record of mineral crystallization temperatures occurs at a time when some sources indicate the onset of the largest single glaciation of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age. The temperature change indicated by these paleosol minerals is accompanied by a unidirectional, irreversible change in the composition of tropical lowland vegetation. This transition delineates the magnitude and characteristics of vegetational changes in the modern tropics that might accompany continued atmospheric warming. Times of low surface temperatures coincide with a typical Late Pennsylvanian, tropical Pangean, ""wet"" biome dominated by Sigillaria, Macroneuropteris, other pteridosperms and marattialean ferns. This plant assemblage is replaced spatially by a xeromorphic biome dominated by conifers, callipterids, and other seed plants, characteristic of the tropical Permian across western and central Pangea. The fully xeromorphic flora appears initially in sub-meter-scale beds within outcrops otherwise characterized by wet flora, and becomes predominant once peak surface temperatures were reached in the earliest Permian. A narrow stratigraphic interval (20 m) separates these two biomes in the region, marking what was to be a permanent floristic change in western Pangea. The lower diversity floras of seasonally dry habitats apparently migrated from drier extrabasinal areas into increasingly dry landscapes formerly dominated by the wet biome. This study documents the regional disappearance of an entire tropical biome with a net reduction of biodiversity accompanying rapid environmental warming. ",0.445488223,NA

We seek to predict the types of forest in which root competition affects seedling performance, and the types of plants that respond most strongly to release from root competition. We then test our predictions by reviewing experiments in which tree seedlings and forest herbs are released from belowground competition, usually by cutting trenches to sever the roots of surrounding trees. First, we provide a worldwide review of changes in canopy form and fine-root mass along gradients of soil fertility and seasonal drought, keeping in mind the stages of forest development. Our review shows that penetration of light is least in forests on moist soils providing large amounts of major nutrients. The changes are far more complex than those considered by allocation models. Dry woodlands typically allow 20 times as much light to penetrate as do wet forests, but there is surprisingly little evidence that they have greater fine-root densities in the topsoil. Tropical rain forests on highly infertile soils have only slightly more open canopies than those on fertile soils, but much greater fine-root densities. Northern temperate forests on highly acidic peats and sandy soils are often dominated by early-successional, open-canopied conifers (generally pines), mostly as a result of recurrent fires, and transmit about five times as much light as surrounding deciduous forests. A review of trenching experiments shows that light alone limits seedling growth in forests on moist, nutrient-rich soils, but competition for belowground resources becomes important on infertile soils and in drier regions. Secondly, we consider how root competition alters species' shade tolerances. Shade-house experiments demonstrate that species differ markedly in the minimum irradiance at which they respond to nutrient addition, but there generally tends to be a sizable response at >5% daylight and little response in <2% daylight. There is some evidence that species that have high potential growth rates and that respond markedly to increased irradiance are also most responsive to nutrient addition in 2-3% daylight. T Smith and M. Huston have hypothesized that species cannot tolerate both shade and drought; this appears to be the case for species that tolerate shade chiefly by maximizing leaf area. However, many shade-tolerant woody plants in tropical and mediterranean-climate forests have thick, tough, long-lived leaves and a relatively high allocation to roots, and these species are much more drought tolerant. A few studies indicate that root trenching allows species to persist in deeper shade than that in which they are normally found and allows species from mesic sites to invade more xeric sites. Usually, the impact of trenching on growth rate is much greater in gaps than in the understory. Finally, we discuss the ways in which life-form composition and population structure of plant communities are shaped by reduced water: supply and reduced nutrient availability, emphasizing the inadequacy of models that consider the impact of ""belowground resource availability"" in a generic sense. Competition in a dry climate leads to widely spaced dominants, a lack of interstitial plants, high rates of seedling mortality in the understory, and a restriction of regeneration to patches where established matrix-forming plants have died. In contrast, vegetation on moist, infertile sites is characterized by closely packed, slender dominants, miniaturized interstitial plants, and slow rates of seedling growth in the understory, combined with relatively low rates of seedling mortality. Consequently, there is a continuum of sizes among the individuals of the dominant species, and a lack of reliance on gaps for establishment.","",NA,"",NA,2000,"10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0171:IORCIF]2.0.CO;2",188,"Light is widely considered to be the most important factor limiting the performance of plants on the floors of forests and woodlands, but the roles of nutrient availability and water supply remain poorly defined.

A total of 97 trace gas species were quantified from both airborne and ground-based sampling platforms, making this one of the most detailed field studies of fire emissions to date. The measurements include the first emission factors for a suite of monoterpenes produced by heating vegetative fuels during field fires. The first quantitative FTIR observations of limonene in smoke are reported along with an expanded suite of monoterpenes measured by WAS including alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, camphene, 4-carene, and myrcene. The known chemistry of the monoterpenes and their measured abundance of 0.4-27.9% of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) and similar to 21% of organic aerosol (mass basis) suggests that they impacted secondary formation of ozone (O-3), aerosols, and small organic trace gases such as methanol and formaldehyde in the sampled plumes in the first few hours after emission. The variability in the initial terpene emissions in the SC fire plumes was high and, in general, the speciation of the initially emitted gas-phase NMOCs was 13-195% different from that observed in a similar study in nominally similar pine forests in North Carolina similar to 20 months earlier. It is likely that differences in stand structure and environmental conditions contributed to the high variability observed within and between these studies. Similar factors may explain much of the variability in initial emissions in the literature. The Delta HCN/Delta CO emission ratio, however, was found to be fairly consistent with previous airborne fire measurements in other coniferous-dominated ecosystems, with the mean for these studies being 0.90+/-0.06 %, further confirming the value of HCN as a biomass burning tracer. The SC results also support an earlier finding that C3C4 alkynes may be of use as biomass burning indicators on the time-scale of hours to a day. It was possible to measure the downwind chemical evolution of the plume on four of the fires and significant O-3 formation (Delta O-3/Delta CO from 1090 %) occurred in all of these plumes within two hours. The slowest O-3 production was observed on a cloudy day with low co-emission of NOx. The fastest O-3 production was observed on a sunny day when the downwind plume almost certainly incorporated significant additional NOx by passing over the Columbia, SC metropolitan area. Due to rapid plume dilution, it was only possible to acquire high-quality downwind data for two other trace gas species (formaldehyde and methanol) during two of the fires. In all four of these cases, significant increases in formaldehyde and methanol were observed in < 2 h. This is likely the first direct observation of post-emission methanol production in biomass burning plumes. Post-emission production of methanol does not always happen in young biomass burning plumes, and its occurrence in this study could have involved terpene precursors to a significant extent.","",NA,"",NA,2013,"10.5194/acp-13-1141-2013",191,"In October-November 2011 we measured trace gas emission factors from seven prescribed fires in South Carolina (SC), US, using two Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) systems and whole air sampling (WAS) into canisters followed by gas-chromatographic analysis.
