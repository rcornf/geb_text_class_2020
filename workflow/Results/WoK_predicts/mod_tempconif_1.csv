The species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole breeding bird assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the linear models of different groups varied between 20% and 60%, and the relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably.

However, in temperate forests, it is unclear what components of forest management affect ant communities and how. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of forest management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in 150 temperate forest stands in three regions in Germany.

In total, we found 28 ant species occurring on 120 plots.

We recorded a total of 24 species of ants, 11 characteristic of forests and seven of open landscape. Ant species richness was higher in clear-cuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands. Number of ant individuals was highest in young age classes and lowest in closed-canopy age classes. There was no drastic change in species richness during the succession, however differences in community composition at different stages were recorded. Open landscape species are able to rapidly colonize following disturbance but disappear when the forest sites mature and many forest ant species are capable of surviving clear cutting.","Succession in ant communities (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in deciduous forest clear-cuts - an Eastern European case study Clear-cutting, the main method of harvesting in many forests in the world, causes a series of dramatic environmental changes to the forest habitat and removes habitat resources for arboreal and epigeal species. It results in considerable changes in the composition of both plant and animal communities. Ants have many critical roles in the maintenance and functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore, the response of ants to clear-cutting and the time it takes for an ant community to recover after clear-cutting are important indicators of the effect of this harvesting technique on the forest ecosystem. We investigated ground-dwelling ant communities during secondary succession of deciduous forests in Transylvania, Romania. Using space-for-time substitution, we explored a chronosequence from clear-cuts to mature forests (> 120 years). The object was to determine if cutting has measurable effects on ant community structure, and if ant species richness differs between successional stages.

During 2000, beetles were sampled via pitfall traps within two large oak fragments (ca. 2.0-4.0 ha), two small oak fragments (ca. 0.2-0.4 ha) and two surrounding matrices dominated by pine plantations (>4 ha) in two sites of different aspects. Overall, no significantly negative effects from forest patch size and the surrounding matrix habitat were detected in total species number and abundance of ground-dwelling beetles. However, compared with small oak patches or pine plantations, more species were associated with an affinity for at least one large oak patch of the two aspects. Multivariate regression trees showed that the habitat type better determined the beetle assemblage structure than patch size and aspect, indicating a strong impact of the surrounding matrix. Linear mixed models indicated that species richness and abundance of all ground-dwelling beetles or beetle families showed different responses to the selected environmental variables. Our results suggest that more disturbed sites are significantly poorer in oak forest specialists, which are usually more abundant in large oak fragments and decrease in abundance or disappear in small fragments and surrounding matrix habitats.

Previous studies on the level of invasion in forest habitats were usually conducted on a relatively coarse scale, often excluding plantations of non-native trees or analyzing them together as a group regardless of the different biological properties of different species. Therefore, a more detailed analysis would be helpful to obtain better insight into the processes taking place in forests, focusing not only on the analysis of the invasion level of different forest types at a finer scale (e.g., in various types of floodplain, beech or coniferous) but also on the character of the non-native plants found there (invasive status, frequencies and habitat preferences). In this study, we aimed to (i) compare the invasion level of various forest habitats (including forests dominated by non-native trees) in Slovakia with regard to different residence times and invasive status of nonnative species, (ii) analyze whether forest habitats possess specific non-native species combinations, and (iii) determine the preferences of non-native plants with respect to specific forest habitats and the co-occurrence of other plant species with the most frequent non-native species. Our study confirmed that almost all forest habitats contained at least one non-native species. Native forests at lower elevations and closer to rivers were more invaded, while broadleaved, mixed and especially coniferous forests at higher elevations and ecologically strictly limited forests were less (or un-) invaded. Significant differences between various types of riparian and coniferous forests, emphasized the importance of the more detailed discrimination of the forest habitats in comparison with previous studies.

We applied an improved version of the mapping technique (a combined mapping method) for forest birds in seven plots located in three old-growth forest types: ash-alder riverine, oak-hornbeam, and mixed coniferous. The composition of the breeding avifauna and species richness remained basically unchanged. Jointly 67 (79% of 40-year total) breeding species were recorded in 2010-2014. Overall 49 (57%) of all species bred in the study plots in more than 35 years, they formed c. 97% of the pairs in the breeding assemblage. The composition of the group of dominants changed slightly; Phylloscopus sibilatrix became much less numerous in comparison to the earlier periods. Anthus trivialis ceased to breed - possibly due to disappearance of its habitat. The numbers of Sylvia atricapilla reached the highest ever level, and those of Columba palumbus and Dendrocopos medius equalled the maxima observed during 40 years. The overall breeding densities did not change significantly but they were substantially lower than in the peak year (2001). Crown insectivores, crown nesters and short-distance migrants remained the most numerous foraging, nesting and migratory groups, respectively. The earlier observed density gradient across habitats -highest in the riverine, lowest in the coniferous stands - was retained. Overall composition of the breeding avifauna did not change during 40 years, and no colonization of forest areas by a new species, nor extinction of a formerly widespread species, except A. trivialis, were observed. Some local changes of species richness occurred, however. Large-scale changes in coniferous habitats due to die-back of Picea abies and appearance of canopy gaps were followed by the increase in species richness there, while disappearance of former sharp forest edges reduced the number of species breeding in the ""edge"" plots.

Young and mature but managed forests differ significantly from old-growth forests in species composition, structure and socio-ecological function. Human land-use has already caused the loss or dramatic reduction in occurrence of some entire species assemblages, especially of logging-sensitive species, in Central European forests. These general statements also apply to beech forests, beech (Fagus sylvatica) being the naturally dominating tree species in Central Europe. Based on data for breeding birds (from 258 sampling plots in a sub-montane and 228 plots in a montane area), molluscs (36 plots in the sub-montane and 79 plots in the montane area) and lichens (84 plots in the montane forest), this paper aims at identifying significant forest age threshold ranges for the occurrence of these old-growth sensitive taxa. The sampling plots in the sub-montane zone (420-520 m a.s.l.) are in beech-oak forests, plots in the montane zone (650-1150 m a.s.l.) are in beech-spruce-fir forests. Stand ages in both areas range up to around 350-400 years. Threshold values for the total number of species related to stand age were calculated by recursive partitioning. In all three taxonomic groups the number of species per plot significantly increases with forest age. The same analysis was run for red-listed lichen and mollusc species as well as hole-nesting bird species. The threshold values obtained are very similar to those for the whole species assemblages, except for molluscs where considerably lower threshold values are computed with red-listed species assemblages. Regarding the confidence intervals, the difference pattern between the whole species datasets and the more sensitive species subsets is inconsistent. Threshold values in sub-montane beech forests range from 100 to 170 years and in mixed montane forests from 160 to 220 years. These threshold levels are clearly incompatible with economic interests that aim on reducing the rotation period in beech stands to less than 140 years to avoid formation of red heartwood.

Threshold values in sub-montane beech forests range from 100 to 170 years and in mixed montane forests from 160 to 220 years. These threshold levels are clearly incompatible with economic interests that aim on reducing the rotation period in beech stands to less than 140 years to avoid formation of red heartwood. It would therefore seem to be essential to establish a network of trees and stands that are never logged and may thus act as areas for retreat and dispersion for logging-sensitive species.

The impact of land-use change on the spatial pattern of F. cupressoides habitat from 1999 to 2011 was evaluated at the landscape level, using satellite images. Additionally, eight 20 x 25 m plots were established in four populations to assess their status. In each plot the density of F. cupressoides and the species richness of the associated plant communities were recorded and analysed, together with spatial patterns at the population and community levels. The loss of potential F. cupressoides habitat was 46% from 1999 to 2011 (38-100% for the four populations). The density of F. cupressoides was lowest in smaller habitat patches, where the number of plant species was higher and the matrix dominated by anthropogenic land-use. Land-use change was associated with a loss of potential habitat for F. cupressoides, and differences in the spatial patterns of habitat influenced the composition of remaining populations and communities. A landscape approach is recommended as a conservation planning strategy for F. cupressoides.","Impacts of anthropogenic land-use change on populations of the Endangered Patagonian cypress Fitzroya cupressoides in southern Chile: implications for its conservation Land-use change can have negative effects on threatened species by modifying their habitat and population dynamics.

Tree level richness was mainly determined by host tree species for both groups. For bryophytes oaks, while for lichens oaks and hornbeam turned out the most favourable hosts. Tree size generally increased tree level species richness, except on pine for bryophytes and on hornbeam for lichens. The key variables for epiphytic diversity of the region were directly influenced by recent forest management; historical and landscape variables were not influential. Forest management oriented to the conservation of epiphytes should focus on: (i) the maintenance of tree species diversity in mixed stands; (ii) increment the proportion of deciduous trees (mainly oaks); (iii) conserving large trees within the stands; (iv) providing the presence of shrub and regeneration layer; (v) creating heterogeneous light conditions. For these purposes tree selection and selective cutting management seem more appropriate than shelterwood system.",0.804439295,NA

Diversity and population dynamics of small mammals,"1. Variable retention harvests in temperate coniferous forests provide various intensities and sizes of disturbance across a gradient, from clear-cutting to single-tree harvesting. These 'green-tree retention systems' leave large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand. It is unclear what effect these harvesting patterns will have on wildlife in general, and small mammals in particular. 2. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that: (i) the abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals will decline with lower levels of tree retention; (ii) the abundance, reproduction and survival of Microtus spp. and southern red-backed vole Clethrionomys gapperi populations will decline and increase, respectively, with the basal area and density of residual trees after harvest; and (iii) habitat heterogeneity generated by variable retention harvesting will limit population size of Microtus, thereby reducing feeding damage to tree seedlings planted on harvested areas. 3. Small mammals were intensively live-trapped from 1996 to 1999 in replicated clearcut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed natural forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada.

Studies from research sites on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, have shown that ancient temperate rain forest canopy ecosystems contain a largely undescribed fauna that is specific to habitat features found only in these canopies.

The proportion of light-demanding and oligotrophic species significantly decreased, while the contribution of species with a wide ecological amplitude, i.e. more shade-tolerant and nutrient-demanding - increased. The share of A. alba was reduced. Species defined in this study as most valuable, should be actively protected, or selection of conservation targets should be re-evaluated.",0.783719048,NA

We compared decadal changes in bird densities and forest vegetation among 3 stand types: managed stands originating from clearcuts 35 years ago that were left untreated (unthinned), managed stands thinned at uniform spacing (thinned), and old growth with no prior timber harvest. We did not detect differences in decadal trends in avian densities between thinned and unthinned stands for 15 of 16 common bird species using a repeated-measures design. Thinning did not result in greater recruitment of overstory-nesting species as predicted. This was likely because of 1) similar increases in tree heights ((x) over bar 9-10 m) and canopy cover ((x) over bar 29-43%) between unthinned and thinned stands across decades and 2) the relatively young successional stage of these stands, which had only begun to recruit medium and large size conifers (dbh >= 36 cm). Decadal trends in densities of most (88%) understory-nesting bird species did not differ between thinned and unthinned stands. Shrub cover decreased by 22% and 31% across decades in thinned and unthinned stands, respectively. Bird community composition in managed stands reflected the general decadal changes in forest vegetation with a shift in dominance from understory species in the early 1990s (80-85% of total bird density) to an equal abundance of understory (45-54%) and overstory species in the mid-2000s. The latter was more similar to old-growth stands, which were dominated by overstory species (67-71%). Overstory-nesting birds in old growth increased in density by 49% across decades. Densities of cavity-nesting species remained unchanged in managed stands and less than densities in old growth across decades, possibly because of a lack of large trees and snags for nest sites.

To infer the effects of forest aging on the abundance, genus richness and diversity, and genus composition of understorey parasitoids, we investigated the assemblages of braconids collected in Malaise traps in a chronosequence of secondary broad-leaved forests (4-128 years old) in the satoyama landscape in the cool-temperate region of central Honshu, Japan. 2.

The abundance of herbivore parasitoids decreased significantly with forest age. This is probably caused by the decline of insect herbivores associated with the decrease in forest floor vegetation along the chronosequence. 4. The opposite trend was observed for detritivore parasitoids, which significantly increased in abundance with forest age, probably along with forest floor litter mass, though no significant change in the abundance of wood-borer parasitoids was observed with forest age. 5. Genus composition of braconid parasitoids was affected by forest age, as determined by canonical correspondence analysis. Genera of detritivore parasitoids were mostly confined to older plots, those of herbivore parasitoids were rather abundant in younger plots, and those of wood-borer parasitoids were more broadly distributed. 6.

There is a great need for conservation and restoration of fauna in these fragmented forests, particularly those with special ecological functions, such as fruit-eating birds. In this 3-year study, we explored the relative importance of landscape-level and local factors for the richness and abundance of fruit-eating birds in broad-leaved forest patches scattered within a coniferous plantation in Japan. As local factors of remnant forests we included fleshy fruit availability and stand structural attributes, and then analyzed how the relative importance of these factor varies between the breeding (May-August) and non-breeding (September-December) seasons and among three bird size classes. Our results provide new insights into seasonal variations in the factors associated with bird richness and abundance and demonstrate the importance of fruit availability in the remnant forest patches. The main factors showing positive associations with bird richness/abundance were stand structural attributes (e.g., tree basal area) and landscape variables (e.g., proportion of broad-leaved forest) during the breeding season, whereas it was fruit availability during the non-breeding season, when migrating birds are dothinant. We detected only minor variations in the associated factors among the three size classes. Thus, preserving continuous mature forests is of great importance for conserving breeding communities of fruit-eating birds, and maintaining fruit availability is an effective approach for supporting migrating birds during the non-breeding season. These findings are applicable to forest management aimed toward biodiversity conservation in regions being replaced or to be replaced by plantations, such as in many areas of temperate East Asia.

The main factors showing positive associations with bird richness/abundance were stand structural attributes (e.g., tree basal area) and landscape variables (e.g., proportion of broad-leaved forest) during the breeding season, whereas it was fruit availability during the non-breeding season, when migrating birds are dothinant. We detected only minor variations in the associated factors among the three size classes. Thus, preserving continuous mature forests is of great importance for conserving breeding communities of fruit-eating birds, and maintaining fruit availability is an effective approach for supporting migrating birds during the non-breeding season. These findings are applicable to forest management aimed toward biodiversity conservation in regions being replaced or to be replaced by plantations, such as in many areas of temperate East Asia. ","Relative importance of landscape features, stand structural attributes, and fruit availability on fruit-eating birds in Japanese forests fragmented by coniferous plantations Replacement of natural forests with plantations is causing forest loss and fragmentation worldwide. There is a great need for conservation and restoration of fauna in these fragmented forests, particularly those with special ecological functions, such as fruit-eating birds. In this 3-year study, we explored the relative importance of landscape-level and local factors for the richness and abundance of fruit-eating birds in broad-leaved forest patches scattered within a coniferous plantation in Japan. As local factors of remnant forests we included fleshy fruit availability and stand structural attributes, and then analyzed how the relative importance of these factor varies between the breeding (May-August) and non-breeding (September-December) seasons and among three bird size classes.

In this study, we tested four hypotheses concerning woody recruits in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations established on grasslands with respect to their distance from the nearest Konara oak (Quercus serrata) forest. Our four hypotheses were as follows: (1) both species richness and occurrence frequency (the number of subplots in which recruits were present) decline with increasing distance; (2) the strength of the effect of distance differs depending on the growth form, seed dispersal type, or life history trait; (3) the species richness of recruits does not increase in response to a disturbance or other site conditions; (4) and species composition of recruits also changes with distance.

Although recent studies underlie the important role of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) in cavity networks of Canadian western temperate forests, limited information exists for conifer-dominated forests such as the black spruce (Picea mariana) forests of central Quebec where the proportion of deciduous trees is generally <10%. We used the habitat requirements of an ecosystem engineer of eastern boreal forests, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), to determine harvesting prescriptions likely to preserve most of the biodiversity of this ecosystem. We describe the mean physical characteristics of trees selected for nesting, quantify nesting habitat selection at two scales (nest tree and nesting stand), and identify quantitative targets for forest managers to select types and amounts of retention structures that will offer optimal resources to cavity nesting birds and dead wood associated species in managed boreal landscapes.

Selection of nest trees by Black-backed Woodpeckers was influenced primarily by tree species (jack pine; Pinus banksiana) and also by the dbh of trees, while their selection of nesting stand habitat was influenced positively by the mean density of recent-solid snags and negatively by the mean basal area of live trees.

Therefore, conversion could represent a loss of habitat for this species and several others that are associated with early successional deciduous stages. We conducted grouse drumming surveys in northwestern Quebec, Canada to evaluate the effects of transforming old fields into conifer plantations on ruffed grouse by comparing densities between two habitat types: abandoned farm fields (n = 22) and old fields converted to conifer plantations (n = 19). To correct any audibility bias between habitat types, we located all drumming males that were heard at each site.

In many regions, forest managers have identified areas of intensive timber production where spruce plantations and thinning treatments are to be used extensively.

We evaluated whether an experimental low-density spruce plantation (1350 stems/ha) could increase habitat suitability for moose Alces americanus compared to standard high-density plantations currently used throughout eastern Canada (similar to 2000 stems/ha). We evaluated the effects of plantation type, pre-commercial thinning, and age class of plantations on proxies of habitat suitability and use by moose in a northeastern temperate forest of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec (Canada). We also considered various environmental characteristics measured locally and within 3.14-km(2) landscape contexts to explain spatial variations in use by moose among 540 sampling plots. Our results show that the proportion of stems browsed by moose increased with the number of available stems and decreased with vertical cover. The number of moose feces, an index of time spent by moose in sampling plots, was similar in both plantation types, but was lower in thinned and young (5 years old) stands as compared to unthinned and 15 years old stands. Variations in the proportion of browsed stems and the number of feces were not explained by broad-scale indices of food availability, density of edges between stands offering good cover and foraging opportunities, road density, elevation, or the area occupied by plantations and naturally regenerated stands around sampling plots. Moose used low-density plantations significantly more than standard plantations for browsing, and these stands supported higher stem densities and vertical cover than standard high-density plantations on average. Low-density plantations offered good foraging opportunities for moose by allowing a large variety of palatable deciduous species to grow between planted coniferous stems. However, we found high inter-site variability in environmental characteristics following plantation, even among equivalent treatments. This suggests that forest managers should aim for particular stand characteristics (i.e. high availability of stems and low vertical cover) in situ rather than prescribing specific post-harvest silvicultural treatments (e.g., plantation types) to favor moose.

Results from the FRAGSTATS (R) and CONEFOR (R) software indicated that Araucaria connectivity has increased in sites located in the central Andean Range in comparison to other sites, because of reduced human and livestock pressure as well as the relative absence of commercial plantations. The proximity index ranged from 6.01 m to 34834.2 m, and the probability of connectivity has significantly increased (175663 ha) in the central Andean Range. Significant relationships were found between the Simpson's index (or the probability of connectivity) and basal area, and between the mean largest patch index and crown diameter. The largest patch index (r = 0.6; p < 0.05) and the area-weighted mean proximity index (r = 0.767; p < 0.05) were the most important landscape metrics influencing Araucaria regeneration.

Results from the FRAGSTATS (R) and CONEFOR (R) software indicated that Araucaria connectivity has increased in sites located in the central Andean Range in comparison to other sites, because of reduced human and livestock pressure as well as the relative absence of commercial plantations. The proximity index ranged from 6.01 m to 34834.2 m, and the probability of connectivity has significantly increased (175663 ha) in the central Andean Range. Significant relationships were found between the Simpson's index (or the probability of connectivity) and basal area, and between the mean largest patch index and crown diameter. The largest patch index (r = 0.6; p < 0.05) and the area-weighted mean proximity index (r = 0.767; p < 0.05) were the most important landscape metrics influencing Araucaria regeneration. Furthermore, the integration of spatial pattern analysis obtained from satellite images and aerial photographs with forest and regeneration characterization from field sampling allowed to identify the most vulnerable areas. The methodology presented here can assist in the identification of target areas for spatial conservation, including management needs under the current budget restrictions.","Fragmentation of Araucaria araucana forests in Chile: quantification and correlation with structural variables Landscape fragmentation is one of the main threats to South American temperate forests due to population growth, conversion of native forests to plantations of exotic species and non-sustainable timber harvesting. The lack of forest connectivity can interfere with pollination, seed dispersal, biodiversity and landscape quality. Species with relatively limited seed dispersal are potentially more sensitive to the landscape fragmentation. Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K.

We predict that, as effects of disturbance diminish with time, effects of canopy structure will increasingly shape patterns of compositional and structural development in the understory.","Initial responses of forest understories to varying levels and patterns of green-tree retention Timber harvest with ""green-tree"" retention has been adopted in many temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, reflecting growing appreciation for the ecological values of managed forests. On federal forest lands in the Pacific Northwest; standards and guidelines for green-tree retention have been adopted, but systematic assessments of ecosystem response have not been undertaken. We studied initial (1-2 yr) responses of vascular understory communities to green-tree retention at six locations (blocks) in western Oregon and Washington, using a factorial design with retention at contrasting levels (15% vs. 40% of initial basal area) and spatial patterns (trees dispersed vs. aggregated in I-ha patches). Direction of compositional change (expressed in ordination space) was similar among treatments within each block, but the magnitude of change was consistently larger at 15% than at 40% retention; pattern of retention had little effect on compositional change. Despite major changes in vegetation structure, early-seral (ruderal) herbs contributed little to plant abundance and richness in most treatments. For many forest understory groups, declines in abundance or richness were significantly greater at 15% than at 40% retention. However, pattern of retention had surprisingly, little effect on treatment-level response; although changes within forest aggregates were small, declines in adjacent areas of harvest were generally greater than those in corresponding dispersed treatments. Late-seral herbs were particularly sensitive to these effects, with more frequent extirpations from plots within the harvested portions of aggregated treatments than from dispersed treatments. Plot-to-plot variation in understory abundance and richness within treatments increased after harvest, but level and pattern of retention had. little effect on the magnitude of this change. We suspect that the initial responses of forest understories to green-tree retention are mediated, in large part, by associated patterns of disturbance and slash accumulation that differ significantly with level and pattern of retention. Because these represent short-term responses, future sampling will be necessary to understand the broader implications of structural retention harvests.

This study was designed to test the hypotheses that large-scale stand thinning, at a 15-year period after PCT, would enhance: (i) productivity and structural features (crown volume, diameter, height, and volume growth of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) crop trees); and (ii) coniferous stand structure (abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity of coniferous tree layers). Replicate study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 stems/ha (low), similar to 1000 stems/ha (medium), and similar to 2000 stems/ha (high), with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. An overall analysis of tree growth in thinned stands, across these regional replicates, indicated that lodgepole pine grew significantly faster in mean diameter in the low- than either of the medium- or high-density stands. There was no difference in mean height growth among stand densities over the 15-year period since PCT. Mean tree volume increment was significantly higher in the low-density than in the high-density stands. Mean stand volume increment (m(3)/ha) was similar in the medium-density (108.53) and high-density (132.51) stands, both of which were significantly higher than the low-density stands (72.88). Mean crown volume of crop trees was significantly greater in the low-density (52.8 m(3)) and medium-density (42.9 m(3)) stands than in the high-density (27.8 m(3)), unthinned (11.7 m(3)), or old-growth stands (30.9 m(3) pine only). This measure of crown size was similar among pine trees in the low-density, medium-density, and all conifers (43.2 m 3) in the old-growth stands. Other measurements of crown architecture followed this same pattern. Mean densities of understory trees were similar among stands for height classes up to 3 m. Mean species diversity and structural diversity of coniferous tree layers were highest in the low- and medium-density stands than in other treatment stands. Our results support the hypotheses that PCT enhances productivity (diameter and volume growth, but not height growth) and structural features (crown architecture) of young lodgepole pine, as well as diversity of coniferous tree layers in thinned stands.

In this study, we aim to evaluate whether conversion of mixed broadleaved forest to Norway spruce (Picea abies) on the acidic soils of the Gaume forest (southern Belgium) affected soil quality in terms of soil acidity, exchangeable calcium and aluminium, humus type and earthworm communities, and determine whether this effect is mitigated or amplified by an edaphic gradient in clay content. In this ancient deciduous woodland, stands were partly converted from mixed deciduous forest to Norway spruce monocultures 30-60 years ago. A twin-plot setup was established, where we sampled pairs of adjacent deciduous and Norway spruce plots along a gradient in clay content varying between 3 and 34%. This design allowed to evaluate the effects of soil type and conversion independently. In the deciduous plots, forest type ranged from mixed oak-hornbeam forest to oak-beech forest. The first has a higher clay content, higher exchangeable calcium, mull humus type, low forest floor mass and the presence of burrowing earthworms (endogeics), while the latter is characterised by high forest floor mass and presence of only litter-dwelling earthworms (epigeics), respectively. Our results provide evidence that the natural biogeochemical gradient converges to a narrow and acid range after conversion. When comparing Norway spruce plots with adjacent broadleaved stands, topsoil pH, calcium concentrations and total earthworm biomass were significantly lower, endogeic and epi-anecic earthworms were mostly absent, and the exchangeable aluminium was significantly higher. Contrary to the current paradigm, the impact of conversion in these acidic soils is largest for the stands with the highest clay content, where the larger exchange capacity allows greater accumulation of exchangeable aluminium when pH becomes sufficiently low. These findings have important implications for forest management: for systems near a threshold in soil process domain, it is important to realise that the sites with higher CEC and more favourable pH-values are the ones that will have larger trajectories and deteriorate the most upon acidification.

They have featured species status for federal land management planning; hence, considerable modeling focused on habitat evaluation and land management planning has been undertaken for elk. The extent to which these and other habitat models for large ungulates account for influences of nutritional resources varies greatly, probably because of varying recognition of the importance of nutrition and uncertainty about how to measure and model nutrition. Our primary goals were to 1) develop greater understanding of how habitat conditions influence foraging dynamics and nutrition of elk in summer and autumn; and 2) illustrate an ecological framework for evaluating and predicting nutritional resources so that nutritional needs of elk can be integrated within landscape-scale plans, population models, and habitat evaluation models. We evaluated foraging responses of elk to clearcut logging and commercial thinning, forest succession, and season across ecological site potentials. We also identified the extent to which plant communities satisfied nutritional requirements of lactating female elk and their calves. Our study was conducted in the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest on industrial and public timberlands. We evaluated relations between habitat conditions and elk nutrition in plant communities representing a range in stand age and ecological conditions at 3 study areas, 1 near the Canadian border in the north Cascades Mountains (Nooksack), 1 in the Coast range southwest of Olympia, Washington (Willapa Hills), and the third in the central Cascades near Springfield, Oregon (Springfield), from late June to November, 2000-2002. In 98-143 macroplots per study area, we measured forage abundance by plant species, digestible energy content by plant life-form group, and forest overstory. In a subset of these macroplots (similar to 30 per study area), we held 4 tame lactating elk with calves in electrified pens (n = 15-25 adult elk per year), and sampled activity budgets, dietary composition, forage selection, and other measures of foraging behavior; dietary digestible energy (DE; kcal/g) and protein (DP; %) levels; and intake rates of these nutrients. In 15 of these pens, we held elk for extended periods (13-21 days) to monitor changes in body fat of adults and growth of calves. We developed equations to predict dietary DE and DP and per-minute intake rates of each in a nutrition prediction model that reflected vegetation attributes and ecological site influences. Total abundance of forage in the western hemlock series after clearcut logging in low to moderate elevations (<= 1,000 m) ranged from a peak of 3,000-4,500 kg/ha in 5- to 10-year-old stands to 100-300 kg/ha in 20- to 50-year-old stands with only moderate increases through late succession. Patterns were similar in higher elevation forests (1,000-1,800 m), although peaks and troughs in forage abundance developed more slowly. Deciduous shrubs, forbs, and graminoids were abundant in early seral stages after stand disturbance, but these were rapidly replaced by shade-tolerant evergreen shrubs and ferns as conifer overstories closed 15-20 years later in low-elevation forest zones, and 20-40 years later in high-elevation zones. Digestible energy within plant life-form groups generally declined with season and with advancing succession, increased with elevation, and was highest in forbs and deciduous shrubs and lowest in evergreen shrubs and shade-tolerant ferns. Levels of DE in elk diets exhibited a strong asymptotic relation with abundance (kg/ha) of plant species that were eaten in proportions equal to or greater than availability (i.e., accepted species). Marked declines in dietary DE occurred in stands containing <400 kg/ha to 500 kg/ha of accepted species, largely because elk began to increase consumption of avoided species, and these typically contained low levels of DE. The asymptotic pattern was generally consistent among seasons, study areas, and habitat types (potential natural vegetation categories), although the asymptote averaged 10-12% greater in high-versus low-elevation forests. Abundance of accepted species in early seral stands averaged 7-10 times that in mid and late seral stages, and dietary DE levels varied accordingly. Dietary DE was little influenced by thinning in 20- to 60-year-old stands. In contrast, levels of dietary DP were unrelated to forage composition and abundance of accepted or avoided species, and varied little between low and high-elevation forests. Dietary DP increased with overstory canopy cover, was higher in thinned and hardwood stands, particularly those hardwood stands with saturated soils in late summer, declined with season, and was lowest in the driest forest communities in our study. Overall, soil moisture regime and season accounted for the majority of variation in dietary DP. Relations between nutrient intake rate and vegetation conditions varied among study areas and habitat types. Nevertheless, elk maintained about double the intake rate of DE in early seral stages versus closed-canopy forests. Intake rate of DP was similar between early seral versus closed-canopy forests, despite modestly lower dietary DP in early seral stages. Protein intake rate was greater in thinned and hardwood-riparian stands. In early seral stages, dietary DE typically met the requirement of 2.7 kcal/g of ingested forage (necessary to maintain body fat levels of lactating elk in summer) in the low-elevation forest zones and exceeded that level in high-elevation forest zones. In closed-canopy forests, dietary DE averaged below requirements, markedly so in low-elevation forests (2.25-2.5 kcal/g) and moderately so in high-elevation forests (2.4-2.65 kcal/g). Evidence of deficiencies based on DE intake rate was greater, averaging about 50% of requirements (28 kcal/min; 21,000 kcal/day) in closed-canopy forests and 80% of requirements in early seral stages. In contrast, dietary DP and DP intake rates generally approached or exceeded estimated requirements (6.8% DP; 380 g/day) in many habitat types that we sampled, with the greatest potential for deficient DP intake rates in relatively dry, low-elevation forests. Body fat dynamics and growth of calves confirmed nutritional deficiencies suggested by our data on DE intake. Adult elk lost body fat during all trials at rates generally in accordance with expectations at the dietary DE levels they consumed, and rate of change in body fat was inversely related to abundance of accepted species. Calves grew at about half the rate of which they are capable (1 kg/day) if summer nutrition is sufficient. Daily calf growth was positively related to their mother's dietary DE and protein intake levels. Elk compensated for limited foraging options in many plant communities via several behavioral strategies. Selection was generally strong for plants with higher DE levels, where selected species composed nearly 5 times more of the diet than did species that elk avoided, yet avoided species were 10 times more abundant. As abundance of accepted species declined below approximately 400 kg/ha, elk increased intake of avoided species. This strategy delayed declines in per-minute forage and DE intake rate as long as abundance of accepted species remained above roughly 200 kg/ha, despite declining dietary DE levels apparent at <400 kg/ha to 500 kg/ha of accepted species. Elk traveled faster while foraging to compensate for plant communities with very low abundance of total forage, increased bite rate as bite mass declined, increased time spent feeding at night in pens with low abundance of total forage or relatively low dietary DE levels, and increased rumination time particularly as dietary fiber levels increased. Dietary DE, DP, and intake rates of these nutrients therefore were robust to substantial variation in overall forage quality and quantity. Nevertheless, these strategies were insufficient to compensate for low abundance of high-quality forage typically present under closed forest canopies. Our nutrition model included nonlinear and multiple regression equations to predict 1) dietary DE (kcal/g of ingested forage), based primarily on abundance of accepted species (r(2) = 0.49-0.62); and 2) dietary DP (% of ingested forage), based primarily on abundance of accepted species, overstory canopy cover, and site characteristics intended to index soil moisture (r(2) = 0.60). Additional equations to predict intake rates per minute included the same covariates, but the variance explained was modestly lower (DE intake: r(2) = 0.43; DP intake: r(2) = 0.45-0.54). With these equations, we created nutrition-succession profiles to illustrate dietary DE and DP intake dynamics across the successional sequence for each habitat type and study area. These profiles may serve as inputs for spatially explicit maps of nutritional resources for elk. Because they were developed using nutrition data from foraging elk, they should help alleviate much of the uncertainty arising from proxy variables often used as indices of nutritional resources. Our data demonstrated that nutritional resources in forests of western Oregon and Washington are generally deficient for lactating elk in summer and early autumn. They provided evidence that inadequate nutritional resources are largely responsible for low body fat in autumn and reduced pregnancy rates reported for many elk herds in the Pacific Northwest. Our data also illustrated that nutritional value of habitats is highly variable depending on ecological context, disturbance, and succession. Thus, how, if, and where forested elk habitats are managed can greatly influence the nutritional suitability of an area. Finally, our data indicate a considerable need for integrating nutritional assessments in landscape planning processes where maintaining abundant and productive elk populations is one of several forest management goals in the Pacific Northwest.

Eight structural features (overstory basal area and crown cover, percent conifer overstory, midstory basal area, shrub frequency, snag basal area, coarse woody debris volume, and maple seedling density) were measured. An additional derived variable, coefficient of variation (CV) for cover, was also tested. The objectives of the study were to determine the significance and impact (increase or decrease) of each structural feature on understory attributes. These were addressed with regression, canonical correspondence analysis, and two-sample tests. Ordination was used to assess differences in composition among forest types. The analyses indicated that structure had no effect on richness or cover, a modest influence on composition, and strong effect on evenness. An important revelation was the over-riding influence of understory structure, but a small role for the overstory. The severity and type(s) of historical disturbance interacted with species pools to strongly constrain richness in the early 20th century. Small changes related to succession have occurred since then. The amount of understory cover is still changing but appears to be succession-related. In contrast, more than 40% of the variation in evenness was explained by maple seedling density, and two interaction variables: maple density*shrub frequency and overstory*midstory basal area. Higher maple seedling density decreased evenness, probably by competitive effects. As the interaction variables increased, evenness was reduced. The regression analysis and CCA point to the shrub layer as having a direct, mechanistic effect on which species are present and their abundance; whereas the presence of shrubs is relatively benign. It is hypothesized that the abundance of upper strata resulted in varying levels of resource limitations, and influenced other environmental features to the extent that niche heterogeneity was affected. The proportion of conifer in the overstory had an important influence on understory composition, but hemlock assemblages did not differ from broadleaved forests in richness or cover. These results suggest that excess emphasis has been placed on the influence of the upper strata, but too little on the shrub and understory layers. Thus, the management of understory assemblages should carefully evaluate the sub-ordinate strata because they may be more important than upper layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our specific objectives were to: (1) classify sub-hectare-scale disturbance history based on disturbance timing and severity; (2) classify current forest structure based on tree size distributions (live, dead, standing, downed); (3) characterize structural development pathways as revealed by the association between disturbance history and current forest structural, complexity. We used hierarchical cluster analysis for the first two objectives and indicator analysis for the third. The disturbance-based cluster analysis yielded six groups associated with three levels of disturbance severity (low, moderate, and high canopy loss) and two levels of timing (old, recent) over the past 200 years. The structure-based cluster analysis yielded three groups along a gradient of increasing structural complexity. A large majority of plots exhibited relatively high (53%) or very high (26%) structural complexity, indicated by abundant large live trees, standing and downed dead trees, and spruce regeneration. Consistent with conventional models of structural development, some disturbance history groups were associated with specific structural complexity groups, particularly lowseverity/recent (very high complexity) and high-severity/recent (moderate complexity) disturbances. In other cases, however, the distribution of plots among disturbance history and structural complexity groups indicated either divergent or convergent pathways. For example, multiple disturbance history groups were significantly associated with the high complexity group, demonstrating structural convergence. These results illustrate that complex forest structure including features nominally associated with old-growth can be associated as much with disturbance severity as it is with conventional notions of forest age. Because wind and bark beetles are natural disturbance processes that can induce relatively high levels of tree mortality while simultaneously contributing to structural complexity and heterogeneity, we suggest that forest management plans allow for the stochastic occurrence of disturbance and variable post-disturbance development trajectories. Such applications are especially appropriate in conservation areas where biodiversity and forest resilience are management objectives, particularly given projections of increasing disturbance activity under global change.",0.678536256,NA

However, these changes have proven to lead to serious ecological problems. Therefore, re-establishing mixed forests with native tree species became an increasingly popular management strategy to fulfil the demands of multi-functional forestry. We report about changes in collembolan assemblages and microbial performances during conversion of pure coniferous stands to mixed forests. The study was carried out in the Black forest area (SW of Germany), where a gradient of conversion from pure spruce stands (Si) to equally mixed stands (spruce, beech, and fir) at S4, through two intermediate stages (S2 and S3) was selected. Results clearly indicated strong modifications of the collembolan communities with an enrichment of the assemblages over the course of the conversion process. Mean species richness increased by 47% from Si to S4 accompanied by diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson) higher at S4. Significantly different soil biota assemblages were found at each phase of the conversion process. Spatial turnover and nestedness contribute almost equally to the modification of assemblages from Si to S2 while later on in the mixing process only spatial turnover was acting. Concomitantly, significant shifts in the functional structure of the collembolan assemblages were depicted, deep-dwelling collembolan (euedaphic) being, surprisingly, the most responsive group. In contrast, neither microbial nor coarse environmental parameters were influenced by the factor ""conversion phase"". We suggest that stimulation of Collembolan communities after the mixing process was mainly due to the input of more suitable food sources and/or microhabitat increases. Our findings underline the crucial role of aboveground processes on the belowground system, with the intensity and scheme of the mixing-process as important factors to consider when aiming at soil biodiversity improvement in forest systems.

There were strong and consistent trends in growth response among the tree species as gap size increased. Growth of all the species increased rapidly from small single-tree gaps to about 1000 m(2) gaps, but thereafter, showed little change up to 5000 m(2). Tree size and current growth rates for all species were highest in full open conditions. Performance of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the most light-demanding species, exceeded that of all other species in large gaps (1001-5000 m(2)) and clearcuts. In large and medium gaps (301-1000 m(2)), the largest trees of all species were found in the middle gap position and there was little difference between the sunny north and shady south positions, except for lodgepole pine which clearly grew poorly in the south position. Total size and growth rates of all species were nearly identical in small gaps (20-300 m(2)) and again in the forest understory. The light advantage expected off the north end of high latitude gaps was not a benefit for tree growth, suggesting that below-ground effects of canopy edge trees have an important influence on seedling growth in these forests.

Both experiments are located in temperate conifer and broadleaved mixed forests. One is a mature secondary forest (MF, 42 ha), the other is an old-growth forest (OGF, 30 ha). Based on the modified Individual Species-Area Relationship (mISAR) concept, tree species acting as diversity accumulators or repellers were identified in the two study areas. A large proportion of diversity accumulators were found, especially at distances closer than 10 m. Diversity accumulators dominated at distances between 0 and 50 m in the MF plot. In the OGF experiment, accumulators dominated at short ranges (<25 m), while both accumulators and neutrals dominated beyond 25 m.

Occurring in the subalpine belt of northern Velebit, it reaches altitudes between 1,200 and 1,600 m. Here, the association is developed as a permanent stage under the strong influence of the microclimate of more humid, colder and shadier sites. Locally, it descends into sinkholes and lower slopes all the way to the beech-fir forest (Omphalodo-Fagetum). It is generally incorporated within the belt of pre-alpine beech forest with large white buttercup (Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum). Some stands are highly productive, but in a large part of the range the community has a protective character. The phytocoenosis Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum has macro-climatic features of the prealpine beech forest, in whose belt it is situated. However its occurrence is predominantly determined by the microclimate modified primarily by the relief altitude and other geomorphological factors (Cindric 1973). The average annual temperature of the subalpine belt of northern Velebit is 3.5 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is 1,898 mm (in the period 1961-1990, data from the State Hydro-Meteorological Institute). The parent material is made up of limestone breccias and limestone-dolomite blocks which often resurface. The soil is organogenic and organomineral calcomelanosol in mosaic with calcocambisol. In relation to calcomelanosols of other forest communities in the Zavizan area, calcomelanosols in this community are the richest in total nitrogen and humus content. Martinovic (in Cestar et. al. 1977) found neutral reaction and base saturated adsorption complex in the humus-accumulative horizon and in the cambic horizon in calcomelanosols. He attributes his finding to the fragmented dolomitized limestones and breccias which supply the soils with ample quantities of calcium. It is very important to point this out, because in relation to other spruce associations, the studied Velebit community is significantly richer in species of the order Fagetalia. The average soil pH determined in water for the depth layer of 0-5 cm amounts to 5.50. Table 1 presents 12 phytocoenological releves of the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piccetum with 140 species of higher plants and 25 moss species. Of this, 58 species of higher plants and 6 species of moss occur in more than 40 % of the releves. Spruce is completely prevalent in the tree layer and is frequently accompanied by beech (often deformed and of poor vitality) and mountain ash, while the bottom of the sinkholes and the lower positions are reserved for fir. The shrub layer, in addition to the species from the tree layer, contains another 16 species. The dominant species include Rubus idaeus, Vaccinium myrtillus and Rosa pendulina. Rubus saxatilis is dominant in more stony areas and Daphne mezereum in more temperate areas. The ground vegetation contains 119 species, of which 48 participate with the 3(rd) degree and more. Of 25 moss species, Dicranum scoparium, Polytrichum formosum, Ctenidium molluscum, Tortella tortuosa and Isothecium alopecuroides occur in over 40 % of the plots. From the sociological standpoint, the dominant species are so-called ""picetal"" ones, characteristic of spruce forests in the larger part of Europe. Among them, Polystichum lonchitis, Luzula sylvatica, Veronica urticifolia, Valeriana tripteris, Adenostyles alpina, Hieracium murorum, Oxalis acetosella, Homogyne sylvestris, Gentiana asclepiadea and others have the highest participation. Together with mosses, there are 36 species in all.. Other significantly represented higher categories and lower units include as many as 39 species of the order Fagetalia Pawl. 1928 (22 species with over 40 %). The alliance Adenostylion Br.-Bl. 1925 and the order Adenostyletalia G & J. Br.-Bl. 1931 are represented with 20 species, of which 9 with over 40 %. In terms of participation, species of the order Erico-Pinetalia Horvat 1959, Cirsium erisithales and Calamagrostis varia are very important. Other categories contain 69 plant and moss species, of which 13 occur in over 40 % of the releves. The species Laserpitium krapfii and Campanula velebitica are characteristic of the association, Knautia drymeia, Petasites albus, Mycelis muralis and Mercurialis perennis from the Fagetalia order are differentiating species, whereas Hypericum richeri subsp. grisebachii, Valeriana montana, Geranium sylvaticum and Trollius europaeus have prominent diagnostic importance. The association belongs to the suballiance Vaccinio-Piceenion Oberdorfer 1957, although the participation of elements of the suballiance Abieti-Piceenion Br.-Bl. in Br.-Bl. et al. 1939 is somewhat higher. However; the synecology of the subalpine belt, the complete dominance of spruce and the secondary role of fir; as well as the presence of species of the subalpine belt, firmly indicate the suballiance Vaccinio-Piceenion. The abundance of differentiating species of subalpine in relation to montane spruce forests include Valeriana montana, Rubus saxatilis, Cirsium erisithales, Viola biflora, Polystichum lonchitis, Trollius europaeus, and slightly less Saxifraga rotundifolia. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), releve No. 5 in the fifth column of Table 1 is the nomenclatural type. Table II analyzes the relationship of the association towards related spruce subalpine associations in Croatia and in adjacent areas, ranging from the pre-alpine region to the central Dinaric range. Column 1 contains an important zonal association of the pre-alpine and alpine phytogeographic area of Slovenia and south Austria (Adenostylo glabrae-Piceetum M. Wraber ex Zukrigl 1973 corr. Zupancic 1999), while column 2 presents the community from the subalpine belt of the Dinaric phytogeographic area of Slovenia on carbonate parent material (Lonicero caeruleae-Piceetum Zupancic (1976)1999). Columns 3 and 4 present Horvat's association ""Picetum subalpinum croaticum"", mainly from western Croatia. Column 5 shows 6 releves of the association ""Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum"" (nom. invalid) from northern Velebit (Bertovic, 1975), and column 6 presents 12 new releves of the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. Columns 7-9 feature subalpine spruce forests of Bosnia and Herzegovina, two of which /column 7, Sorbo-Piceetum Fukarek 1964, column 8 Piceetum (illyricum) subalpinum Horvat 1950 listeretosum et homo-gynetosum Fukarek 1969/ were taken from Zupancic's analysis (1990). Column 9 provides seven releves from Vlasic (Lakusic et al. 1982). The floral composition of spruce forests in Velebit, in relation to other Dinaric spruce communities, is characterized by lesser participation and cover of Alpine-boreal species (Lonicera nigra, Lycopodium annotinum, Huperzia selago, Listera cordata, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Rhytiadelphus loreus) and higher participation and cover of the species from the Fagetalia order and lower units. This is attributed to several reasons, such as the biogeographic position of Velebit and the resulting ecological factors, the lithological-pedological properties of the substrate and the influence of a strong beech belt which surrounds smaller complexes (and fragments) of coniferous forests. West Croatian and particularly Slovenian spruce forests are under a strong Alpine influence, while Bosnian-Herzegovinian spruce forests have retreated deep into the continental part. It is therefore logical that the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum manifests a more ""fagetal"" character and that its composition contains species of beech forests that are either absent from other spruce associations or are much less represented. Compared to the subalpine spruce forest ""Calamagrostio-Piceetum"" described earlier, the new association occurs at lower positions and covers more humid, colder, shadier, much less stony and soil-rich sites. Locally, it descends into sinkholes and lower slopes to the altitude of 1,100 m. Fir is still considerably present, but the other mentioned association is above the upper fir boundary. Typologically, the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum can provisionally be divided into three types of stands. Stands with a standard composition are found on upper and centrally positioned, shady, moderately fresh slopes with an average floral composition. They frequently contain equal amounts of species from the order Fagetalia. The second type occurs on drier, more illuminated, more exposed localities that also include meadow edges (most frequently Nardetum strictae), while the third type of stands is developed in narrow and restricted sinkholes and on the slopes leading to them. Species of the order Adenostyletalia dominate on colluvial soils with more moisture and longer presence of snow. Cicerbita alpina, Ranunculus platanifolius, Stellaria nemorum, Poa hybrida and some others are particularly prominent. In some earlier research into spruce forests of northern Velebit (Vukelic and Tomljanovic 1990), this stand type was identified as an independent association Adenostylo alliariae-Piceetum Hartman 1994.",,NA,,NA,,,2010,,321,"This research describes a new association of spruce with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum abietis ass. nova). Occurring in the subalpine belt of northern Velebit, it reaches altitudes between 1,200 and 1,600 m. Here, the association is developed as a permanent stage under the strong influence of the microclimate of more humid, colder and shadier sites. Locally, it descends into sinkholes and lower slopes all the way to the beech-fir forest (Omphalodo-Fagetum). It is generally incorporated within the belt of pre-alpine beech forest with large white buttercup (Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum). Some stands are highly productive, but in a large part of the range the community has a protective character. The phytocoenosis Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum has macro-climatic features of the prealpine beech forest, in whose belt it is situated. However its occurrence is predominantly determined by the microclimate modified primarily by the relief altitude and other geomorphological factors (Cindric 1973). The average annual temperature of the subalpine belt of northern Velebit is 3.5 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is 1,898 mm (in the period 1961-1990, data from the State Hydro-Meteorological Institute). The parent material is made up of limestone breccias and limestone-dolomite blocks which often resurface. The soil is organogenic and organomineral calcomelanosol in mosaic with calcocambisol. In relation to calcomelanosols of other forest communities in the Zavizan area, calcomelanosols in this community are the richest in total nitrogen and humus content. Martinovic (in Cestar et. al. 1977) found neutral reaction and base saturated adsorption complex in the humus-accumulative horizon and in the cambic horizon in calcomelanosols. He attributes his finding to the fragmented dolomitized limestones and breccias which supply the soils with ample quantities of calcium. It is very important to point this out, because in relation to other spruce associations, the studied Velebit community is significantly richer in species of the order Fagetalia. The average soil pH determined in water for the depth layer of 0-5 cm amounts to 5.50. Table 1 presents 12 phytocoenological releves of the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piccetum with 140 species of higher plants and 25 moss species. Of this, 58 species of higher plants and 6 species of moss occur in more than 40 % of the releves. Spruce is completely prevalent in the tree layer and is frequently accompanied by beech (often deformed and of poor vitality) and mountain ash, while the bottom of the sinkholes and the lower positions are reserved for fir. The shrub layer, in addition to the species from the tree layer, contains another 16 species. The dominant species include Rubus idaeus, Vaccinium myrtillus and Rosa pendulina. Rubus saxatilis is dominant in more stony areas and Daphne mezereum in more temperate areas. The ground vegetation contains 119 species, of which 48 participate with the 3(rd) degree and more. Of 25 moss species, Dicranum scoparium, Polytrichum formosum, Ctenidium molluscum, Tortella tortuosa and Isothecium alopecuroides occur in over 40 % of the plots. From the sociological standpoint, the dominant species are so-called ""picetal"" ones, characteristic of spruce forests in the larger part of Europe. Among them, Polystichum lonchitis, Luzula sylvatica, Veronica urticifolia, Valeriana tripteris, Adenostyles alpina, Hieracium murorum, Oxalis acetosella, Homogyne sylvestris, Gentiana asclepiadea and others have the highest participation. Together with mosses, there are 36 species in all.. Other significantly represented higher categories and lower units include as many as 39 species of the order Fagetalia Pawl. 1928 (22 species with over 40 %). The alliance Adenostylion Br.-Bl. 1925 and the order Adenostyletalia G & J. Br.-Bl. 1931 are represented with 20 species, of which 9 with over 40 %. In terms of participation, species of the order Erico-Pinetalia Horvat 1959, Cirsium erisithales and Calamagrostis varia are very important. Other categories contain 69 plant and moss species, of which 13 occur in over 40 % of the releves. The species Laserpitium krapfii and Campanula velebitica are characteristic of the association, Knautia drymeia, Petasites albus, Mycelis muralis and Mercurialis perennis from the Fagetalia order are differentiating species, whereas Hypericum richeri subsp. grisebachii, Valeriana montana, Geranium sylvaticum and Trollius europaeus have prominent diagnostic importance. The association belongs to the suballiance Vaccinio-Piceenion Oberdorfer 1957, although the participation of elements of the suballiance Abieti-Piceenion Br.-Bl. in Br.-Bl. et al. 1939 is somewhat higher. However; the synecology of the subalpine belt, the complete dominance of spruce and the secondary role of fir; as well as the presence of species of the subalpine belt, firmly indicate the suballiance Vaccinio-Piceenion. The abundance of differentiating species of subalpine in relation to montane spruce forests include Valeriana montana, Rubus saxatilis, Cirsium erisithales, Viola biflora, Polystichum lonchitis, Trollius europaeus, and slightly less Saxifraga rotundifolia. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), releve No. 5 in the fifth column of Table 1 is the nomenclatural type. Table II analyzes the relationship of the association towards related spruce subalpine associations in Croatia and in adjacent areas, ranging from the pre-alpine region to the central Dinaric range. Column 1 contains an important zonal association of the pre-alpine and alpine phytogeographic area of Slovenia and south Austria (Adenostylo glabrae-Piceetum M. Wraber ex Zukrigl 1973 corr. Zupancic 1999), while column 2 presents the community from the subalpine belt of the Dinaric phytogeographic area of Slovenia on carbonate parent material (Lonicero caeruleae-Piceetum Zupancic (1976)1999). Columns 3 and 4 present Horvat's association ""Picetum subalpinum croaticum"", mainly from western Croatia. Column 5 shows 6 releves of the association ""Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum"" (nom. invalid) from northern Velebit (Bertovic, 1975), and column 6 presents 12 new releves of the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. Columns 7-9 feature subalpine spruce forests of Bosnia and Herzegovina, two of which /column 7, Sorbo-Piceetum Fukarek 1964, column 8 Piceetum (illyricum) subalpinum Horvat 1950 listeretosum et homo-gynetosum Fukarek 1969/ were taken from Zupancic's analysis (1990). Column 9 provides seven releves from Vlasic (Lakusic et al. 1982).

The main hosts were oaks (primarily Quercus leucotrichophora and Q. floribunda), pines (Pinus roxburghii and P. wallichiana) and deodar (Cedrus deodara). The species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi was 43 in oak forests and 55 in conifer forests, which is close to midpoint values on the range derived from the literature for similar forest types. The major genera in terms of species were Amanita (15 sp.), Russula (13 sp.), Boletus (12 sp.), Lactarius (9 sp.), Hygrophorus (4 sp.) and Cortinarius (4 sp.).

The evidence also suggests that mega-fires are positive feedbacks to changing climates via carbon emissions, and will be responsible for large swings in water yield and quality from temperate forests at the regional scale. Two factors widely considered to have contributed to our current proximity to tipping points are changing climates and human management - the latter most obviously taking the form of allowing fuels to build up, either through policies of fire suppression or failure to implement sufficient fuel reduction fires - to the point where wildfire intensity increases dramatically. Much of the evidence comes from Australia and the USA, but domains such as Africa and the boreal north provide additional insights. Forests adapted to regimes of low-moderate intensity fires may not face the same challenges as the iconic ash forests of Australia and the coniferous forests of Yellowstone or the west coast of the USA that are adapted to high intensity fire. However the often modest physical barriers (including distance, topography and climate) between forests adapted to more frequent, low-moderate intensity fires on the one hand, and less frequent, high intensity fires on the other, are easily overcome by confluences of continually increasing fuel loads and changing climates that serve to increase both fire frequency and intensity. For temperate forests, we can mitigate the extent of large-scale, high intensity fires and their consequences if we carefully use fuel reduction fires and other standard forest management practises such as thinning. Mitigation will require assessing impacts on biodiversity of smaller, low-intensity fires at intervals of 5-10 years (to reduce fuels and mitigate fire size and intensity), against those of large-scale, high intensity wildfires at increasing (but unknown) frequency.

The colonisation of different islands at different times, and the absence of significant predation allow us to assess whether and how a large herbivore can exert ""top-down"" control on vegetation and its associated fauna. We studied plant communities in forest interior and shoreline, on seven small islands of varying browse history. Three islands were untouched by deer, deer had been resident for about 15 years on two, and on another two deer had been present for more than 50 years. Without deer, vegetation in the understorey and/or shrub layer was dense or very dense. Structure and composition varied markedly within and between shoreline and interior communities. Without deer, shoreline communities were dominated by species absent from islands with deer. Where deer had been present for less than 20 years most plant species characteristic of shorelines on islands without deer were already absent or scarce, but in the forest interior species richness was less affected and extensive shrub thickets remained. On islands where deer had been present for > 50 years vegetation below the browse line was extremely simplified, converging in both forest interior and shoreline towards an open assemblage of a few deer-tolerant species, basically two coniferous trees. This top down effect on the plant community reflected up the food chain so that understorey invertebrate and shrub-dependent songbird communities became simplified. In contrast, species densities of litter arthropods (especially weevils and millipedes) were highest where deer were present for > 50 years. Canopy birds were unaffected by deer presence. In the absence of predators, major climatic stress or other means to control the herbivore, deer browsing created greatly simplified plant and animal communities.",0.651815887,NA

The results indicated that this management approach yielded a statistically significant difference in tree species composition and presence of large-diameter trees. The cumulative diameter distributions, however, were similar in OGF and MF as both exhibited the shapes that are considered to provide demographic equilibrium. On the species level, though, this was the case only for beech. Species occurrence matrices indicated significant dominance of young European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees over silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in OGF. Nevertheless, based on the results from MF, the study highlights the crucial role of silvicultural measures that may potentially provide targeted long-term coexistence of the studied broadleaved and coniferous tree species. ","Stand structural complexity of mixed old-growth and adjacent selection forests in the Dinaric Mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina Research results on the structure of European OGF are often contradictory; while some researchers stress equilibrium structures, others suggest that this rarely happens due to biomass accumulation. If the former were the case, then there would be a fairly strong argument that OGF should serve as natural references for selection management. At the same time, mountain mixed selection forests are in many regions considered to be the most ""natural"" type of MF, and thus to a large extent similar to corresponding OGF. However, because there are few old-growth forests (OGF) left in Europe, comparisons between OGF and selection-managed forests (MF) are rare. Since nature-based silviculture should follow natural processes and not exclude any species from its natural range, in this study we compared two mixed OGF and neighboring MF (Piceo-Abieti-Fagetum illyricum) in the Dinaric Mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Ecosystem-level alleopathic effect has been argued as a cause for conifer regeneration failure by citing examples from a species-poor boreal forest in northern Sweden with ground vegetation dominated by crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Ericales) and New Zealand dairy pastures invaded by nodding or musk thistle (Carduus nutans). This article aims to explain the phenomenon of vegetation shift from conifer forest to ericaceous heath by extending the argument of ecosystem-level impact of ericaceous plants and linking the disturbance-mediated regeneration strategies of the dominant conifer species and the understory ericaceous species with the quality of seedbed substrate that influence the direction of secondary succession. It has been argued that fire severity plays a pivotal role in controlling seedbed quality and the regeneration mechanisms of conifers, which in turn determines the direction of post-disturbance succession. The post-fire-dominated ericaceous plants and their habitat-modifying effects have been explained from the point of view of keystone species concept and their role as ecosystem engineers. In the absence of high severity natural fires the canopy keystone species (conifer) fails to regenerate successfully mainly due to limitation of favorable seedbed. On the other hand, the understory ericaceous plants regenerate vigorously by vegetative methods from the belowground components that survived the fire. Forest harvesting by clearcutting or selective cutting also create similar vigorous vegetative regrowth of ericaceous plants, but conifer regeneration suffers from the lack of a suitable seedbed. Thus in the absence of successful conifer regeneration, the vigorously growing understory ericaceous plants become the new keystone species. The new keystone ericaceous species bring about a significant long-term habitat change by rapid accumulation of plyphenol-rich humus. Ericaceous phenolic compounds have been found to inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of conifers. By forming protein-phenol complexes they cause a further reduction of available nitrogen of the already nutrient-stressed habitat. A low pH condition in the presence of phenolic compounds causes the leaching of metallic ions and forms hard iron pans that impair soil water movement. The phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous humus are also inhibitory to many conifer ectomycorrhizae. On the other hand, ericaceous plants perpetuate in the community by their stress-tolerating strategies as well as their ability to acquire nutrients through ericoid mycorrhizae. Three mechanisms working at the ecosystem level can be suggested as the cause of vegetation shift from forest to ericaceous heath. These are (1) the absence of high severity natural fire and the limitation of suitable conifer seedbed in the presence of thick humus, (2) increased competition resulting from the rapid vegetative regeneration of understory ericaceous plants after forest canopy opening by harvesting or nonsevere fire, and (3) habitat degradation by phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous plants causing a soil nutrient imbalance and iron pan formation. Thus, a shift in keystone species from conifer to ericaceous plant in the post-disturbance habitat may induce a retrogressive succession due to ecosystem-level engineering effects of the new keystone species. Vegetation management in conifer-ericaceous communities depends on land management objectives. If the objective is to produce timber and other forest products then the control of ericaceous plants and site preparation is necessary after forest harvesting. Ploughing and liming followed by conifer planting and repeated N fertilization has been applied successfully to promote afforestation of Calluna heathlands in Britain. However, such practice has not been proven successful in the reforestation of Kalmia-dominated sites in eastern Canada.

Pioneer (Betula spp., Salix spp.) and post-pioneer species (Fraxinus exelsior, Sorbus spp., Prunus avium) played an important role throughout the silvigenetic cycle by providing a diversity of deadwood when deadwood from the dominant species (i.e. Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies) was scarce. Understanding the dynamics of deadwood and tree microhabitats may help us provide a model for forest managers who intend to emulate natural forest dynamics and will also improve our understanding of the relationship between forest dynamics and biodiversity conservation.

We also conducted germination experiment in laboratory for the six pioneer species to test the effects of red:far-red (R:FR) light ratio and temperature fluctuations on the seed germination. In conifer forests, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), the R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations in thinned stands were 2, 1.5, and 3 times higher, respectively, than those of unthinned stands. The PPFD and R:FR ratios just above forest floor also increased after the removal of thick litter accumulation. As a result, higher seed germination was observed in thinned compared to unthinned stands for three photoblastic species, whereas little differences were observed for three non-photoblastic species. These findings suggest that thinning, which frequently reduces litter accumulation, can substantially affect the regeneration of pioneer species and the resultant species diversity in conifer plantations. None of the measured environmental signals changed seasonally in unthinned stands of conifer forests, but they all changed remarkably in the understory of the hardwood forests. in this system, all signals were high and nearly identical to those in the gaps in early spring prior to canopy closure. Thus, the percent germination of the three photoblastic species was enhanced by high R:FR ratios and/or large temperature fluctuations even beneath the canopy and was nearly equal to that in the thinned conifer stands where the environmental conditions were nearly identical to those in the gaps. However, all of the environmental signals decreased with the expansion of canopy leaves and reached minimums at canopy closure. Even in the thinned stands and the gaps, the PPFD and magnitude of temperature fluctuations decreased over time due to shading by growing herbs and/or emerging canopy leaves. In these temporally changing environments, the germination of all photoblastic species ceased simultaneously. This study clearly demonstrated that the environmental signals inducing seed germination of photoblastic pioneer species spatially and temporally change in temperate forests, particularly in deciduous hardwood forests.

Based on sampling in 18, 100 m(2) plots, we identified three distinct community associations: a Fitzroya forest at the bottom of the watershed, a mid-slope Pilgerodendron-Tepualia transition zone, and a ridgetop moorland community. The Fitzroya forest was dominated by a cohort of approximately 400 year-old Fitzroya cupressoides trees. Both tree basal area (138 m(2)/ha) and total live biomass (656 Mg ha(-1)) reached a maximum in this vegetation type. The Pilgerodendron-Tepualia forest consisted of smaller, shorter, and younger trees with dominance shared by Pilgerodendron uviferum, Tepualia stipularis, and to a lesser extent, F. cupressoides. Basal area and biomass were half that of the Fitzroya forest (69.5 m(2) ha(-1); 350 Mg ha(-1)) but tree density was 65% greater. The moorland can best be described as an open community of mosses and cushion plants that included low stature individuals of P. uviferum, F. cupressoides, and T. stipularis. The size and age structure of F. cupressoides in the bottomland forest suggest that the current cohort of adult trees was established following a catastrophic disturbance and that F. cupressoides is unable to regenerate under its own canopy. In contrast, the size structure of the tree populations in the Pilgerodendron-Tepualia zone indicates that all the constituent tree species, except F. cupressoides, are able to reproduce at least at some microsites in the understory.

Both tree basal area (138 m(2)/ha) and total live biomass (656 Mg ha(-1)) reached a maximum in this vegetation type. The Pilgerodendron-Tepualia forest consisted of smaller, shorter, and younger trees with dominance shared by Pilgerodendron uviferum, Tepualia stipularis, and to a lesser extent, F. cupressoides. Basal area and biomass were half that of the Fitzroya forest (69.5 m(2) ha(-1); 350 Mg ha(-1)) but tree density was 65% greater. The moorland can best be described as an open community of mosses and cushion plants that included low stature individuals of P. uviferum, F. cupressoides, and T. stipularis. The size and age structure of F. cupressoides in the bottomland forest suggest that the current cohort of adult trees was established following a catastrophic disturbance and that F. cupressoides is unable to regenerate under its own canopy. In contrast, the size structure of the tree populations in the Pilgerodendron-Tepualia zone indicates that all the constituent tree species, except F. cupressoides, are able to reproduce at least at some microsites in the understory. The watershed-level means for live biomass were 306 Mg ha(-1) of aboveground tree biomass, 25 Mg ha(-1) of large root biomass (diameter ge 1 cm), and 46 Mg ha(-1) of small root biomass (diameter < 1 cm).","Vegetation composition, structure, and biomass of two unpolluted watersheds in the Cordillera de Piuchue, Chiloe Island, Chile Research in pristine forests provides a necessary reference of energy and nutrient cycling in absence of anthropogenic influence. Therefore two unpolluted watersheds in the Cordillera de Piuchue of southern Chile (42 degrees30' S) were chosen for detailed ecosystem analysis. The goals of this study were to quantify the distribution of the living biomass in the research watershed and to document topographic gradients in the vegetation. Across a small spatial gradient from ravine bottom to ridgetop (approximately 60 m in elevation and < 300 m in length) in the Cordillera de Piuchue watersheds, there were significant shifts in vegetation composition, structure, and biomass.

Virtually all central European forests are managed and land-use regimes likely impact microbial abundance and community composition. Consequently, knowledge on how land-use intensity and abiotic variables, such as pH, C-to-N ratios, moisture regimes and concomitantly different stress levels, affect microbial communities is needed. We investigated phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles of leaf litter and soil from four forest types differing in foliage, age and management intensity, replicated in three regions across Germany. To account for temporal variation, samples were taken twice in the same season, but with an interval of three years. Total microbial biomass and microbial community composition differed between years, presumably due to between year variations in weather conditions. The litter layer was more prone to effects of drying, with a reduction of almost 30% of total PLFAs in the drier year. In soil effects of weather conditions depended on soil type and therefore differed between regions, with microorganisms in the sandy soils of the Schorfheide being more susceptible to water-stress, as evidenced by a ten-fold increase of the stress indicator cy/pre ratio in the drier year. Despite temporal variations in microbial biomass and community composition, the balance between the fungal and bacterial energy channel, as measured by fungal-to-bacterial ratios, remained rather constant in particular in soil. While total microbial biomass did not differ between forest types, microbial community composition differed significantly between beech and coniferous forests. Despite more acidic conditions, the fungal energy channel was less pronounced in leaf litter of coniferous forests than in broad-leaved forests, whereas the proportion of bacterial fatty acids was the highest in coniferous forests. Increasing management intensity presumably fosters the bacterial energy channel in the exposed litter layer.

Bacterial community structure and biomass closely correlated with pH, with particular PLFAs dominating at high and low pH, respectively, indicating pH-specific microbial communities.

Despite the similarity in dominant tree species in the two forests, the macrofungus communities were very different. At the drier, nitrogen-poor Deer Park area, the macrofungi were dominated by ectomycorrhizal species in the genera Cortinarius, Tricholoma, Hydnellum, Suillus, and Sarcodon. At the wetter, higher nitrogen Hoh Valley, the macrofungi were characterized by ectomycorrhizal species in different genera, such as Inocybe, Russula, Amanita, Boletus, and Phaeocollybia, and saprotrophic fungi accounted for a greater proportion of the community.

3,WOS:000086984100001,414,"Coomes, DA; Grubb, PJ",ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Impacts of root competition in forests and woodlands: A theoretical framework and review of experiments,"Light is widely considered to be the most important factor limiting the performance of plants on the floors of forests and woodlands, but the roles of nutrient availability and water supply remain poorly defined. We seek to predict the types of forest in which root competition affects seedling performance, and the types of plants that respond most strongly to release from root competition. We then test our predictions by reviewing experiments in which tree seedlings and forest herbs are released from belowground competition, usually by cutting trenches to sever the roots of surrounding trees. First, we provide a worldwide review of changes in canopy form and fine-root mass along gradients of soil fertility and seasonal drought, keeping in mind the stages of forest development. Our review shows that penetration of light is least in forests on moist soils providing large amounts of major nutrients. The changes are far more complex than those considered by allocation models. Dry woodlands typically allow 20 times as much light to penetrate as do wet forests, but there is surprisingly little evidence that they have greater fine-root densities in the topsoil. Tropical rain forests on highly infertile soils have only slightly more open canopies than those on fertile soils, but much greater fine-root densities. Northern temperate forests on highly acidic peats and sandy soils are often dominated by early-successional, open-canopied conifers (generally pines), mostly as a result of recurrent fires, and transmit about five times as much light as surrounding deciduous forests. A review of trenching experiments shows that light alone limits seedling growth in forests on moist, nutrient-rich soils, but competition for belowground resources becomes important on infertile soils and in drier regions. Secondly, we consider how root competition alters species' shade tolerances. Shade-house experiments demonstrate that species differ markedly in the minimum irradiance at which they respond to nutrient addition, but there generally tends to be a sizable response at >5% daylight and little response in <2% daylight. There is some evidence that species that have high potential growth rates and that respond markedly to increased irradiance are also most responsive to nutrient addition in 2-3% daylight. T Smith and M. Huston have hypothesized that species cannot tolerate both shade and drought; this appears to be the case for species that tolerate shade chiefly by maximizing leaf area. However, many shade-tolerant woody plants in tropical and mediterranean-climate forests have thick, tough, long-lived leaves and a relatively high allocation to roots, and these species are much more drought tolerant. A few studies indicate that root trenching allows species to persist in deeper shade than that in which they are normally found and allows species from mesic sites to invade more xeric sites. Usually, the impact of trenching on growth rate is much greater in gaps than in the understory. Finally, we discuss the ways in which life-form composition and population structure of plant communities are shaped by reduced water: supply and reduced nutrient availability, emphasizing the inadequacy of models that consider the impact of ""belowground resource availability"" in a generic sense. Competition in a dry climate leads to widely spaced dominants, a lack of interstitial plants, high rates of seedling mortality in the understory, and a restriction of regeneration to patches where established matrix-forming plants have died.

We seek to predict the types of forest in which root competition affects seedling performance, and the types of plants that respond most strongly to release from root competition. We then test our predictions by reviewing experiments in which tree seedlings and forest herbs are released from belowground competition, usually by cutting trenches to sever the roots of surrounding trees. First, we provide a worldwide review of changes in canopy form and fine-root mass along gradients of soil fertility and seasonal drought, keeping in mind the stages of forest development. Our review shows that penetration of light is least in forests on moist soils providing large amounts of major nutrients. The changes are far more complex than those considered by allocation models. Dry woodlands typically allow 20 times as much light to penetrate as do wet forests, but there is surprisingly little evidence that they have greater fine-root densities in the topsoil. Tropical rain forests on highly infertile soils have only slightly more open canopies than those on fertile soils, but much greater fine-root densities. Northern temperate forests on highly acidic peats and sandy soils are often dominated by early-successional, open-canopied conifers (generally pines), mostly as a result of recurrent fires, and transmit about five times as much light as surrounding deciduous forests. A review of trenching experiments shows that light alone limits seedling growth in forests on moist, nutrient-rich soils, but competition for belowground resources becomes important on infertile soils and in drier regions. Secondly, we consider how root competition alters species' shade tolerances. Shade-house experiments demonstrate that species differ markedly in the minimum irradiance at which they respond to nutrient addition, but there generally tends to be a sizable response at >5% daylight and little response in <2% daylight. There is some evidence that species that have high potential growth rates and that respond markedly to increased irradiance are also most responsive to nutrient addition in 2-3% daylight. T Smith and M. Huston have hypothesized that species cannot tolerate both shade and drought; this appears to be the case for species that tolerate shade chiefly by maximizing leaf area. However, many shade-tolerant woody plants in tropical and mediterranean-climate forests have thick, tough, long-lived leaves and a relatively high allocation to roots, and these species are much more drought tolerant. A few studies indicate that root trenching allows species to persist in deeper shade than that in which they are normally found and allows species from mesic sites to invade more xeric sites. Usually, the impact of trenching on growth rate is much greater in gaps than in the understory. Finally, we discuss the ways in which life-form composition and population structure of plant communities are shaped by reduced water: supply and reduced nutrient availability, emphasizing the inadequacy of models that consider the impact of ""belowground resource availability"" in a generic sense. Competition in a dry climate leads to widely spaced dominants, a lack of interstitial plants, high rates of seedling mortality in the understory, and a restriction of regeneration to patches where established matrix-forming plants have died.

Negative associations were observed between upper coniferous trees and lower broad-leaved trees and between upper P. jezoensis and lower P. koraiensis, suggesting that a canopy of these trees might not provide suitable environment for the survival, establishment, and growth of lower individuals, corresponding well to Janzen-Connell hypothesis.",0.584278578,NA

This study is a province-level study that aims to interpret the patterns and factors in early-stage vegetation recovery at abandoned plantation clearcut sites. We also discuss the potential indicators that may determine whether a certain site recovers towards evergreen broad-leaved forest consisting of Castanopsis cuspidata and Quercus glauca or towards deciduous broad-leaved forest comprising Q. serrata and Q. acutissima. A cluster analysis revealed that five types of vegetation (evergreen trees, evergreen trees-deciduous pioneer shrubs, pioneer species, deciduous trees, and deciduous shrubs) were observed from an early stage of succession. The first two vegetation types were considered to recover successfully to the target vegetation of evergreen broad-leaved forest, but the remaining three vegetation types did not show any tendency to recover to the target vegetations. According to the results of the detrended correspondence analysis, a smaller size of the abandoned site with adjacent evergreen broad-leaved forest and a longer time after clearcutting were identified as factors that enhance the invasion of evergreen tree species; these factors are also useful to predict the future successional tendency. In conjunction with these factors, the existence of regeneration sources (i.e., stumps) that allow sprouting appeared to be an important indicator for predicting the early-stage vegetation recovery.",?,15,,NA,,,2009,10.1007/s10310-009-0118-8,17,"The abandonment of sites after clearcutting plantations is increasing rapidly in Japan.

We also discuss the potential indicators that may determine whether a certain site recovers towards evergreen broad-leaved forest consisting of Castanopsis cuspidata and Quercus glauca or towards deciduous broad-leaved forest comprising Q. serrata and Q. acutissima. A cluster analysis revealed that five types of vegetation (evergreen trees, evergreen trees-deciduous pioneer shrubs, pioneer species, deciduous trees, and deciduous shrubs) were observed from an early stage of succession. The first two vegetation types were considered to recover successfully to the target vegetation of evergreen broad-leaved forest, but the remaining three vegetation types did not show any tendency to recover to the target vegetations. According to the results of the detrended correspondence analysis, a smaller size of the abandoned site with adjacent evergreen broad-leaved forest and a longer time after clearcutting were identified as factors that enhance the invasion of evergreen tree species; these factors are also useful to predict the future successional tendency. In conjunction with these factors, the existence of regeneration sources (i.e., stumps) that allow sprouting appeared to be an important indicator for predicting the early-stage vegetation recovery.","Patterns and factors in early-stage vegetation recovery at abandoned plantation clearcut sites in Oita, Japan: possible indicators for evaluating vegetation status The abandonment of sites after clearcutting plantations is increasing rapidly in Japan.

The record was obtained from a small, remnant, riverine patch of cool temperate rainforest dominated by the southern beech species, Nothofagus cunninghamii, and surrounded by tall open eucalypt forest. The present nature and extent of forest vegetation had been established by the beginning of the record and, in line with other records from southeastern Australia, there is evidence for higher precipitation than today during the mid-Holocene from a slight expansion of rainforest and increased diversity of tall open forest vegetation. From 4300 years ago, forest vegetation around the site becomes more open allowing the establishment of herbaceous swamp taxa. This development is attributed to relative stability of the site, with a reduction in stream water flow. A major feature of the record is the presence of pollen from the southern conifers Podocarpus, Phyllocladus and Dacrycarpus whose parent plants were important components of Victorian rainforest vegetation during the Tertiary period but no longer grow in the Otway region.

Given the persistence of these factors in the landscape, competitive alien plant species with a broad niche, including alien trees and shrubs, are likely to persist and spread further into European woodlands.",0.572682488,NA

Specifically, coniferous species have higher alpha- and gamma-diversity than the majority of analyzed broadleaf species, but twobroadleaf species showed the highest ss- diversity. Surprisingly, we found nonrandom co-occurrence (P<0.001) and strong tree species preferences of wood-inhabiting fungi, especially in broadleaf trees (P<0.01).

We also tested for the presence of strong environmental gradients across local ecotones that might inhibit species expansion. Results showed that tree regeneration patterns across ecotones varied by species and size class, and varied across the regional summer temperature gradient. Temperate tree species regeneration has established across local ecotones into boreal forest patches and this process was facilitated by warmer temperatures. Conversely, boreal conifer regeneration exhibited negative responses to the regional temperature gradient and only displayed high abundance at the boreal end of local ecotones at cool northern sites. The filtering effects of temperature also increased with individual size for both boreal and temperate understory stems.

Intensive thinning strongly increased light and soil temperature but reduced litter accumulation, thus facilitating seed germination, seedling emergence, and seedling survival of primarily early- and mid-successional species compared to late-successional species. As a result, more early- and mid-successional species were observed in Intensive compared to Weak and Control, whereas the number of late-successional species did not differ among thinning intensities. Thus, the number of species was greatest in Intensive but lowest in Control throughout the 5 years. However, Shannon's diversity index (H') did not strongly differ among thinning intensities, largely due to the predominance of the mid-successional species Cornus controversa, particularly in Intensive. In Control and Weak, both seedling survival and height were often greater for advance regeneration than for seedlings newly emerged in the year following thinning, whereas neither variable differed between advance regeneration and seedlings newly emerged in Intensive, mainly due to selective predation of advance regeneration by mammalian herbivores. These results suggest that the future composition of hardwoods can be roughly predicted by the composition of advance regeneration in Weak but by the composition of both advance regeneration and seedlings newly emerged in Intensive.

Inocybe sp. was only found on root tips of three-year-old trees, characterizing as an early-stage mycobiont. H. crustuliniforme appeared as a multi-stage colonizer in all three age classes but was clearly dominant on roots of three- and ten-year-old trees, whereas R. sardonia was mainly found on roots of 20-year-old trees, classifying as a late-stage species together with the unidentified morphotype Pinirhiza spinulosa which is reported for the first time from Chile.

Studies of this association in South America are still scarce, especially when referring to the causes of temporal dynamics of this symbiotic community, despite its importance in countries with a thriving forestry industry like Chile. This study evaluates the dynamics of the ectomycorrhizal community of Pinus mdiata stands of 3, 10 and 20 years of age, identifying and quantifying the most common fungal colonizers of fine roots in each age class. The results confirm that the mycobiont community changes with host tree age but that age classes differ in dominance patterns rather than in species richness, with the three- and ten-year-old tree cohorts forming a group separate from the 20-year-old trees.

New Zealand's old growth evergreen temperate forests are largely comprised of long-lived, slow-growing tree species typically growing in cool, humid conditions; collectively these conditions are thought to promote accumulation of high deadwood stocks. We estimated deadwood biomass and volume in New Zealand's forests and compared these stocks with published values from other broadleaved evergreen temperate forests. Mean deadwood biomass in New Zealand was 54 Mg ha(-1) but ranged across plots from 0 to 550 Mg ha(-1). Mean deadwood volume was 158 m(3) ha(-1) and ranged across plots from 0 to 1890 m(3) ha(-1). Fallen logs accounted for 63% of total deadwood volume and 65% of total deadwood biomass, with standing dead trees being the remainder. Each piece of deadwood was classified into one of three broad decay classes and >40% of deadwood was fallen logs of the intermediate decay class. Deadwood biomass and volume varied 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively, among forest types and was greatest in broadleaved forests, dominated by Weinmannia racemosa (Cunoniaceae), Metrosideros umbellata (Myrtaceae) and Metrosideros robusta, and broad leaf-Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) forests supporting the large tree species Nothofagus fusca.

This represents a knowledge gap for environmental management because repeated prescribed fires are a key tool for mitigating wildfire risk, and because CWD is recognized as critical to forest biodiversity and functioning. We examined the effects of repeated low-intensity prescribed fires on the attributes and stocks of (fallen) CWD in a mixed-species eucalypt forest of temperate Australia. Prescribed fire treatments were a factorial combination of two seasons (Autumn, Spring) and two frequencies (three yearly High, 10 yearly Low), were replicated over five study areas, and involved two to seven low-intensity fires over 27 years. Charring due to prescribed fires variously changed carbon and nitrogen concentrations and C to N ratios of CWD pieces depending on decay class, but did not affect mean wood density. CWD biomass and C and N stocks were significantly less in Fire than Control treatments. Decreases in total CWD C stocks of similar to 8 Mg/ha in Fire treatments were not balanced by minor increases in pyrogenic (char) C (similar to 0.3 Mg/ha). Effects of prescribed fire frequency and season included significantly less C and N stocks in rotten CWD in High than Low frequency treatments, and in the largest CWD pieces in Autumn than Spring treatments. Our study demonstrates that repeated low-intensity prescribed fires have the potential to significantly decrease CWD stocks, in pieces of all sizes and particularly decayed pieces, and to change CWD chemical attributes. CWD is at best a minor stock of pyrogenic C under such fire regimes. These findings suggest a potential trade-off in the management of temperate eucalypt forests between sustained reduction of wildfire risk, and the consequences of decreased CWD C stocks, and of changes in CWD as a habitat and biogeochemical substrate.

This represents a knowledge gap for environmental management because repeated prescribed fires are a key tool for mitigating wildfire risk, and because CWD is recognized as critical to forest biodiversity and functioning. We examined the effects of repeated low-intensity prescribed fires on the attributes and stocks of (fallen) CWD in a mixed-species eucalypt forest of temperate Australia. Prescribed fire treatments were a factorial combination of two seasons (Autumn, Spring) and two frequencies (three yearly High, 10 yearly Low), were replicated over five study areas, and involved two to seven low-intensity fires over 27 years. Charring due to prescribed fires variously changed carbon and nitrogen concentrations and C to N ratios of CWD pieces depending on decay class, but did not affect mean wood density. CWD biomass and C and N stocks were significantly less in Fire than Control treatments. Decreases in total CWD C stocks of similar to 8 Mg/ha in Fire treatments were not balanced by minor increases in pyrogenic (char) C (similar to 0.3 Mg/ha). Effects of prescribed fire frequency and season included significantly less C and N stocks in rotten CWD in High than Low frequency treatments, and in the largest CWD pieces in Autumn than Spring treatments. Our study demonstrates that repeated low-intensity prescribed fires have the potential to significantly decrease CWD stocks, in pieces of all sizes and particularly decayed pieces, and to change CWD chemical attributes. CWD is at best a minor stock of pyrogenic C under such fire regimes. These findings suggest a potential trade-off in the management of temperate eucalypt forests between sustained reduction of wildfire risk, and the consequences of decreased CWD C stocks, and of changes in CWD as a habitat and biogeochemical substrate. Nonetheless, negative impacts on CWD of repeated low-intensity prescribed fires could be lessened by fire intervals of 10 rather than three years (to decrease losses of decayed CWD), and fires in moist rather than dry conditions (to conserve large CWD).",0.529497333,NA

We evaluated the impact of tree ferns on the regeneration niche of vascular woody species to determine whether tree ferns function as biotic filters and influence seedling occurrence. We asked the following questions: (i) do understorey tree ferns influence the woody seedling bank, and (ii) which potential mechanisms drive any such influence? LocationMethodsAuckland and Waikato regions, northern New Zealand. We measured woody seedlings in 164 1-m(2) plots in northern New Zealand temperate broad-leaved podocarp forest and used multivariate analyses and modelling to assess the relative contributions of abiotic and biotic effects on community composition and seedling abundance. We manipulated the environments beneath 160 tree fern individuals by removing fronds and/or macro-litter in a balanced factorial design, and recorded the response of the seedling community over 1year. We then assessed the relative influences of shading and litter depth on the seedling community response. ResultsConclusionsDistance to the nearest tree fern was the best predictor of understorey seedling abundance; seedling abundance decreased beneath tree ferns. There was no strong evidence, however, that tree ferns influence seedling community composition; although the palm Rhopalostylis sapida, was consistently present away from tree fern micro-sites.

Earlier studies have shown that Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), the two dominant tree species in Fennoscandia, often generate soils with larger carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools than silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). Consequently, we hypothesised that spruce and pine would create soils with slower turnover rates than birch. To test this, C and N pools and C and N mineralisation rates were determined in different soil layers (humus, 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm mineral soil) at two sites with contrasting climatic conditions. One site (Tonnersjoheden) was located in the temperate zone in SW Sweden and one (Kivalo) in the north boreal zone in N Finland. At both sites, experimental plots with the three tree species had been established more than 50 years before the study. Samples from the different soil layers were incubated at 15 C in the laboratory for 30 days, and C and N mineralisation rates were determined. In addition, earthworm abundance was estimated at Tonnersjoheden but not at Kivalo (no sign of bioturbation). At Tonnersjoheden, soil C and N pools (g C or N m(-2)) were ranked spruce > pine > birch. C mineralisation rate (mg CO2-C g(-1) C d(-1)) was higher in the birch plots than in the other plots, but because of larger C pools in the spruce plots, field C mineralisation (g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)) was higher for spruce than for pine and birch. Field net N mineralisation (80-90 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) did not differ significantly between tree species, but nitrification rates (mu g NO3-N g-1 C d-1) in the topsoil were higher in the birch plots than in the other plots. The birch plots had larger populations of earthworms and a higher degree of bioturbation than any of the coniferous plots, which probably explains the higher turnover rate of birch soil organic matter (SOM). At Kivalo, C and N soil pools were significantly larger in spruce than in birch plots, and C mineralisation rate was higher in birch and spruce humus than in pine humus. Net N mineralisation rate and annual field net N mineralisation (<4 kg N ha-1 year-1) were estimated to be very low, with no effect of tree species. Thus, the hypothesis of a 'birch effect' was supported at Tonnersjoheden, but only partly at Kivalo. The main difference seemed to be that the earthworms at Tonnersjoheden accelerated SOM decomposition under birch, whereas earthworm stimulation was negligible at Kivalo, probably because of climate-related limitations.

Samples from the different soil layers were incubated at 15 C in the laboratory for 30 days, and C and N mineralisation rates were determined. In addition, earthworm abundance was estimated at Tonnersjoheden but not at Kivalo (no sign of bioturbation). At Tonnersjoheden, soil C and N pools (g C or N m(-2)) were ranked spruce > pine > birch. C mineralisation rate (mg CO2-C g(-1) C d(-1)) was higher in the birch plots than in the other plots, but because of larger C pools in the spruce plots, field C mineralisation (g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)) was higher for spruce than for pine and birch. Field net N mineralisation (80-90 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) did not differ significantly between tree species, but nitrification rates (mu g NO3-N g-1 C d-1) in the topsoil were higher in the birch plots than in the other plots. The birch plots had larger populations of earthworms and a higher degree of bioturbation than any of the coniferous plots, which probably explains the higher turnover rate of birch soil organic matter (SOM). At Kivalo, C and N soil pools were significantly larger in spruce than in birch plots, and C mineralisation rate was higher in birch and spruce humus than in pine humus. Net N mineralisation rate and annual field net N mineralisation (<4 kg N ha-1 year-1) were estimated to be very low, with no effect of tree species. Thus, the hypothesis of a 'birch effect' was supported at Tonnersjoheden, but only partly at Kivalo. The main difference seemed to be that the earthworms at Tonnersjoheden accelerated SOM decomposition under birch, whereas earthworm stimulation was negligible at Kivalo, probably because of climate-related limitations.

In this study, we estimated seasonal and age-related changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in three epigeic species of collembolans (Pogonognathellus longicornis, Orchesella flavescens and Isotoma viridis) and two litter-dwelling species of millipedes (Polydesmus denticulatus and Leptoiulus proximus) in deciduous and coniferous forest stands in central Russia. Age-related changes in delta C-13 or delta N-15 values were either absent or negligible (within 1 parts per thousand) in L proximus, but adult and subadult specimens of P. denticulatus were enriched in N-15 compared to early larval stages. Since the adults of P. denticulatus were generally more enriched in N-15 than adults of L proximus, they presumably occupy more distinct trophic niches than juveniles do. Age-related changes in isotopic composition were small or absent in collembolans studied. Neither delta C-13 nor delta N-15 values of millipedes changed significantly during the vegetation season. In contrast, consistent seasonal changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were found in collembolans. Increased delta C-13 values coincided with the period of minimum soil moisture and correlated with a decreased C/N ratio in collembolan tissues. These changes can largely be attributed to the depletion of lipid-rich storage tissues. Seasonal changes in delta N-15 values were similar among collembolan species, yet slightly varied between habitats. A general trend of increasing delta N-15 values from June to September October may indicate either a reduced importance of non-vascular plants (algae and lichen) in collembolan diet or variation in the isotopic composition of these plants. Overall, our data show that seasonal variations should be taken into account when estimating the isotopic composition of epigeic collembolans in forest soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Our results on time trends and competitive performance showed local exceptions to existing theories of Sierran forest dynamics, with some shade-tolerant species increasing in survival over time and others performing better than expected under more crowded conditions. Within species, low survival was concentrated in susceptible subsets of our population and single estimates of annual survival rates did not reflect this heterogeneity in survival.",0.502028858,NA

To predict the future development of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, well-validated models are needed. We applied the litter and soil carbon model Yasso15 to 1838 plots of the German national forest soil inventory (NFSI) for the period between 1985 and 2014 to enables a direct comparison to the NFSI measurements. In addition, to provide data for the German Greenhouse Gas Inventory, we simulated the development of SOC with Yasso15 applying a climate projection based on the RCP8.5 scenario. The initial model-calculated SOC stocks were adjusted to the measured ones in the NFSI. On average, there were no significant differences between the simulated SOC changes (0.25 +/- 0.10 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1)) and the NFSI data (0.39 +/- 0.11 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1)). Comparing regional soil-unit-specific aggregates of the SOC changes, the correlation between both methods was significant (r(2) = 0.49) although the NFSI values had a wider range and more negative values.

Seedlings of some tree species are strongly associated with decaying wood in the germination or establishment period. Despite recognition of this pattern in forests around the world, few studies have compared the ability of different species of decaying wood to support seedlings. 2. We measured the abundance, survival, and age distribution of seedlings of Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock), Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch), and Acer saccharum (sugar maple) among forest floor substrates at field sites in Upper Michigan, USA. Seedlings were censused on decaying wood of the same three species and on soil to determine whether species of decaying wood and soil differ in their ability to support seedlings. We hypothesized that Tsuga and Betula seedling abundance and survival are higher on Tsuga wood than on Acer wood or soil. 3. Independent of seed fall, light and size of wood piece, Tsuga wood generally supported the highest densities of first-year and established (> 1 year-old) seedlings of Betula and Tsuga.

The spatial distribution of mitotypes suggests that five distinct population groups exist in the species: one in the west comprising seven populations, a second with a north-central distribution comprising 15 populations, a third with a southern and easterly distribution comprising five populations, a fourth comprising one central and one western population, and a fifth comprising a single population located in the north-central part of the species' range.

Location The study site is a mire (1300 m a.s.l.) at Vega de Viejos, on a south-facing slope of the western Cantabrian Range, Spain. The region's present-day landscape is almost treeless, with the exception of some patches of Quercus pyrenaica and a few copses of Salix and Betula along stream banks. Methods Tree macrofossils from Vega de Viejos were studied by transmitted light and dark-field reflection microscopy; strobili were subjected to comparative morphological analyses. Two Pinus macrofossils were dated by conventional C-14 methods. Results The taxonomic accuracy achieved in the identification of the macrofossils provided new information regarding the Holocene history of Pinus sylvestris in this territory. Ninety-five cones of this species were identified; in fact, more than 80% of the 36 identified wood remains were of Pinus gr. sylvestris. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the forest to which the fossils belonged was present until at least 2170 +/- 50 yr BP - its disappearance was therefore relatively recent. Main conclusions Pinus sylvestris suffered long-term isolation, and after the Wurm glacial period tended to migrate towards the east.

High densities of ungulates can have a profound impact on plant populations, forest structure and ecosystem processes. We focus here on plant responses at two levels of population organisation in woody plants: modules and genets. Modules are defined as leaves and winter shoots, and genets as the original zygotes. Our main concern is with boreal and temperate deciduous forests, but examples from other systems are included where appropriate. Our aims are: (1) to describe and evaluate the effect of ungulate browsers on the number and other characteristics of plant population units (modules and genets), and (2) to identify consequences of the resulting changes in module and genet populations for woody plants, the browser and the forest ecosystems. At the module level, the ungulate browsers can easily change not only the number, but also the size and quality of modules. The browser-module system is more dynamic than we commonly believe, and there is a strong seasonal effect of browsing. At medium to high ungulate densities we can expect different food selection processes and food intake rates of ungulates compared to those found at low densities. At the genet level, browsers affect the number of genets of preferred plant species, as well as their size and other qualities. Reductions in the abundance of one plant species can lead to increases in other species, followed by cascading effects involving many different biota. If species increasing in abundance differ in important respects from those being replaced (e.g. if nitrogen-fixing or deciduous trees replace non-fixing or coniferous species, respectively) there may be dramatic long-term changes in ecosystem function. Both module and genet populations respond to ungulate activities, but over somewhat different time scales: the module responses being more short-term, with apparently more dynamic components. We need to better understand the dynamics of trees at both the module and genet levels, especially at high ungulate densities, and to monitor the responses of the woody plants as well as the ungulates.

There is evidence, however, that a single trade-off axis may fail to explain the dynamics of mixed conifer-angiosperm rain forests in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in New Zealand. We tested for growth vs. shade tolerance trade-offs by measuring juvenile growth of five podocarps and five broadleaved canopy angiosperms across a wide range of light environments in a New Zealand warm-temperate rain forest. The light compensation point of growth was used as a measure of species light requirements, which we then compared with height growth in 10% light, approximating the environments encountered beneath small treefall gaps. Despite considerable overlap between the ranges of both growth rates and compensation points found in the two lineages, major axis tests showed that the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off differed significantly between podocarp and angiosperm species. At a common compensation point, angiosperms were faster growing than podocarps in 10% light. However, juveniles of these angiosperm species were notably scarce in the more open environments associated with forest margins. Synthesis.A conifer-angiosperm divergence in the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off may explain long-standing problems of the dynamics of these forests. Although juveniles of most lowland podocarps can tolerate considerable shade, the more vigorous response of broadleaved angiosperms to small canopy openings enables them to out-compete podocarps in old-growth stands. The greater abundance of podocarp juveniles on forest margins cannot be attributed to them out-competing angiosperm species where light is abundant and is likely to reflect superior resistance to frost and/or drought.

The drivers of the dynamics of New Zealand's podocarp-broadleaved forests therefore differ appreciably from those ascribed to tropical and north-temperate forests.","A conifer-angiosperm divergence in the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off underlies the dynamics of a New Zealand warm-temperate rain forest A central tenet of forest ecology is that succession and regeneration dynamics are driven by an interspecific trade-off between juvenile growth rates in high light and shade tolerance. There is evidence, however, that a single trade-off axis may fail to explain the dynamics of mixed conifer-angiosperm rain forests in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in New Zealand. We tested for growth vs. shade tolerance trade-offs by measuring juvenile growth of five podocarps and five broadleaved canopy angiosperms across a wide range of light environments in a New Zealand warm-temperate rain forest. The light compensation point of growth was used as a measure of species light requirements, which we then compared with height growth in 10% light, approximating the environments encountered beneath small treefall gaps. Despite considerable overlap between the ranges of both growth rates and compensation points found in the two lineages, major axis tests showed that the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off differed significantly between podocarp and angiosperm species. At a common compensation point, angiosperms were faster growing than podocarps in 10% light. However, juveniles of these angiosperm species were notably scarce in the more open environments associated with forest margins. Synthesis.A conifer-angiosperm divergence in the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off may explain long-standing problems of the dynamics of these forests. Although juveniles of most lowland podocarps can tolerate considerable shade, the more vigorous response of broadleaved angiosperms to small canopy openings enables them to out-compete podocarps in old-growth stands. The greater abundance of podocarp juveniles on forest margins cannot be attributed to them out-competing angiosperm species where light is abundant and is likely to reflect superior resistance to frost and/or drought.

However, little is known on below- and above-ground processes leading to these positive effects. We tested whether stratification in soil water uptake depth occurred between four tree species in a 10-year-old temperate mixed species plantation during a dry summer. We selected dominant and co-dominant trees of European beech, Sessile oak, Douglas fir and Norway spruce in areas with varying species diversity, competition intensity, and where different plant functional types (broadleaf vs. conifer) were present. We applied a deuterium labelling approach that consisted of spraying labelled water to the soil surface to create a strong vertical gradient of the deuterium isotope composition in the soil water. The deuterium isotope composition of both the xylem sap and the soil water was measured before labelling, and then again three days after labelling, to estimate the soil water uptake depth using a simple modelling approach. We also sampled leaves and needles from selected trees to measure their carbon isotope composition (a proxy for water use efficiency) and total nitrogen content. At the end of the summer, we found differences in the soil water uptake depth between plant functional types but not within types: on average, coniferous species extracted water from deeper layers than did broadleaved species. Neither species diversity nor competition intensity had a detectable influence on soil water uptake depth, foliar water use efficiency or foliar nitrogen concentration in the species studied. However, when coexisting with an increasing proportion of conifers, beech extracted water from progressively deeper soil layers. We conclude that complementarity for water uptake could occur in this 10-year-old plantation because of inherent differences among functional groups (conifers and broadleaves). Furthermore, water uptake depth of beech was already influenced at this young development stage by interspecific interactions whereas no clear niche differentiation occurred for the other species. This finding does not preclude that plasticity-mediated responses to species interactions could increase as the plantation ages, leading to the coexistence of these species in adult forest stands.

At the end of the summer, we found differences in the soil water uptake depth between plant functional types but not within types: on average, coniferous species extracted water from deeper layers than did broadleaved species. Neither species diversity nor competition intensity had a detectable influence on soil water uptake depth, foliar water use efficiency or foliar nitrogen concentration in the species studied. However, when coexisting with an increasing proportion of conifers, beech extracted water from progressively deeper soil layers. We conclude that complementarity for water uptake could occur in this 10-year-old plantation because of inherent differences among functional groups (conifers and broadleaves). Furthermore, water uptake depth of beech was already influenced at this young development stage by interspecific interactions whereas no clear niche differentiation occurred for the other species. This finding does not preclude that plasticity-mediated responses to species interactions could increase as the plantation ages, leading to the coexistence of these species in adult forest stands. ","Impact of interspecific interactions on the soil water uptake depth in a young temperate mixed species plantation Interactions between tree species in forests can be beneficial to ecosystem functions and services related to the carbon and water cycles by improving for example transpiration and productivity. However, little is known on below- and above-ground processes leading to these positive effects. We tested whether stratification in soil water uptake depth occurred between four tree species in a 10-year-old temperate mixed species plantation during a dry summer. We selected dominant and co-dominant trees of European beech, Sessile oak, Douglas fir and Norway spruce in areas with varying species diversity, competition intensity, and where different plant functional types (broadleaf vs. conifer) were present. We applied a deuterium labelling approach that consisted of spraying labelled water to the soil surface to create a strong vertical gradient of the deuterium isotope composition in the soil water.

The objective of this research was to develop automated tools to provide from a single aerial LiDAR dataset new mapping tools and keystone riparian zone attributes assessing the ecological integrity of the riparian zone at a network scale (24 km). Different metrics were extracted from the original LiDAR point cloud, notably the Digital Terrain Model and Canopy Height Model rasters, allowing the extraction of riparian zones attributes such as the wetted channel (0.89 m; mean residual) and floodplain extents (6.02 m; mean residual). Different riparian forest characteristics were directly extracted from these layers (patch extent, overhanging character, longitudinal continuity, relative water level, mean and relative standard deviation of tree height). Within the riparian forest, the coniferous stands were distinguished from deciduous and isolated trees, with high accuracy (87.3%, Kappa index). Going further the mapping of the indicators, our study proposed an original approach to study the riparian zone attributes within different buffer width, from local scale (50 m long channel axis reach) to a network scale (ca. 2 km long reaches), using a disaggregation/re-agraggation process. This novel approach, combined to graphical presentations of the results allow natural resource managers to visualise the variation of upstream-downstream attributes and to identify priority action areas. In the case study, results showed a general decrease of the riparian forests when the river crosses built-up areas. They also highlighted the lower flooding frequency of riparian forest patches in habitats areas. Those results showed that LiDAR data can be used to extract indicators of ecological integrity of riparian zones in temperate climate zone.

Despite their relatively low area coverage, riparian zones consequently represent a major concern for land and water resource managers confirmed within several European directives. These directives involve effective multi-scale monitoring to assess their conditions and their ability to carry out their functions. The objective of this research was to develop automated tools to provide from a single aerial LiDAR dataset new mapping tools and keystone riparian zone attributes assessing the ecological integrity of the riparian zone at a network scale (24 km).

Annual litter production did not change significantly along the chronosequence (mean 2.41 tha(-1)). In contrast, litter decay rates decreased significantly during the rapid growth phase of trees. In consequence, the litter turnover time (1/k) was lower in the youngest stands (20 months) compared to the oldest ones (31 months). Even in the absence of a significant pattern of variation, litter production was positively correlated with the thickness of the OF (Oi) horizon. In contrast, litter decay was strongly negatively correlated with maximum thickness of the OH (Oa) horizon, suggesting that the appearance of the humification layer was mainly due to a decrease in litter decay rate. We did not find significant changes in the main properties of the organo-mineral horizon, suggesting that soil nutrient availability may not directly affect litter dynamics.

Most studies carried out in northern hemisphere temperate coniferous forests emphasize the importance of old growth stages of forests or large dead trees as habitat for cavity builders. We present a study of Nothofagus pumilio tree selection by the magellanic woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) that incorporates dendroecological data on long-term growth trends of trees that provides new insights into the processes that create suitable habitat for cavity excavating species. We analysed 351 cavity and neighbouring control trees in terms of age and radial growth patterns, as well as external tree characteristics. In addition, from a subsample of these trees we developed tree-ring chronologies for each group using standard methods in order to analyse potential differences in radial growth patterns between cavity and non-cavity trees. Multivariate models that account for differences between paired cavities versus control trees indicated that growth decline and the degree of crown dieback were the primary variables explaining magellanic woodpecker tree selection for cavity building. In contrast to previous work, neither diameter (above a certain threshold) nor age, were important determinants of selection. Furthermore, trees that became present cavity are those that had synchronously declined in radial growth during the 1943-44 and 1956-57 droughts and the 1985-86 massive caterpillar defoliation. Insect outbreaks and extreme climatic events may episodically reduce vigour, induce partial crown mortality, trigger increased fungal attack and heart rot formation at different tree heights on the bole in a group of trees and thus increase availability of soft substrate and their likelihood of cavity excavation by the magellanic woodpecker.

Here, we used data on naturalized conifers (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) from sixty temperate and subtropical regions and five continents to test how environmental and socio-economic conditions of recipient areas as well as introduction efforts affect naturalization probabilities. We collated 18 predictor variables for each region describing environmental, biogeographic and socio-economic conditions as well as a measure of the macro-climatic match with the species' native ranges, and the extent to which alien conifers are used in commercial forestry. Naturalization probabilities across all species and regions were then related to these predictor variables by means of generalized linear mixed models. For both Pinaceae and Cupressaceae, naturalization probabilities were generally higher in the Southern Hemisphere, and increased with indicators of habitat diversity of the recipient region. The match in macro-climatic conditions between the native and introduced regions was a significant predictor of conifer naturalization, but socio-economic variables were less powerful predictors. Only for Cupressaceae did a socio-economic variable (human population density) affect naturalization probabilities. Key attributes facilitating naturalization were related to introduction effort.

Thus, an adequate representation of ecosystem response to water stress in land models is critical for predicting carbon dynamics. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5 against observations at an old-growth coniferous forest site in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States (Wind River AmeriFlux site), characterized by a Mediterranean climate that subjects trees to water stress each summer. CLM was driven by site-observed meteorology and calibrated primarily using parameter values observed at the site or at similar stands in the region. Key model adjustments included parameters controlling specific leaf area and stomatal conductance. Default values of these parameters led to significant underestimation of gross primary production, overestimation of evapotranspiration, and consequently overestimation of photosynthetic C-13 discrimination, reflected in reduced C-13 : C-12 ratios of carbon fluxes and pools. Adjustments in soil hydraulic parameters within CLM were also critical, preventing significant underestimation of soil water content and unrealistic soil moisture stress during summer. After calibration, CLM was able to simulate energy and carbon fluxes, leaf area index, biomass stocks, and carbon isotope ratios of carbon fluxes and pools in reasonable agreement with site observations.

This is the first report about fossil plants from the Yinzuilazi Formation, the easternmost distribution area of the Jehol Biota. The discovery of the new species extends significantly the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of Baiera in the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota as well as the Eurasia. It also shows that Baiera was a common member of Ginkgophytes once lived in the Early Cretaceous deciduous forest of Northeast China. The new species also improves our knowledge on understanding the leaf morphology, epidermal features, and diversity of Baiera during the Early Cretaceous. Analysis of the epidermal characters of the new species and other associated plants reveals that the plants grew in a warm and humid climate in the temperate zone. The presence of some deciduous plants, including gingkgoaleans, czekanowskialeans, and some conifers, demonstrates a climate with seasonal fluctuations and precipitation. ",0.353918455,NA

One of the most influential factors affecting plants and microbial communities in soil in managed ecosystems is the current land-use. In forestry, wood ash has been proposed as a liming agent and a fertilizer, but has been questioned due to the risk associated with its Cd content. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of wood ash on the structure and function of decomposer microbial communities in forest soils and to assign them to causal mechanisms. To do this, we assessed the responses to wood ash application of (i) the microbial community size and structure, (ii) microbial community trait-distributions, including bacterial pH relationships and Cd-tolerance, to assign the microbial responses to pH and Cd, and (iii) consequences for proxies of the function soil organic matter (SOM) turnover including respiration and microbial growth rates. Two sets of field-experiments in temperate conifer forest plantations were combined with laboratory microcosm experiments where wood ash additions were compared to additions of lime and Cd. Wood ash induced structural changes in the microbial community in both field experiments, and striking similarities were observed between the application of ash and that of lime in the microcosm experiments. Wood ash increased pH, and led to a shift toward faster SOM decomposition and a reduced importance of fungi. This coincided with shifts in bacterial community trait distributions for pH, with pH optima closely tracking the new soil pH. A Cd solution could induce Cd-tolerance in the microcosm experiments, but the ash did not affect the microbial tolerance to Cd in field or microcosm experiments. We demonstrate that the microbial community responded strongly to the application of wood ash to forest soils with consequences for its functional capabilities in terms of respiration and growth rates. The bacterial community's trait distributions revealed that the increased pH directly caused the microbial responses, while the wood ash associated Cd has no detectable effects on the microbial community.

Wood ash induced structural changes in the microbial community in both field experiments, and striking similarities were observed between the application of ash and that of lime in the microcosm experiments. Wood ash increased pH, and led to a shift toward faster SOM decomposition and a reduced importance of fungi. This coincided with shifts in bacterial community trait distributions for pH, with pH optima closely tracking the new soil pH. A Cd solution could induce Cd-tolerance in the microcosm experiments, but the ash did not affect the microbial tolerance to Cd in field or microcosm experiments. We demonstrate that the microbial community responded strongly to the application of wood ash to forest soils with consequences for its functional capabilities in terms of respiration and growth rates. The bacterial community's trait distributions revealed that the increased pH directly caused the microbial responses, while the wood ash associated Cd has no detectable effects on the microbial community. The study demonstrates the power of community trait distributions to (i) causally link microbial structural responses to environmental change and (ii) potential to predict the ecosystem functional consequences.

Temperate conifer forest soils contain a substantial portion of the global soil C pool and therefore are key components of the global carbon cycle. Despite the importance of temperate forest soil organic carbon (SOC) in the global carbon cycle, the mechanisms and dynamics of SOC accumulation and storage remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled four soils over different bedrock types (rhyolite, granite, basalt, limestone) under Pinus ponderosa to explore the following questions: i) Within a specific ecosystem type, how do SOC contents vary among sites with differing mineralogy? ii) What physicochemical variables are most highly correlated with SOC content, soil microbial community composition and soil respiration? and iii) What mechanisms account for the influence of these variables on SOC cycling? Soil physiochemical and microbiological properties were characterized and compared on the basis of mineral assemblage, pH, organic carbon content, bacterial community composition, respiration rate, microbial biomass, specific metabolic activity (qCO(2)), and delta(13)C of respired CO(2). The selected field sites spanned a physicochemical gradient, ranging from acid (pH of 5.2) to basic (pH of 7.1) from rhyolite to granite to basalt to limestone. The acidic rhyolite and granite soils had measurable amounts of exchangeable Al(3+) (Up to 3 cmol(+) kg(-1)). SOC content varied significantly among sites, ranging from 3.5 to 11 kg C m(-2).in limestone and rhyolite soils, respectively. Soil bacterial communities were also significantly different among all sites. Metal-humus complex and Fe-oxyhydroxide content emerged as important controllers of SOC dynamics across all sites, showing significant correlation with both SOC content (Al-humus: R(2) = 0.71; P<0.01; Fehumus: R(2) = 0.75; P<0.001; crystalline FeOx: R(2) = 0.63; P<0.01) and bacterial community composition (Alhumus: R(2) = 0.35; P<0.05; Fe-humus: R(2) = 0.51; P<0.01; oxalate-extractable Fe: R(2) = 0.59; P<0.01). Moreover, soil pH was significantly correlated with exchangeable Al(3+), metal-humus complex content, bacterial community composition, and microbial biomass C/N ratios. Results indicated that within a specific ecosystem, SOC dynamics and microbial community vary predictably with soil physicochemical variables directly related to mineralogical differences among soil parent materials. Specifically, the data suggest a gradient in the dominant SOC stabilization mechanism among sites, with chemical recalcitrance and metal-humus complexation the dominant control in soils of the acidic rhyolite and granite sites, and mineral adsorption the dominant factor in the basic limestone and basalt sites. Knowledge of parent material dependent SOC dynamics allows for improved estimates of ecosystem SOC stocks and the potential response of SOC to climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Metal-humus complex and Fe-oxyhydroxide content emerged as important controllers of SOC dynamics across all sites, showing significant correlation with both SOC content (Al-humus: R(2) = 0.71; P<0.01; Fehumus: R(2) = 0.75; P<0.001; crystalline FeOx: R(2) = 0.63; P<0.01) and bacterial community composition (Alhumus: R(2) = 0.35; P<0.05; Fe-humus: R(2) = 0.51; P<0.01; oxalate-extractable Fe: R(2) = 0.59; P<0.01). Moreover, soil pH was significantly correlated with exchangeable Al(3+), metal-humus complex content, bacterial community composition, and microbial biomass C/N ratios. Results indicated that within a specific ecosystem, SOC dynamics and microbial community vary predictably with soil physicochemical variables directly related to mineralogical differences among soil parent materials. Specifically, the data suggest a gradient in the dominant SOC stabilization mechanism among sites, with chemical recalcitrance and metal-humus complexation the dominant control in soils of the acidic rhyolite and granite sites, and mineral adsorption the dominant factor in the basic limestone and basalt sites. Knowledge of parent material dependent SOC dynamics allows for improved estimates of ecosystem SOC stocks and the potential response of SOC to climate change. ","Geologic controls of soil carbon cycling and microbial dynamics in temperate conifer forests Understanding soil carbon cycling is important for assessing ecosystem response to climate change. Temperate conifer forest soils contain a substantial portion of the global soil C pool and therefore are key components of the global carbon cycle. Despite the importance of temperate forest soil organic carbon (SOC) in the global carbon cycle, the mechanisms and dynamics of SOC accumulation and storage remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled four soils over different bedrock types (rhyolite, granite, basalt, limestone) under Pinus ponderosa to explore the following questions: i) Within a specific ecosystem type, how do SOC contents vary among sites with differing mineralogy? ii) What physicochemical variables are most highly correlated with SOC content, soil microbial community composition and soil respiration? and iii) What mechanisms account for the influence of these variables on SOC cycling? Soil physiochemical and microbiological properties were characterized and compared on the basis of mineral assemblage, pH, organic carbon content, bacterial community composition, respiration rate, microbial biomass, specific metabolic activity (qCO(2)), and delta(13)C of respired CO(2). The selected field sites spanned a physicochemical gradient, ranging from acid (pH of 5.2) to basic (pH of 7.1) from rhyolite to granite to basalt to limestone. The acidic rhyolite and granite soils had measurable amounts of exchangeable Al(3+) (Up to 3 cmol(+) kg(-1)). SOC content varied significantly among sites, ranging from 3.5 to 11 kg C m(-2).in limestone and rhyolite soils, respectively. Soil bacterial communities were also significantly different among all sites. Metal-humus complex and Fe-oxyhydroxide content emerged as important controllers of SOC dynamics across all sites, showing significant correlation with both SOC content (Al-humus: R(2) = 0.71; P<0.01; Fehumus: R(2) = 0.75; P<0.001; crystalline FeOx: R(2) = 0.63; P<0.01) and bacterial community composition (Alhumus: R(2) = 0.35; P<0.05; Fe-humus: R(2) = 0.51; P<0.01; oxalate-extractable Fe: R(2) = 0.59; P<0.01).

In this study, we examined the rates of microbial respiration and net N mineralization in 84 distinct mineral soils in static laboratory incubations. We examined patterns in C and N pool sizes, microbial biomass, and process rates by vegetation type (grassland, shrubland, coniferous forest, and deciduous/broadleaf forest). We also modeled microbial respiration and net N mineralization in relation to soil and site characteristics using structural equation modeling to identify potential process drivers across soils. While we did not explicitly investigate the influence of soil organic matter quality, microbial community composition, or clay mineralogy on microbial process rates in this study, our models allow us to put boundaries on the unique explanatory power these characteristics could potentially provide in predicting respiration and net N mineralization. Mean annual temperature and precipitation, soil C concentration, microbial biomass, and clay content predicted 78% of the variance in microbial respiration, with 61% explained by microbial biomass alone. For net N mineralization, only 33% of the variance was explained, with mean annual precipitation, soil C and N concentration, and clay content as the potential drivers. We suggest that the high R-2 for respiration suggests that soil organic matter quality, microbial community composition, and clay mineralogy explain at most 22% of the variance in respiration, while they could explain up to 67% of the variance in net N mineralization.
