We investigated the importance of habitat variables at different scales on the richness and abundance of bumble bees both annually and seasonally in Sierran montane meadows over two years. We found that both patch and landscape factors influence the species richness and abundance of bumblebees and these factors have a seasonal component to their importance. The proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat was the most consistent positive influence on both species richness and abundance across years.

Seventy cover-abundance floristic releves were performed in randomly located permanent plots, half at the pasture edge (M-plots) and half in their central part (C-plots).

We tested this hypothesis by performing a controlled field experiment in which we manipulated fire and compared grazed plots with ungrazed exclosures, simulating current (high frequent fires and low livestock load) and future (fire suppression and grazing exclosure) scenarios. We recorded total of 90 species with 40 shared among all treatments. Tussock grasses (Elionurus muticus), followed by three shrubs represented the main contribution to live biomass in all treatments.

Yet how they interact in natural settings remains unclear. Experiments have revealed two major mechanisms for the observed increase in primary productivity with plant species richness. Plant productivity may rise with species richness due to the increased amount of resources used by more diverse communities (niche complementarity) or through the increased probability of including a highly productive, dominant species in the community (sampling effect). Current evidence suggests that niche complementarity is the most relevant mechanism, whereas the sampling effect would only play a minor and transient role in natural systems. In turn, exotic species can invade by using untapped resources or because they possess a fitness advantage over resident species allowing them to dominate the community. We argue that the sampling effect can be a significant biodiversity mechanism in ecosystems invaded by dominant exotic species, and that the effect can be persistent even after decades of succession. We illustrate this idea by analyzing tree species richness-productivity relationships in a subtropical montane forest (NW Argentina) heavily invaded by Ligustrum lucidum, an evergreen tree from Asia. We found that the forest biomass increased along a natural gradient of tree species richness whether invaded by L. lucidum or not. Consistent with the sampling effect, L. lucidum invasion tripled total tree biomass irrespective of species richness, and monocultures of L. lucidum were more productive than any of the most species-rich, uninvaded communities. Hence, the sampling effect may not be restricted to randomly assembled, synthetic communities. We emphasize that studying invaded ecosystems may provide novel insights on the mechanisms underlying the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function.","",NA,"",NA,2017,"10.1111/oik.04221",29,"Species loss and invasion of exotic species are two components of global biodiversity change that are expected to influence ecosystem functioning.

In turn, exotic species can invade by using untapped resources or because they possess a fitness advantage over resident species allowing them to dominate the community. We argue that the sampling effect can be a significant biodiversity mechanism in ecosystems invaded by dominant exotic species, and that the effect can be persistent even after decades of succession. We illustrate this idea by analyzing tree species richness-productivity relationships in a subtropical montane forest (NW Argentina) heavily invaded by Ligustrum lucidum, an evergreen tree from Asia. We found that the forest biomass increased along a natural gradient of tree species richness whether invaded by L. lucidum or not. Consistent with the sampling effect, L. lucidum invasion tripled total tree biomass irrespective of species richness, and monocultures of L. lucidum were more productive than any of the most species-rich, uninvaded communities. Hence, the sampling effect may not be restricted to randomly assembled, synthetic communities. We emphasize that studying invaded ecosystems may provide novel insights on the mechanisms underlying the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function.","A role for the sampling effect in invaded ecosystems Species loss and invasion of exotic species are two components of global biodiversity change that are expected to influence ecosystem functioning.

Sampling dung beetles of the subfamilies Aphodiinae, Scarabaeinae, and Geotrupinae was carried out at four volcanoes in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) in the Mexican transition zone at 2,700 and 3,400 MASL, and on the windward and leeward sides. Sampling units represented a forest-shrubland-pasture (FSP) mosaic typical of this mountain region. A total of 3,430 individuals of 29 dung beetle species were collected. Diversity, abundance and compositional similarity (CS) displayed a high variability at all scales; elevation, cardinal direction, or FSP mosaics did not show any patterns of higher or lower values of those measures. The four mountains were different regarding dispersion patterns and taxonomic groups, both for species and individuals. Onthophagus chevrolati dominated all four mountains with an overall relative abundance of 63%. CS was not related to distance among mountains, but when O. chevrolati was excluded from the analysis, CS values based on species abundance decreased with increasing distance. Speciation, dispersion, and environmental instability are suggested as the main drivers of high mountain diversity patterns, acting together at different spatial and temporal scales. Three species new to science were collected (>10% of all species sampled). These discoveries may indicate that speciation rate is high among these volcanoes-a hypothesis that is also supported by the elevated number of collected species with a restricted montane distribution. Dispersion is an important factor in driving species composition, although naturally limited between high mountains; horizontal colonization events at different time scales may best explain the observed species composition in the TMVB, complemented by vertical colonization events to a lesser extent. Environmental instability may be the main factor causing the high variability of diversity and abundance patterns found during sampling. Together, we interpret these results as indicating that species richness and composition in the high mountains of the TMVB may be driven by biogeographical history while variability in diversity is determined by ecological factors. We argue that current conservation strategies do not focus sufficiently on protecting high mountain fauna, and that there is a need for developing and applying new conservation concepts that take into account the high spatial and temporal variability of this system.",0.719772298,NA

Limited geographical range of some species reduced the per-square species richness of all Functional Groups below their potential maximum but the degree of reduction varied markedly between Functional Groups. Structural heterogeneity in the landscape was an important determinant of bird biodiversity, with both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape types (strata) of value to different Functional Groups. The importance of the lowland strata for birds generally, especially in winter, contrasted with the specific importance of every stratum for particular Functional Groups, especially in summer. Conclusions The combination of Functional Groups and land cover/use stratification enables a concise, comprehensive, direct assessment of bird biodiversity in relation to land cover/use at landscape scale. It also provides a framework within which effects of regional or global changes in environment or land use on bird biodiversity can be estimated. Total species richness in a stratum is a poor measure of its importance for overall bird biodiversity; species richness within Functional Groups, together with the analyses of Functional Groups in relation to the strata, provides a better base for the formulation of national-level conservation and biodiversity policy.",0.787409813,NA

Our aim was to determine the effects of the dehesa abandonment and shrub cutting on plant species richness (annual herbs, perennial herbs and woody plants) and species composition, as well as on topsoil properties. For that, we compared three types of dehesas with different management regimes: (1) grazed dehesas (used at the present), (2) abandoned dehesas (more than 20 years without grazing) and (3) dehesas where shrub cutting was applied after abandonment (i.e. cleared dehesas). We selected three replicates or stands per dehesa type. The highest organic matter content (O.M.), total nitrogen (N) and available phosphorus (P) were found in cleared dehesas, while the lowest values corresponded to the grazed ones. Abandoned dehesas were characterized by the highest values for available calcium (Ca(2+)). No significant differences were detected regarding the vegetation richness values (S alpha, gamma or beta), although higher mean values of S alpha and gamma were found in grazed dehesas and lower, values in the cleared ones. Concerning the vegetation life forms, grazed dehesas held significantly greater species richness and cover of annual herbs, while abandoned dehesas had significantly higher woody species cover.

A case study of a pine plantation in KwaZulu-Natal","Grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and fragmented, but are poorly protected. Commercial afforestation poses a particular threat to grassland biodiversity because areas suitable for forestry coincide with those supporting the greatest richness of endemic and threatened biota. To comply with international forestry standards, commercial timber growers leave ""ecological networks"" of interconnected open corridors within plantations: however, the value of these networks for conservation is unclear. This study investigated how bird community composition, richness and density were influenced by habitat extent, connectivity and quality in a grassland ecological network in a forestry plantation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed birds and measured local vegetation characteristics throughout the network. There were at least five open habitat types within the network and bird communities responded clearly to differences between these habitats: all network communities showed a distinct shift away from those typical of control grasslands.

The flora of these habitat islands comprises 346 vascular plant species including 82 exotic species and 52 species that are nationally rare, regionally rare, or regional endemics. Both Multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination analysis and TWINSPAN results illustrated the high compositional and environmental heterogeneity across the outcrops. MDS revealed that primary environmental factors related to community composition comprise both regional-scale gradients of altitude and outcrop-scale gradients of slope steepness, soil pH, area available to plants, maximum vegetation height, and the percentage of the surrounding vegetation that is forest. Accordingly, TWINSPAN separated four outcrop communities that occur on steeper slopes, have less fertile soils and tend not to face north from three outcrop communities that have shallower slopes, more fertile soils and tend to face north. Types in the first group are more likely to be bordered by forest or taller shrublands, whereas those in the second group occur on outcrops primarily bordered by grasslands and support more exotic species. Within these broader groups, communities differ in their altitude and the size, soil depth and shading of the outcrops on which they occur.

The percentage of species on an outcrop face that are exotic is well modelled by site factors, with exotics increasing as the surrounding matrix becomes more disturbed, slopes become more gentle, the percentage of shade on the outcrop decreases, and soil fertility increases. In contrast, nearby disturbance has little influence on the percentage or number of species that are rare on an outcrop face; rather rare species richness is more strongly related to outcrop area and lack of shade, echoing patterns observed for rare outcrop species elsewhere in the world.

The size of farmland patch predicted the Occurrence of many species in spring and winter. including some that are declining in Europe (e.g. Lanius collurio, Passer montanus, Miliaria calandra, Alauda arvensis, etc.). In winter, bird abundance increased at low elevation areas and decreased with increasing distance from the main gateway for European migrants entering the Iberian Peninsula at the western Pyrenees. Conclusions: Results support the idea that easternmost farmlands are particularly important wintering grounds for European migrants and that the increasing deterioration or reduction of lowland farmland patches may affect bird populations. Because such negative effects are likely to increase in the near future, some general guidelines are suggested to apply the legal and budgetary resources of the European Union for better preserving farmland biodiversity in Northern Spain.",0.716310018,NA

In Switzerland, this is done by calculating the average nutrient (N) indicator value of the vegetation based on a country-wide systematic vegetation survey. However, it is questionable whether N values indicate eutrophication and resulting species loss equally well across an entire country, which includes wide topographic gradients and distinct biogeographic regions.

However, because of poor management serious degradation has occurred on these subalpine meadows. The aim of this paper is to present a quantitative analysis of effects of tourism disturbance and topography on the status and diversity of montane meadow communities and to provide direction for improved management. Sixty quadrats of 2 x 2 m(2) along 10 transects were set up to collect data on site characteristics and vegetation status.

We also compare the abundance of native and exotic species within specific morpho-functional groups and use this to determine the relative significance of T. repens as a community constituent, and to identify native species that would be most at risk by expanding populations of T. repens. We found that T. repens comprises a relatively small component of the total community cover and biomass, but is one of the most abundant herbaceous species in mesic Poa - dominated grasslands and Poa-Eucalyptus woodlands in the study area, and that T. repens abundance is correlated at the within-community scale primarily with soil moisture and fertility. At smaller scales T. repens is limited by the hierarchical dominance of native graminoids and we conclude that competition for inter-tussock space in mesic communities is the most likely mechanism by which expanding populations of T. repens would influence populations of associated native species. These results have significant implications for the manner in which future analysis and risk quantification stages of the risk assessment of virus-resistant T.repens and other transgenic pasture plants in complex plant communities are performed.",0.517535833,NA

We analyzed the genetic structure of the montane herb Geranium sylvaticum L. on a local scale in order to understand the effects of habitat fragmentation and potential GCC impacts on genetic diversity and differentiation. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting and cpDNA sequencing was performed for 295 individuals of 15 G. sylvaticum populations spanning the entire distribution range of the species in the Taunus mountain range in Germany. We found patterns of substantial genetic differentiation among populations using 150 polymorphic AFLP markers (mean F (ST) = 0.105), but no variation in 896 bp of plastid DNA sequences. While populations in the center of their local distribution range were genetically diverse and less differentiated, higher F (ST) values and reduced genetic variability was revealed for the populations at the low-altitudinal distribution margins. Projections of GCC effects on the distribution of G. sylvaticum in 2050 showed that GCC will likely lead to the extinction of most edge populations. To maintain regional genetic diversity, conservation efforts should focus on the diverse high-altitude populations, although a potential loss of unique variations in genetically differentiated peripheral populations could lower the overall genetic diversity and potentially the long-term viability in the study region.

Fourteen present-day associations of woody species are related to a gradient in elevation and climate, and to the degree of disturbance by fire and mammalian grazing since human settlement. A few closed-canopy forest remnants remain only in the montane zone, while more modified forest relicts are scattered across a wider range of environments. Remaining woody plant associations have originated as secondary successions following fire, and range from exotic-species-invaded lowland associations on semi-arid basin floors to prostrate, native-species-dominated associations on mountain tops.

"124","WOS:000313309800014",136,"Potthast, K; Hamer, U; Makeschin, F","APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY","In an Ecuadorian pasture soil the growth of Setaria sphacelata, but not of soil microorganisms, is co-limited by N and P","In the mountain rainforest region of southern Ecuador, soils of active pastures, established after slash- and-burn of the forest, are characterized by improved quantity and quality of soil organic matter favoring microbial conditions. However, these beneficial conditions decrease with increasing pasture age and burning frequency. As a consequence, rates of soil nutrient cycling decrease, supporting the infestation of bracken fern and, in turn, causing further decreases in pasture productivity. Finally, farmers are forced to abandon the degraded pastures and to establish new ones by continuous deforestation. To investigate whether an application of N and/or P nutrients to an extensively grazed pasture (active pasture) can improve grass productivity and maintain soil fertility, a pasture fertilization experiment was conducted. On an active pasture site, planted with Setaria sphacelata, moderate rates of urea (50 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)), rock phosphate (10 kg P ha(-1) a(-1)), and a combination of both were applied. It was examined whether soil mineralization (gross and net N mineralization, SOC mineralization) and microbial community structure (PLFA-analysis), as well as quantity and quality of the grass biomass, were affected by fertilization. Furthermore, the impact of fertilization on in situ soil respiration rates was studied. The combined application of urea and rock phosphate increased the pasture yield by 2 Mg ha(-1) a(-1) most efficiently, indicating a co-limitation of growth. Additionally, the fodder quality was improved by a 67% higher content of P and by a 7% higher content of Ca in the grass biomass compared to the control. While carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the microbial biomass remained unaffected and the microbial activity increased only temporarily, the relative abundance of fungi (18:2n6,9) increased significantly due to fertilizer addition. Urea addition induced a short-lived increase in the in situ soil CO2-C effluxes, assuming a positive priming effect due to an activation of soil microbes. In total, plots amended with urea emitted 0.8 Mg CO2-C ha-(1) a(-1) more than the control. Results reveal that already moderate fertilization significantly improved pasture productivity and maintained soil quality.

Maintaining native species and characteristic processes requires this successional diversity, but methods to achieve it are poorly explained in the literature. In the Inland Pacific US, large, old, early seral trees were a key historical feature of many young and old forest successional patches, especially where fires frequently occurred. Large, old trees are naturally fire-tolerant, but today are often threatened by dense understory cohorts that create fuel ladders that alter likely post-fire successional pathways. Reducing these understories can contribute to resistance by creating conditions where canopy trees will survive disturbances and climatic stressors; these survivors are important seed sources, soil protectors, and critical habitat elements. Historical timber harvesting has skewed tree size and age class distributions, created hard edges, and altered native patch sizes. Manipulating these altered forests to promote development of larger patches of older, larger, and more widely-spaced trees with diverse understories will increase landscape resistance to severe fires, and enhance wildlife habitat for underrepresented conditions. Closed-canopy, multi-layered patches that develop in hot, dry summer environments are vulnerable to droughts, and they increase landscape vulnerability to insect outbreaks and severe wildfires. These same patches provide habitat for species such as the northern spotted owl, which has benefited from increased habitat area. Regional and local planning will be critical for gauging risks, evaluating trade-offs, and restoring dynamics that can support these and other species. The goal will be to manage for heterogeneous landscapes that include variably-sized patches of (1) young, middle-aged, and old, closed canopy forests growing in upper montane, northerly aspect, and valley bottom settings, (2) a similar diversity of open-canopy, fire-tolerant patches growing on ridgetops, southerly aspects, and lower montane settings, and (3) significant montane chaparral and grassland areas. Tools to achieve this goal include managed wildfire, prescribed burning, and variable density thinning at small to large scales. Specifics on ""how much and where?"" will vary according to physiographic, topographic and historical templates, and regulatory requirements, and be determined by means of a socio-ecological process.

In the tropical Andes, which are one of the most diverse and threatened of all biodiversity hotspots, many plant and animal species have already started to shift their distributions to higher elevations in response to warming. However, a variety of biotic and abiotic factors may stabilize Andean timberlines and halt further upslope migrations into the high elevation grasslands (referred to as ""puna"" in southern Peru) above the forest. One possibility is that small forest patches that occur above-timberline throughout the Andes may facilitate forest expansion into newly suitable areas in the puna, yet little is known about the ecology or function of these patches. In this study, we examined seedling recruitment patterns, seed dispersal, and microclimate at the timberline, in and around above-timberline forest patches, and in the puna. The above-timberline forest patches had similar patterns of seed dispersal as the timberline but overal <1% of captured seeds were dispersed 10 m into the puna. At both the patch edges and the forest timberline, seedling abundances were lower in the puna relative to the adjacent forest and forest-puna ecotone. This reduction may be a result of reduced seed dispersal across the forest-puna ecotone and/or decreased germination of dispersed seeds due to the harsh microclimatic conditions occurring in the puna (daily temperature fluctuations are greatly elevated in the puna relative to the forest and frost events are more frequent and severe). While increasing temperatures associated with climate change may ameliorate some of the severe climatic conditions occurring in the puna, it will not directly affect other potential recruitment limitations such as reduced seed dispersal, high levels of UV radiation, and anthropogenic activities (cattle grazing and fires) in the puna. With the reduction of anthropogenic activities, above-timberline forest patches may serve as nucleating foci for future forest expansion into the puna. However, our results indicate that any upslope migration of the timberline into the puna will likely occur at a rate that is slower than what is required to keep pace with warming because recruitment is restricted to a narrow strip along the forest-puna borders.

We compiled publications of research conducted in this habitat from scientific databases and the grey literature to examine trends in publication. For a quantitative summary, all publications were classified according to the taxa of research and the broad topic of research. We identified 279 publications from 1964 and found an almost threefold increase in the number of publications and diversity of research topics studied over the last decade. Studies on flora, birds and mammals have been numerous (62% of the studies examined), but certain taxa like fish (1%) have been ignored.

Today South Africa has a strong insect conservation research record, with significant contributions from both professional and amateur entomologists. This activity has in a number of instances led to insect conservation management actions. As in many other parts of the world, threats to arthropod diversity include rapid rates of land transformation in the form of, for example, overgrazing, soil erosion, urbanization, deforestation, the expansion of exotic plantations and invasive species.

In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence, herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks. For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20 m into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival. These experiments identified that the early-successional species Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and tree patches within established grasslands.

","Molecular phylogenetics, species diversity, and biogeography of the Andean lizards of the genus Proctoporus (Squamata: Gymnophthalmidae) The family Gymnophthalmidae comprises ca. 220 described species of Neotropical lizards distributed from southern Mexico to Argentina. It includes 36 genera, among them Proctoporus, which contains six currently recognized species occurring across the yungas forests and wet montane grasslands of the Amazonian versant of the Andes from central Peru to central Bolivia. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships and species limits of Proctoporus and closely related taxa by analyzing 2121 base pairs of mitochondrial (12S, 16S, and ND4) and nuclear (c-mos) genes.

Bacterial diversity was typically highest in the top 10 cm of the profile; diversity typically dropped by 20-40% from the surface horizons to the deepest horizons sampled. Community composition was significantly affected by soil depth in all profiles, driven primarily by a decline in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes with depth and the peak in the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia between 10 and 50 cm.

There are extensive savanna woodlands and grasslands and montane forests on the highlands, which support unique biota. A review was carried out to establish the Orchid species diversity in Kenya and their current use for human well being. A survey was also carried out to explore potential species for cut-flower production, opportunities for such species and challenges encountered in orchid cultivation. The review revealed that among the trees, shrubs and grasslands, Kenya is the home of 283 species of orchids belonging to 50 genera, half of which are epiphytic and half terrestrial. Of these species, 280 are preserved at the Museums of Kenya. A few face extinction due to climate change and wanton destruction of their natural habitat. The survey revealed that most are grown as hobby plants. Their benefits for human well being include aesthetic, architectural, utility and economic benefits. Some including Ansellia africana, Angraecum eburneum, Calanthea sylvatica and Eulophia horsfalii have potential for cut-flower production.

Using autocorrelation analysis, we show that there is a strong periodicity (with period of 8-9years) of legume and grass biomass and nitrogen content in the grass biomass. These three variables are in fairly stable phase shifts relative to each other, with a grass peak followed by a peak in C:N ratio in grasses which is followed by a legume peak. Phosphorus content in either legume or grass biomass does not show synchronous cycling with legume or grass biomass or nitrogen content in grass. 4. Fitting a dynamic linear model to the data showed that legumes affect nitrogen content in grasses, and grass biomass both affects and is affected by nitrogen content. In contrast, there is no negative effect of grasses on legumes, indicating some other process must be responsible for the legume decline. Manuring, which was occasionally applied to the plots, also does not seem to affect the cycling. Second-order term for legumes showed some evidence of self-inhibitory effects in legumes, but phosphorus content in legumes shows no support for phosphorus limitation. The most likely explanation of the legume decline should be sought elsewhere (pathogens, soil biota etc.). 5. Synthesis. Long-term data support the existing the claim that legume dynamics are the key driver of nitrogen dynamics in nutrient-poor semi-natural grasslands. Grasses benefit from the nutrient enrichment due to legume cycling, but are a passive element and do not play a role in legume limitation. Apart from the role of nutrient cycling, these legume-driven nutrient dynamics also constitutes processes by which long-term richness of meadows is maintained.",0.307903388,NA

Increases in meadow aridity due to livestock use has been proposed as the primary factor facilitating sagebrush dominance in these areas. However, our data suggest that sagebrush can readily expand into moist meadow areas where the water table is shallow. We explored how the relative importance of local processes influencing seedling establishment vary with changes in site aridity. We quantified patterns of sagebrush abundance in relation to water table depth and surface soil moisture and sagebrush seedling occurrence relative to distance from reproductive sagebrush plants and the presence of gopher disturbance. We tested the independent and interactive effects of vegetation clipping and surface soil disturbances on sagebrush germination, survival, and growth using experiments established in four vegetation types that differed in water table depth, surface soil moisture, and herbaceous species cover. Experiments were conducted over two growing seasons that differed in water availability. Our results suggest that small <1 m(2)) soil disturbances promote the germination and growth of sagebrush seedlings in intact, ungrazed, moist, herbaceous meadow areas. In the absence of disturbance, dense herbs, whether clipped or not, prevented germination. The effects of disturbance were strongest in sites with moist surface soil that support a dense herbaceous canopy and were less important in sites with lower surface-soil moisture, where seedling establishment rates were low despite abundant exposed soil. The spatial distribution of sagebrush seedlings is consistent with these experimental results. Sagebrush seedling density decreased dramatically with distance from reproductive shrubs. and seedlings were almost always preferentially associated with gopher mounds in moist herbaceous areas. Clipping above-ground biomass of herbs on a relatively small scale (4 m(2)) had no effect on sagebrush germination or early seedling growth; however, the growth and survival of larger transplanted seedlings was enhanced by clipping.

Because shrubland ecosystems have been greatly reduced from their original extent in western North America and fire is increasingly being used to manage these landscapes, a better understanding of how fire affects the associated vegetation and wildlife is imperative. We evaluated the response of Green-tailed Towhees (Pipilo chlorurus) to prescribed fire in the montane shrublands of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado during 2002 and 2003. Three to five years following prescribed burning, Green-tailed Towhee density and shrub cover were generally higher in unburned areas. Nests (n = 179) were located in unburned vegetation; within burned sites, all nests were in remnant patches. Green-tailed Towhee nest survival was 57% (95% Cl = 49%-65%) across the two years of the study.

Fine sediment release had marked ecological effects, but these were detectable only at patch-to-patch scales. We suggest that investigation of localized sediment release in streams will benefit from scale-dependent or scale-specific sampling, and some effects could go undetected unless sample resolution is selected carefully.",0.388036359,NA

The Kinangop Plateau is an area of montane grassland east of the Rift Valley, used primarily for dairy farming since human settlement in 1964. However, dairy farming (which retains grassland as pasture) has given way to other forms of land-use, especially cultivation of crops. In March 1996, a questionnaire was administered to 50 landowners to investigate community attitudes towards birds and their conservation, the extent of present land-use changes and likely future land-use patterns, The mean acreage of landholding was decreasing, and more grassland was rapidly being converted into cultivated land, with 3.2% being ploughed up during the six months from November 1995 to May 1996. Farmers expressed a preference for crop farming (66%) over livestock farming (26%) or other land uses. Thirty-two per cent expressed a positive attitude, and 60% were indifferent, towards birds. Most (76%) were not aware of biodiversity values or conservation. Though 64% were aware of declining bird populations around them, 82% of this group did not realize that their activities might be contributing to this decline. Sixty-eight per cent of landowners planned to convert all or part of their grassland holdings.

We suggest a variety of actions that might help to secure the future of Sharpe's Longclaw while promoting sustainable agricultural development on Kinangop, and propose several topics where further research is needed.

With 1.9% floristic endemism, the GWA could marginally qualify as a new centre of floristic endemism(complimentary to the adjacent Sneeuberg Centre), but formal recognition as a discrete Centre should await comprehensive floristic comparison with the adjacent, poorly studied Stormberg. Due to restricted distributions and pressure from commercial forestry, almost half of the 35 endemics have conservation listings as Rare or stronger, with one Presumed Extinct and three Endangered. Five endemics are still only known from their type specimens. Intensive fieldwork and accurate collation of available data is thus shown as essential for accurate biodiversity assessment and conservation planning in South Africa's montane regions.

These effects are particularly distinct upon conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems due to very fast carbon (C) and nutrient cycles and high vulnerability, especially in the tropics. The objective of this study was to use the unique advantage of Mt. Kilimanjaro - altitudinal gradient leading to different tropical ecosystems but developed all on the same soil parent material - to investigate the effects of land-use change and elevation on MBC and WOC contents during a transition phase from dry to wet season. Down to a soil depth of 50 cm, we compared MBC and WOC contents of 2 natural (Ocotea and Podocarpus forest), 3 seminatural (lower montane forest, grassland, savannah), I sustainably used (homegarden) and 2 intensively used (maize field, coffee plantation) ecosystems on an elevation gradient from 950 to 2850m a.s.l. Independent of land-use, both MBC and WOC strongly increased with elevation on Mt. Kilimanjaro corresponding to ecosystem productivity and biodiversity. Through the agricultural use of ecosystems MBC and WOC contents decreased - especially in surface layers - on average by 765 mg kg(-1) for MBC and 916 mg kg(-1) for WOC, compared to the respective natural ecosystems. The decrease with depth was highest for forests > grasslands > agroecosystems and also was positively correlated with elevation. We conclude that MBC and WOC contents in soils of Mt. Kilimanjaro ecosystems are highly sensitive to land-use changes, especially in topsoil. The MBC and WOC contents were considerably reduced even in sustainable agricultural systems. Since MBC and WOC are very fast reacting and sensitive C pools, we expect a decrease in other soil C pools accompanied by a strong decrease in fertility and productivity due to changes in land use from natural to agricultural ecosystems.

Muhavura representing the last ca. 2400 years BR. Ten plant species from the Alpine belt were also analysed for their main phytolith morphotypes. Phytoliths from the sediments were grouped into 12 main categories and the most frequently occurring individual morphotypes were bilobate (33%), oblong (16%), elongate (17%) and globular psilate (13%). The phytolith assemblage consists predominantly of phytoliths characteristic of grasses (70%).
