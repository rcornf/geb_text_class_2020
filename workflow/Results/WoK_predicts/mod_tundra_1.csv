A major feature of the ecological footprint of oil and gas exploration is seismic lines-narrow corridors used to transport and deploy geophysical survey equipment.

The number of reindeer had considerably declined from the 1980s to the 1990s and we followed the recovery of vegetation. The comparisons between 1990 and 1999/2001 were made at seven sites differing in their original grazing pressure. Results: At the initially heavily grazed sites, lichen abundances increased, but at the lightly grazed sites the abundances of lichens decreased. Graminoids declined at all sites, but the change seemed to be greatest at the most heavily grazed sites. Forbs increased slightly across all sites. At the species level, lichens and graminoids responded most notably to the reduction of grazing pressure. Individual species responses in shrubs were variable and among forbs, typical species of species-rich Dryas heaths increased.

However, little is known of the effect of herbivores on plant colonisation following disturbance, and on its variability depending on the identity of herbivores and the characteristics of the habitats. To quantify the role of large and small vertebrate herbivores, we established exclosures of two different mesh sizes around disturbed subplots in forest and nearby tundra habitats in four contrasting locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and Norway. The study revealed that herbivores influenced the abundance but not the species composition of regenerating vegetation. Gaps were colonised by the dominant species in the surrounding vegetation. The only exception to this expectation was Empetrum nigrum, which failed to colonise gaps even though it dominated undisturbed vegetation. Significant effects of herbivory were only detected when both small and large herbivores were excluded. Herbivores decreased the abundance of three of the most common species Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis idaea, and Deschampsia flexuosa.

The main objective was to identify processes that influence diversity at different spatial scales with a particular focus on grazing. In a global perspective the species pool of the Scandinavian mountains is limited, partly reflecting the general latitudinal decline of species but also historical and ecological factors operating after the latest glaciation. At the local scale, both productivity and disturbance are primary factors structuring diversity, but abiotic factors such as soil pH, snow distribution and temperature are also important. Although evidence is scarce, grazing favours local species richness in productive habitats, whereas species richness decreases with grazing when productivity is low. Regional patterns of plant diversity is set by, 1) the species pool, 2) the heterogeneity and fragmentation of communities, and 3) local diversity of each plant community. We suggest that local shifts in community composition depend both on the local grazing frequency and the return-time of the plant community after a grazing session. In addition, an increasing number of grazing-modified local patches homogenises the vegetation and is likely to reduce the regional plant diversity. The time scale of local shifts in community composition depends on plant colonisation and persistence, From a mechanistic point of view, diversity patterns at a regional scale also depend on the regional dynamics of single species.

Heavy reindeer grazing may reduce plant allocation to reproduction and removes significant proportions of flowers and seeds, thus reducing contributions to seed bank. In contrast, foraging and trampling may break up existing mature plants, increasing the vegetative propagules in the soil. To determine the effect of grazing on colonization potential in the High Arctic, two studies were carried out: (i) a comparison of seed bank inside and outside three long-term reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhnchus (Vrolic)) exclosures and (ii) an investigation of the germinable seed and propagule bank of two neighbouring peninsulas with contrasting reindeer grazing history in north-western Svalbard (79 degrees N, 12 degrees E).

Heavily grazed samples showed less species numbers and coverage percentage of vegetation. The number of graminoid species was found to be highest in areas of high grazing pressure. We concluded that alpha-diversity was controlled by growing season, snow cover, pH, soil moisture, disturbance, temperature, and precipitation, stressing the importance of multi-factorial approaches in diversity studies. Determinants of P-diversity were predominantly local environmental conditions, whereas regional conditions were less important.",0.681770148,NA

We compared litter decomposition in two common and compositionally distinct tundra vegetation types in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaska: moist acidic tundra (soil pH 3-4), which occurs primarily on older landscapes, and moist non-acidic tundra (soil pH 6-7), which occurs primarily on landscapes with a more recent history of glaciation and has higher graminoid and forb abundance and lower woody shrub abundance than acidic tundra. To separate the influence of plant community composition from that of the soil environment, we decomposed the same nine substrates at a moist acidic and a moist non-acidic site located less than 2 km apart. Substrates included leaf litter of the dominant species in each growth form (graminoid, deciduous shrub, evergreen shrub, forb, moss) as well as woody stems of the deciduous shrub Betula nana. Then, we estimated above-ground community-level decomposition by weighting the decay rate of each species in the community by its proportional contribution to overall above-ground net primary production (ANPP). In contrast to our expectations, community-level decomposition rates estimated using the site-average decay rate for each substrate were similar between the two sites, likely because growth forms differed little in their leaf litter decay. By contrast, when site-specific decay rates were used to estimate community-level decomposition, it was nearly twice as fast at the older, moist acidic tundra site because most substrates decayed faster at that site, indicating a more favorable environment for decomposition in acidic tundra. Site differences in soil moisture and temperature could not explain site differences in decomposition. However, higher soil N availability at the moist acidic tundra may have contributed to faster decomposition since, in a separate experiment, fertilization with N stimulated decomposition of a common substrate at both sites. In addition, lower pH in acidic tundra may promote greater abundance of soil fungi, perhaps explaining faster decomposition rates at that site. In summary, the large differences in plant species composition between moist acidic and non-acidic tundra are likely to not contribute to site differences in decomposition.

The changes in plant abundance and chemistry might have cascading effects on tundra food webs, but an integrated understanding of how the responses vary between habitats and across environmental gradients is lacking. We assessed responses in plant abundance and plant chemistry to warmer climate, both at species and community levels, in two different habitats. We used a long-term and multisite warming (OTC) experiment in the Scandinavian forest-tundra ecotone to investigate (i) changes in plant community composition and (ii) responses in foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon-based secondary compound concentrations in two dominant evergreen dwarf-shrubs (Empetrum hermaphroditum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and two deciduous shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus and Betula nana). We found that initial plant community composition, and the functional traits of these plants, will determine the responsiveness of the community composition, and thus community traits, to experimental warming. Although changes in plant chemistry within species were minor, alterations in plant community composition drive changes in community-level nutrient concentrations. In view of projected climate change, our results suggest that plant abundance will increase in the future, but nutrient concentrations in the tundra field layer vegetation will decrease.

However, most of these studies have been conducted aboveground. Although they deliver key ecosystem functions and services, the elevational diversity and biomass patterns of soil invertebrates, including a wide range of taxa, have been severely understudied, especially at treeline. To address this critical gap, we identified richness, abundance, and biomass patterns of soil invertebrates across an elevational gradient under below-treeline forest (from 1020 to 1770 asl) and above-treeline meadow (from 1790 to 2280 asl), respectively. We aimed to (1) identify the elevational patterns of richness, abundance, and biomass in soil invertebrates across the treeline; and (2) test whether these patterns break and the underlying mechanisms shift at the treeline. We found that both the diversity and biomass of litter-dwelling invertebrates showed hump-shaped patterns below the treeline and monotonically decreasing patterns above the treeline, respectively. Richness association of litter-dwelling invertebrates and herbaceous plants shifted from negative to positive at the treeline. For the soil-dwelling invertebrates, no elevational trends were detected in forest while the diversity decreased monotonically with elevation in meadow. In contrast to basal area and litter thickness in forest, temperature was most strongly related to the diversity of litter-dwelling invertebrates in meadow.

These changes have been predicted to cause afforestation or shrubification of open tundra, increases of warmth-demanding southern species and plant groups favoured by increased moisture, and decline of species and habitats that are dependent on snow cover. In this study, we explore temporal changes in northern tundra upland plant communities along regional gradients and in local habitats. We ask how vegetation changes are linked with long-term trends in regional climate and grazing pressure. LocationNorthern Europe. MethodsIn 2013-2014, we resurveyed a total of 108 vegetation plots on wind-exposed and snow-protected tundra habitats in three subareas along a bioclimatic gradient from the northern boreal to the arctic zone. Vegetation plots were originally sampled in 1964-1967. We related observed vegetation changes to changes in temperature, precipitation and grazing pressure, which all showed regionally variable increases over the study period. ResultsWe found a significant increase of the evergreen dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum subsp. hermaphroditum in snow-protected communities and a prominent decrease of lichens throughout the study area. No evidence for extensive tree or larger shrub (Betula spp., Salix spp. or Juniperus communis) encroachment despite climatic warming trends was found. Among studied communities, most pronounced changes in vegetation were observed in snow-protected boreal heaths on small isolated uplands, where community composition showed low resemblance to the original composition described decades ago. Changes in plant communities correlated with changes in summer and winter temperatures, summer precipitation and reindeer grazing pressure, yet correlations varied depending on region and habitat. ConclusionsNorthern tundra uplands vary in their resistance to on-going climate change and reindeer grazing. Isolated treeless heaths of boreal forest-tundra ecotone appear least resistant to climate change and have already shifted towards new community states.",0.610214566,NA

A systematic review","Background: The reindeer (or caribou, Rangifer tarandus L.) has a natural range extending over much of Eurasia's and North America's arctic, alpine and boreal zones, yet its impact on vegetation is still unclear. This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms. Methods: Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Results: Our searches identified more than 6,000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia.

However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. Conclusions: We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, there is a lack of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions.

The study reveals that voles and lemmings have larger effects on the vegetation than reindeer in both habitats in all four locations, even though densities of reindeer differ between locations and only two locations experienced lemming peaks during the period of the experiment. The relative abundance of five of the fifteen most common species was significantly influenced by voles and lemmings whereas only a single species was significantly influenced by reindeer. Different analyses give contrasting results on the importance of herbivory in forest versus open heathlands. A principal component analyses revealed that herbivory influenced the vegetation more in open heathlands than in forests. However, an importance index of herbivores did not differ between forest and open heathlands. Moreover, none of the plant species responded differently in the two habitats, when herbivores were removed. Our results suggest that intense and localised selective foraging by small mammals may have a more marked effect on vegetation than transient feeding by reindeer.",0.747076989,NA

The model fitted to woodland communities accounted for 95% of the variation in seed density. The heathland model was less predictive but still explained 52% of the variation in seed bank size. In mire communities there was no relationship, collective or individual, between buried seed density and the measured environmental variables, possibly due to variations in the duration and frequency of waterlogging at these sites. The potential role of seed banks for initiating the recolonisation of disturbed ground is discussed. Densities of buried seeds at most Calluna-dominant sites were probably sufficient to generate successful recolonisation but the prospects for recovery were poor at other sites, particularly in graminaceous communities at 800 m or higher.",0.57503442,NA

Our results suggest that evergreen shrubs may benefit from increased grazing intensity due to their low palatability, yet a growth rate sensitivity analysis suggests that changes in nutrient uptake rates may result in different shrub responses to grazing pressure. Heavy grazing caused plant communities to shift from shrub tundra toward moss, graminoid-dominated tundra in subzones C and D when evergreen shrub growth rates were decreased in the model. The response of moss, lichen and forbs to warming varied across the different subzones.

Our results suggest that evergreen shrubs may benefit from increased grazing intensity due to their low palatability, yet a growth rate sensitivity analysis suggests that changes in nutrient uptake rates may result in different shrub responses to grazing pressure. Heavy grazing caused plant communities to shift from shrub tundra toward moss, graminoid-dominated tundra in subzones C and D when evergreen shrub growth rates were decreased in the model. The response of moss, lichen and forbs to warming varied across the different subzones. Initial vegetation responses to climate change during transient warming are different from the long term equilibrium responses due to shifts in the controlling mechanisms (nutrient limitation versus competition) within tundra plant communities.","Modeling dynamics of tundra plant communities on the Yamal Peninsula, Russia, in response to climate change and grazing pressure Understanding the responses of the arctic tundra biome to a changing climate requires knowledge of the complex interactions among the climate, soils and biological system. This study investigates the individual and interaction effects of climate change and reindeer grazing across a variety of climate zones and soil texture types on tundra vegetation community dynamics using an arctic vegetation model that incorporates the reindeer diet, where grazing is a function of both foliar nitrogen concentration and reindeer forage preference. We found that grazing is important, in addition to the latitudinal climate gradient, in controlling tundra plant community composition, explaining about 13% of the total variance in model simulations for all arctic tundra subzones.

We explored differences in the natural delta N-15 signatures in plant, microbial and soil N pools, and examined mycorrhizal colonization in two tundra sites that have been either lightly or heavily grazed by reindeer for more than 50 years. The study examined changes in nutrient acquisition in five common tundra plants with contrasting traits and mycorrhiza status; the mycorrhizal dwarf shrubs, Betula nana, Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum hermaphroditum; a mycorrhizal grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, and a non-mycorrhizal sedge, Carex bigelowii. 3. There were large variations in delta N-15 among coexisting plant species in the lightly grazed sites. This variation was dramatically reduced in the heavily grazed sites. At an individual species level, delta N-15 was higher in E. hermaphroditum and lower in C. bigelowii in the heavily grazed sites. Mycorrhizal colonization in B. nana and E. hermaphroditum roots were also lower in the heavily grazed sites. The delta N-15 signatures of the total soil N pool and of the microbial N pools were higher in the heavily grazed sites. 4. Since the strong delta N-15 differentiation among plant species has been interpreted as a result of plants with different mycorrhizal types using different sources of soil nitrogen, we suggest that the lower variation in delta N-15 in heavily grazed sites indicates a lower niche differentiation in nitrogen uptake among plants. Reduced mycorrhizamediated nitrogen uptake by some of the species, a shift towards a more mineral nutrition due to higher nutrient turnover, and uptake of labile nitrogen from dung and urine in the heavily grazed sites could all contribute to the changes in plant delta N-15. 5. We conclude that herbivores have the potential to influence plant nutrient uptake and provide the first data suggesting that herbivores decrease nutrient partitioning on the basis of chemical N forms among plant species.

On the other hand, mammalian grazers form an important biotic factor influencing resource coupling between plants and soil microorganisms. To investigate individual effects and interactions among soil nutrients, pH, and grazing on tundra soils, we performed factorial treatments of fertilization, liming, and grazer exclusion in the field for 3 years at 2 contrasting tundra habitats, acidic (N-poor) and non-acidic (N-rich) tundra heaths. The effects of all treatments were small in the non-acidic tundra heaths. In the acidic tundra heaths, fertilization decreased the fungal: bacterial ratio as analyzed by soil PLFAs, but there were no effects of liming.

We define ecotone structure as the spatial distribution of trees of different size classes and growth-forms and the relationship between these aspects and the spatial distribution of understory vegetation and substrate. The studied ecotones are dominated by Pinus uncinata Ram. and have been little affected by anthropogenic disturbances (logging, grazing) during this century. One rectangular plot (30 x 140 m) was located within each site with its longest side parallel to the slope and encompassing treeline and timberline. The distribution of size and growth-form classes at site O followed a clear sequence of increasing size downslope from shrubby multistemmed krummholz individuals to bigger arborescent trees. At site O, regeneration was concentrated near the krummholz area and over rocky substrates. This suggests that krummholz may modify microenvironment conditions and increase seedling survival. At site T, regeneration was abundant above the treeline where the cover of the dominant understory shrub (Rhododendron ferrugineum) decreased. In both ecotones the diversity of plants was higher above the treeline than in the forest and decreased going downslope coinciding with the increase of P. uncinata cover.

Large herbivores can control plant community composition and, under certain conditions, even induce vegetation shifts to alternative ecosystem states. As different plant assemblages maintain contrasting carbon (C) cycling patterns, herbivores have the potential to alter C sequestration at regional scales. Their influence is of particular interest in the Arctic tundra, where a large share of the world's soil C reservoir is stored. 2. We assessed the influence of grazing mammals on tundra vegetation and C stocks by resampling two sites located along pasture rotation fences in northern Norway. These fences have separated lightly grazed areas from heavily grazed areas (in close proximity to the fences) and moderately grazed areas (further away from the fences) for the past 50years. Fourteen years earlier, the lightly and moderately grazed areas were dominated by dwarf shrubs, whereas heavy grazing had promoted the establishment of graminoid-dominated vegetation. Since then, both reindeer densities and temperatures have increased, and more time has passed for transient dynamics to be expressed. We expected that the vegetation and C stocks would have changed under all grazing intensities, but not necessarily in the same way. 3.

Two outbreaks of geometrid moths occurred during the study period, with contrasting effects on the field layer: one in 2004 had marginal effects, while one in 2012 severely reduced biomass in the control plots and eliminated biomass that had accumulated over 15 years in the exclosures. The latter was followed by a dramatic decline of the dominant understory dwarf-shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum, driven by an interaction between moth herbivory on top buds and leaves, and increased disease severity of a pathogenic fungus. We show that the climate has important direct and indirect effects on all these biotic interactions. We conclude that long time series are essential to identify key biotic interactions in ecosystems, since their importance will be influenced by climatic conditions, and that manipulative treatments are needed in order to obtain the mechanistic understanding needed for robust predictions of future ecosystem changes and their feedback effects.",0.422354644,NA

We recommend use of our successional metric for lichen communities throughout the arctic tundra to infer successional status of an area.","Defining a successional metric for lichen communities in the arctic tundra We provide an index of successional status for arctic macrolichen communities based on a synthesis of literature reports. We amassed research from the past 50 years that studied lichen communities following disturbance, such as fire or grazing. Species scores were derived from these reports depending on when a particular macrolichen species appeared following disturbance. Weighted averaging of these data with a community matrix can create a successional score for each sample unit of interest. These scores can be used as a surrogate for community age estimates that are otherwise difficult to obtain from tundra environments above treeline. We test this approach using an example data set of macrolichen communities collected from the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Alaska.

Our findings suggest that plant species which acquire their N close to the soil surface (e.g. mosses) access more of the N from faeces than species with deeper root systems (e.g. grasses) suggesting a transfer of N from the preferred forage species to the mosses and dwarf shrubs, which are less preferred by the geese. In conclusion, the moss layer appears to disrupt the nitrogen return from herbivores to their forage species.","Nitrogen transfer between herbivores and their forage species Herbivores may increase the productivity of forage plants; however, this depends on the return of nutrients from faeces to the forage plants. The aim of this study was to test if nitrogen (N) from faeces is available to forage plants and whether the return of nutrients differs between plant species using (15)N natural abundance in faeces and plant tissue. To investigate the effect of grazing on N transfer, we carried out a grazing experiment in wet and mesic tundra on high Arctic Spitsbergen using barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) as the model herbivore. N inputs (from faeces) increased with grazing pressure at both the wet and mesic sites, with the greatest N input from faeces at the wet site. The delta(15)N ratio in plant tissue from grazed plots was enriched in mosses and the dwarf shrub species, reflecting the delta(15)N signature of faeces-derived N, but no such pattern was observed in the dominant grasses.

Plant fitness and growth will be determined by how plants interact with each other at smaller scales. Local-scale neighbourhood interactions may be altered by environmental pertubations, which could fundamentally affect community structure. This study examined the effects of seven years of experimental warming and nutrient addition on overall changes in the community structure and patterns of interspecific interaction between neighbouring plant species in two contrasting alpine plant communities, mesic meadow and poor heath, in subarctic Sweden. We used a network approach to quantify the dissimilarity of plant interaction networks and the average number of interspecific neighbourhood interactions over time in response to different environmental perturbations. The results revealed that combined warming and nutrient addition had significant negative effects on how dissimilar plant interaction networks were over time compared with the control. Moreover, plant-plant neighbourhood interaction networks were more dissimilar over time in nutrient-poor heath than in nutrient-rich mesic meadow. In addition, nutrient addition alone and combined nutrient addition and warming significantly affected neighbourhood species interactions in both plant communities.

ConclusionsOur results show that graminoids and shrubs in the Arctic differ in their N uptake strategies, with graminoids profiting from nutrients released at the thaw front, while shrubs mainly forage in upper soil layers. Our results suggest that tundra vegetation will become graminoid-dominated as permafrost thaw progresses and nutrient availability increases in the deep soil.",0.396441488,NA

Some relations between fungi and their environment in tundra regions. In: Holding, A.J., Heal, O.W., MacLean Jr., S.F., Flanagan, P.W. (Eds.), Soil Organisms and Decomposition in Tundra. Tundra Biome Steering Committee, Stockholm, Sweden, pp. 123-150], probably because of selectivity in isolation methods. In the few molecular studies carried out in Arctic and Antarctic soils to date, basidiomycetes, particularly yeasts, have been found. These techniques should give better estimates of the order of magnitude of fungal species richness in Arctic and Antarctic soils, although caution should be used concerning primer choice and amplification conditions. From collections in Arctic regions, species of basidiomycetes appear to be circumpolar in distribution with restricted endemism.

Plant N found in new biomass, indicative of plant N assimilation, was significantly higher in moderately and heavily grazed areas than in lightly grazed areas, which corresponded to a decreased amount of N in old plant parts. The amount of N found in plant litter or organic soil layer did not differ between the grazing treatments. Together with soil N concentrations and litter decomposition rates, soil temperatures were significantly higher in moderately and heavily grazed areas. We conclude that the changes in soil temperature are important for the litter decomposition rate and thus on the nutrient availability for plant uptake. However, the changes in plant community composition appear to be more important for the altered N pools and thus the enhanced primary production. The results provide some support for the keystone herbivore hypothesis, which states that intensive grazing can promote a transition from moss-rich tundra heath to productive grasslands.

The change in genotype density in the warmed plots was associated with an increase in PCR amplification efficiency, suggesting that increased C allocation belowground is increasing the overall biomass of the fungal community.",0.512828025,NA

We found that fire increased establishment of shrub seedlings by as much as 33-fold. Experimental warming also doubled growth rates of tall shrub seedlings and could potentially increase their survival. By contrast, warming had no effect on shrub recruitment, postfire tussock regeneration, or how tussock grass affected shrub seedling growth and survival. These findings indicate that warming, coupled with more frequent or severe fires, will likely result in an increase in the cover and abundance of evergreen shrubs. Given that shrubs are one of the most flammable components in alpine and tundra environments, warming is likely to strengthen an existing feedback between woody species abundance and fire in these ecosystems.","Climatic warming strengthens a positive feedback between alpine shrubs and fire Climate change is expected to increase fire activity and woody plant encroachment in arctic and alpine landscapes.

Marine birds that forage at sea and breed on land can transport organic matter from the sea to land, and thus help to initiate and sustain terrestrial ecosystems. This organic matter initiates the emergence of local tundra communities, increasing primary and secondary production and species diversity. Climate change will influence ocean circulation and the hydrologic regime, which will consequently lead to a restructuring of zooplankton communities between cold arctic waters, with a dominance of large zooplankton species, and Atlantic waters in which small species predominate. The dominance of large zooplankton favours plankton-eating seabirds, such as the little auk (Alle alle), while the presence of small zooplankton redirects the food chain to plankton-eating fish, up through to fish-eating birds (e.g., guillemots Uria sp.). Thus, in regions where the two water masses compete for dominance, such as in the Barents Sea, plankton-eating birds should dominate the avifauna in cold periods and recess in warmer periods, when fish-eaters should prevail. Therefore under future anthropogenic climate scenarios, there could be serious consequences for the structure and functioning of the terrestrial part of arctic ecosystems, due in part to changes in the arctic marine avifauna. Large colonies of plankton-eating little auks are located on mild mountain slopes, usually a few kilometres from the shore, whereas colonies of fish-eating guillemots are situated on rocky cliffs at the coast. The impact of guillemots on the terrestrial ecosystems is therefore much smaller than for little auks because of the rapid washing-out to sea of the guano deposited on the seabird cliffs. These characteristics of seabird nesting sites dramatically limit the range of occurrence of ornithogenic soils, and the accompanying flora and fauna, to locations where talus-breeding species occur. As a result of climate warming favoring the increase of ichthyiofagous cliff-nesting seabirds, we can expect that large areas of ornithogenic tundra around the colonies of plankton-eating seabirds situated far from the sea may disappear, while areas of tundra in the vicinity of cliffs inhabited by fish-eating seabirds, with low total production and supporting few large herbivores, will likely increase, but only imperceptibly.

In the Alaskan tundra, microbes only ever appear to be N-limited in Eriophorum vaginatum-dominated tussock tundra, and that only during the summer growing season; during winter microbes continue to respire but show no evidence of N-limitation. What drives the shifts in microbial N-limitation and how are they developed by the metabolic pathways involved in processing available soil organic compounds? To answer these questions, we collected soils from tussock and shrub tundra during four seasons and incubated them with C-13-labeled glucose, glutamate, and protein; then we measured C-13 in CO2, microbial biomass, and specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). By analyzing C-13-PLFAs, we were able to assess whether different groups of microbes processed the substrates differently, and to assess changes in N-use brought on by the Arctic winter. Monomers were metabolized during both seasons. In tussock tundra, glutamate-C was assimilated into PLFAs more extensively in winter than summer, suggesting glutamate was used as a C-source during winter but as a N-source during summer. In shrub soils, the flow of C from glutamate to PLFAs tracked with glucose year-round suggesting that the communities were primarily using glutamate as a C source. These results parallel biogeochemical evidence showing shifts in N availability and limitation. Protein metabolism was negligible in winter in soils other than tussocks. In summer, protein was broken down and all communities incorporated C; however, fungi did not assimilate protein-C at all while Gram-positive bacteria appeared to be proteolytic specialists. The different patterns of metabolism of C vs. N containing compounds across microbial groups regulate the dynamics of both soil. communities and of soil carbon and nitrogen in tundra soils. As such, the flow of C-13 into different biomarker PLFAs provided a lens to evaluate the shifting dynamics of microbial communities and of the resource environment in which they find themselves.

Monomers were metabolized during both seasons. In tussock tundra, glutamate-C was assimilated into PLFAs more extensively in winter than summer, suggesting glutamate was used as a C-source during winter but as a N-source during summer. In shrub soils, the flow of C from glutamate to PLFAs tracked with glucose year-round suggesting that the communities were primarily using glutamate as a C source.

Microbial community responses were assessed over the course of a year at two depths (15-20 cm, 95-100 cm) by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), along with co-occurring changes in plant cover and edaphic properties. Bacterial richness, Shannon Weaver diversity, and composition in shallow soils (15-20 cm) as well as evenness in deep soils (95-100 cm) differed across irrigation treatments during July. Irrigation timing affected fungal community diversity and community composition during the dormant season and most strongly in deep soils (95-100 cm). Dormant-season irrigation increased the ratio of shrubs to forbs and reduced soil C in shallow soils by 16% relative to ambient conditions. It is unclear whether or not soil C will continue to decline with continued treatment application or if microbial adaptation could mitigate sustained soil C losses.

Global warming is predicted to change patterns in precipitation and plant species compositions, especially in arctic regions where the temperature increase will be most pronounced. These changes are potentially highly important for the BVOC emissions but studies investigating the effects are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality and quantity of BVOC emissions from a high arctic soil moisture gradient extending from dry tundra to a wet fen. Ecosystem BVOC emissions were sampled five times in the July-August period using a push-pull enclosure technique, and BVOCs trapped in absorbent cartridges were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Plant species compositions were estimated using the point intercept method. In order to take into account important underlying ecosystem processes, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem production were measured in connection with chamber-based BVOC measurements. Highest emissions of BVOCs were found from vegetation communities dominated by Salix arctica and Cassiope tetragon, which had emission profiles dominated by isoprene and monoterpenes, respectively. These results show that emissions of BVOCs are highly dependent on the plant cover supported by the varying soil moisture, suggesting that high arctic BVOC emissions may affect the climate differently if-soil water content and plant cover change.

The aim of this study was to investigate the quality and quantity of BVOC emissions from a high arctic soil moisture gradient extending from dry tundra to a wet fen. Ecosystem BVOC emissions were sampled five times in the July-August period using a push-pull enclosure technique, and BVOCs trapped in absorbent cartridges were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Plant species compositions were estimated using the point intercept method. In order to take into account important underlying ecosystem processes, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem production were measured in connection with chamber-based BVOC measurements. Highest emissions of BVOCs were found from vegetation communities dominated by Salix arctica and Cassiope tetragon, which had emission profiles dominated by isoprene and monoterpenes, respectively. These results show that emissions of BVOCs are highly dependent on the plant cover supported by the varying soil moisture, suggesting that high arctic BVOC emissions may affect the climate differently if-soil water content and plant cover change.

Carex subspathacea is a characteristic fen species in the absence of other Carex species dominating elsewhere in the Arctic. Arctic marshes are linked to an extremely cold environment. They have a very low species diversity with a few species dominating; Arctophila fulva, Pseudocalliergon trifarium, Scorpidium scorpioides and Warnstorfia tundrae are character species. Moss tundra as defined here appears to be restricted to Svalbard and, probably, neighbouring Novaya Zemlya. This may be due to the absence of rodents and the high seabird density, which is related to the mild sea currents reaching further to the north here and which implies manuring of surrounding ecosystems. Manuring in a very cold environment produces moss carpets with a thin active layer and accumulation of thick peat layers without a standing water level. In Sassendalen the role of arctic seabirds is replaced by Svalbard reindeer which are non-migratory and are concentrated to favourable grazing areas where their manuring effect is intense. Their long-term manuring effect probably explains the occurrence of moss tundras in this weakly rolling landscape where seabird colonies are absent.",0.529334612,NA

Predation did not alter habitat choice by Arctic rodents","In systems where predation plays a key role in the dynamics of prey populations, such as in Arctic rodents, it is reasonable to assume that differential patterns of habitat use by prey species represent adaptive responses to spatial variation in predation. However, habitat selection by collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown (Lemmus trimucronatus) lemmings depends on intra- and inter-specific densities, and there has been little agreement on the respective influences of food abundance, predators, and competition for habitat on lemming dynamics. Thus, we investigated whether predation affected selection of sedge-meadow versus upland tundra by collared lemmings in the central Canadian Arctic. We first controlled for the effects of competition on lemming habitat selection. We then searched for an additional signal of predation by comparing habitat selection patterns between 12 control plots and one large grid where lemmings were protected from predators by fencing in 1996 and 1997, but not during 5 subsequent years when we monitored habitat use in the grid as well as in the control plots. Dicrostonyx used upland preferentially over meadows and was more numerous in 1996 and 2011 than in other sample years. Lemmus was also more abundant in 1996 than in subsequent years, but its abundance was too low in the exclosure to assess whether exclusion of predators influenced its habitat selection.

Containing the greatest concentration of rare and endangered species in New York State, this similar to 12,000-year-old ecosystem is important to understanding the ecological history of northeastern North America. In order to monitor floristic and vegetational shifts over time, 11 permanent transects were established in 1984 on four summits (Wright, Algonquin, Boundary, and Iroquois) of the MacIntyre Range in the Adirondack High Peaks region. Using the point-intercept method, all 11 transects were sampled in 1984, 1994, 2002, and 2007. Vegetation composition changed significantly over the 23-year period, with an overall decrease in bryophytes/lichens and an increase in vascular plants, indicating that vascular plants were replacing bryophytes, particularly in areas not disturbed by hikers. Community similarity was high among all transects, and increased with time for vascular plants as they became more abundant, indicating a successional convergence.

We combined shrub dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis and weekly measurements of leaf gas exchange to examine the drivers of secondary growth in two widespread and dominant deciduous shrub species: Salix glauca and Betula nana. Betula showed a dramatic growth decline beginning in the early 1990s, when correlations between growing season air temperature and growth shifted from neutral to strongly negative. Salix also showed a growth decline, but it began slightly later and was more pronounced among older stems. May-August mean air temperature of c. 7 degrees C appeared to be an important threshold. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) in alpha-cellulose of Salix growth rings declined strongly during the period of reduced growth, suggesting drought-induced stomatal closure as a possible cause.

Betula growth declined more dramatically than Salix, but leaf gas exchange was less sensitive to moisture availability and there was less evidence of a Delta C-13 trend. We hypothesize that the dramatic Betula growth decline might reflect the combined effects of increasing moisture limitation, repeated defoliation during recent moth outbreaks and greater browsing by a growing muskoxen population.

In these depauperate soil ecosystems, microbial communities are vital as they represent the dominant input sources of essential nutrients. However, the effects of changing climate on extreme edaphic environments, such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, remain poorly understood. To better understand these effects, we constructed soil microcosms and simulated temperature shifts over a 40-day period. Soil physicochemical analysis revealed low levels of key nutrients, with mean organic carbon and nitrogen contents of <0.1% and 11.55 ppm, respectively. We also applied 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to determine taxonomic composition and enzyme assays to measure in situ activity. Our data showed a prevalence of ubiquitous soil taxa (Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Deinococcus-Thermus), with a smaller proportion of autotrophic phyla (i.e. Cyanobacteria). None of the major phyla showed relative abundance changes in response to temperature. We found very low extracellular enzyme activity levels across all samples and observed no significant differences among temperature treatments.

Growth rate of knot chicks was very high compared to other, mainly temperate, shorebirds of their size, but strongly correlated with weather-induced and seasonal variation in availability of invertebrate prey. Red knot chicks sought less parental brooding and foraged more at the same mass and temperature than chicks of three temperate shorebird species studied in The Netherlands.

A comparative simulation model based on our observations and data for temperate shorebird chicks showed that several factors combine to enable red knots to meet these high energy requirements: (1) the greater cold-hardiness of red knot chicks increases time available for foraging; (2) their fast growth further shortens the period in which chicks depend on brooding; and (3) the 24-h daylight increases potential foraging time, though knots apparently did not make full use of this. These mechanisms buffer the loss of foraging time due to increased need for brooding at arctic temperatures, but not enough to satisfy the high energy requirements without invoking (4) a higher foraging intake rate as an explanation. Since surface-active arthropods were not more abundant in our arctic study site than in a temperate grassland, this may be due to easier detection or capture of prey in the tundra.

We analyzed different phases of germination: time of radicle emergence, germination duration, and germination percentage, and thereafter seedling performance measured using seedling biomasses. Species were grouped as acidophilous, basophilous and neutrophilous according to their Ellenberg indicator values. Seeds were germinated on each soil mixture in a greenhouse, and then seedlings were selected and transplanted outdoors to grow for one season at 2,050 m a.s.l. The time of radicle emergence, length of germination, final germination percentage, seedling biomass and specific leaf area (SLA) varied according to the soil mixtures depending on the pH group. There were some consistencies between the Ellenberg groups, which were built for adult plant species, and the way these seedlings responded to a particular soil mixture. For instance, the group of species predominantly occurring in basic soils during their adult life (basophilous) had the highest germination percentage and the shortest emergence time on the soil mixture composed of gypsum, but a low germination percentage and the smallest seedling biomass on the other two soil mixtures.

A sequence of population increases of Hippophae rhamnoides (ca 14,600 yr BP), Salix spp. (ca 14,600 yr BP), Betula trees (ca.14,480 yr BP), Populus cf. tremula (ca. 14,300 yr BP), and Pinus cf. sylvestris (ca. 13,830 yr BP). (2) Biological processes: Plants responded to the rapid increase of summer temperatures on all organisational levels: (2.1) Individuals may have produced more pollen (e.g. Juniperus); (2.2) Populations increased or decreased (e.g. Juniperus, Betula, later Pinus), and (2.3) Populations changed their biogeographical range and may show migrational lags. (2.4) Plant communities changed in their composition because the species pools changed through immigration and (local) extinction. Some plant communities may have been without modern analogue. These mechanisms require increasing amounts of time. (2.5) Processes on the level of ecosystems, with species interactions, may involve various time scales. Besides competition and facilitation, nitrogen fixation is discussed. (3) The minor fluctuations of temperature during the Late-Glacial Interstadial, which are recorded in delta O-18, resulted in only very minor changes in pollen during the Aegelsee Oscillation (Older Dryas biozone, GI-1d) and the Gerzensee Oscillation (GI-1b). (4) Biodiversity: The afforestation at the onset of Bolling coincided with a gradual increase of taxonomic diversity up to the time of the major Pinus expansion. ",0.374957471,NA

As part of a project addressing microbial transformations of methane in Arctic wetlands, we studied archaeal communities in two wetlands (Solvatnet and Stuphallet) at Spitsbergen, Norway (78 degrees N) during two summer seasons. Directly extracted peat community DNA and enrichment cultures of methanogenic archaea were analyzed by nested PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and subsequent sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Sequences affiliated with Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosaeta and Group T.3b of the uncultured crenarchaeota were detected at both sites.

Consequently, the vegetation of cold and unproductive areas is predicted to be under intense winter grazing pressure, which prevents the accumulation of aboveground plant biomass and excludes erect woody plants. In the most extreme habitats (e.g., polar deserts and their high alpine counterparts), even folivorous endotherms are predicted to be absent, and the scanty vegetation is predicted to be structured by preemptive competition. Within temperature-determined productivity gradients, EEH is corroborated by biomass patterns, by patterns in the structure and dynamics of carnivore, folivore, and plant communities, and by experimental results. The general idea of top-down trophic dynamics is supported for other autotroph-based systems, too, but the relevance and sufficiency of the energy constraint in explaining patterns in trophic dynamics appears to be variable. Moreover, critical empirical evidence for or against the capacity of folivorous insects to regulate plant biomass has not yet been obtained. Another open question is the ability of boreal and temperate browsers, evolved in productive environments with intense predation pressure and abundance of forage, to prevent the regeneration of the least palatable tree species. There are, thus, many open questions waiting to be answered and many exciting experiments waiting to be conducted.",0.403246536,NA

The experiment was designed as a randomized block consisting of five replications and four treatments: control (CK), warming (W), clipping (C) and warming+clipping combination (WC). The plant and soil properties were investigated in the growing season of the alpine meadow in 2012. The results showed that W and WC treatments significantly decreased relative humidity at 20-cm height above ground as well as significantly increases air temperature at the same height, surface temperature, and soil temperature at the depth of 0-30 cm. However, the C treatment did not significantly decrease soil moisture and soil temperature at the depth of 0-60 cm. Relative to CK, vegetation height and species number increased significantly in W and WC treatment, respectively, while vegetation aboveground biomass decreased significantly in C treatment in the early growing season. However, vegetation cover, species diversity, belowground biomass and soil properties at the depth of 0-30 cm did not differ significantly in W, C and WC treatments. Soil moisture increased at the depth of 40-100 cm in W and WC treatments, while belowground biomass, soil activated carbon, organic carbon and total nitrogen increased in the 30-50 cm soil layer in W, C and WC treatments.

This attribute indicates that it may play important roles in the two contrast habitats. In order to evaluate the influences of different habitats on differentiation in B. ermanii, we assessed the genetic and epigenetic population structure in selected populations from two contrasting habitats by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive AFLP techniques. According to our results, the AT group not only exhibits higher genetic and epigenetic diversity than the SF group but also shows greater population genetic and epigenetic differentiation. In addition, the analysis of cytosine methylation levels also revealed that the AT group exhibits higher degrees of genome methylation than the SF group. Taken together, our results indicate that populations from two contrasting habitats show significantly different genetic and epigenetic population structures.

At high latitudes/altitudes, cryptogams such as bryophytes and lichens are of great importance in terms of biomass, carbon/nutrient cycling, cover and ecosystem functioning. This seven-year factorial experiment examined the effects of fertilizing and experimental warming on bryophyte and lichen abundance in an alpine meadow and a heath community in subarctic Sweden. The aim was to determine whether shortterm responses (five years) are good predictors of longer-term responses (seven years). Fertilizing and warming had significant negative effects on total and relative abundance of bryophytes and lichens, with the largest and most rapid decline caused by fertilizing and combined fertilizing and warming. Bryophytes decreased most in the alpine meadow community, which was bryophyte-dominated, and lichens decreased most in the heath community, which was lichen-dominated. This was surprising, as the most diverse group in each community was expected to be most resistant to perturbation. Warming alone had a delayed negative impact.

Four dated samples (three Late Pleistocene, one Holocene) rich in plant macrofossils were analysed with respect to their floristic composition. The flora of the Holocene sample is similar to the recent plant cover in the study area and is mainly characterized by subarctic and high arctic dwarf-shrubs and hydrophytes. The Pleistocene samples, radiocarbon dated to ca. 30, 27 and 18 ka BP, reflect a species-rich vegetation. The high proportion of pioneer plants within these samples indicates frequent disturbances of the vegetation cover. Furthermore, an almost complete absence of hydrophytes and swamp plants and the dominance of xerophytes, respectively, are typical for the Pleistocene vegetation from the Cape Sabler section. The presence of the tundra-steppe Crassulaceae Orostachys spinosa gives evidence for extremely cryoxeric climatic conditions in the Central Taymyr Peninsula during the Late Pleistocene. The species composition of the Pleistocene samples thus proves the predominance of a continental climate during the Weichselian, which was characterized by a decreased cloud cover, and thus increased direct solar radiation reaching the ground and extreme annual temperature variations. That would have entailed higher summer temperatures, lower precipitation, and longer vegetation periods (due to shorter snowmelt), thus, better conditions than today for the growth of plants in the study area.

We investigated how the reindeer-mediated aboveground changes affect soil microbial and microfaunal communities and enzymatic activities. We hypothesized that in areas with intensive summer browsing by reindeer, the carbon flow to belowground is reduced, but the carbon substances are more readily degradable. This is likely to influence both the abundance and the trophic structure of microbial and microfaunal communities. However, despite large differences in the vegetation, the reindeer ranges did not differ in the amount of microbial biomass or the abundance of nematodes. Furthermore, there was no difference in the microbial phospholipid fatty acid composition or in the trophic groups of soil nematodes. There were few effects on the organic fractions (non-polar extractives, water-soluble extractives, acid-soluble fraction, and acid-insoluble residue) of the soil organic matter. We suggest that the high stocks of organic matter in subarctic systems weaken the direct link between the aboveground and the belowground environments. Because soil carbon has a long turnover time in these systems, it takes at least several decades until the aboveground changes caused by large herbivores will influence the trophic structure in soils.

As such, lichens dominate approximately 8% of the Earth's land surface. Despite their potential importance in driving ecosystem biogeochemistry, the influence of lichens on community processes and ecosystem functioning have attracted relatively little attention. Here, we review the role of lichens in terrestrial ecosystems and draw attention to the important, but often overlooked role of lichens as determinants of ecological processes. We start by assessing characteristics that vary among lichens and that may be important in determining their ecological role; these include their growth form, the types of photobionts that they contain, their key functional traits, their water-holding capacity, their colour, and the levels of secondary compounds in their thalli. We then assess how these differences among lichens influence their impacts on ecosystem and community processes. As such, we consider the consequences of these differences for determining the impacts of lichens on ecosystem nutrient inputs and fluxes, on the loss of mass and nutrients during lichen thallus decomposition, and on the role of lichenivorous invertebrates in moderating decomposition. We then consider how differences among lichens impact on their interactions with consumer organisms that utilize lichen thalli, and that range in size from microfauna (for which the primary role of lichens is habitat provision) to large mammals (for which lichens are primarily a food source). We then address how differences among lichens impact on plants, through for example increasing nutrient inputs and availability during primary succession, and serving as a filter for plant seedling establishment. Finally we identify areas in need of further work for better understanding the role of lichens in terrestrial ecosystems. These include understanding how the high intraspecific trait variation that characterizes many lichens impacts on community assembly processes and ecosystem functioning, how multiple species mixtures of lichens affect the key community- and ecosystem-level processes that they drive, the extent to which lichens in early succession influence vascular plant succession and ecosystem development in the longer term, and how global change drivers may impact on ecosystem functioning through altering the functional composition of lichen communities.","",NA,"",NA,2017,"10.1111/brv.12305",396,"Lichens occur in most terrestrial ecosystems; they are often present as minor contributors, but in some forests, drylands and tundras they can make up most of the ground layer biomass.

Variations between permafrost structures and soil horizons caused by differences in the physical and chemical soil properties were observed. C and N content is significantly correlated with the BHP composition so that the highest BHP concentrations and greatest structural diversity occur in the upper most organic soilhorizons, which consist mainly of fresh or little degraded plant material. Furthermore, statistical analyses reveal that higher abundances of adenosylhopane-type soil marker BHPs are linked to higher soil pH values. Small scale environmental controls on BHP distributions are reflected by amine-functionalised BHPs from methanotrophic bacteria only occurring in the water-saturated, oxygen-depleted polygon centres and by soil marker BHPs, which are significantly more abundant in the well aerated polygon rims than in the centres. In contrast, C-2 methylated BHPs, putative indicators of plant-bacterial interactions, are present in all soil horizons and permafrost structures and their relative distribution is not systematically linked to soil properties. Overall, lipid-based results agree with published 16S rRNA based community structure assessments highlighting the usefulness of BHPs to represent bacterial populations in recent and ancient permafrost soils.

The wheatear, a small songbird, has declined dramatically throughout Europe. It is known to live in alpine meadows, in tundra, and rural landscapes as well as in urban areas, but it is unknown if these urban populations reproduce sufficiently. This study aimed to investigate reproductive success and habitat requirements of the wheatear in the city of Berlin, Germany. We analysed occurrence and breeding success in relation to vegetation and surface structure of the settled sites, intensity of direct disturbance by humans and dogs, as well as degree of sealing and residential population density in the surrounding urban matrix. Finally, we compared early-settled to late-settled territories to appraise habitat preferences of wheatears. The proportion of successful nests was high (73%) compared to other regions and habitats. Area size of a site greatly affected the probability of wheatear occurrence; it was much higher on sites larger than five hectare. Factors affecting breeding success differed completely from those explaining variation in occurrence, indicating that breeding success seems not to be related to habitat preferences. There was no influence of the urban matrix at a landscape level (200 m and 2000 m zone) on occurrence or breeding success. To maintain and create habitat for endangered open-land species as the wheatear, we recommend minimum area size of five hectare, sparse vegetation, open soils, short grass, and very few trees and shrubs.

These inferences are supported by delta D-wax data from surface sediments of 24 lakes where epsilon(app), relative to delta D-xylem, averages -128 + 13% and -130 +/- 8% for n-acids and n-alkanes, respectively, and co-varies with vegetation type across watersheds. These new determinations of plant source water seasonality and epsilon(app) for the Arctic will improve the delta D-wax paleoclimate proxy at high latitudes. ",0.286165608,NA

It is found primarily in subcutaneous tissues of the legs, and is more commonly known as 'legworm'. Blackflies are intermediate hosts and transmit larvae to ungulates when they blood-feed. In this article we report the first records of O. cervipedis from high latitudes of North America and its occurrence in previously unrecognized host subspecies including the Yukon-Alaska moose (Alces americanus gigas) and the Grant's caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti). Methods: We examined the subcutaneous connective tissues of the metacarpi and/or metatarsi of 34 moose and one caribou for parasitic lesions. Samples were collected from animals killed by subsistence hunters or animals found dead in the Northwest Territories (NT), Canada and Alaska (AK), USA from 2005 to 2012. Genomic DNA lysate was prepared from nematode fragments collected from two moose. The nd5 region of the mitochondrial DNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Results: Subcutaneous nodules were found in 12 moose from the NT and AK, and one caribou from AK. Nematodes dissected from the lesions were identified as Onchocerca cervipedis based on morphology of female and male specimens. Histopathological findings in moose included cavitating lesions with multifocal granulomatous cellulitis containing intralesional microfilariae and adults, often necrotic and partially mineralized. Lesions in the caribou included periosteitis with chronic cellulitis, eosinophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and abundant granulation associated with intralesional adult nematodes and larvae. Sequences of the nd5 region (471bp), the first generated for this species, were deposited with Genbank (JN580791 and JN580792).

Accelerated climate change at high latitudes may affect vector dynamics, and consequently the abundance and distribution of O. cervipedis in moose and caribou.

The observed number of species in herb vegetation was 15-20 m(-2) whereas it was only 1-6 m(-2) in P. pumila scrub. The total cover of plants was 111-129% for burned herb vegetation but was only 8-31% for burned P. pumila scrub. Although the species composition in P. pumila scrub distinctly differed between burned and unburned plots, in herb vegetation it was similar between them. Therefore, P. pumila scrub was greatly damaged by the fire, whereas herb vegetation was not damaged. Rapid recovery of herbaceous plants was because winter buds in the soil were not damaged by the fire, but winter buds on shoots of P. pumila were burned. Therefore, the difference in winter bud location (above or belowground) may have resulted in the difference in damage between herbaceous plants and P. pumila.","",NA,"",NA,2012,"10.1007/s11355-010-0134-z",424,"A fire occurred (0.59 ha) in an alpine fellfield (2600 m a.s.l.) on Mount Shirouma, central Japan, on 9 May 2009 before the start of the growing season.

However, burned P. pumila did not recover, and other alpine plants were scarce in burned P. pumila scrub.

Although the species composition in P. pumila scrub distinctly differed between burned and unburned plots, in herb vegetation it was similar between them. Therefore, P. pumila scrub was greatly damaged by the fire, whereas herb vegetation was not damaged. Rapid recovery of herbaceous plants was because winter buds in the soil were not damaged by the fire, but winter buds on shoots of P. pumila were burned. Therefore, the difference in winter bud location (above or belowground) may have resulted in the difference in damage between herbaceous plants and P. pumila.","Damage of alpine vegetation by the 2009 fire on Mt.

These observations suggest that chironomid-based inference models should only be applied to sediment cores which have similar climate regimes to the geographic area of the training set. In addition a 149 lake, 120 taxa chironomid-based continentality inference model was also developed from the modern Norwegian and Russian training sets. A 2-component WA-PLS model was the minimal adequate model with r(jack)(2) = 0.73 and RMSEP = 9.9 using the Gorczynski continentality index. Comparison of reconstructed continentality indices from the tundra lake, VORK5, show close agreement with local instrumental records over the past 70 years and suggest that the model is reliable. Recent warming in the Arctic has been spatially and seasonally heterogeneous; in many areas warming is more pronounced in the spring and autumn leading to a lengthening of the summer, while summer temperatures have remained relatively stable. A continentality inference model has the potential to detect these seasonal changes in climate. ",0.222305229,NA

We evaluated the relationship between Nothofagus delta C-13 and moisture availability by determining delta C-13 of modern Nothofagus pollen, sporopollenin, and leaves and comparing these results to precipitation data. To assess plant moisture availability and vegetation composition just prior to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, we measured delta C-13 of fossil Nothofagus sporopollenin (Nothofagidites) from the SHALDRIL 3C cores (which date to similar to 35.9 My) and evaluated these results in the context of temporal variation in pollen assemblages from the same sediments. Values of carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) for modern Nothofagus sporopollenin range between 18.1 and 22.4 parts per thousand. These values are positively correlated with precipitation amount, as well as pollen and leaf Delta, which suggests that fossil sporopollenin Delta records the level of plant moisture availability. Delta values obtained from Nothofagidites sporopollenin from the SHALDRIL 3C sediments range between 17.9 and 20.2 parts per thousand and generally decline through time. These results suggest a decrease in plant moisture availability on the Antarctic Peninsula during the Late Eocene, perhaps as a result of declining precipitation and/or soil moisture.

Indicator species analysis revealed high specificity and fidelity for many uncultured and unclassified bacterial taxa in the heavy DNA for all soils and substrates. Among characterized taxa, Actinomycetales (Salinibacterium), Rhizobiales (Devosia), Rhodospirillales (Telmatospirillum), and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium and Asticcacaulis) were bacterial indicator species for the heavy substrates and soils tested. Both Actinomycetales and Caulobacterales (Phenylobacterium) were associated with metabolism of cellulose, and Alphaproteobacteria were associated with the metabolism of arabinose; members of the order Rhizobiales were strongly associated with the metabolism of xylose. Annotated metagenomic data suggested diverse glycoside hydrolase gene representation within the pooled heavy DNA. By screening 2,876 cloned fragments derived from the C-13-labeled DNA isolated from soils incubated with cellulose, we demonstrate the power of combining DNA-SIP, multiple-displacement amplification (MDA), and functional metagenomics by efficiently isolating multiple clones with activity on carboxymethyl cellulose and fluorogenic proxy substrates for carbohydrate-active enzymes.

We undertook a multiproxy study on an alpine lake (ESM-1) at the modern tree-line in boreal, southern Siberia. Steppe and tundra biomes were extensive in eastern Sayan landscapes during the early Holocene. Boreal forest quickly expanded by 9.1 ka BP, and dominated the landscape until c 0.7 ka BP, when the greatest period of compositional turnover occurred. At this time, alpine meadow landscape expanded and Picea obovata colonised new habitats along river valleys and lake shorelines, because of prevailing cool, moist conditions. During the early Holocene, chironomid assemblages were dominated by cold stenotherms. Diatoms for much of the Holocene were dominated by alkaliphilous, fragilarioid taxa, up until 0.2 ka BP, when epiphytic species expanded, indicative of increased habitat availability. C/N mass ratios ranged between 9.5 and 13.5 (11.1-15.8 C/N atomic ratios), indicative of algal communities dominating organic matter contributions to bottom sediments with small, persistent contributions from vascular plants. However, delta C-13 values increased steadily from -34.9 parts per thousand during the early Holocene (9.3 ka BP) to -24.8 parts per thousand, by 0.6 ka BP. This large shift in magnitude may be due to a number of factors, including increasing within-lake productivity, increasing disequilibrium between the isotopic balance of the lake with the atmosphere as the lake became isotopically 'mature', and declining soil respiration linked to small, but distinct retreat in forest biomes. The influence of climatic variables on landscape vegetation was assessed using redundancy analysis (RDA), a linear, direct ordination technique. Changes in July insolation at 60 degrees N significantly explained over one-fifth of the variation in species composition, while changes in estimates of northern hemisphere temperature and ice-rafted debris events in the North Atlantic were also significant, but considerably less important. The potential importance of climate and biome development (tundra, steppe, cold deciduous forest and taiga) on different trophic levels (i.e. chironomid and diatom communities) in lake ESM-1 was also assessed using RDA. Climate predictors had a more significant influence on Holocene chironomid assemblages, especially July insolation at 60 degrees N, estimates of regional precipitation and estimates of northern hemisphere temperature, while only the development of the taiga biome had a significant impact on these primary consumers. Diatom communities also had a small, but significant influence on Holocene chironomid populations, perhaps linked to variation in faunal feeding strategies. In contrast, climatic and biome predictors explained similar amounts of variation in the Holocene diatom assemblage (approximately 20% each), while chironomids themselves as predictors explained just under 7% of diatom variation. Lake acidity was inferred using a diatom inference model. Results suggest that after deglaciation, the lake did not undergo a process of gradual acidification, most likely due to the presence of continuous permafrost and low levels of precipitation, preventing base cations and dissolved organic carbon entering the lake (except for the period between 1.7 and 0.7 ka BP). We conclude that lakes in continental, boreal regions undergo different models of lake ontogeny than oceanic boreal regions. Unlike other regions discussed, climate is a more important driver of ecosystem change than catchment changes. We also demonstrate that the start of the period coincident with the onset of the Little Ice Age resulted in important thresholds crossed in catchment vegetation and aquatic communities.

The total length of the human-accessible underground spaces is estimated to be at least 27 km, the vertical range is 105 m. The annual course of air temperature was monitored on the sun-exposed upper rock margin (max. 26.5 degrees C, mm. -7.3 degrees C, mean 6.1 degrees C), as well as in the cold and dark crevice cave (max. 9.6 degrees C, min. -1.9 degrees C, mean 3.7 degrees C). Due to the climatic inversion in the deep vertical spaces, mountain bryophytes and vascular plants occur here. A total of 2285 arthropods belonging to eight taxonomic groups were evaluated; spiders and beetles were the most numerous. We registered 304 species, which colonize the totality of habitats in the labyrinth: cold bottom parts, dark caves, shady rock walls, as well as the sun-exposed upper rock margins. The cold parts of the labyrinth harbour populations of sixteen species of mountain arthropods (beetles, spiders and a harvestman) and five species of arthropods with distributions in tundra or boreal forests, and similar disjunctive habitats in the temperate zone in central Europe (spiders and a mite). The first record of the Arctic predatory mite Rhagidia gelida in central Europe was in the Poseidon Labyrinth in 1986; this species proved to be a bio-indicator of the long-lasting periglacial microclimate in central Europe. Prior to discovery of the spider Sisicus apertus in the Poseidon Labyrinth, it had been recorded in central Europe in the Alps and in the High Tatra Mountains at altitudes of 1150 to 2300 m. At the present time, we consider the Poseidon Sandstone Labyrinth to be a paleorefugium of cold-adapted arthropods.",0.554413676,NA

To date, this is the only complete record of such age in the eastern Baltic area and the northernmost area for which Bolling records are present. Combining pollen evidence, pollen accumulation rates (PAR) and plant macrofossil data, we assess the local and regional vegetation development, and we attempt to separate the true Lateglacial vegetation signal by removing the obviously redeposited thermophilous pollen; however, we remove not only their signal, we discuss the possibilities of separating the redeposition signal of the so-called ""local Lateglacial trees"", pine and birch, by looking at their corrosion and degradation. The results show that the Bolling warming in the eastern Baltic area was a treeless tundra community consisting of the shrubs Betula nana, Dryas octopetala and Salix polaris. The Older Dryas cold spell is clearly recognised as a decline in the total concentration of plant macrofossils and PARs at between 14,200 and 13,500 cal yr BR At 13,460 cal yr BP, the B. nana macrofossils disappear, and tree birch (Betula sect. Albae) appears, marking the start of tree birch forest. The presence of pine forest is confirmed by a variety of macrofossils, including bark, wood, needles and seeds, since 13,400 cal yr BP, at the same time at which pine stomata are found. The first identified pine stomata finds are associated with a Pinus PAR over 3000 grains cm(-2) yr(-1) and pine macrofossil finds with a Pin us PAR over 4000 grains cm(-2) yr(-1). During the warmest period of the GI-1a (Allerod) at 13,000-12,700 cal yr BP, a pine forest with deciduous trees (birch - Betula pendula and aspen - Populus tremula) developed in the study area. The Younger Dryas (GS-1) cooling strongly affected the floral composition in eastern Latvia. The PAR of the tree taxa declined abruptly from a maximum value at 12,700 to below 1000 grains cm(-2) yr(-1) at 12,600 cal yr BR The response time for the pine forest to collapse was 100 years according to the PAR data. Pine macrofossils disappear simultaneously with the pollen signal at 12,600 cal yr BP, yet occasional Pinus stomata are recorded throughout the Younger Dryas (GS-1). The landscape was treeless shrub tundra again, with D. octopetala, S. polaris, B. nana and Juniperus present.

","Fungal communities at the edge: Ecological lessons from high alpine fungi One of the least studied ecosystems on Earth is the plant-free zone found between the alpine tundra zone and the zone of permanent ice and snow. This unique ecosystem-type occurs in all of the major mountain ranges on Earth and is especially widespread in the Andes and Himalayas. Here we describe recent molecular-phylogenetic studies of the fungi that inhabit these apparently barren soils. Sites that receive significant amounts of snowfall (in the Himalayas, Rocky and Andes ranges) are dominated by unique clades of zoosporic fungi (especially the Spizellomycetales), which likely use the saturated soil conditions during snow melt to complete their life cycles and then remain dormant for most of the year during periods of extreme cold and dryness. In more extreme sites that have very sporadic and shallow snow packs, such as the upper slopes of Llullaillaco Volcano (el. 6 741 m above sea level) on the Chilean-Argentinian border, fungal communities show very little diversity and are dominated by clades of yeasts related to the Antarctic endolithic yeasts in the Filobasidiales group.

The residues were mixed to mesocosms equivalent to 1.2 mg C and 42.5 mu g N g(-1) dry soil, after which the samples were incubated at a constant temperature of +4 degrees C, a constant -3 degrees C, and under multiple and single freeze thaw conditions. A constant +4 degrees C was most favourable for microbial substrate use, with 4- and 6-fold higher total and maize-C mineralization, respectively, in comparison with constant frost. The cumulative maize mineralization was not determined by the frequency of freeze thaw events, but regulated by the overall time of frost and thaw conditions. The decomposition of maize straw significantly increased soil organic C mineralization (in all scenarios) and incorporation into microbial biomass (in the freeze thaw scenarios only). The positive priming effects observed were equivalent to an additional loss of total soil organic C of between about 0.2 (continuous frost) and 0.8% (single freeze thaw). Microbial biomass was significantly increased after maize straw amendment, with constant frost and freeze thaw scenarios not having any negative effect on microbial biomass C compared with constant +4 degrees C. Highest fungal biomass was found after constant frost without fresh substrates and also after extended frost followed by a warm period when fresh plant residues were present.

We tested the influence of climate, forest dynamics, community dynamics compared to other causes for delays. For this aim temperature reconstructed from a delta O-18-record was used as input driving the multi-species forest-landscape model TreeMig. In a stepwise scenario analysis, population dynamics along with pollen production and transport were simulated and compared with pollen-influx data, according to scenarios of different delta O-18/temperature sensitivities, different precipitation levels, with/without inter-specific competition, and with/without prescribed arrival of species. In the best-fitting scenarios, the effects on competitive relationships, pollen production, spatial forest structure, albedo, and surface roughness were examined in more detail. The appearance of most taxa in the data could only be explained by the coldest temperature scenario with a sensitivity of 0.3 parts per thousand/degrees C, corresponding to an anomaly of - 15 degrees C. Once the taxa were present, their temporal pattern was shaped by competition. The later arrival of Pinus could not be explained even by the coldest temperatures, and its timing had to be prescribed by first observations in the pollen record. After the arrival into the simulation area, the expansion of Pinus was further influenced by competitors and minor climate oscillations. The rapid change in the simulated species composition went along with a drastic change in forest structure, leaf area, albedo, and surface roughness. Pollen increased only shortly after biomass. Based on our simulations, two alternative potential scenarios for the pollen pattern can be given: either very cold climate suppressed most species in the Oldest Dryas, or they were delayed by soil formation or migration. One taxon, Pious, was delayed by migration and then additionally hindered by competition. Community dynamics affected the pattern in two ways: potentially by facilitation, i.e. by nitrogen-fixing pioneer species at the onset, whereas the later pattern was clearly shaped by competition. The simulated structural changes illustrate how vegetation on a larger scale could feed back to the climate system. For a better understanding, a more integrated simulation approach covering also the immigration from refugia would be necessary, for this combines climate-driven population dynamics, migration, individual pollen production and transport, soil dynamics, and physiology of individual pollen production.

The later arrival of Pinus could not be explained even by the coldest temperatures, and its timing had to be prescribed by first observations in the pollen record. After the arrival into the simulation area, the expansion of Pinus was further influenced by competitors and minor climate oscillations. The rapid change in the simulated species composition went along with a drastic change in forest structure, leaf area, albedo, and surface roughness. Pollen increased only shortly after biomass. Based on our simulations, two alternative potential scenarios for the pollen pattern can be given: either very cold climate suppressed most species in the Oldest Dryas, or they were delayed by soil formation or migration. One taxon, Pious, was delayed by migration and then additionally hindered by competition. Community dynamics affected the pattern in two ways: potentially by facilitation, i.e. by nitrogen-fixing pioneer species at the onset, whereas the later pattern was clearly shaped by competition. The simulated structural changes illustrate how vegetation on a larger scale could feed back to the climate system. For a better understanding, a more integrated simulation approach covering also the immigration from refugia would be necessary, for this combines climate-driven population dynamics, migration, individual pollen production and transport, soil dynamics, and physiology of individual pollen production. ","Forest dynamics during the transition from the Oldest Dryas to the Bolling-Allerod at Gerzensee-a simulation study The aim of this study was to explore potential causes and mechanisms for the sequence and temporal pattern of tree taxa, specifically for the shift from shrub-tundra to birch-juniper woodland during and after the transition from the Oldest Dryas to the Bolling-Allerod in the region surrounding the lake Gerzensee in southern Central Europe. We tested the influence of climate, forest dynamics, community dynamics compared to other causes for delays. For this aim temperature reconstructed from a delta O-18-record was used as input driving the multi-species forest-landscape model TreeMig. In a stepwise scenario analysis, population dynamics along with pollen production and transport were simulated and compared with pollen-influx data, according to scenarios of different delta O-18/temperature sensitivities, different precipitation levels, with/without inter-specific competition, and with/without prescribed arrival of species. In the best-fitting scenarios, the effects on competitive relationships, pollen production, spatial forest structure, albedo, and surface roughness were examined in more detail.

Yet, limited attention has been given to their potential influence on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including the diurnal variations of GHG fluxes that are fundamental in estimating the carbon and nitrogen budget. In this study, we examined the diurnal variation in fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a S. alterniflora intertidal flat in June, October, and December of 2013 and April of 2014 representing the summer, autumn, winter, and spring seasons, respectively. We found that the average CH4 fluxes on the diurnal scale were positive during the growing season while negative otherwise. The tidal flat of S. alterniflora acted as a source of CH4 in summer (June) and a combination of source and sink in other seasons. We observed higher diurnal variations in the CO2 and N2O fluxes during the growing season (1 536.5 mg CO2 m(-2) h (-1) and 25.6 mu g N2O m(-2) h (-1)) compared with those measured in the non -growing season (379.1 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and 16.5 lig (NO)-O-2 m(-2) h(-1)).

The diurnal variation in the fluxes of CO2 in June and N2O in December fluctuated more than that in October and April. However, two peak curves in October and April were observed for the diurnal changes in CO2 and N2O fluxes (prominent peaks were found in the morning of October and in the afternoon of April, respectively). The highest diurnal variation in the N2O fluxes took place at 15:00 (86.4 lig N2O m(-2) h(-1)) in June with an unimodal distribution.
