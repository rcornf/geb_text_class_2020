Furthermore, enhancing the diversity of degraded ecosystems is a major goal in applied restoration ecology. In grasslands, many species may be locally absent due to dispersal or microsite limitation and may therefore profit from mechanical disturbance of the resident vegetation. We established a seed addition and disturbance experiment across several grassland sites of different land use to test whether plant diversity can be increased in these grasslands. Additionally, the experiment will allow us testing the consequences of increased plant diversity for ecosystem processes and for the diversity of other taxa in real-world ecosystems. Here, we present details of the experimental design and report results from the first vegetation survey 1 year after disturbance and seed addition. Moreover, we tested whether the effects of seed addition and disturbance varied among grassland depending on their land use or pre-disturbance plant diversity. Methods A full-factorial experiment was installed in 73 grasslands in three regions across Germany. Grasslands were under regular agricultural use, but varied in the type and the intensity of management, thereby representing the range of management typical for large parts of Central Europe. The disturbance treatment consisted of disturbing the top 10 cm of the sward using a rotavator or rotary harrow. Seed addition consisted of sowing a high-diversity seed mixture of regional plant species. These species were all regionally present, but often locally absent, depending on the resident vegetation composition and richness of each grassland. Important Findings Seven months after sward disturbance, respective plots had significantly increased in bare soil, seedling species richness and number of seedlings. Seed addition had increased plant species richness, but only in combination with sward disturbance.

The highest numbers of species were recorded in semi-natural grasslands, in which we report four new world records for fine-scale species richness: 17 species of vascular plants in 0.0044 m(2) in a mountain meadow in the Krkonose Mts, 52 and 63 species in 0.25 and 0.5 m(2), respectively, in the Kopanecke luky meadows in the Slovak Paradise (Slovensky raj), and 109 species in 16 m2 in the Porazky meadows in the White Carpathians (Bile Karpaty). The previous world record of 43 species in 0.1 m(2) was equalled in the Certoryje meadows in the White Carpathians, however, the previous record referred to shoot presence while the new record considers only the species rooted in the plot. We interpreted and corrected the data from the Czech Republic that Wilson et al. (2012) used to compile a list of world records and provide an updated list. The updated list contains five world records from the Czech Republic and two from Slovakia. The most species-rich grasslands and forests in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are concentrated in regions with base-rich soils in the Western Carpathians, especially in the flysch zone in SE Moravia and the Czech-Slovak borderland, and in limestone and volcanic areas in central Slovakia.

The question of site management following rewetting is important from a practical and economic as well as a conservation perspective. Extensive grazing on rewetted floodplain habitats is often more feasible than mowing. However, such a management change is often contested from a conservation perspective. Within the scope of this study, a vegetation analysis is used to compare different land use regimes for floodplains in the Luxembourg Syr-wetlands six years after rewetting through a land restoration project. The aim is to analyse differences in vegetation composition between the management alternatives of extensive grazing, one-cut mowing with grazing and two-cut mowing, and to draw conclusions for the future management of rewetted floodplain wetlands. Along the use limits of pasture-mowing areas, vegetation surveys have been carried out using paired sampling plots to keep site conditions as similar as possible. Alongside parameters for floristic diversity and rarity, the vegetation data have also been analysed with the help of indicator values and species traits.

In the process, harvested pastures, which were formerly used intensively, are frequently restored. The question of site management following rewetting is important from a practical and economic as well as a conservation perspective. Extensive grazing on rewetted floodplain habitats is often more feasible than mowing. However, such a management change is often contested from a conservation perspective. Within the scope of this study, a vegetation analysis is used to compare different land use regimes for floodplains in the Luxembourg Syr-wetlands six years after rewetting through a land restoration project. The aim is to analyse differences in vegetation composition between the management alternatives of extensive grazing, one-cut mowing with grazing and two-cut mowing, and to draw conclusions for the future management of rewetted floodplain wetlands. Along the use limits of pasture-mowing areas, vegetation surveys have been carried out using paired sampling plots to keep site conditions as similar as possible. Alongside parameters for floristic diversity and rarity, the vegetation data have also been analysed with the help of indicator values and species traits. One dimension of an NMDS-ordination allows the vegetation composition of the management alternatives to be significantly distinguished from one another. The main influencing factor here is primarily differing land use. At the pasture areas investigated, more species were observed overall than in the mowing areas. The average species numbers, diversity indices, and structural vegetation parameters per unit of measurement point to a greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation under the influence of grazing animals. Regarding rare and conservation-relevant plant species, no significant differences between the management alternatives were recorded. In contrast, the two-cut mowing areas in particular differ from the permanent pasture with regard to species traits like life-form, reproduction type, and flowering time span. This result is not consistent with the species decline associated with a management change from mowing to grazing, which has been observed in other studies for different site conditions. The extensive mowing and grazing use in the Syr floodplain comes close to historical agricultural management forms, which are increasingly required for the conservation and development of species-rich habitat types. The different land-use regimes complement each other in the Syr valley and offer different habitats for plant species with varying species traits.",0.816729287,NA

Large amounts of resources are put into wetland restoration with the aim to recover biodiversity. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated effects of management, wetness and flooding dynamics on biodiversity of restored wetlands such as seasonally flooded wet grasslands. We inventoried bird communities over 4years at 137 sites (each 31ha) within five restored wet grassland areas in Sweden to investigate whether species richness and occurrence of 12 common wet grassland species were related to (i) local conditions such as management (grazing, mowing and unmanaged areas), basic wetness and spring flooding dynamics. Further, we investigated whether (ii) the composition of the adjacent landscape (20ha) related to local bird diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale. Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale. Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure, resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet grassland bird species.Synthesis and applications. The selection of wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest edges. Restoration and management of wet grasslands should include water level management, removal of shrubs and trees, and low-intensity grazing, whereas mowing could be used in non-flooded grasslands of low basic wetness.

Further, we investigated whether (ii) the composition of the adjacent landscape (20ha) related to local bird diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale. Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale. Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure, resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet grassland bird species.Synthesis and applications. The selection of wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest edges.

The annual integral of the normalized difference vegetation index was used as a surrogate for above-ground net primary productivity. ResultsCompositional dissimilarity between grazed and ungrazed plots, as well as grazing-induced differences in plant richness and beta-diversity all increased with habitat productivity. Grazing decreased species richness in low-productive steppes but enhanced the richness of high-productive grasslands. On average, grazing reduced beta-diversity in high-productive sites but not in low-productive sites. Dominant species were more strongly suppressed by grazing towards productive grasslands. Grazing generally decreased shrub species cover, whereas graminoid and forb cover did not consistently change with grazing through the productivity gradient. ConclusionsOur results indicate that the overall grazing effects on vegetation structure increased along a regional productivity gradient.

In North America, these habitats or ecosystems include grasslands or prairies, shrublands, savannas, early successional forests, and floodplains. Whereas the extent of all natural habitats has diminished significantly owing to outright loss from agriculture and development, the suppression of disturbance by agents such as fire and flooding has led to further losses. Accordingly, the abundances of many bird species adapted to disturbance-mediated habitats have declined as well. In North America, these declines have been more severe and common than those of species associated with less frequently disturbed habitats such as mature or closed-canopy forests. Field studies consistently reveal the direct role of disturbance and successional processes in structuring avian habitats and communities. Conservation strategies involving the management of disturbance through some combination of flooding, application of fire, or the expression of wildfire, and use of certain types of silviculture have the potential to diversify avian habitats at the local, landscape, and regional scale.

Forest reserves protect 5.3% (2,027 km(2)) of the dry forest habitats, 5% (165,285 km(2)) of lowland and montane moist forests, 2.6% (364,354 km(2)) of savannah woodlands, 1.8% (10,561 km(2)) of flooded grasslands, and 1.65% (1,177 km(2)) of mangroves. Forest reserves also protect parts of three conservation schemes: 6.5% (61,630 km(2)) of BirdLife's Endemic Bird Areas, 3.4% (147,718 km(2)) of Conservation International's Hotpots and 3.4% (346,864 km(2)) of WWF's Global 200 Ecoregions. Several of the global protected area gaps identified in Africa are also covered by forest reserves, in the Eastern Arc Mountains, Eastern African coastal forests, Kenyan Highlands, Cameroon-Nigerian Mountains,West African Forests and mountain areas of Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Zambia. Some African forest reserves have a legally defined role in biodiversity conservation and are strictly protected; they thus fit criteria for protected areas. Working with forest departments in individual countries may help develop a more comprehensive protected area network without creating additional new reserves.",0.737800925,NA

Butterfly data were obtained from a number of transects walked as part of the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, which uses a standardized methodology for monitoring butterflies. A Mantel test indicated a strong association between habitat types and the composition of butterfly assemblages and a principal component analysis ordinated individual butterfly species along a gradient from woodland to open areas, thereby indicating various degrees of shade tolerance. In addition, cluster analysis distinguished two main groups of habitats based on the similarities of their butterfly fauna: woodland and bramble clumps and a group of three different kinds of grasslands (traditionally hay meadows, pastures, and alfalfa fields).

The delay in the P effect on biomass and species composition and the persistence of the P effect on species composition are ascribed to fast immobilisation and subsequent slow release of fertilizer P in the peat soil. Recurrence of the P pulses is expected to cause permanent changes in species composition.",0.708958332,NA

Ch. lacustris is estimated to have lost 85-99% of its habitat during the last 50 years due to wetland drainage. The main threat to the species survival is further habitat loss by urbanisation around Pamvotida Lake and by land conversion to agriculture in Paramythia Lake, even though both sites belong to the Natura 2000 network. The species status is Critically Endangered and it should be listed in Annex 11 of the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) as a priority species for conservation. Restoring wet grasslands, protecting them from further urbanisation and drainage, and monitoring species population are the main measures proposed for its conservation.",0.679119752,NA

However, they are one of the most threatened due to human activities such as agriculture and livestock. Mexico has lost 62% of its wetlands and specifically those of the central coast of the Gulf of Mexico are being affected due to livestock pressure. There are very few studies about the subject, so in this paper we analyze the effect of livestock and seasonality on floristic composition, above ground biomass (AB) and below ground biomass (BB) of the Alvarado lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico. Methods: We selected two working locations, and in each locality chose two sampling sites. In each site, we placed eight 1 m(2) plots of four different locations (half were fenced to keep out livestock). For an entire year we obtained species richness and diversity, and data on vegetation cover, as well as AB and BB. With the data obtained, we calculated the Relative Importance Value (RIV) by species and the relative replacement rate of species. Key results: Total richness resulted in 29 species. A disturbance gradient was observed, with the best conserved sites in Rio Blanco. In most sites, species richness was significantly higher in rainfall and species with high RIV were typical wetland species, although there were dominant grasses in both climatic seasons. BB was significantly higher in one location of Rio Blanco, and AB in one location of Rio Blanco and in one from Rio Limon. During the rainy season, AB was higher in half of the sites.

But, if the sites remain stable, the number of species first of all increases, only then to decrease due to the proliferation of competitive species such as Phalaris arundinacea L. The ranges of species found on the different geomorphological features do not display a high degree of similarity. Canonical correlation analysis reveals that the density and the total number of species on geomorphological features are most strongly influenced by the proportion of fine particulates (< 2 mm).

How does the encroachment of a woody shrub affect herbaceous community structure and species composition in grasslands of a wetland ecosystem? Location: Seasonally flooded grasslands in a Neotropical Hyperseasonal Savanna, the Pantanal wetland, Brazil. Methods: We investigated the effect of the encroaching plant Combretum laxum on a herbaceous community from seasonally flooded grasslands in the Pantanal wetland using 29 vegetation samples representing encroachment at different spatio-temporal stages. The point quadrat method was used to acquire vegetation data, as plant cover, species richness (S) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'). We evaluated the existence of stages of encroachment related to differences in vegetation structure and species composition using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and analysis of similarity. The response of the herbaceous community to shrub advance was analysed using linear and quadratic polynomial regression models. Model fitness was tested using the ACI.

Location: Southern Campos of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, in south-central Uruguay. Methods: We surveyed seven continuously grazed and ungrazed paired plots. Plant and litter cover were recorded on three 5-m interception lines placed parallel to the fence in each plot. We extracted soil fauna from a 10 ern deep composite sample and analysed the oribatids. Soil attributes included bulk density, water content, organic carbon (in particulate and mineral associated organic matter) and nitrogen content and root biomass at different depths. Changes in floristic, Plant Functional Types and mesofauna composition were analysed by Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling. Results: Species number was lower in ungrazed than in grazed plots. Of 105 species in grazed plots only three were exotics. Shrub and litter cover were significantly higher inside the exclosures, while the cover of Cyperaceae-Juncaceae was lower.

Grazed grasslands showed the highest species number and coverages of pioneer vegetation. The banks indicated fewer differences in species composition between floodplain types.

Natural, semi-natural and artificial grasslands occur extensively around the globe, but successful management for production and biodiversity poses several dilemmas for conservationists and farmland managers. Deriving from three continents (Africa, Australia and Europe), papers in this Special Profile interface three specific issues: plant responses to grazing, plant invasions and the responses to management of valued grassland biota. 2. Although pivotal in grassland management, plant responses to grazing are sometimes difficult to predict. Two alternative approaches are presented here. The first uses natural variations in sheep grazing around a water hole to model the dynamic population response of a chenopod shrub. The second analyses a long-term grazing experiment to investigate the links between plant traits and grazing response. 3. Linked often crucially with grazing, but also driven sometimes by extrinsic factors, invasions are often cause for concern in grassland management.

U.S. Public Land Survey data from Tefft in 1833 indicate black and white oak barrens, and pin oak savanna, with trees averaging 50 stems/ha and 4 m(2)/ha basal area. We used ordination and a digital elevation model to assess topographic distribution of tree species in 1986. In 1986, we also compared initial effects of high- and low-intensity dormant season fire on woody vegetation among nine blocks containing black oak, white oak, and pin oak stands. Twenty years later, we compared the same blocks, all of which had been burned three times per decade with low-intensity fires. In 1986, black oak, white oak and pin oak occurred across a gradient of decreasing elevation and slope. At that time, unburned black oak and white oak stands averaged >400 stems/ha and about 10 m(2)/ha basal area, and their smaller size classes contained non-oak woody vegetation that apparently had invaded with fire exclusion. After initial burns, black oak and white oak stands receiving high-intensity fire averaged <200 stems/ha and had significantly lower oak canopy cover and basal area than unburned stands. Stands receiving low-intensity fire had intermediate oak canopy cover, with basal area similar to unburned stands. Pin oak stands were more fire-resistant, apparently because spring flooding often reduced fire effects. Density, cover and basal area of non-oak tree species were much lower than oaks, and were not reduced by initial burning. Repeated low-intensity burning over 20 years tended to maintain structure caused by initial fires. However, it reduced lower size class stem densities, promoted post-fire sprouting into the shrub layer, and allowed oak basal area to increase in larger size classes. Time since fire regulated shrub layer structure on a 4-year cycle. Density and cover of trees and shrubs returned to pre-burn conditions by the second and fourth growing seasons after fire, respectively, with non-oak tree species exceeding pre-burn cover and density by the fourth season.

We compared short- and long-term effects of restored fire on the Tefft Savanna, a 197 ha eastern sand savanna in northwest Indiana that had undergone three decades of fire protection. U.S. Public Land Survey data from Tefft in 1833 indicate black and white oak barrens, and pin oak savanna, with trees averaging 50 stems/ha and 4 m(2)/ha basal area. We used ordination and a digital elevation model to assess topographic distribution of tree species in 1986. In 1986, we also compared initial effects of high- and low-intensity dormant season fire on woody vegetation among nine blocks containing black oak, white oak, and pin oak stands. Twenty years later, we compared the same blocks, all of which had been burned three times per decade with low-intensity fires. In 1986, black oak, white oak and pin oak occurred across a gradient of decreasing elevation and slope. At that time, unburned black oak and white oak stands averaged >400 stems/ha and about 10 m(2)/ha basal area, and their smaller size classes contained non-oak woody vegetation that apparently had invaded with fire exclusion. After initial burns, black oak and white oak stands receiving high-intensity fire averaged <200 stems/ha and had significantly lower oak canopy cover and basal area than unburned stands. Stands receiving low-intensity fire had intermediate oak canopy cover, with basal area similar to unburned stands. Pin oak stands were more fire-resistant, apparently because spring flooding often reduced fire effects. Density, cover and basal area of non-oak tree species were much lower than oaks, and were not reduced by initial burning. Repeated low-intensity burning over 20 years tended to maintain structure caused by initial fires. However, it reduced lower size class stem densities, promoted post-fire sprouting into the shrub layer, and allowed oak basal area to increase in larger size classes. Time since fire regulated shrub layer structure on a 4-year cycle. Density and cover of trees and shrubs returned to pre-burn conditions by the second and fourth growing seasons after fire, respectively, with non-oak tree species exceeding pre-burn cover and density by the fourth season. These results suggest that high-intensity fire is more important than repeated low-intensity burning in structuring and restoring eastern sand savanna, and that non-oak tree species, once established, may be resistant to low-intensity fire.

They constitute complex territories as many stakeholders interact to manage water levels. Among them, livestock farmers play a key role by managing those flooded grasslands. Wet grasslands are still endangered by both conversion to improved grasslands or crops and abandonment due to the difficulties associated with exploiting constrained lands. In south east France, transhumant sheep breeding allows to maintain open vegetation that decreases the risk of both fires in the Alpilles hills and avalanche in the Alp mountains. In La Crau, maintaining Sheep grazing appears to be the only way to ensure the durability of the ""Coussoul"" habitat, the last steppe area in Europe. The crisis of sheep farming, return of wolves to the area and industrial development in La Crau all constitute a significant threat to this breeding system. The maintenance of breeding activities constitutes a challenge for the conservation of areas which have a high heritage value. Farming sectors face natural constraints which make management of the system more difficult and affect the economic viability, resulting in a need for an agroenvironmental policy. An increased market value of quality products, which are linked to production region, appears to be a lever to preserve livestock farming while conserving natural habitats.","Multiple services delivered by semi-natural lands depend on breeding activities Semi-natural grasslands present opportunities for delivering multiple services but their conservation is tightly dependent on livestock farming.

Grazing changed vegetation structure more intensively in the high elevation level because it reduced the competitive exclusion exerted by S. densiflora, allowing the increase in floristic richness. Grazing increased soil salinity and the contribution of salt-tolerant species only in the medium but not in the low elevation level probably because the higher frequency and duration of tidal flooding counterbalanced the increase in evaporation promoted by biomass removal in the low respect to the medium elevation level.

Grazing changed vegetation structure more intensively in the high elevation level because it reduced the competitive exclusion exerted by S. densiflora, allowing the increase in floristic richness. Grazing increased soil salinity and the contribution of salt-tolerant species only in the medium but not in the low elevation level probably because the higher frequency and duration of tidal flooding counterbalanced the increase in evaporation promoted by biomass removal in the low respect to the medium elevation level. While grazing may cause positive impacts for plant conservation in the high elevation level, it may cause negative consequence for livestock production because of the reduction in forage quality along the entire elevation gradient.","Effect of cattle grazing on soil salinity and vegetation composition along an elevation gradient in a temperate coastal salt marsh of Samborombon Bay (Argentina) Salt marshes of Samborombn Bay (Argentina) have been grazed sporadically at very low stocking rates, but in the last decade, grazing intensity increased due to agriculture expansion. We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on vegetation and soil salinity on the most extended Spartina densiflora community. This community develops along an elevation gradient where the frequency and duration of tidal flooding and soil salinity increased as elevation decreased. Vegetation and soil data were collected from a national park excluded to cattle grazing for 30 years and from an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. As elevation level decreased, plant cover, richness and diversity of functional groups and species decreased.

Alluvial meadows along large European rivers are part of the European Union's Habitats Directive, and therefore part of conservation and restoration efforts. Sustainable management of these meadows should aim to reconcile the interests of both nature conservationists and farmers. In this context, we conducted a two-year comparative study in alluvial meadows of high and low nature conservation value, belonging to the alliances Arrhenatherion and Cnidion. Firstly, we aimed to assess how differences in fodder yield and quality are linked to abiotic and biotic factors. Secondly, we addressed the possibility of incorporating fodder from these meadows into livestock farming. Our results revealed that while yield tended to be higher in meadows of low nature conservation value, fodder quality (e.g. energy content) showed the reverse trend. These differences are most likely caused by differences in vegetation composition and soil fertility. In addition, the response seemed to be closely linked to the precipitation pattern. In 2006, when precipitation was evenly distributed, fodder quantity seemed to be mainly related to site conditions. In 2007, when a drought occurred in April, differences in the proportion of functional groups were additionally related to differences in yield.

These species are mostly restricted to small habitat patches of dikes and natural levees as these locations provide the necessary microclimate conditions for this species group with a more southern Central European range. This spatial restriction of habitat together with the intensified agricultural use of the floodplains means that these habitat fragments have become rare in the river valley. The central question for the study was whether preservation of these relics is a sufficient means to preserve this group of species and the overall riparian diversity. We investigated the composition and diversity of the floodplain meadows of the alluvial plain of a 40 km river reach. Emphasis was on the specific conditions of the dry river grasslands with river corridor plants. A mapping and sampling of vegetation and soil conditions over the alluvial plain was executed. This analysis was completed with a colonisation survey for the rare species of dry river grasslands in newly generated habitat after two consecutive flood peak periods of the mid-nineties and the beginning of this century. Comparative analysis of the recruitment over the different meadow types was done by defining a colonisation rate per type. In the DCA ordination the dry river grasslands appeared separated from the other floodplain meadow communities, and the rare river corridor plants showed a strong preference to the pioneer dry river grasslands. These communities are restricted to the gravel or sandy deposits on the more elevated parts of the floodplain. A significant isolation of the river corridor plant relics was revealed. As for the cause of this isolation, the colonisation analysis indicated recruitment limitation to be the major threat for survival of most of the river corridor plants. Colonisation rates were high for species from all vegetation types, the exceptional low values are caused by disconnection of flood contact. The recovery of populations depends strongly on flood contact and possibilities for recruitment in the creation of new habitat. Synthesis and applications: The hypothesis of conservation of relics of river corridor plant populations outside the river dynamic influence was withdrawn. This shows that the construction of conservation and rehabilitation strategies for species at risk needs a good knowledge of key processes that determine the species survival at the regional scale. Although the dry river grasslands and its river corridor species are sensitive to flooding, we determined the need for dynamic flooding processes in the creation of habitat and in the dispersal and recruitment, and thus the sustainable conservation of these species.

These species differ with respect to their abundance in riverine and dune slack habitats, with Trifolium repens mainly occurring in riverine grasslands and Trifolium fragiferum in coastal dune slacks. Soil flooding decreased survival and regrowth by up to 80 %. Plants originating from riverine grasslands were less negatively affected by fragmentation than plants from dune slack habitats. Surprisingly, ramets did not always benefit from being attached to a larger internode, as internode size was often negatively correlated with survival after fragmentation. Regrowth, on the other hand, was generally positively correlated with internode size. These unexpected results indicate that there may be contrasting selection pressures on internode size in stoloniferous species growing in severely disturbed habitats.",0.589540143,NA

These grasslands are dominated by C-3 and C-4 grasses, and in a lesser extent to herbaceous plants, shrubs and dispersed trees, with some exceptions in particular regions. Previous to the introduction of large herbivores, at the beginning of the XVII century, like cattle and horses, shrubs and tall grasses dominated the vegetation. Then, associated with greater grazing pressure and partially due to fire, the original campos are maintained, actually in a pseudo climax herbaceous phase. These native communities are highly stable, adapted to long periods of water stress and flooding. Campos are generally grazed at continuos stocking all year around by sheep, cattle and horses. With the exceptions of the secondary plant successions, the summer growing species (C-4) dominate the campos vegetation, having a high relative frequency (75%). Continuos grazing and coarse summer grasses contribute to decrease the frequency of winter species (C-3). There is a high spatial and temporal variation in the native communities related to the type of soil, texture, water capacity, topography, altitude, management, etc., which determinate the different proportions of vegetation types and botanical compositions. The temporal variation is mainly associated with climatic factors, principally rainfall, affecting the variability of the annual dry matter production of campos vegetation (CV = 40 to 50%). The range of annual forage production of campos vegetation varies between 2.5 (shallow and low fertility soils) to 7.0 ton DM ha(-1) (deep and fertile soils). Most of the annual forage production is mainly concentrated in spring and summer, reaching 70-80% and 60-70% in shallow and deep soils, respectively. Grazing management, and particularly the stocking rate utilised, is the principal factor determining changes in the botanical composition in this type of vegetation. In general, the use stocking rates greater than I stock unit ha(-1), for longer periods, causes reductions in forage production, associated with increases and decreases in the frequency of productive species and weeds/shrubs/forbs, respectively. Pasture degradation is even greater, when high stocking rates are applied in conjunction with the use of high sheep/cattle ratios (e.g. 5: 1). The use of rotational grazing systems enhances pasture production by 12% as well as pasture utilisation. When continuos stocking is applied, it is difficult to achieve pasture utilisation greater than 50%. Avoiding overgrazing in degraded vegetation, it is possible to obtain a recovery in pasture conditions, while the degradation caused by continuos cropping is unrecoverable. Animal production is negatively affected when herbage mass or sward height are lower than 1000kg DM ha(-1) or 5-6cm,respectively. Animal selectivity allows sheep and cattle to have a greater crude protein (33 and 22% respectively) and metabolisable energy (15 and 11% respectively) levels than those obtained in the pasture offered. The use application of low quantities of nitrogen and phosphate on native vegetation increase forage production and nutritive value by 50%, enhancing the contribution of winter species (C-3) in the sward. Legume introduction by overseeding increases native pasture production by 60-100% and pasture nutritive value by 50-100%, particularly during winter. This response is associated with the contribution of the introduced species and additionally by the increments in proportions of the native winter species (C-3), resulting in a higher plan community biodiversity. Improved pastures permit to obtain 4 to 5 times greater secondary production than those unimproved.

Avoiding overgrazing in degraded vegetation, it is possible to obtain a recovery in pasture conditions, while the degradation caused by continuos cropping is unrecoverable. Animal production is negatively affected when herbage mass or sward height are lower than 1000kg DM ha(-1) or 5-6cm,respectively. Animal selectivity allows sheep and cattle to have a greater crude protein (33 and 22% respectively) and metabolisable energy (15 and 11% respectively) levels than those obtained in the pasture offered. The use application of low quantities of nitrogen and phosphate on native vegetation increase forage production and nutritive value by 50%, enhancing the contribution of winter species (C-3) in the sward. Legume introduction by overseeding increases native pasture production by 60-100% and pasture nutritive value by 50-100%, particularly during winter. This response is associated with the contribution of the introduced species and additionally by the increments in proportions of the native winter species (C-3), resulting in a higher plan community biodiversity. Improved pastures permit to obtain 4 to 5 times greater secondary production than those unimproved. The generated scientific knowledge has contributed to apply better pasture management practices, which resulted in biological and economical benefits to the fanner community and the whole society in the longer time, with special care of animal and plant communities biodiversity and water conservation for human and animal use. Both animals and plants will be for a long time our main source of food and fibre in the world, hence conditioning our actions and behaviour in the manner that we conserve our natural resources for the future generations.",0.578510359,NA

One key consideration is the growth rate of dominant trees, as tree age and size are linked to characteristics that provide fauna habitat, such as canopy cover, tree hollows and coarse woody debris. In this study we examined growth rate and mortality of Eucalyptus species for all individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 15 cm on forty one-ha sites in temperate semi-arid woodland in eastern Australia. Over five years (2008-2013) encompassing drought and flood, mean growth was <2.5 cm in DBH. Mixed effects models indicated that growth rate differed among species, and decreased with increasing senescence and greater initial foliage projective cover on the site. There was no link between initial tree DBH and growth rate for most species. Growth in DBH was similarly variable in large and small trees. Consequently increases in cross-sectional area, and hence biomass accumulation, are likely to be faster in larger trees. Growth of E. microcarpa, E. camaldulensis, E. blakelyi and E. conica did not significantly differ but was faster than that of E. populnea and E. melliodora. The random factors site and tree identity (for multi-stemmed trees) explained around 10% and 30% of the overall variability in growth rate respectively. Twelve trees (similar to 1%) died and 4 live trees were cut down and removed. Five (6.5%) of the 75 standing dead trees present in 2008 collapsed, and a further eight (10.5%) were cut down and removed by people. Forty saplings of four species with DBH < 15 cm in 2008 grew to DBH >= 15 cm by 2013, equating to a recruitment rate of <4%, but this occurred on only nine of the 40 sites. Our study suggests mortality rate is being met by recruitment rate at the regional scale, but recruitment was extremely patchy and may result in site scale extinctions.

To what extent do time since raised water levels, vegetation management and water regime influence community composition? Location: Pevensey Levels, southeast England, UK. Methods: Plant communities and hydrology were monitored during 2001-03 within 23 wet grassland meadows and pastures where water levels had been raised for nature conservation at different times over 21 years. Community variations were examined using species abundance and ecological traits. Results: Water regime, measured as duration of flooding, groundwater level and soil moisture was significantly related to plant community variation. Communities were divided into grasslands where inundation was shallow (<= 8cm) and relatively short (<= 3 months) and sites where deeper flooding was prolonged (>= 5 months), supporting a variety of wetland vegetation. With increasing wetness, sites were characterised by more bare ground and wetland plants such as sedges, helophytes and hydrophytes, and species with a stress-tolerating competitive strategy.

There were no significant relationships between time since water levels were raised and plant community composition.

","Burrowing activity by armadillos in agroecosystems of central Argentina: Biogeography, land use, and rainfall effects Land use change and agricultural practices are among the main factors affecting biodiversity, and require understanding of how differing species responses shape wildlife communities in rural landscapes. During the last 2-3 decades, the Pampas of central Argentina have experienced an agricultural expansion along with rapid adoption of a non-tillage system. In some areas armadillos are increasingly considered agricultural pests, not only because they can damage and contaminate silo bags and may act as direct consumers of crops, but also their burrowing activities interfere with farming practices. Here, we describe variations in activity of armadillos in the Pampas of Buenos Aires province, central Argentina, and discuss how biogeography, land use, and rainfall may have affected these species in the rural landscape. We carried out four sampling sessions between December 2011 and June 2013 (including two periods of normal rainfall and two periods of high rainfall), surveying 392 plots (196 crop fields and 196 rangelands) at 25 different localities (covering the five different ecological units of the Pampas). In each plot, we surveyed for signs (burrows and holes) along a 600 x 6 m transect, in order to assess armadillo activity. Chaetophractus villosus (large hairy armadillo) showed the highest activity, with 5968 signs at 79% of the plots surveyed; whereas, 1866 signs of Dasypus hybridus (southern long-nosed armadillo) were found in 36% of the plots. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that C villosus is more active mainly in the Inland Pampas and in cropland plots, whereas, D. hybridus is more active in the Flooding Pampas at plots with active livestock use. Both species showed less burrowing activity during the second year of surveys, in a period of exceptionally high rainfall. Our results suggest that the omnivorous C. villosus may have benefited from agriculturization and non-tillage, particularly in the Inland Pampas where sandy soils favor burrowing, whereas, the more myrmecophagous D. hybridus may be in retraction.

Some regions will be strongly impacted by climate change, others by agricultural intensification, and others by both. Soil microbial communities are integral components of terrestrial ecosystems, but their responses to multiple perturbations are poorly understood. Here, we exposed soils from sustainably- or intensively-managed grasslands in an agro-silvo-pastoral oak woodland to month-long intensified drought and flood simulation treatments in a controlled mesocosm setting. We monitored the response of the bacterial communities at the end of one month as well as during the following month of recovery. The communities in sustainably-managed plots under all precipitation regimes were richer and more diverse than those in intensively-managed plots, and contained a lower proportion of rapidly-growing taxa. Soils from both land managements exhibited changes in bacterial community composition in response to flooding, but only intensively-managed soils were affected by drought. The ecologies of bacteria favored by both drought and flood point to both opportunism and stress tolerance as key traits shaping the community following disturbance.

In the presented study, such analysis was applied to fen ecosystems. Study areas were river valleys and eutrophic lakes in The Netherlands and in Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost state of Germany. At these sites high fen degradation has taken place and restoration strategies such as ""recovery of peat-forming systems"" and ""development of species-rich fen grasslands"" have recently been pursued. Based on an indirect successional analysis, we derived characteristic shifts of abiotic (hydrodynamics, soil parameter) and biotic (species composition, phytomass production) ecosystem traits relative to increasing land use intensity. Species richness and nature conservation value (NCV) initially increased and afterwards decreased during the process of land use intensification. This floristic change was accompanied by an initial decrease and subsequent increase in system productivity. Indicators for P-availability showed the same trend and there was evidence that nutrient limitation changed initially from N- (tall sedge reeds) to P- or P/N (co)-limitation (small sedge reeds) and afterwards again to N-limitation (wet and mesic grasslands). The successional analysis documented the abiotic requirements of vegetation types and their characteristic species, and thus, allowed for the use of these ecosystem traits as indicators to evaluate the success of specific restoration targets. For example, the decrease of Scheuchzerio-Caricetea species could be related more directly to reduced light availability than to an increase of the groundwater tables. Furthermore, we calculated threshold values of these traits for the occurrence of target species. For instance, a sustainable establishment of light-demanding mesotrophic species can only be expected if the standing crop value is less than 400 g m(-2). In a further step, we estimated the restoration success in selected study areas by applying the findings of the successional analysis. Results showed that rewetting measures have to be carried out with caution if both restoration strategies are aspired in one specific area.

A case study of breeding waders on grassland,"We review published studies to show that changes in soil moisture levels have significant impacts on a range of wading bird species that use UK lowland grassland, including wet grassland, and obtain their food predominantly by probing the soil. We examine both the hydrological and the ecological literature and assess how management options could alter (1) ecosystem services (via water quality and flooding) and (2) habitat quality for wading birds.

We surveyed the seed bank composition of the five dominant plant communities before and after the flood. We also measured selected soil physico-chemical properties in each community. We used univariate and multivariate methods to examine the effect of the flood on both seed bank and soil physico-chemical properties. Flooding resulted in variable deposition of sediment within the plant communities; four communities varied from 14.6 to 18.8 cm but the fifth (dominated by Miscanthus sacchariflorus) had much less sediment (4.8 cm).

Selected statements 'were submitted to former interviewees for rating from complete disagreement to complete agreement as well as to farmers of 12 different turloughs with SAC-status. Principal components analysis of these ratings leads to a typology of stakeholders according to the way they respond to the implementation of Natura 2000, to the changing agenda of CAP, and how this influences turlough management. The results show that farmers' and conservationists' perspectives are less opposed than expected and that this opposition is better described as mutual ignorance of each other's expertise. This calls for a better communication strategy to turn conflict into compromise. We suggest three pathways to do this: making better use of the local farmers' press, fostering users' input by the close collaboration with an agriculturalist and an ecologist on a farm-to-farm basis and a marketing approach that values agricultural produce from marginal land for its intrinsic qualities.

II: Ecological, conservation, and management implications of predator restoration","Conserving African wildlife in human-occupied landscapes requires management intervention that is guided by a mechanistic understanding of how anthropogenic factors influence large-scale ecological processes. In Laikipia District, a dry savanna region in northern Kenya where wildlife share the landscape with humans and livestock, we examined why five of nine wild ungulate species suffered protracted declines on properties receiving the greatest conservation investment. Of 10 alternative causes examined, only an increase in predation, interacting with brief periods of high and low rainfall, was consistent with the timing, synchrony, duration and species composition of observed ungulate declines. The principal factor causing predation to increase was a shift in land use from cattle ranching, under which predators and plains zebras were severely suppressed, to wildlife conservation and ecotourism. This prompted a 5-fold increase in plains zebra abundance, and created a demand for living predators.

Methods We assessed the effects of 40-d of flooding, trampling and the combination thereof on plant cover and biomass, vertical distribution of foliage and floristic composition in lowland grassland mesocosms. We considered a 120-d recovery period to evaluate the persistence of flooding and trampling effects on the plant community. Results Flooding, with or without trampling, increased cover and biomass of the graminoid species, especially marsh grasses, which developed a taller canopy, whereas most of the forb species were negatively affected. This was enhanced by trampling, as the aerial biomass of the dominant legume Lotus tenuis decreased by 90%, while three major forb species disappeared. Trampling under flooding conditions did not reduce the total above-ground biomass production, as the growth enhancement of graminoids was enough to compensate for the breakdown of the forbs. Below-ground biomass was lower when both perturbations occurred simultaneously. After 120-d of recovery, graminoids continued to be dominant while the remaining forbs (including L. tenuis) recovered only partially.

Fossil pollen records were interpreted in terms of palaeoenvironmental information using the modern pollen-vegetation-climate relationship as an analogue. Although an exact analogue does not exist today, Late glacial vegetation consisted mostly of psammophytic steppe in large areas of the central and southwestern Pampa grassland which, in the south west, is associated with a shrub steppe, suggesting subhumid-dry to semi-arid climatic conditions. The replacement of dry steppe by humid grassland and the rapid evolution of pond environments during the early Holocene (starting during the Late glacial-Holocene transition) suggests a shift towards subhumid to humid climate conditions. The Late glacial-Holocene transition is indicated in the pollen records by repeated abrupt changes in the proportions and concentrations of some taxa, such as Brassicaceae, Asteraceae and Carduus-type. In the modern vegetation they represent species of common occurrence in human-induced disturbance habitats, suggesting an environment that was subject to frequent natural disturbance such as rapid and repeated flooding episodes that inundated the depressions along the valley floodplains, caused by unusual rainfall events, Some species of Carduus may have been native and not introduced by the Europeans, suggesting that Late glacial vegetation of the Pampa grasslands may account for the abundance of ruderal species.

Glinus lotoides was in higher abundance in the grazed area and Alternanthera denticulata, Persicaria lapathifolium, Polygonum plebium, Typha domingensis and Centipeda cunninghamii in the ungrazed area. Similarly, the final communities derived from the grazed and ungrazed areas were significantly different from each other (NPMANOVA: F-1,F-10 = 15.53, P = 0.0032). Greater numbers of Centipeda cunninghamii were present in the community from the grazed area and Alternanthera denticulata and Cuscuta campestris were present in larger numbers in the community from the ungrazed area. Water depth also had an impact on germination; no germination occurred in seed banks flooded to 50 cm and one Typha domingensis seedling was observed in a sample flooded to 5 cm. These results showed that grazing reduces the density and species richness of the seed bank and in turn changes the plant communities derived from the seed bank; however, if grazing is removed pest plants such as Cuscuta campestris may require control. In addition, managed drawdown or water-level fluctuations are important in exposing wetland sediments and allowing for species to recruit from the seed bank.",0.510579286,NA

The model describes a heterogeneous environment composed by several patches of grassland, only related by seed dispersal. The last burn date at each patch determines the accumulation level of fuel-biomass provided by a third, dominant species, which in turn controls for the exclusion rate of both colonizer species. The population dynamics of both species was approached following density-dependent models and parameterized for two opposite dispersal strategies: low spatial and high temporal dispersion of seeds (type 1), high spatial and low temporal dispersion of seeds (type 2). Only under the most variable scenarios (when non-synchronous and irregular fire regimes were combined with a proportion of patches (p) with initially depleted seed banks) did the relative success of dispersal strategies vary with the length of the lire-free period. Irrespective of p, smaller interval lengths favored the postburn density of the strategy 1. Strategy 2 was favored over strategy 1 when the fire-free interval increased, such difference being maximum for intermediate p-values. These general tendencies agree with those observed from a reference system: the Flooding Pampa grasslands dominated by Paspalum quadrifarium where short no-fire intervals promote the postburn abundance of a type 1 species (Lotus tenuis) over two type 2 species (Carduus acanthoides and Cirsium vulgare) while for long fire-free intervals the opposite is true. This results suggest that frequency, time since last burn, and burning synchrony are useful components of a fire regime to take advantage of variation in dispersal strategies.

Irrespective of p, smaller interval lengths favored the postburn density of the strategy 1. Strategy 2 was favored over strategy 1 when the fire-free interval increased, such difference being maximum for intermediate p-values. These general tendencies agree with those observed from a reference system: the Flooding Pampa grasslands dominated by Paspalum quadrifarium where short no-fire intervals promote the postburn abundance of a type 1 species (Lotus tenuis) over two type 2 species (Carduus acanthoides and Cirsium vulgare) while for long fire-free intervals the opposite is true. This results suggest that frequency, time since last burn, and burning synchrony are useful components of a fire regime to take advantage of variation in dispersal strategies. ","Dispersal strategies, spatial heterogeneity and colonization success in fire-managed grasslands Interactions between fire regime, dispersal strategies and patch structure were examined as key issues for the management of floristic composition of grasslands, through a model that simulates the population dynamics of two competing fire-cued and non-sprouting species. The model describes a heterogeneous environment composed by several patches of grassland, only related by seed dispersal. The last burn date at each patch determines the accumulation level of fuel-biomass provided by a third, dominant species, which in turn controls for the exclusion rate of both colonizer species.

Exotic dicots generated lysigenous aerenchyma throughout their cortex; in contrast, native dicot species maintained the cell layers adjacent to the stele. A lag in the development of secondary growth during flooding was detected in both groups of dicots, a response that was particularly evident in the exotic species, contrasting with their prominent growth under nonflooded conditions. In general, our results indicate that constitutive and plastic root traits are very significant in terms of the effects of periodic flooding on the abundance of coexisting species of the flooding pampa grasslands.",0.499850548,NA

Late summer applications of glyphosate greatly reduced the biomass contribution of warm-season perennial grasses and legumes and increased the contribution of cool season annual grasses, altering the seasonal pattern of ANPP. As the reduction of the spring and summer productivity could not be compensated by the increase of cool-season productivity, the annual ANPP was lower in the glyphosate-treated paddocks than in control paddocks.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that ancient raised fields were ""re-engineered"" by non-human soil organisms, leading to their maintenance against erosion. In a raised-field landscape in a seasonally flooded coastal savanna of French Guiana, we characterized the distribution of soil macro-invertebrates (ants, termites, earthworms) and plant roots between ancient raised fields (in this site, circular mounds) and inter-mound areas and between dry and wet seasons, and quantified the influence of these organisms on soil physical properties and texture. Social insect colonies were highly concentrated in mound soils; their density and species richness were maintained across seasons.

This paper reviews the relationship between wetlands and agriculture with the aim to identify the successes and failures of agricultural use in different types of wetlands, with reference to short-term and long-term benefits and issues of sustainability.

Finally, attention is paid to the development of more flood-tolerant crop cultivars. Agriculture has been carried out in several types of (former) wetlands for millennia, with crop fields on river floodplain soils and rice fields as major examples. However, intensive agricultural use of drained/reclaimed peatlands has been shown to lead to major problems because of the oxidation and subsidence of the peat soil. This does not only lead to severe carbon dioxide emissions, but also results in low-lying land which needs to be protected against flooding. Developments in South-East Asia, where vast areas of tropical peatlands are being converted into oil palm plantations, are of great concern in this respect.

Seed deposition in riparian landscapes occurs mainly within litter in drift lines. We investigated whether conditions within drift lines are suitable for seed survival and germination and whether drift lines act as seed sources or sinks for species diversity in riparian fen grasslands. We analysed drift litter in a small river valley in Northern Germany (Upper Eider valley) after typical late winter floods in 2000, 2002 and 2004. The content of viable seeds in drift lines was studied via a germination trial with drift litter samples taken from five fen grassland sites representative of the vegetation of floodplain. Further, seedling recruitment of both abandoned and moderately grazed fen grasslands affected by drift line deposition was compared with equivalent sites without drift lines. Additionally, the decline of viable seeds after the deposition of drift litter was studied. Finally, the relative importance of seed-containing drift litter and microsite availability for seedling recruitment was investigated in a field experiment with the factors disturbance (mowing, large gaps, small gaps, undisturbed control) and addition of (seed-containing) drift litter (yes, no) in an abandoned riparian fen. Seedlings which recruited from drift litter collected at different sites differed in species composition. A nearly 50% reduction of the number of viable seeds in drift litter was observed already during 2 weeks after deposition. Naturally deposited drift lines had a positive effect on the number of seedlings, although an increase of seedling recruitment in areas with drift litter was only observed at the grazed site. Adding drift litter reduced the number of seedlings in the field experiment, while creating gaps enhanced seedling recruitment. These results indicate that in riparian fen grasslands, drift lines can affect species diversity either negatively by hampering germination and/or establishment or positively by increasing seed availability. As the studied river system is comparatively species poor and flooding extension is limited, the role of drift lines as seed source might be of minor importance in the study area.

These results indicate that in riparian fen grasslands, drift lines can affect species diversity either negatively by hampering germination and/or establishment or positively by increasing seed availability. As the studied river system is comparatively species poor and flooding extension is limited, the role of drift lines as seed source might be of minor importance in the study area.

Arrival at suitable sites for germination and establishment is crucial for hydrochorous plants. Seed deposition in riparian landscapes occurs mainly within litter in drift lines. We investigated whether conditions within drift lines are suitable for seed survival and germination and whether drift lines act as seed sources or sinks for species diversity in riparian fen grasslands. We analysed drift litter in a small river valley in Northern Germany (Upper Eider valley) after typical late winter floods in 2000, 2002 and 2004. The content of viable seeds in drift lines was studied via a germination trial with drift litter samples taken from five fen grassland sites representative of the vegetation of floodplain. Further, seedling recruitment of both abandoned and moderately grazed fen grasslands affected by drift line deposition was compared with equivalent sites without drift lines. Additionally, the decline of viable seeds after the deposition of drift litter was studied. Finally, the relative importance of seed-containing drift litter and microsite availability for seedling recruitment was investigated in a field experiment with the factors disturbance (mowing, large gaps, small gaps, undisturbed control) and addition of (seed-containing) drift litter (yes, no) in an abandoned riparian fen. Seedlings which recruited from drift litter collected at different sites differed in species composition. A nearly 50% reduction of the number of viable seeds in drift litter was observed already during 2 weeks after deposition. Naturally deposited drift lines had a positive effect on the number of seedlings, although an increase of seedling recruitment in areas with drift litter was only observed at the grazed site. Adding drift litter reduced the number of seedlings in the field experiment, while creating gaps enhanced seedling recruitment.

While some disturbances may be highly stochastic (e.g., flooding or landslides), other types of disturbance are closely linked to the current successional state of the community (e.g., fire or herbivory). For example, when herbivores preferentially feed on early successional species they may generate conditions favorable for these species and thus create a positive feedback. Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species, and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior, dispersal behavior, and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial-scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers, though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivore's territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase, then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case, fixed regions of the landscape. may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species, whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species.

Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species, and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior, dispersal behavior, and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial-scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers, though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivore's territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase, then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case, fixed regions of the landscape. may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species, whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species. This structuring of the landscape occurs even though we assume that the entire landscape is intrinsically identical.",0.464943834,NA

Grazing had no significant effect on the seed density and species richness, but altered the species composition of soil seed bank. Grazing tended to increase the floristic similarity between the soil seed bank and the above-ground vegetation. DCA ordination produced a clear separation of the soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation. Our results suggest that soil seed bank and its relation to standing vegetation in the Hei-wa-wu oxbow wetland are strongly influenced by livestock grazing.",0.458853563,NA

One of the main targets of river regulation with dams and dykes is the stabilization of highly fluctuating water tables. While there is information about the overall impact of such regulation measures on plant species composition and richness, far less is known about specific species' response patterns to reduced water level fluctuations. 2. The response of 30 common grassland species to soil moisture and water level fluctuations was assessed. Floristic data were collected from the floodplain of the Elbe River, Germany, from 182 plots, 99 within the recent floodplain and 83 in an older floodplain, separated from one another by dykes. Hydrological data were collected weekly over 2 years at 37 water level wells. Using logistic regression, the patterns of species' responses to hydrological regulation were predicted. 3. The majority of species responded significantly to water level fluctuations. Species of high elevation habitats occurred at lower elevations where water level fluctuations were reduced, indicating increasing drought at high elevation habitats. However, species that occurred in floodplain depressions tended to shift from lower to higher elevations to avoid permanent inundation. 4.

Vegetative growth is a colonization strategy especially important in regularly disturbed grasslands. In a salt marsh on the Baltic coast of Germany, we studied (i) the role of seedling recruitment and vegetative growth in recolonization of gaps, (ii) if gaps are necessary for seedling recruitment and (iii) whether gaps contribute to species diversity and composition of the salt marsh. We carried out a two-factorial field experiment during two years. We created 48 gaps of 0.04 m(2) in size in autumn 2006. We eliminated the seed bank by sterilization and prevented vegetative growth into these gaps with dense meshes. We used a full-factorial design with four treatments: (1) seed bank and vegetative growth eliminated, (2) seed bank eliminated and vegetative growth intact, (3) seed bank intact and vegetative growth eliminated, (4) both intact. Seedlings and ramets were counted in these gaps in summers 2007 and 2008. In the established vegetation we counted the dicot seedlings in 12 control plots without manipulation. Both seed bank and vegetative growth contributed to the recolonization of the gaps. Nevertheless, seedling establishment was limited due to flooding of the site for six weeks in summer 2007. Vegetative growth was more successful in recolonizing the gaps. No increase in species richness occurred due to gaps in this salt marsh.

Few studies have examined how wildlife is affected by extreme weather, and none have examined whether any resulting effects are contingent upon the degree of anthropogenic landscape change. Using an 8-year study in Canada (2003-2010), we examined how nest survival of burrowing owls Athene cunicularia varied in relation to weather, vegetation and soil type around the nest. Using a 3-year (1992, 1993 and 1996) feeding experiment, we examined whether food limitation also causes owlet mortality during inclement weather. Lastly, we examined how productivity (i.e. annual fledgling output) between 2003 and 2010 varied as a function of breeding season precipitation anomalies. Using this relationship, we estimated how productivity has changed in response to breeding season precipitation anomalies from 1960 to 2012. During extreme precipitation events, nest survival decreased because of flooding. When burrow flooding did not occur, the youngest owlets in broods that were not food-supplemented had the lowest survival rates when there was precipitation, yetalmost all food-supplemented owlets survived bouts of inclement weather. Accordingly, annual productivity from 2003 to 2010 varied inversely with breeding season precipitation anomalies, and we estimated that mean annual productivity decreased by 12% from 1960 to 2012.Synthesis and applications.

Two application rates (1 and 3 L m(-2)) of the commercially available fire retardant, Fire Trol 934, were used to simulate environmentally realistic contamination scenarios for wetlands situated in Mediterranean grasslands and shrublands, respectively. Two contrasting emergence conditions (winter versus spring flooding conditions) were simulated to take into account the high inter- and intra-annual variability of pond filling in Mediterranean areas. Results showed a decrease in abundance (p < 0.001), taxonomic richness (p < 0.001) and biodiversity based on Shannon-Weaver diversity indices (p < 0.001) in both wetlands and under both emergence conditions with increased retardant application rate.

Soil macroinvertebrates are important prey for breeding wading birds on lowland wet grassland. This study quantified the response of soil macroinvertebrates to flooding, their ability to survive in flooded grassland, and changes in the abundance and physical availability of soil macroinvertebrates for feeding wading birds as flood water subsides. 3. Unflooded grasslands contained high biomasses of soil macroinvertebrates, comprising mainly Tipulidae larvae and earthworm species that are widespread in pastures. Grasslands with a long history of winter flooding contained much lower biomasses of soil macroinvertebrates, comprising mainly a limited range of semi-aquatic earthworm species. 4. Introducing winter flooding to previously unflooded grassland greatly reduced soil macroinvertebrate biomass. This was mainly due to the majority of earthworms vacating the soil soon after the onset of flooding. However, when earthworms were artificially confined in flooded soils, most species were capable of surviving periods of at least 120 days continual submergence. Winter flooding also expelled large numbers of overwintering arthropods from the soil. 5. Soil macroinvertebrates were slow to recolonize winter-flooded grassland when it was re-immersed in spring. Consequently, prey biomass for breeding wading birds remained low in areas that had been flooded during the preceding winter. However, winter flooding probably benefited breeding snipe by helping keep the soil soft enough for them to probe for prey. It also probably benefited breeding lapwings and redshank by helping keep the sward short and open enough for them to feed in during the latter part of their breeding season.

Analyses revealed that on the plant material plots seed density of plant material species declined significantly with soil depth, just as similarity between above ground vegetation and seed bank declined. In contrast, the seed bank on control plots comprised significantly lower numbers of transferred species. We found a vertical pattern of seed bank composition: in general, the upper seed bank layer comprised more elongated and large seeds of long-lived, competitive species able to build up transient seed bank.

In this highly dynamic habitat, many typical plant species rely on a persistent seed bank for re-establishment after disturbance. But in contrast to the re-established above ground vegetation, seed bank composition remains unknown. Thus the main aims of the study were to elucidate the current seed bank composition and to assess patterns of seed and species traits. To this end we sampled above ground vegetation and seed bank on plant material plots and on control plots left to natural recruitment. Although the seed bank was still dominated by agrestal and ruderal plant species, it already contained seeds of transferred species. Analyses revealed that on the plant material plots seed density of plant material species declined significantly with soil depth, just as similarity between above ground vegetation and seed bank declined. In contrast, the seed bank on control plots comprised significantly lower numbers of transferred species. We found a vertical pattern of seed bank composition: in general, the upper seed bank layer comprised more elongated and large seeds of long-lived, competitive species able to build up transient seed bank. The lower soil layer was dominated by seeds of short-lived, agrestal and ruderal species, producing small, round and long-term persistent seeds. The present study shows that the build up of a seed bank typical of flood meadows is a time-consuming process. Thus restorative management in the early phase of vegetation development should focus on fostering high seed production of transferred species. ",0.437634051,NA

General linear models and non-parametric tests were used to assess successional trends in seed bank richness, density, similarity to target vegetation and percentage of flooded meadow species to assess the restoration potential of the soil seed bank.

The results showed that both N addition and growth stage of rice could affect physiochemical properties of rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil simultaneously. At tillering stage, no significant difference of bacterial and archaeal gene abundance was observed, but rhizospheric abundance of microorganisms was significantly different with non-rhizosphere at ripening stage. One-way ANOVA analysis indicated that N addition has greater effect on microbial structure diversity of bacteria rather than archaea, non-rhizosphere than rhizosphere, respectively.

The results showed that both N addition and growth stage of rice could affect physiochemical properties of rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil simultaneously. At tillering stage, no significant difference of bacterial and archaeal gene abundance was observed, but rhizospheric abundance of microorganisms was significantly different with non-rhizosphere at ripening stage. One-way ANOVA analysis indicated that N addition has greater effect on microbial structure diversity of bacteria rather than archaea, non-rhizosphere than rhizosphere, respectively. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed two groups of bacterial community both in rhizospheric and in non-rhizospheric soils at tillering stage differing much, but similar at ripening stage. Redundancy analysis showed that the microbial community compositions at tillering stage were most correlated with NH4 (+), total N (TN), pH, microbial biomass N (N-mic) and microbial biomass carbon (C-mir) whereas at ripening stage were more or less lined with Olsen-P, C/N ratio, total C (TC) and available K.

Animal species targeted for recovery include the greater sage-grouse (Great Basin shrublands), the red-cockaded woodpecker (longleaf pine forest), the south-western willow flycatcher (Colorado River and its tributaries), the desert tortoise (Mojave Desert), eight salmonid fish (Elwha River), and the blue crab and eastern oyster (Chesapeake Bay).","Impacts on ecosystems, corrective restoration practices, and prospects for recovery: nine case studies in the continental United States Ecological restoration in the United States is growing in terms of the number, size, and diversity of projects.

The average observed within-population genetic diversity was high and suggests that river regulation and associated fragmentation of the populations have not strongly affected genetic diversity.

Twenty-two genotypes of rice representing the diversity found in West Africa, and including Oryza sativa indica and japonica, Oryza glaberrima and O. sativa x O. glaberrima progenies, were grown in a controlled environment (CE) under flooded (lowland) and free-drained (upland) hydrologies at I I and 13 h photoperiods combined with mean temperatures of 22 and 28 degreesC. A simple model describing f in terms of a BVP, photoperiod-sensitive phase (PSP) and post-PSP was used to analyse variation in f.

For low-gradient river food webs, aquatic C3 plants were the principal carbon source, contributing as much as 80% of carbon assimilated by top consumers, with phytoplankton secondarily important. The estimated relative importance of phytoplankton was greatest for food webs of reservoirs and river stretches downriver from impoundments, although aquatic C3 plants contributed similar amounts in both landscape types. Highest 99th percentile source contribution estimates for C-4 plants and filamentous algae (both approximately 40%) were observed for high-gradient river food webs.

For low-gradient river food webs, aquatic C3 plants were the principal carbon source, contributing as much as 80% of carbon assimilated by top consumers, with phytoplankton secondarily important. The estimated relative importance of phytoplankton was greatest for food webs of reservoirs and river stretches downriver from impoundments, although aquatic C3 plants contributed similar amounts in both landscape types. Highest 99th percentile source contribution estimates for C-4 plants and filamentous algae (both approximately 40%) were observed for high-gradient river food webs. Our results for low-gradient rivers supported predictions of the Flood Pulse Concept, whereas results for the three other landscape types supported the Riverine Productivity Model to varying degrees. Incorporation of landscape-scale hydrologic or geomorphic characteristics, such as river slope or floodplain width, may promote integration of fluvial ecosystem concepts. Expanding these models to include hydrologically impacted landscapes should lead to a more holistic understanding of ecosystem processes in large-river systems.","Landscape-scale hydrologic characteristics differentiate patterns of carbon flow in large-river food webs Efforts to conserve, restore, or otherwise manage large rivers and the services they provide are hindered by limited understanding of the functional dynamics of these systems.

An integral part of any coastal management strategy throughout European countries is the ""do nothing"" scenario; this is the benchmark against which putative intervention strategies are evaluated. While the prime concern of a flood defense scheme appraisal often focuses on the sustained financial ""benefits"" of an intervention, intrinsic to a complete multicriteria analysis is a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological and social consequences of coastal flooding, reflecting the needs of end users and satisfying relevant national and international policies. An ecological perspective may be usefully employed to examine the impact of the do nothing option on coastal environments (e.g. estuaries, sand dunes and grasslands) and businesses. Although at first sight coastal environmental and business systems appear quite different, they have similarities in that both are vulnerable and susceptible to flood damage or loss and both may be analyzed by employing ecological, adaptive, resilience frameworks. From an ecological perspective many coastal environments are of international conservation importance and provide important ecosystem services including coastal protection, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, food production and recreation. Nonetheless, despite their potential vulnerability to coastal flooding, our understanding of the effects of salinity on the biological response of many coastal plants and animals is extremely limited. We show here how plant physiology and patterns of plant and invertebrate distribution are impacted by sea water flooding. We also present responses of model plants to sea water inundation based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) predictions of sea level rise and storm surge events. Results showed that coastal habitats surveyed are relatively resilient to flooding due to their species rich nature and their ability to adapt to flooding. However specific groups of plants such as grasses are more affected by flooding and less able to recover. The socio-economic dimensions of doing nothing are addressed in relation to the impacts of coastal flooding specifically on business activity, which has received little attention to date. Here the focus is on the presence or absence of business disruption and recovery plans as a means of increasing a business's adaptation and resilience to flooding. Results show that some businesses, particularly small ones, are more likely to fail to recover from flooding due to lack of forward planning. Therefore from an ecological perspective business recovery post flooding is likely to be dependent upon ability to adapt, which itself depends upon the construction of resilient business environments.

This study investigated how the cost of acquiring metal tolerance affected the responses of such communities to secondary stressors (stress-onstress). We studied soil microbial communities living in soils polluted by metals to different degrees, sampled along two metal pollution gradients in Poland. We hypothesized that communities adapted to high concentrations of metals would be more susceptible to additional stressors that they had not previously encountered (benzo[a]pyrene and salt), compared to communities exposed to low concentrations of metals. In contrast, metal-adapted communities were expected to be more stable when exposed to stress factors within the same category of toxicity or to stress factors that periodically occur naturally, such as arsenic and flooding. In 60-day microcosm experiments, phospholipid fatty acid (PLEA) profiles were used to compare changes in microbial communities sampled from the field and exposed to four different additional stressors. Our results showed that, regardless of existing pollution, additional stress restructured the microbial communities similarly in all soils. However, salt and flooding stress had stronger effects on community structure than arsenic and benzo[a]pyrene. PLFAs indicative of fungi, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria generally declined under stress relative to unspecific PLFAs (such as 16:0 and 18:0). This trend may be caused by the inhibition or suppression of sensitive microbial groups and selection of tolerant groups by the stressors applied and also because of the proliferation of fast-growing species under stress conditions. Overall, our study showed that metaltolerant communities that have been selected in the field over many years are not more susceptible to additional stress than communities exposed to low concentrations of metals; thus, adaptation in these microbes has evolved without apparent costs.
