"2","desert","How to Bloom the Green Desert: Eucalyptus Plantations and Native Forests in Uruguay beyond Black and White Perspectives","The ongoing debate on the boon or bane of monocultural timber plantations demonstrates the need to develop alternative approaches that achieve forest productivity while conserving biodiversity. We assessed the diversity of tree species in native forests and in Eucalyptus plantations, and evaluated the potential use of native species to enhance plantation management. For this purpose, we established one-hectare permanent plots in nine native forests (riverine and park forests) and nine Eucalyptus plantations in the northwestern part of Uruguay. Forest inventories were carried out on 200 m(2) plots and regeneration was assessed along transects in 9 m(2) subplots. Riverine forests have the highest Shannon diversity index (2.5) followed by park forests (2.1) and Eucalyptus plantations (1.3). Tree density was high in riverine forests (1913/ha) and plantations (1315/ha), whereas park forests have lower tree density (796/ha). Regeneration density was high in riverine forests (39136/ha) and park forests (7500/ha); however, native species can regenerate in the understory of plantations (727/ha), and this underlines the possibility of developing a mixed species approach to reduce the negative impact of monocultures. Differences in the composition of plant communities were denoted between native forests and plantations, although native forests were similar in composition, even in the presence of exotic species. Native forests harbor specialist species that are absent from plantations, and therefore perform a decisive role in maintaining local biodiversity. Strategies to enhance species diversity and structural diversity within plantations or to establish mixed buffer strips containing native species at the edge of plantations are potential measures to enhance biodiversity and foster the integration of plantations into the local landscape.","WOS:000448550700033",285,0.924211805,1
"3","desert","Maintenance of richness despite reduced abundance of desert bees ( Hymenoptera: Apiformes) to persistent grazing","Anthropogenic changes to ecosystems typically result in decreased species richness and abundance relative to that of adjacent semi-pristine or pristine areas. Yet, there is debate about the generality of this result for bees given that most studies have included extremely disturbed areas and are from a limited set of biogeographical areas. Repeat sampling of an unusually specialised, species-rich bee community was done in the north-western Chihuahuan Desert, North America at sites in five habitats (riparian, mesquite forest, abandoned field, grassland, and desert scrub) that either had been intensely grazed by cattle in the previous year or not been grazed for 22+ years. Species density and species composition of bees did not change in response to grazing, abundance and proportion of singleton species (those represented by one specimen) did. In all habitats, other than the riparian, there was lower overall abundance and a greater proportion of singleton species at sites that had been recently grazed than at sites that had not been grazed since 1979. The proportion of singletons was greater in recently grazed than in long-term ungrazed areas, but pollen-specialist species did not respond more strongly than pollen generalists. The substantial variation in bee abundance and rarity was probably associated with differences in floral resources. Overall, lower bee abundance in grazed areas reflects the continuous removal by grazers of the flowers that bees use. Despite reduced bee abundance due to long-term grazing, species richness, and composition in this desert bee community remained high.","WOS:000335471900007",9,0.894215874,1
"4","desert","Grazing promotes dung beetle diversity in the xeric landscape of a Mexican Biosphere Reserve","We analyze the impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity at the Barranca de Metztitlan Biosphere Reserve, a xeric ecosystem in central Mexico with a long history of use by humans. We compared the community structure, as well as the alpha and beta diversity between two cover conditions (open and closed vegetation) that represent the impact of grazing within a habitat, and between habitat types (submountainous and crassicaule scrublands). From 576 samples we collected 75,605 dung beetles belonging to 20 taxa. While mean species richness and diversity were different between habitat types, cumulative species richness was not. The effects of grazing on vegetation structure influenced the cumulative species richness and diversity of dung beetles in the submountainous scrubland, where grazing has created land mosaics of a grassland matrix with scrubland patches. This was not the case in the crassicaule scrubland where the impact of grazing is not as evident. Beta diversity significantly responds to the effects of grazing on habitat conditions. We discuss the ecological factors that may promote these responses by landscape diversity components. We also identify the species that could act as useful indicators to monitor the effect of land management on biodiversity. Our results indicate cattle farming maintains a diversified land mosaic, and these areas support more diverse dung beetle ensembles than homogeneous areas of closed, shrubby vegetation cover. Thus, controlled grazing activity could certainly favour the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and improve ecosystem functioning by maintaining dung decomposition rates.","WOS:000251210800011",18,0.878043711,1
"5","desert","Effect of landscape and stand variables on tree species diversity in the understory of Pinus taeda plantations in Misiones province","Forest plantations are within the most important productive activities in Misiones, Argentina. Afforestations are strongly criticized under the idea that are green deserts, non suitable as habitat for native fauna. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the regeneration of native tree species in the understory of Pinus taeda plantations and the influence of stand and landscape variables in the northwest of Misiones, Argentina. Plantations presenting different ages, previous land uses and landscape contexts were sampled. A total of 91 native tree species were found in the forest understory, and the most abundant were animal-dispersed tree species. The native tree composition of plantations understory was different from that of native forest. The similarity analysis revealed that old plantations were more similar to native forest than to young plantations. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that previous land use was the variable with more influence on the understory composition, followed by the basal area and the distance to the native forest at the time of planting. Wind-dispersed and pioneer species were more associated with short distances to the native forest and lower basal area; whereas animal-dispersed and shade tolerant species were related to high basal area and previous land use. Results support the idea that forest plantations may represent a suitable environment for the development of native plants.","WOS:000328564800009",448,0.877384134,1
"6","desert","CACTI COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN A TROPICAL MEXICAN DRY FOREST UNDER CHRONIC DISTURBANCE","When agricultural lands in formerly dry forest are abandoned, chronic disturbance by livestock grazing and wood extraction may set back successional processes precluding older dry forest structure from be reached. We compare cacti density, richness, diversity and evenness in twelve 50 x 50 m plots: six plots in secondary dry forest and six plots in older conserved dry forest at Sierra de Huautla, Central Mexico. Cacti were identified, the life-form of each species was recorded and size was measured to assign individuals into four life-stage classes. Nine cacti species were registered across both forest types. In this dry forest, richness, diversity and evenness of cacti community increased in sites under chronic disturbance, whereas density was not significantly affected. Size structure at community level in the conserved forest showed an increase of individuals with size, whereas in the secondary forest, size structure showed an uneven distribution of individuals, as in populations that regenerate by pulses. In the secondary forest, there was a lower proportion of adults and they were in average, smaller than those in the conserved forest. Chronic disturbance may eventually change cacti community structure, affecting animals that depend on large arboreal cacti for food, perches and/or refuge; therefore, maintenance of biodiversity will be at stake.","WOS:000341675600007",273,0.873223372,1

Striking differences are observed in the species richness, number of clades and functional diversity of termite assemblage between different habitats. This study aim was to examine effect of human interference in the diversity of wood destroying termite in forest areas as well as managed and unmanaged plantations in South India. Termites attacking trees and wooden logs were collected from forest areas, managed plantations and unmanaged plantations. The termites collected were identified and compared for species abundance, richness and species diversity. Results show that the species composition and species diversity of the wood destroying termites vary according to the conditions. The species diversity measures revealed that there is a significance variation among the forest fauna and plantations. The forest areas have the highest species composition compared to plantations. Species richness is high forest areas. Even though the abundance of termites are more in unmanaged plantations, there is no significant difference related to species diversity among the managed and unmanaged plantations.","WOS:000322190900021",55,0.865020064,1
"8","desert","Ecological impacts of desert plantation forests on biodiversity","This investigation involves the comparison of the diversity of understorey vegetation of four desert planted forests with the adjacent desert areas. Spatial and temporal variations in species composition and structure were compared, and alpha and beta diversities were compared for the field data collected from sampled sites. The diversity of native desert species decreased from 66% in desert areas to 44% of the total recorded plants inside the forests. Meanwhile, the percentage of agricultural weed species increased in forests to >twofold more than that recorded in desert areas. Plant communities in forest stands shared <50% of their species with adjacent vegetation in desert stands. The percentage of variation in species composition was >340% in some forests compared with the desert areas. Alpha diversity and beta-diversity were significantly higher in forest stands than in the desert. Spatial and temporal variations in species diversity were correlated with type of tree canopy and irrigation system. Planted forests had significant negative effects on the diversity of native desert shrubs and trees. Using flood irrigation and more spacing between trees might help in conserving the floristic diversity of desert shrubs and trees at the forest floor.","WOS:000306794700006",185,0.847524002,1
"9","desert","Gardening in the desert changes bee communities and pollination network characteristics","Conversion of natural habitats to human settlements creates an alternative habitat with different bio-physical characteristics such as micro-climatic conditions and resource availability. Deserts are especially sensitive to such effects due to generally low nutrient levels and water availability. Gardens in human settlements in the desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant pollinator networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat surrounding the gardens.","WOS:000293312600005",32,0.8473785,1

In this study, we compared population-and community-level data between a mature and a secondary forest in the Chancani Reserve (Cordoba, Argentina). Scorpions were collected using pitfall traps (54 nights per site), and their nocturnal activity was observed by means of UV light (26 nights per site) over 7 months. Seven species of scorpions (1964 individuals) were observed in the study area (Bothriuridae and Buthidae). Brachistosternus ferrugineus composed >74 % of all individuals and was numerically dominant in most months. It was the most common species sampled with UV light method in all months (85.73 % in mature and 81.80 % in secondary forest). Timogenes elegans was the most common species sampled with the pitfall traps method in secondary forest (48.58 %). General sex ratio (males: females) for B. ferrugineus was 1: 1.24 and for T. elegans was 1:0.53. The Shannon index was not significantly different between sites. Species richness was similar, and the Jaccard index was Cs = 0.86, indicating that both sites share 86 % of the species. Tityus confluens was the only species not shared between sites. Our results indicate that species composition in regenerating forest resembles that of primary forest after c. 15 years, but the relative abundances of these species differ.","WOS:000338983200009",73,0.84573288,1
"11","desert","Effect of a desert planted forest on the understory plant diversity: implication to conservation","The present study aimed to assess the potential role of desert tree plantations for biodiversity conservation of native vegetation. For this purpose, we compared diversity and composition of understory vegetation in a managed desert plantation in Egypt with adjacent natural vegetation. In 126 stands, we estimated the diversity indices of the understory vegetation associated with five tree plantations inside and outside the forest. The results showed that therophytes had the highest contribution to the total flora of the study area (45.7 %), followed by chamaephytes (21.7 %). The weed species were the main components inside the forest (37 species). In the stands of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Khaya senegalensis, the agricultural weeds were the most abundant followed by natural weeds. Spring season was the main flourishing season for weeds followed by autumn. Dalbergia sissoo had the highest values for species richness (8.8) and the lowest for species turnover (2.5). On the contrary, Casuarina spp. had the lowest values of species richness (3.0) and the highest of species turnover (7.3) and Simpson index (12.3). Establishment of the forest leads to remarkable loss and changes in the biodiversity of natural desert vegetation and vegetation composition, respectively. Many ruderal weeds colonized the adjacent desert habitats. From this study, we concluded that forest managers should pay attention for the conservation and retention of existing native vegetation during their design for the desert plantations.","WOS:000389833300012",259,0.844924196,1
"12","desert","Desert grassland canopy arthropod species richness: temporal patterns and effects of intense, short-duration livestock grazing","Arthropods living in the canopies of two woody shrub species (a sub-shrub (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and a large shrub (Prosopis glandulosa)) and perennial grasses plus associated herbaceous species, were sampled on 18, 0.5 hectare plots in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland for five consecutive years. Mesquite shrubs were removed from nine plots, six plots were grazed by yearling cattle in August and six plots were grazed in February for the last 3 years of the 5 year study. Arthropod species richness ranged between 154 and 353 on grasses, from 120 to 266 on G. sarothrae, and from 69 to 116 on P. glandulosa. There was a significant relationship between the number of families of insects on grass and G. sarothrae and growing season rainfall but species richness was not a function of growing season rainfall on any of the plants. Several of the arthropod families that were the most species rich in this grassland were found on all of the plants sampled, i.e. Salticid spiders, Bruchid and Curculionid beetles, Cicadellid and Psyllid homopterans, and ants (Formicidae). There were more species rich families that were shared by grasses and the sub-shrub G. sarothrae than with mesquite. The absence of a relationship between growing season rainfall and species richness was attributed to variation in life history characteristics of arthropods and to the non-linear responses of annual and perennial desert grassland plants to rainfall. There were no significant differences in insect family or species richness on any of the plant types as a result of removal of mesquite (P. glandulosa) from selected plots. Intense, short duration (24 h) grazing by livestock during in late summer resulted in reduced species richness in the grass-herb vegetation layer but had no effect on insect species richness on snakeweed or mesquite shrubs. Livestock grazing in winter had no effect on insect species richness on any of the vegetation sampled. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","WOS:000226455200007",154,0.844008763,1
"13","desert","Complex responses within a desert bee guild (Hymenoptera : Apiformes) to urban habitat fragmentation","Urbanization within the Tucson Basin of Arizona during the past 5 years has fragmented the original desert scrub into patches of different sizes and ages. These remnant patches and the surrounding desert are dominated by Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), a long-lived shrub whose flowers are visited by > 120 native bee species across its range. Twenty-one of these bee species restrict their pollen foraging to L. tridentata. To evaluate the response of this bee fauna to fragmentation, we compared species incidence and abundance patterns for the bee guild visiting L. tridentata at 59 habitat fragments of known size (0.002-5 ha) and age (up to 70 years), and in adjacent desert. The 62 bee species caught during this study responded to fragmentation heterogeneously and not in direct relation to their abundance or incidence in undisturbed desert. Few species found outside the city were entirely absent from urban fragments. Species of ground-nesting L. tridentata specialists were underrepresented in smaller fragments and less abundant in the smaller and older fragments. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees (including one L. tridentata specialist) were overrepresented in the habitat fragments., probably due to enhanced nesting opportunities available in the urban matrix. Small-bodied bee species were no more likely than larger bodied species to be absent from the smaller fragments. The introduced European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was a minor faunal element at > 90% of the fragments and exerted little if any influence on the response of native bee species to fragmentation. Overall, bee response to urban habitat fragmentation was best predicted by ecological traits associated with nesting and dietary breadth. Had species been treated as individual units in the analyses, or pooled together into one analysis, these response patterns may not have been apparent. Pollination interactions with this floral host are probably not adversely affected in this system because of its longevity and ability to attract diverse pollinators but will demand careful further study to understand.","WOS:000237052200017",280,0.84372996,1

The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1 km(2). At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187 ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975-2005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Five plant communities were recognized and for each one all woody individuals >= 10 cm DBH were tallied in sixteen 400 m(2) circular plots, whereas individuals between 2.5 and 9.9 cm DBH were measured in a 100 m(2) circular subplot centered within each larger plot. A total of 46 species, 33 genera and 21 families were recorded. The tropical deciduous forest and Quercus deserticola forest had low values of mean plant height (< 5 m) and basal area (17.8 and 26 m(2)/ha, respectively), but these communities showed the higher density. Forests dominated by Q. rugosa and Quercus-Pinus had the lowest density but the highest mean height (> 11 m) and basal area (> 40 m(2)/ha). Diversity was greater in the tropical deciduous forest (S= 23 and alpha= 5.4, respectively) and lower in the oak-pine forest (S= 13 and alpha= 2.71). All communities displayed different dominant species and high beta diversity. Our results suggest that composition and structure could be affected by altitude and human activities. Nevertheless, the Cerro El Aguila still has well conservation areas, mainly temperate forests located toward summit zone and we recommend their inclusion in a near future within the state reserve system.","WOS:000295913300012",715,0.837754165,0
"16","desert","Variation in arthropod communities in response to urbanization: Seven years of arthropod monitoring in a desert city","Continuous monitoring is essential to understand dynamics of biological communities in response to urbanization, and to provide guidance in landscape planning for conserving urban biodiversity. Arthropods serve this purpose because they are abundant and diverse in urban areas, and relatively easy to collect. Over seven years, in the Central Arizona Phoenix area, arthropod communities in three urban habitat categories were collected and compared to arthropods in natural desert using pitfall traps and non-parametric analyses. First, we tested for differences in arthropod composition, abundances, and diversity across habitats and years. Second, we examined how conclusions about arthropod diversity vary with level of taxonomic resolution. We found that arthropod community composition varied among the four habitats at all taxonomic levels tested. In particular, urban mesic habitats had generally lower diversity than natural desert habitats, although with some exceptions. In contrast, mesic habitats had higher arthropod abundance than all habitats, and fluctuations in abundance were completely independent from changes in precipitation. Taxonomic shortcuts gave overall good impressions of community differences, but finer taxonomic resolutions on certain groups of arthropods revealed distinctly different responses to urbanization (e.g., higher beetle and ant diversity in the urban habitats). Urban areas have great potential for arthropod diversity, but community composition and dynamics are notably different from natural habitats. Institutions, local governments and homeowners can make an impact in arthropod conservation by choice of landscaping, and we recommend that remnants of natural habitats within cities receive further attention in urban planning.

Richness and abundance of bees were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees. Specifically, preservation of desert and greater use of xeric landscaping rather than mesiscaping may help preserve this ecologically and economically vital group of organisms.","WOS:000171075800003",399,0.835961528,1
"18","desert","Ant biodiversity in semiarid landscape mosaics: The consequences of grazing vs. natural heterogeneity","The conservation of biodiversity in landscape mosaics requires an understanding of the impacts of human land use within mosaic elements and an evaluation of the biological uniqueness of different elements. We address these issues by examining patterns of ant diversity in three semiarid rangeland landscapes used predominantly for grazing. These landscapes lie along a regional gradient from shortgrass steppe through a transitional zone to desert grassland, along which climate and ant species composition vary. Within each landscape, we compared the effects of grazing and natural variation in soils and vegetation on ant diversity and community composition. Grazing had little effect on ant richness, diversity, or composition at the transitional zone or the desert grassland site, but ungrazed areas at the shortgrass steppe site had a higher overall richness and favored the abundance of some species. Some samples of saltbush (Atriplex canescens) shrubland were similar to ungrazed samples in richness and species composition. In both the transitional zone and the desert grassland, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata)-dominated habitats harbored comparatively species-rich and distinct ant communities. In addition, mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) coppice dunes at the desert grassland site favored the abundance of several species that were rare across the site. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that variation in soil strength and texture best explained community variation at the shortgrass steppe site, whereas soil texture and associated differences in shrub density best explained differences in composition at the transitional and desert grassland sites. The characterization of habitats based upon vegetation classification did not adequately reflect environmental variation that was important to ants in shortgrass steppe, but reflected important soil textural variation in the transitional and desert grassland sites. These results suggest that ant conservation in these semiarid rangelands should emphasize patterns of variation in soil properties. The results add to a growing consensus that a variety of variables determined by the responses of several focal taxa may be needed to characterize biodiversity patterns.","WOS:000170209200015",11,0.833663502,1

A study was conducted of soil nematodes and their diversity associated with different land uses in the Biosphere Reserve Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Three sites were selected to investigate 4 types of land uses: natural forest, secondary forest, pasture, and maize fields. Total abundance of nematodes and estimators based on generic and diversity indices were assessed and compared between the 4 land uses and sites. Fifty-three families and 124 genera of nematodes were identified from the study area. The dominant families were Criconematidae, Hoplolaimidae, Cephalobidae, and Tylenchidae, and the most abundant genera in this study were Helicotylenchus, Discocriconemella, Tylenchus, Steinernema and Mesocriconema. The greatest nematode abundance, generic richness, and diversity were found in natural forest, closely followed by secondary forest. Intensive (largely monocrop) agricultural systems, represented by maize fields and pasture, had low generic richness and significantly less diversity than non-disturbed systems. Most of the estimators and indices were useful in showing the significant effects of different land uses on soil nematodes in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. This study is the first of its type to be carried out in the Biosphere Reserve Los Tuxtlas, being the first report of soil nematodes that shows the effects of the land use changes that have been made in recent years.

AMF spores were extracted and identified from soil samples and from trap cultures established using soil collected at each site. Data were analyzed according to land use, land-use history, soil chemistry and vegetation characteristics at each site. Current agricultural sites were associated with decreased spore densities and historically agricultural sites with decreased species richness. Overall species composition was similar to that previously reported for the Sonoran desert, but composition at each sampling site was influenced by the vegetation from which samples were collected. Sites with the highest degrees of similarity in AMF species composition were also similar to each other in native plants or land use. Conversely, sites with the lowest similarity in AMF composition were those from which the majority of samples were collected from non-mycorrhizal plants, predominately ectomycorrhizal plants or bare soil. Spores of Glomus microggregatum were most abundant in urban sites, while those of G. eburneum were most abundant in desert and agricultural sites. Further studies are needed to determine the functional implications of shifts in AMF communities in urban ecosystems, including effects on plant primary productivity.","WOS:000186978300004",200,0.831609533,1

Location: Semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands of Jordan. Methods: Vegetation. litter, bare soil and rock cover were compared among four management types - free grazing and protected from grazing with three levels of tree cover. Species composition. plant cover, species richness and evenness were used to evaluate differences in vegetation among management types. Species composition differences among management types were also investigated. Results: Semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands harbour appreciable levels of plant biodiversity. Grazing did not affect plant diversity. indicating the high resilience against and adaptation to grazing: however. grazing affected species composition and cover parameters. Afforestation seems to protect soil through higher litter cover but its impact on plant biodiversity was negative and markedly affected species composition. Conclusions: Neither protection from grazing or massive afforestation alone are sufficient for conserving biodiversity in this system. A management model is suggested where the landscape should be maintained as a mosaic of four management types: complete protection from grazing, grazing rotation, planting sparse trees in eroded areas and revegetating degraded areas using native, herbaceous and grazing tolerant species.","WOS:000247766700012",83,0.831329363,1

Here, we discuss some management recommendations to improve the conservation value of agricultural landscapes. From July 2003 to June 2004 we surveyed 284.4 km transects searching for tracks and visualizations of mammals in the main environments of an agricultural landscape in south-eastern Brazil. We recorded 25 native species, two exotic and six domestic species in the area: 23 species on native forest fragments, 19 on sugarcane plantations, 17 on eucalyptus plantations, and 12 on pasture areas. There were significant differences in species richness and frequency of occurrence among these environments. Pasture areas had the lowest species richness and sugarcane plantations the greatest frequency of occurrence. Some species are associated with open areas, whereas other species are associated with forested habitats. Although a considerable part of the original mammal diversity is still present, the community found is predominantly composed of species able to adapt to environmental alterations. Therefore, to improve the conservation value of agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Brazil, the maintenance of native forest fragments is essential, in addition to mitigation measures of the various agricultural impacts.","WOS:000296765400005",14,0.830579634,1

However, little is known about the taxonomic composition, and organization of the assemblage of native small mammal, and the influence of local ecological factors, particularly from different vegetation types. Therefore, we were interested in documenting the species composition and structure of the small mammal assemblages of this sierra and provide insights into the nesting level of the Community and deviations from a random organization. The study area was a place named ""El Durangueno"" ranch, Durango, Mexico. Three different vegetation types (grassland, and oak-pine and pine-oak forests) were sampled there during every season of 2005 to 2006. During three consecutive nights rodents of each site were captured, recaptured, and taxonomically identified. Results produced 520 individuals (386 captures, 134 recaptures) of 18 small mammal species (14 mice, four squirrels) of different body sizes that represent neartic. neotropical, or shared affinity; endemicity of taxa was found as well as taxa in some extinction risk category. Species richness and eveness were high and the diversity and population levels were moderate. although high density of small mammals highlights oak-pine forest whereas dominance of some species occurs in pine-oak forest perhaps due to disturbance. Spatial pattern of medium-size species was not at random. Assemble of species revealed a non-nested pattern and displayed a log-normal distribution, characterized by four common and widely distributed rodent species (Peromyscus truei, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys montanus, and Sigmodon leucotis), and seven of restricted distribution. On the other hand, several species were allocated to different trophic-niche guilds, as revealed by their reported food preferences, that were composed by up to two dominant species by site. In conclusion, the small mammal assemblage of forests of Sierra Madre is distinctive and diverse, is not structured at random and vegetation may be one of the ecological factors that have played an important evolutionary role.","WOS:000274063100007",322,0.828246907,0
"24","desert","Effects of past and present land use on vegetation cover and regeneration in a tropical dryland forest","Brazilian Caatinga is one of the most diverse dryland ecosystem of the world and is threatened by strong land use pressure and poor protection. In this study, we investigate the effects of past and present land use on plant community richness and structure. We used satellite information to identify 55 Caatinga forest plots with and without past vegetation clearing. We also quantified current land use, i.e. grazing by domestic animals, and selective logging. Caatinga vegetation structure, measured as vegetation cover, vegetation height, basal area and woody plant density, as well as recruitment, measured as woody plant seedling density and species richness, were negatively affected by both past and current land use. Past clear-cut not only had strong effects on most vegetation measures, but also increased current grazing which further negatively affected vegetation structure. Selective logging had little measurable effects but increased recruitment in plots previously clear-cut. Increasing time since the last clear-cut increased negative effects on vegetation, presumably because of a prolonged negative effect of grazing. Our results suggest that grazing needs to be prevented in areas degraded by clear-cut to allow vegetation restoration through natural succession and avoid further degradation and desertification.

In Central America, natural forests have been transformed into agriculture production areas, generating forest fragmentation, desertification, erosion and loss of biodiversity, among other concerns. Different tree cover compositions are kept on these agricultural landscapes, including scattered trees in pastures, live fences, fragments of secondary forests, and riparian forests. These can help in biodiversity conservation because they generate shelter, feeding and reproduction areas, among others. We studied the composition, richness and abundance of diurnal butterflies on two types of live fences in a landscape where pastures are predominant in Costa Rica's Central Pacific Region. Transects (120x5m) were observed for an hour (two days/habitat) in five multi-strata fences (with several plant species, strata and canopy width) and five simple fences (with smaller and pruned trees). A total of 2 782 butterflies were observed (75 species). The most abundant species were Anartia fatima, Eurema daria, Eurema nise, Hermeuptychia hermes, Junonia evarete and Phoebis philea. Multi-strata fences had more species and can help maintain 56% of the total species observed in secondary and riparian forests. This type of live fence can play an important role in butterfly conservation in livestock areas, and its benefits are influenced by the manner in which farmers manage their land. Rev. Biol.

This study aims to test the hypothesis that the effect of habitat fragmentation on plant diversity is non-linear, i.e. there is a shift in the effect of habitat fragmentation on plant diversity from positive to negative (or from negative to positive) with intensifying fragmentation. A sand dune field in a desertified grassland in eastern Inner Mongolia, China, was used as the study site. Eighteen fragmented plots (inter-dune lowlands in the sand dune) and 14 continuous plots (different sizes of grassland) were selected. Plant diversity was estimated by species richness, functional groups and rare species. Logarithmic, power and exponential functions were used to analyze the relationship of species richness, frequency and abundance and plot area. There was a shift from positive to negative in the relationship between habitat fragmentation and species richness with the intensifying fragmentation. The number of plant functional groups increased due to habitat fragmentation, and different functional groups showed distinct responses to the degree of fragmentation. The effect of habitat fragmentation on rare species richness is non-linear, and the effect of habitat fragmentation on rare species population is negative. Our results indicate: (1) thresholds should be taken into consideration when drawing up plant diversity conservation plans; and (2) a single large reserve and several small reserves have different implications in plant diversity conservation.

Fencing to exclude grazers is one of the main management practices used to restore vegetation and conserve biodiversity. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the changes in plant diversity and abundance, floristic composition and plant groups of the major life forms in response to thirty-five years of grazing exclosure in western Saudi Arabia. These vegetation attributes and palatability were compared in 30 sampling stands located in the excluded and grazed sites. Our results showed that livestock exclusion significantly increased covers, density and species richness of annuals, grasses, perennial forbs, shrubs and trees. Exclosure enhanced the abundance and richness of palatable species and depressed the development of weedy species. About 66.7% of the recorded species at the excluded site were highly palatable compared to 34.5% at the grazed site. In contrary, about 55.2% unpalatable species were found in the grazed site compared to 25.8% in the protected site. Jaccard's similarity index between the excluded and grazed sites showed lower values of 0.39%, 0.40% and 0.31% at levels of families, genus and species, respectively. The results suggest that establishing livestock exclusion may be a useful sustainable management tool for vegetation restoration and conservation of plant diversity in degraded rangelands of arid regions.

"59","desert","Introduction of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) into Western Europe: Epigaeic arthropods in intermediate-aged pure stands in northwestern Germany","Epigaeic arthropods were studied in intermediate-aged pure plantations of the exotic American Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and of European sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.), which had both been established after forest clear-cuts. Studies took place in two blocks in a forest in northwestern Lower Saxony, Germany. Pitfall trapping throughout the vegetation period of 2004 delivered quantitative data for epigaeic macro-arthropods. Communities of ants (Formicidae), ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and spiders (Araneae) were studied in further detail. Several differences in catch numbers, species richness and structure of communities became obvious between the studied stands and are partially interpreted as effects of the different tree cover. As far as environmental factors are concerned, the studied Douglas fir stands showed a high cover of mosses and needle litter, a low weed cover, and a higher soil acidity as compared to the sessile oak plantations. Activity of isopods and diplopods was significantly higher within Douglas fir stands than in those of sessile oak, whereas activity of ants, carabids and weevils was lower in the plantations of this exotic tree species. For all three taxa studied in detail, the numbers of exclusively recorded species were higher in oak stands. Except for wolf spiders (Lycosidae), spider communities of sessile oak sustained to a certain degree in the Douglas fir plantations. On the other hand, communities of ants and carabids were quantitatively impoverished under Douglas fir. Overall, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and cluster analysis showed that the communities of all three taxa in focus were strongly altered by treatment and by area, with treatment prevailing over area. Furthermore, we expected especially carabid communities to recruit individuals continuously from the surrounding deciduous forests. With some reservations resulting from the few replicates studied we conclude, that (1) intermediate-aged pure Douglas fir plantations are no biodiversity deserts as a broad spectrum of epigaeic arthropods persists in the plantations, at least, when these are small.-sized. Furthermore, we conclude that (2) afforestation with exotic Douglas fir leads to conspicuous changes in epigaeic invertebrate communities as compared to autochthonous, deciduous forests of the same age class. Recommendations for forestry using Douglas fir and aimed at conserving biodiversity include the restriction of Douglas fir to recent and new forests, to avoid pure and dense stands, as well as to limit the total area stocked.

Yet, we lack a strong understanding of the relationship between grasshopper diversity and plant community composition at the landscape scale. Our aim was to test landscape scale relationships between plant and grasshopper communities. We used a large-scale, replicated experiment at four sites, including grazed and protected pastures across a 350 km transect and 200-400 mm precipitation gradient in the steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We analyzed the relationships between plant and grasshopper parameters with ANOVAs and CCA. We collected 17 grasshopper species and 15,000+ individuals. The desert steppe (lowest precipitation) had the lowest grasshopper richness and diversity, but abundance was not different from the other sites. In two dry sites (desert steppe and Stipa steppe), livestock grazing decreased grasshopper diversity and increased abundance of the main pest species. In contrast, at the highest precipitation site (meadow steppe), grasshopper communities did not differ between grazing levels. Across all sites and grazing intensities, grasshopper abundance tended to be lowest and diversity highest in plant communities with intermediate levels of biomass and plant species richness. These results support the concept that appropriate land use management practices would be beneficial for increasing biodiversity, promoting grassland sustainability, and reducing outbreaks of the dominant pest grasshopper in Inner Mongolia. Our study suggests that different management approaches are necessary depending on the average annual precipitation and that the driest sites are most vulnerable to disturbance.","WOS:000361903500007",10,0.752692106,1

Spatiotemporal patterns of saprophagous Copestylum (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in different cactus species richness have not yet been studied, although seasonal changes and plant species richness have been shown to strongly impact the diversity and distribution of many insect communities in scrublands. We analyzed the impact of seasonality and of habitat type (disturbed and undisturbed) on Copestylum communities reared from cactus species at the Barranca de Metztitlan Biosphere Reserve, in central Mexico, by comparing their community structure between seasons and habitats, and assessing the contribution of diversity components for the total diversity of this genus. We also measured patterns of temporal niche overlap among hoverfly species considering their breeding medium. Seasonal variation influenced Copestylum community composition most significantly. Species richness and abundance of Copestylum were higher in the rainy season. Additive partitioning of diversity showed that the main component for species richness is beta diversity between seasons. We detected high niche overlap during the dry season and low overlap during the rainy season. This study provides evidence of temporal shifts in xeric hoverfly communities and suggests that the Copestylum species partition resources over time.","WOS:000288552900012",7,0.741628233,0

Worldwide, riverine floodplains are among the most endangered landscapes and are often the focus of restoration activities. Amphibians and reptiles have valuable ecological roles in ecosystems, and promoting their abundance and diversity when rehabilitating riparian systems can contribute to reestablishing degraded ecosystem functions. We evaluated the herpetofauna community by measuring abundance, richness, diversity, and species-habitat relations along three reaches (wildland, urban rehabilitated, and urban disturbed reaches) varying in degree of urbanization and rehabilitation along the Salt River in central Arizona. We performed visual surveys for herpetofauna and quantified riparian microhabitat along eight transects per reach. The wildland reach had the greatest herpetofauna species richness and diversity, and had similar abundance compared to the urban rehabilitated reach. The urban disturbed reach had the lowest herpetofauna abundance and species richness, and had a similar diversity compared to the urban rehabilitated reach. Principal Component Analysis reduced 21 microhabitat variables to five factors which described habitat differences among reaches. Vegetation structural complexity, vegetation species richness, densities of Prosopis (mesquite), Salix (willow), Populus (cottonwood), and animal burrow density had a positive correlation with at least one herpetofauna community parameter, and had a positive correlation with abundance of at least one lizard species. Rehabilitation activities positively influenced herpetofauna abundance and species richness; whereas, urbanization negatively influenced herpetofauna diversity. Based on herpetofauna-microhabitat associations, we recommend urban natural resource managers increase vegetation structural complexity and woody debris to improve herpetofauna habitat when rehabilitating degraded riparian systems.","WOS:000304241400011",15,0.71962803,1
"211","desert","Assessing the Use of Functional Diversity as a Measure of Ecological Resilience in Arid Rangelands","It is becoming more apparent that species richness alone many not be sufficient to fully understand ecosystem resilience but that functional diversity (diversity of species having similar effects on an ecosystem process) may be more relevant. In particular, response diversity (diversity of species that respond differently to disturbance) within functional groups (FG) is suggested to be critical for resilience. We assess for the first time the use of response diversity as a measure of resilience in an empirical study. Our experimental design consisted of sites with three disturbance intensities during a grazing exclosure period and the same sites, 1 year later, after grazing. Plant FGs were identified based on effect traits related to nutrient cycling and soil retention, and species richness within groups was assessed during exclosure and after grazing. To assess if response diversity could predict loss of species richness (resilience analysis), response diversity was calculated only during the exclosure period, based on traits related to grazing tolerance. We also assessed the contribution of richness to response diversity during exclosure (redundancy analysis). Response diversity was significantly and highly correlated with species richness within FGs during disturbance. That is, FGs with the lowest response diversity were the most affected, disappearing when disturbance appeared. Richness within FGs during exclosure was not significantly correlated with response diversity, showing that higher richness does not ensure resilience. We conclude that response diversity can be used to predict which FGs are more resilient, and hence, less vulnerable to future disturbance.","WOS:000300144100010",13,0.710246374,0

Little is known about the independent effects of grazing and water and their interaction on plant community structure and productivity in rangelands of the arid Arab Gulf deserts. Paired sampling plots were used to compare plant species composition, diversity and plant abundances and sizes inside and outside 14-month irrigated and 30-month non-irrigated exclosures constructed during dry years on sandy dunes of the arid Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve. The results showed that the negative impacts of high grazing pressures on plant productivity (plant sizes and abundances) and diversity were stronger in the non-irrigated sites. Both irrigation (IR) and protection (PR) enhanced plant diversity and productivity of the overgrazed degraded Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve. The combined effects of PR and IR resulted in the occurrence of a total of 22 species inside the irrigated exclosures; however, none of them appeared in the irrigated grazed sites. Eighteen palatable species occurred inside, but not outside, the irrigated exclosures. Chamaephytes, which are more sensitive to human and animal disturbances, recovered more than other life forms under PR and IR. Dipterygium glaucum showed a great potential to be used for restoration projects under water IR in the Arab Gulf deserts. It is concluded that grazing and water independently affected plant diversity and productivity, but the relative role of grazing is more important than that of water in conserving desert plants, especially the palatable ones.

In order to analyse the microhabitats of C. bicolor and C. savignyi within the sympatric and allopatric areas of both ant species, the plant species located at 113 different nest sites of the two ant species were determined. In the sympatric area, the two species exhibit a clear-cut nest site segregation. This is not the case in the allopatric areas. Hence the two species differentiate their microhabitat only when they are sympatric. The plant species associated mainly with the nest sites of C. bicolor indicate that this species prefers a type of vegetation that needs irrigation. This is in contrast to the nest sites of C. savignyi, which are usually found around plants that characterize typical dry steppe areas. As the ants' foraging paths recorded in the sympatric area reveal, C. bicolor performs significantly shorter foraging runs with respect to both length and time, and covers a much smaller foraging range than C. savignyi does. This result reflects the fact that the microhabitat occupied by the colonies of C. bicolor is richer in food abundance. When direct interspecific interactions were investigated by placing a bait midway between two heterospecific nests, C. bicolor foragers dominated over those of C. savignyi. The same dominance of C. bicolor over C. savignyi occurred in laboratory experiments. These results suggest that the dominant species drives the subordinate one out of the high quality microhabitats, and that the subordinate species is forced to survive in the less lucrative habitats. In conclusion, coexistence seems to be maintained by the asymmetric competitive relationship between the two species and the fact that the subordinate species has the ability to endure in the less favourable microhabitat.","WOS:000183638000007",5,0.626521759,0

Because pioneer species can differentially facilitate or inhibit target species, we measure native Araucaria angustifolia and exotic hints taeda responses to two common pioneer species, Baccharis uncinella and Vernonia discolor in a clear-cut pine plantation. P taeda establishment and growth was greater than that of A. angustifolia in all treatments, showing its potential for invasiveness. B. uncinella showed significant positive spatial associations with P. taeda and negative spatial associations with A. angustifolia. V discolor showed significant negative spatial associations with P taeda but neutral spatial associations with A. angustifolia, it also supported a higher diversity of native species under its canopy than B. uncinella. Experimental results show that these patterns are due to differential establishment restrictions imposed by both pioneers on target species. We conclude that B. uncinella promotes pine invasion while V discolor restrains it. We suggest strategies for Araucaria forest restoration and highlight the broad applicability of our approach to restoration programs.","WOS:000299187500010",2,0.512727534,0

Granivores are expected to use space selectively (within the capacities of their foraging techniques), resulting in a heterogeneous effect on the seed bank. First, we describe the foraging repertoire of granivorous birds in the algarrobal to develop predictions about their expected use of space. Although the granivory guild as a whole tracked the temporal availability of seeds, species within the guild differed in foraging behavior and seasonal changes. We assessed selection of space by foraging birds through a two-scale bird-centered analysis, comparing the distributions of used and available sites. Granivorous birds, considered as a guild, used the whole range of available microsites, though as a result of an aggregation of contrasting partial patterns. Microsites with more cover of shrubs, grasses, and litter were preferred for predispersal consumption, which is consistent with the frequent technique of attacking grasses from low woody perches. By contrast, use of microsites for postdispersal consumption did not differ from random, which suggests that there are no safe microsites for seeds in this habitat. At a larger scale not particularly related to heterogeneity in food availability, a selective pattern was clearer: birds avoided mesosites with low shrub and litter cover, far from trees. In conclusion, patterns are not straightforward and depend on considerations of spatiotemporal scale and species-specific characteristics. Even when predictions seemed clear-cut and were tested with proper scale and target-group, granivorous birds did not select space according to environmental clues of food abundance.","WOS:000257193800026",4,0.502243108,0

We therefore analyzed a total of 2,294 bp of chloroplast and 738 bp of nuclear sequence data in 169 samples of five native palm species from Baja California, Sonora and Guadalupe Island. We found that Washingtonia and Brahea palms had low levels of genetic diversity and were highly structured, with the majority of species and major geographic regions being characterized by distinct haplotypes. We also found strong support for currently recognized species in Washingtonia, but our results were less clear cut for Brahea due to haplotype sharing. Furthermore, patterns of population structure were broadly consistent with historical vicariant events such as the inundation of the Isthmus of La Paz, the formation of the Sea of Cortez, and the more recent colonization and isolation of Guadalupe Island's palms. Our findings contribute toward a growing appreciation of the complexity of plant responses to past geological changes and also provide valuable baseline genetic data on relict American palm species.","WOS:000404645400037",3,0.43775574,0

The fieldwork was carried out in nine forest fragments within two regions in the southern part of the Hungarian Great Plain, near the river Tisza. The epigeic spider fauna was collected with pitfall traps. The traps were arranged in three groups of five traps at each fragment. Landscape attributes had the strongest effect on spider species composition at the scales between 250 and 750 m, with a peak at 500 m buffer. Spider species composition differed between regularly flooded and non-flooded fragments. Vegetation cover and the proportion of neighboring forests had significant effect on the rarefaction diversity of spiders. Flooding, soil moisture, vegetation cover, and the proportion of forests within 500 m buffer significantly affected spider assemblages.

A test with bird communities in paddy-dominated landscapes","Land-use changes, including agricultural intensification and farmland abandonment, influence biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. However, few studies have focused on how the two major land-use changes affect different types of species at landscape scales. This study examined the relationships between the richness and abundance of five bird groups (agricultural wetland species, agricultural land species, grassland species, edge species, and woodland species) as well as the total species richness and abundance, and intensification or abandonment in 28 square, 100-ha grid cells in paddy-dominated landscapes in the Tone River basin of central Japan. Rice-field intensification and abandonment were not completely segregated spatially: intensification occurred in both plain and hilly areas surrounded by forests, while abandonment tended to occur in hilly areas. The effects of intensification and abandonment differed among species groups and between seasons. The richness or abundance of agricultural wetland species in summer were negatively associated with both intensification and abandonment. While the abundance of agricultural land species in winter and grassland species in both seasons were positively associated with intensification and abandonment, respectively. The total species richness and abundance did not show clear association with intensification and abandonment due to a variety of responses of the five bird groups. Based on prefectural Red Data Books, agricultural wetland species, followed by grassland species, were more threatened than other three groups in both summer and winter. This study found that (1) the diversity of habitats (including consolidated and abandoned farmlands) provides buffer areas for the different bird groups on different times of the year and (2) agricultural wetland species that use flooded rice fields in summer, such as egrets and shorebirds, are particularly threatened by both intensification and abandonment.

What is the contribution of small fragments to the conservation of native species pool of the region? Location: Tandilia's Range, Southern Pampa, Argentina. Methods: Cover of plants was registered within 24 fragments of tall-tussock grassland remnants within an agricultural landscape using modified Whittaker nested sampling. We analysed the influence of site variables related to disturbance history (canopy height, litter thickness) and fragment variables (size, connectivity) on species richness (asymptotic species richness, slope of the species-area curve) as well as on species assemblages by multiple regressions analysis and canonical correspondence analyses, respectively. Cumulative area was used for analysing whether small fragments or large fragments are more important to species diversity in the landscape. Results: Asymptotic species richness was significantly influenced by site variables, in particular by Paspalum quadrifarium's canopy height, but not by fragment variables. Species assemblages were also affected by site variables (12.2% of total variation), but no additional portion of the species assemblage variability was significantly explained by fragment size and connectivity. Sampling of several small fragments rendered more exotic and native species than sampling of few large fragments of the same total area. Conclusions: Our results agree with previous studies reporting low sensitivity of species diversity to size and isolation of grassland fragments in fragmented landscapes and high sensitivity of species diversity to local variables. The higher capture of regional native species pool by small grassland fragments than by few larger ones of equivalent accumulated area highlights the value of small fragments for conservation.","WOS:000287863600004",43,0.872748652,1

On forest islands, richness and composition of forest Frogs was largely related to isolation, whereas reptiles were affected by both isolation and habitat. The observation that isolation rather than area was the primary driver of distribution patterns on forest islands stands in contrast to many studies, and may be a function Of (1) the greater range in forest island isolation values compared to area or (2) the long history of isolation in tills landscape.

We examined beetle diversity in a floodplain ecosystem that is characterised by naturally occurring grassland patches within a dominant matrix of contrasting yet habitable forest. We asked whether differences in the beetle assemblage between grassland and forest vegetation depended on the area of the grassland patch, which is a function of its flooding frequency and duration: smaller grasslands tend to be higher on the floodplain and are flooded less often and for shorter periods than larger grasslands. We found a negative relationship between grassland area and beetle abundance and species richness, and a positive relationship between grassland area and compositional dissimilarity from the surrounding forest. As expected, we found an overall difference in composition between forest and grassland assemblages, with five beetle species more common in the grasslands. Our study indicates that floodplain grasslands not only support beetle assemblages that are distinct from the surrounding forest, but that assemblages from the larger grasslands are compositionally more distinct than those from smaller grasslands. A likely cause of this pattern is the reduced edge effects and greater environmental contrast between forest and large grasslands that may be exposed to greater variation in local climate. Ongoing changes to flood regimes and potential encroachment of forest plants may decrease grassland area in the future, which may reduce spatial heterogeneity in the insect community in this unique floodplain ecosystem.","WOS:000327897200014",27,0.856037541,0

Earthworm communities are typically smaller with fewer species in agricultural soils, but the effect of agriculture on earthworms could be mitigated by the more favorable soil moisture regime in riparian areas, as well as planting perennial grasses or keeping forest fragments as permanently vegetated buffers. The objective of this study was to compare earthworm community composition under contrasting land use (agricultural vs. riparian forest) similar to 5 m and similar to 30 m away from the Pike River in southern Quebec, Canada. Furthermore, we evaluated how earthworm communities were affected by management intensity, flooding, soil and vegetation patterns within these land uses. We established 4 transects at 3 sites along the Pike River representing 4 land uses (agricultural field, agricultural buffer, riparian forest fragment, upland forest fragment). Along each transect, earthworm populations and soil properties were evaluated at 5 discrete points on 4 occasions from fall 2009 to spring 2011. Vegetation cover and plant species richness were measured, and management and flooding intensity were documented through farmer surveys. Earthworm abundance and diversity were highest in a riparian forest transect (460 individuals m(-2), 9 species) and agricultural buffer (325 individuals m(-2), 10 species), and lowest in the agricultural fields with annual crop rotations and agrochemical inputs, which also had the lowest plant diversity. Redundancy analysis revealed that differences in earthworm species compositions across the study area were linked to site-specific management and flooding, represented by differences in soil moisture, vegetation diversity, and soil nutrient concentrations (dissolved organic carbon in soil solution, mineral nitrogen, extractable phosphorus). Generalized linear mixed modeling also showed that less intensively managed agricultural buffers and forest fragments with regular flooding supported higher earthworm diversity. We recommend further research on soil functions affected by earthworms in riparian areas because these non-native earthworms could affect the conservation value of unmanaged agricultural buffers and forest fragments in southern Quebec, Canada.

"81","floodgrass","Enriching plant diversity in grasslands by large-scale experimental sward disturbance and seed addition along gradients of land-use intensity","Aims The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is among the most active areas of ecological research. Furthermore, enhancing the diversity of degraded ecosystems is a major goal in applied restoration ecology. In grasslands, many species may be locally absent due to dispersal or microsite limitation and may therefore profit from mechanical disturbance of the resident vegetation. We established a seed addition and disturbance experiment across several grassland sites of different land use to test whether plant diversity can be increased in these grasslands. Additionally, the experiment will allow us testing the consequences of increased plant diversity for ecosystem processes and for the diversity of other taxa in real-world ecosystems. Here, we present details of the experimental design and report results from the first vegetation survey 1 year after disturbance and seed addition. Moreover, we tested whether the effects of seed addition and disturbance varied among grassland depending on their land use or pre-disturbance plant diversity. Methods A full-factorial experiment was installed in 73 grasslands in three regions across Germany. Grasslands were under regular agricultural use, but varied in the type and the intensity of management, thereby representing the range of management typical for large parts of Central Europe. The disturbance treatment consisted of disturbing the top 10 cm of the sward using a rotavator or rotary harrow. Seed addition consisted of sowing a high-diversity seed mixture of regional plant species. These species were all regionally present, but often locally absent, depending on the resident vegetation composition and richness of each grassland. Important Findings Seven months after sward disturbance, respective plots had significantly increased in bare soil, seedling species richness and number of seedlings. Seed addition had increased plant species richness, but only in combination with sward disturbance. The increase in species richness, when both seed addition and disturbance was applied, was higher at high land-use intensity and low resident diversity. Thus, we show that at least the early recruitment of many species is possible also at high land-use intensity, indicating the potential to restore and enhance biodiversity of species-poor agricultural grasslands. Our newly established experiment provides a unique platform for broad-scale research on the land-use dependence of future trajectories of vegetation diversity and composition and their effects on ecosystem functioning.","WOS:000417976800001",95,0.847948895,0

Is the input of new species lower in environments with strong resource limitation? Is there a decrease in abundance and diversity of native species due to anthropogenic disturbance at local and regional scale? Has abundance of exotic species been favoured by grazing increased? Are floristic changes associated with homogenization processes? Location: Two grassland community types of the Argentine Flooding Pampas: the mesophyte prairie and the halophyte steppe. Methods: Grassland sites (n = 51) were resurveyed with the same methodology after 35 yr. At the local scale (0.25 ha), we analysed alpha diversity, site colonization and extinction rates, and changes in species and functional type composition. Site colonization rates were calculated separately for new species (not recorded in the original inventory) and old species (present in the first survey at other sample sites of the community). Correspondence analysis was applied to the presence/absence species matrix for all sites in both periods. At regional scale, we evaluated gamma diversity, heterogeneity within and between communities, changes in proportion of functional types (growth season, longevity and life form) and species origin. Results: In the mesophytic prairie, average local species richness increased 46% and regional richness 28%, while in the halophytic steppe changes were not significant. The colonization rate was higher and the extinction rate lower in the richest community (mesophytic prairie). Differences in colonization rates between natives and exotics were not found. Principal variability between sites in species composition was associated with abiotic conditions explaining 20.9% of inertia, temporal changes were relegated to the second axis with 6.38%. Proportions of warm-season exotics among new arrivals were higher than expected. Biotic homogenization was evidenced in the mesophytic prairie as a significant reduction in species turnover between sampling dates. Conclusions: After 35 yr under moderate grazing intensity we found increases in species richness, no biodiversity loss and no losses of native species. Instead of those species favoured by grazing, as expected, warm season species increased. Different grassland communities showed clear differences in richness changes, in degree of homogenization and in species turnover.","WOS:000340572700020",4,0.847886244,0

In addition to vegetation relev,s, light intensity (PAR) was also measured in plots. Within the still-managed RWM, two floristically distinct types were recognized using TWINSPAN analysis: meadow-like and forest-like. Light intensity differed significantly between types. The CCA of active RWM showed a significant relation between species composition and light conditions. The number of species per relev, on active RWM was negatively correlated with light intensity - in contrast to North European wooded grasslands. This could be explained by the influence of species-rich riparian hornbeam forests that contribute many understorey species, in contrast to naturally mesotrophic meadows. CCA of both active and abandoned RWM demonstrated that light was a good predictor of RWM species composition and that abandonment caused profound changes in floristic composition. The species turnover during succession was more pronounced in less shaded meadow-like RWM where more light-requiring (grassland) species occurred. Species richness was the highest in active forest-like RWM. There were no significant differences in species richness between active meadow-like RWM and groups of abandoned RWM. The remains of riparian forests stretching along the flood plains of Central and Eastern Europe are considered one of the most natural ecosystems in the prevailing agricultural landscape. But naturalness could be in many cases only the consequence of abandonment of ancient land-use practices, like grazing of livestock, cutting between the trees, litter collecting, etc. Examination of the middle Drava River in Slovenia suggests the need to recognize the remains of ancient cultural landscape.","WOS:000262490400004",156,0.846140172,1

Vegetation composition was studied in adjacent pairs of fen meadows and pastures with similar environmental conditions and biomass production. Vegetation data were analysed with respect to species richness, species composition and response of species traits to disturbance, including morphology, defence mechanisms, clonal growth form and generative reproduction. Species richness was significantly reduced by grazing, but the percentage of typical fen species or Red Data Book species was not affected by land use type. Detrended Corrspondence Analysis indicated that species composition could best be explained in terms of a land use gradient. Species traits showed a clear trend in their response to land use type. Grazing favoured grasses and small forbs. Only a few species with defence mechanisms against foraging were more frequent or abundant on pastures. Many other species with defence mechanisms, however, did not have an advantage on pastures. Flowering and seed dispersal traits did not respond significantly to grazing or mowing. Species with fast spreading stem derived clonal organs were favoured on pastures, whereas all other clonal growth forms and, particularly, non-clonal species were more abundant on meadows. More indicator species of wet soil conditions and species adapted to flooding were found on pastures. Grazing can be recommended as an alternative land use to mowing in contrast to abandonment, but a reduction in species richness and changes in species composition and species traits may occur.","WOS:000220133300017",13,0.845818199,1

Floristic data from 46 plots and soil data from 20 plots were collected from the study site in the area of Lesini (Western Greece). Dendrochronological analysis was conducted and forest structure was also investigated. Plot diversity was assessed for total floristic composition and species groups. Three vegetation units were distinguished, differentiating mainly along a soil texture gradient, with their floristic composition also affected by human disturbances. Total species, as well as species group diversity and evenness were differentiated along the main ecological gradient. The vegetation unit most affected by natural disturbance regimes is characterized by the highest diversity of riparian plant specialists and the lowest total species diversity. The vegetation units less affected by natural disturbances have increased forest species diversity. Human disturbances were found to increase total species diversity and evenness, as well as diversity of grassland and synanthropic species. With the exception of one vegetation unit, the forest lacks young individuals of the dominant tree species. This is a major problem for the persistence of the riparian forest, especially considering the reduction of annual precipitation in the wider area and the lower frequency and intensity of flood events. Conservation aspects in the view of anthropogenic pressures and natural disturbances are outlined.","WOS:000294140300009",115,0.843404048,0
"131","floodgrass","Cattle grazing increases plant species richness of most species trait groups in mesic semi-natural grasslands","The effects of cattle grazing on plant species trait groups were studied by comparing three kinds of mesic semi-natural grasslands in southern Finland: old (continuously cattle grazed), new (cattle grazing restarted 3-8 years ago) and abandoned pastures (grazing terminated > 10 years ago). Two spatial scales were studied: 1 m(2) and grassland patch (0.25-0.8 ha). Species richness was higher among most species trait groups in old than in abandoned pastures and showed some recovery in new pastures. More pronounced differences were found per m(2) than per grassland patch. Richness of perennial and biennial plants was in order old > new > abandoned pastures both per m(2) and per grassland patch, but richness of annual plants was significantly higher only per grassland patch. Grazing increased the richness of hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes and decreased that of geophytes both per m(2) and per grassland patch. Richness of small and medium-sized plants was higher in grazed than in abandoned grasslands. Only richness of the tallest species (height > 80 cm) was lower in grazed grasslands. The proportion of species trait groups, in which species richness was higher in grazed than in abandoned grasslands, was higher than in previous studies. This may be due largely to the differences in the grassland type (mesic vs. dry or wet). It is proposed that species trait responses to grazing may be related to how effectively natural factors (e.g., drought, flooding) limit plant growth. In mesic grasslands natural factors limit plant growth less than in dry or wet grasslands. Because of this the number of groups of species with different species traits benefitting from grazing is higher in mesic than in dry or wet areas.","WOS:000226444100006",14,0.840895569,1

The highest numbers of species were recorded in semi-natural grasslands, in which we report four new world records for fine-scale species richness: 17 species of vascular plants in 0.0044 m(2) in a mountain meadow in the Krkonose Mts, 52 and 63 species in 0.25 and 0.5 m(2), respectively, in the Kopanecke luky meadows in the Slovak Paradise (Slovensky raj), and 109 species in 16 m2 in the Porazky meadows in the White Carpathians (Bile Karpaty). The previous world record of 43 species in 0.1 m(2) was equalled in the Certoryje meadows in the White Carpathians, however, the previous record referred to shoot presence while the new record considers only the species rooted in the plot. We interpreted and corrected the data from the Czech Republic that Wilson et al. (2012) used to compile a list of world records and provide an updated list. The updated list contains five world records from the Czech Republic and two from Slovakia. The most species-rich grasslands and forests in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are concentrated in regions with base-rich soils in the Western Carpathians, especially in the flysch zone in SE Moravia and the Czech-Slovak borderland, and in limestone and volcanic areas in central Slovakia. The richest types of non-forest vegetation include semi-dry base-rich meadows (Bromion erecti and Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati), base-rich pastures and mesic meadows (Cynosurion cristati and Arrhenatherion elatioris), Nardus stricta grasslands (Violion caninae and Nardo strictae-Agrostion minds) and some wet meadows and natural subalpine grasslands. A special type of species-rich herbaceous to open woodland vegetation develops as successional stages on gravel accumulations in Carpathian rivers after severe flooding. The maximum counts of vascular plant species in non-forest vegetation in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are 7 species/0.0009 m(2), 11/0.0011 m(2), 12/0.004 m(2), 17/0.0044 m(2), 23/0.01 m(2), 37/0.04 m(2), 43/0.1 m(2), 52/0.25 m(2), 63/0.5 m(2), 82/1 m(2), 88/4 m(2), 109/16 m(2), 116/25 m(2), 131/49 m(2) and 133/100 m(2). While the maximum counts for plots smaller than 0.5 m(2) are from various regions and probably mainly depend on appropriate management, the maximum counts for plots larger than 0.5 m(2) are for two areas only, the south-eastern part of the White Carpathians and Kopanecke hilcy meadows, suggesting the importance of regionally specific landscape processes for high species richness at such scales. Czech and Slovak forest vegetation is much poorer than grasslands, reaching maxima of 100, 109 and 118 species in plots of 100,400 and 500 m2, which are considerably smaller than global maxima for temperate forests. Most of the species-rich sites occur on base-rich soils, in habitats with intermediate values of environmental factors, are subject to low-intensity management or natural disturbance, occur in landscapes with large areas of natural and semi-natural vegetation and probably have a long historical continuity.","WOS:000364105800001",199,0.838361369,0
"151","floodgrass","Resilience of a high-conservation-value, semi-arid grassland on fertile clay soils to burning, mowing and ploughing","In grassland reserves, managed disturbance is often necessary to maintain plant species diversity. We carried out experiments to determine the impact of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing and disc ploughing on grassland species richness and composition in a nature reserve in semi-arid eastern Australia. Vegetation response was influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn. Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or disc ploughing. In the fire experiment, species richness and composition recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on species richness and composition. Even disc ploughing caused only a small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of the treatment, and the high degree of natural movement and cracking in these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community. However, the ability of the Astrebla- and Dichanthium-dominated grasslands to recover quickly after disturbance, given favourable seasonal conditions, suggests that they are well adapted to natural disturbances (e.g. droughts, fire, flooding and native grazing).","WOS:000278107600010",33,0.838169423,1

We evaluated the response of grassland bird assemblages of the Flooding Pampas to planting of Lotus tenuis (Lotus) pasture, which mainly modifies vegetation structure by reducing vertical heterogeneity. Species richness and abundance of birds were compared between fields of Lotus pasture and semi-natural grasslands. Avian species richness and abundance were both greater in semi-natural grassland than in Lotus pasture. When grouped by nesting habits (grassland specialists, generalists), species richness and abundance of grassland specialists was greater in semi-natural grassland, whereas richness and abundance of generalist species was greater in Lotus pasture. An indicator-species analysis showed that five grassland birds were closely linked to semi-natural grassland vegetation, with two of those species - Hudson's Canastero (Asthenes hudsoni) and Bay-capped Wren-Spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides) of conservation concern. 1 In contrast, generalist species, such as Southern Lapwings (Vanellus chilensis) and Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia), were associated with Lotus pasture.

However, restorations are often limited in space or time, and we know little on whether and how restoration and management affect vertebrates. Here we assessed the local and landscape-scale effects of habitat restoration and management on small-mammal communities in the Egyek-Pusztakocs marsh system (Hortobagy National Park, Hungary), site of the largest active restoration of grasslands on former croplands in Europe. We live-trapped mice, voles and shrews in spring and autumn in 2 years (four sampling periods) at two sites in six habitat types: croplands, grasslands restored 3-6 years earlier and natural grasslands. Data on 421 individuals of 12 species showed that restored grasslands were similar to croplands and natural grasslands in species richness, abundance and composition. At the local scale, management influenced abundance because there were more small mammals in unmanaged and early-mown grasslands with taller vegetation than in late-mown or grazed grasslands with lower vegetation, or in ploughed croplands. Elevation was also important because sites at higher elevation provided refuges during spring floods or summer droughts. At the landscape scale, the proportion of restored and natural grasslands positively affected the abundance of small mammals, whereas the proportion of linear habitats (roads, canals) had a negative effect on abundance. Our results show that management is more important than restoration per se at the local scale, which is expected for habitat generalists such as small mammals in contrast to specialists such as plant-feeding invertebrates. However, restoration provides landscape-scale benefits by increasing the area of grasslands that can serve as refuges for small mammals in unfavourable periods. We thus conclude that a mosaic of restored and appropriately managed grasslands with tall vegetation will provide the best chances for the persistence of small-mammal communities in dynamic landscapes.","WOS:000363471300009",50,0.818955185,1
"192","floodgrass","Management of grasslands in rewetted floodplains: effects of grazing and cutting on vegetation development","Extensive floodplain wetlands of high conservation value have become very rare in Central Europe because of river regulation, flood control measures, drainage, and melioration. In the recent past, restoration measures for water bodies and floodplains have been used specifically to promote endangered animal and plant species of open wetlands. In the process, harvested pastures, which were formerly used intensively, are frequently restored. The question of site management following rewetting is important from a practical and economic as well as a conservation perspective. Extensive grazing on rewetted floodplain habitats is often more feasible than mowing. However, such a management change is often contested from a conservation perspective. Within the scope of this study, a vegetation analysis is used to compare different land use regimes for floodplains in the Luxembourg Syr-wetlands six years after rewetting through a land restoration project. The aim is to analyse differences in vegetation composition between the management alternatives of extensive grazing, one-cut mowing with grazing and two-cut mowing, and to draw conclusions for the future management of rewetted floodplain wetlands. Along the use limits of pasture-mowing areas, vegetation surveys have been carried out using paired sampling plots to keep site conditions as similar as possible. Alongside parameters for floristic diversity and rarity, the vegetation data have also been analysed with the help of indicator values and species traits. One dimension of an NMDS-ordination allows the vegetation composition of the management alternatives to be significantly distinguished from one another. The main influencing factor here is primarily differing land use. At the pasture areas investigated, more species were observed overall than in the mowing areas. The average species numbers, diversity indices, and structural vegetation parameters per unit of measurement point to a greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation under the influence of grazing animals. Regarding rare and conservation-relevant plant species, no significant differences between the management alternatives were recorded. In contrast, the two-cut mowing areas in particular differ from the permanent pasture with regard to species traits like life-form, reproduction type, and flowering time span. This result is not consistent with the species decline associated with a management change from mowing to grazing, which has been observed in other studies for different site conditions. The extensive mowing and grazing use in the Syr floodplain comes close to historical agricultural management forms, which are increasingly required for the conservation and development of species-rich habitat types. The different land-use regimes complement each other in the Syr valley and offer different habitats for plant species with varying species traits.","WOS:000306680700011",71,0.816729287,1

Are climatic or land-use factors the principal drivers of regional and local diversity of these grasslands? Location: Mesophytic grasslands, Argentine Pampas, Rio de la Plata grasslands. Methods: The species presence and cover was recorded in each of 96 remnant grasslands on soils suitable for cropping, grouped into five sampling locations. In each region, CIs for c-diversity and for the slope of species/area curves were estimated. Unconstrained ordination was applied to detect the principal gradients in floristic composition and correlation analysis to identify their main drivers. Mantel test was used to evaluate the correlation between floristic similarity and geographic distance, and with Euclidean distance in fragmentation and climatic variables. To rank the climatic and land-use factors that account for local species richness and percentge of exotics, we applied correlation analysis and regression models. Results: Community composition (73% native species) was mainly related to climatic variables determined by latitude, with a slight influence of fragmentation variables. Regional species richness responded to latitude: c-diversity decreased linearly with increasing distance from the Equator, as did the rate of species accumulation with expanding area. Alpha-diversity did not vary in a systematic way with latitude, being associated with landscape fragmentation and mean annual precipitation. Relative importance of C-4 grasses and mean percentage exotics showed opposite latitudinal tendencies, the former decreasing and the latter increasing towards the south. Conclusions: Latitude was a strong determinant of regional diversity and community composition, but a partial driver for local species richness, mainly influenced by landscape fragmentation. While climatic and geographic drivers determined gradual latitudinal turnover in regional species pools, within regions land-use history, stochastic processes and biotic interactions were also important. All these patterns need to be considered together when delimiting grassland nature reserves for conservation of the most diverse ecosystems of this region, currently threatened by agricultural expansion and intensification.","WOS:000423189400013",20,0.792009322,1

Large amounts of resources are put into wetland restoration with the aim to recover biodiversity. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated effects of management, wetness and flooding dynamics on biodiversity of restored wetlands such as seasonally flooded wet grasslands. We inventoried bird communities over 4years at 137 sites (each 31ha) within five restored wet grassland areas in Sweden to investigate whether species richness and occurrence of 12 common wet grassland species were related to (i) local conditions such as management (grazing, mowing and unmanaged areas), basic wetness and spring flooding dynamics. Further, we investigated whether (ii) the composition of the adjacent landscape (20ha) related to local bird diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale. Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale. Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure, resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet grassland bird species.Synthesis and applications. The selection of wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest edges. Restoration and management of wet grasslands should include water level management, removal of shrubs and trees, and low-intensity grazing, whereas mowing could be used in non-flooded grasslands of low basic wetness.

Hydrology has the strongest influence on wetland biodiversity, second to which agriculture is the most influential factor. This study investigates the influence of hydrology and farming practices on the abundance, species richness and composition of dipteran communities on temperate Atlantic floodplain hay meadows. Insects were sampled by sweep-net across twenty-four vegetation zones for which hydrological variables were calculated by combining river level data with fine-scale topographical data. Plant communities were surveyed using relev,s and land owners were interviewed to gather data on current and past management regimes. A total of twenty-two sciomyzid species were recorded; over one-third of the Irish fauna. Flood depth and duration were found to have the strongest influence on sciomyzids, syrphids and plants. Sciomyzid species richness and total abundance were both positively correlated with hydroperiod and flood depth while both plants and syrphids responded negatively to increases. The difference in response highlights the need to assess more than one taxonomic group, when assessing the impact of changing environmental variables on biodiversity. Whereas vegetation structure drives changes in sciomyzid indicator species, plant species richness and composition, past management regimes and current nutrient inputs do not appear to influence these species. Thus, while the maintenance of the hydrological heterogeneity and the diversity of mowing regimes is important in maintaining biodiversity, variation in nutrient inputs and previous management (at least within the range here investigated) is likely to be of lesser importance for Syrphidae and Sciomyzidae.","WOS:000336400000013",8,0.770144715,1

MethodsWe evaluated grazing effects on plant composition, species richness, beta-diversity and life-form abundances along a ten-fold, regional productivity gradient and within subregions of contrasting productivity, using a common sampling protocol for 23 paired grazed vs ungrazed plots. The annual integral of the normalized difference vegetation index was used as a surrogate for above-ground net primary productivity. ResultsCompositional dissimilarity between grazed and ungrazed plots, as well as grazing-induced differences in plant richness and beta-diversity all increased with habitat productivity. Grazing decreased species richness in low-productive steppes but enhanced the richness of high-productive grasslands. On average, grazing reduced beta-diversity in high-productive sites but not in low-productive sites. Dominant species were more strongly suppressed by grazing towards productive grasslands. Grazing generally decreased shrub species cover, whereas graminoid and forb cover did not consistently change with grazing through the productivity gradient. ConclusionsOur results indicate that the overall grazing effects on vegetation structure increased along a regional productivity gradient. Yet the sign of grazing impacts on species richness and beta-diversity shifted with habitat productivity, in agreement with models of herbivore-mediated co-existence and species colonization in productive systems. Further, we found that narrowing the spatial extent of analysis to the subregion generally obscured grazing-productivity relationships.

We studied the community composition of the grazed and ungrazed situations, and determined biomass and above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of the three treatments during 1 year. Grazed plots had higher species richness and diversity than the exclosure. Grazing resulted in the replacement of some cool-season, tussock grasses by warm-season, prostrate grasses. ANPP was 51% higher under grazing than in the exclosure, but the grazing-simulated plots inside the exclosure were the most productive treatment, 29% higher than the grazed plots. Thus, two components of grazing effect may be postulated for this grassland. The structural component resulted in higher ANPP, probably due to the elimination of standing dead biomass. The species composition component resulted in lower ANPP once the structural component was controlled, probably due to the shift to warm-season phenology and prostrate habit. Our findings contrast with a similar experiment carried out in the neighbouring Flooding Pampa region, which suggests that the relationship between grazing and community structure and function is difficult to generalize.","WOS:000231805000008",7,0.752881982,1
"58","floodgrass","More species, but all do the same: contrasting effects of flood disturbance on ground beetle functional and species diversity","The role of habitat disturbance on biodiversity is central as it promotes changes in ecological systems. That said, still little is known about the functional consequences of such changes. Functional diversity can be used to revealing more mechanistically the disturbance effects on communities by considering the richness and the distribution of traits among the species. Here we analyzed the response of functional and species diversity of ground beetles to flood disturbance to better understand the functioning of alluvial invertebrate communities. Ground beetles were sampled in periodically flooded grasslands along the Elbe River in Germany. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to unveil the relationships between flood disturbance, species and functional diversity, respectively. We measured different components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, dispersion, and divergence) and analyzed species diversity by means of rarefied species richness, abundances, evenness and Simpson's diversity. We found contrasting relationships in that most species diversity measures peaked at highest disturbance levels, while most functional diversity measures decreased with increasing disturbance intensities. Inversed relationships between species and functional diversity are rarely observed, as most studies report on positive correlations. We explain increasing species diversity with a higher amount of resources available in highly disturbed sites. Decreasing functional diversity is best explained through the convergence of species traits by flood disturbance and uneven resource exploitation in highly disturbed plots (low functional evenness), suggesting strong impacts from functionally different generalist species in floodchannels. We show that the amount of resources available, and how these resources are exploited, play major roles in the functioning of floodplain ground beetle communities.","WOS:000301537200004",11,0.720979262,0
"79","floodgrass","Floristic heterogeneity of Flooding Pampa grasslands: a multi-scale analysis","The present paper describes vegetation heterogeneity at contrasting spatial scales in order to analyse patterns of floristic diversity and vegetation-environment relations in the Flooding Pampa grasslands of Argentina. The overall grassland flora contains a large proportion of exotic species, which are mostly annual forbs. At a regional scale, there is a latitudinal turnover in relative abundance of major grass tribes, and C-3 grasses become increasingly common in grasslands at higher latitudes. The principal gradients in overall vegetation composition were associated with landscape-level changes in topography and soil chemistry. Both native and exotic species richness increased with topographic elevation, and markedly decreased in flood-prone habitats with acidic or saline soils. In remnants of tussock grassland, the predominant physiognomy of the Pampas in pre-settlement times, the presence of the tall native grass Paspalum quadrifarium is a strong determinant of local community structure, reducing the percentage of exotic species. Heterogeneity analysis at the community scale revealed a fine-grained species packing that was in sharp contrast with spatial mosaics observed in other grasslands under livestock grazing. At this scale, spatial variation in floristic composition correlated with changes in various soil parameters, but not with subtle differences in topographic relief. The studied grasslands possess some unique features that contribute towards a better understanding of how current vegetation heterogeneity is controlled by historical, environmental and management factors.","WOS:000233849700002",16,0.685327781,0

Sampled sites in the piedmont zone have greater similarity both in species richness and representativeness of some taxonomic groups, and there is also the presence of unique species such as Parides erithalion, Dismorphia crisia, Pereute leucodrosime and Pycina zamba. Moreover, sampled sites in the flood savanna zone are less diverse than the piedmont areas and more similar to each other, since they share a large percentage of the species composition, mainly Anartia amathea, Callicore cyllene, Chlosyne poecile and Siproeta stelenes, species that are adapted to disturbed habitats. Heraclides thoas, Adelpha alala, Danaus gilippus and Heliconius erato are categorized as common species because they are most often shared between sites and samplings. Finally, it highlights the dominance shown by subfamilies Biblidinae and Ithomiinae in most sites sampled in the plains piedmont. This result can be correlated to the high abundance and availability of resources over the different micro-habitats that make up these ecosystems, favoring the establishment of particular species.","WOS:000342607300009",5,0.674625914,0
"107","floodgrass","Viable seed banks under grazing and exclosure conditions in montane mesic grasslands of Argentina","Grazing by large herbivores affects the composition of established vegetation and seed banks. Montane Pampas grasslands are highly productive and have evolved with the influence of grazing by native herbivores. Thus we proposed, firstly that grazing by feral horses would increase seed bank diversity, without changing seed density in grazed areas and secondly that there is a greater similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation in exclosure areas. The study area is located in sub-humid montane grassland in mid-eastern Argentina. Sampling took place at the beginning and end of summer in 2008 and 2009, in three one-year-old exclosures and grazed areas. Soil and litter samples were collected and established vegetation cover was visually recorded in every area. Each sample was elutriated and sieved. Seed composition was recorded using a dissecting microscope. Seed density and species richness of the samples was analyzed using ANOVA and species composition was analyzed by multivariate analysis. Grazing reduces the seed density and richness of grasses, but forb species are not affected. The seed density of grasses increases in soil samples at the end of summer, while the density of forb species does not change. Similarity between the established vegetation and the seed bank was low. Grazing affects seed bank composition which could limit restoration time after the removal of herbivores. However, grass seed availability increases considerably during a short period after exclosure establishment, showing high potential for recovery in sub-humid grasslands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"119","floodgrass","Restoring grassland biodiversity: Sowing low-diversity seed mixtures can lead to rapid favourable changes","We studied the effect of sowing low-diversity seed mixtures (containing 2-3 competitive grass species) on the regeneration of vegetation on croplands previously used as alfalfa fields. In four permanent plots in 10 restored fields (four with alkali and six with loess seed mixture) the cover of flowering plants was recorded and phytomass was measured between 2006 and 2008. We asked three questions: (i) How fast will weedy, short-lived species decrease in abundance during secondary succession enhanced by sowing low-diversity seed mixtures? (ii) Can weeds be suppressed by sowing competitive native grasses, followed up by management by mowing? (iii) Can succession towards the target native grasslands be accelerated by sowing only low-diversity seed mixtures compared to set-aside old field succession? Our results showed that in just two years a vegetation dominated by perennial grasses has developed, which successfully prevented the establishment of weed species. These results suggested that sowing seeds of two or three competitive grass species is an effective tool to eliminate weed domination and to lead towards the restoration of species poor grasslands with grass domination such as alkali grasslands. However, the developed dense perennial grass cover and the accumulated litter may hamper the immigration of specialist species characteristic to reference grasslands. Therefore, the restoration of species-rich grasslands requires the facilitation of the immigration of grassland specialist species by further management (grazing, mowing and/or hay-transport).

The study was conducted nearby the town of Caceres, in Pantanal - Mato Grosso, on six livestock farms subject to the flood pulse of Paraguay River. The types of land use sampled were native savanna and cultivated pasture. Flooded and dry plots were selected, both from the savanna and the pasture in each sampling area. Termite richness and abundance was analysed based on the environments as an explanatory variable (FP - flooded pasture, DP - dry pasture, FS - flooded savanna, DS - dry savanna) through GLM; Tukey's test was subsequently performed to determine whether land use and/or flood pulse can significantly affect the termite community. There were 37 termite species and 19 genera. Richness and abundance of termite species cannot be explained by flooding pulse, but were explained only by land use (pasture and savanna). We identified a greater richness and abundance of arboreal species in flooded environments. In conclusion, flood pulse is not a determining factor for savannas or pasture termite richness, but it changes the composition of the termite fauna in the environment.","WOS:000413604500010",3,0.580446465,1

Near-to-the-ground and below-ground biomass were measured three times during this period. Besides, composition, species richness and diversity were obtained through a floristic inventory. Despite a relatively high floristic richness and diversity, Panicum laxum is the dominant species throughout the study area, while three other perennial grasses, Paspalum chaffanjonii, Leersia hexandra and Axonopus purpusii, also reach high values of cover and biomass. Each of them reacts specifically to flooding, drought and grazing conditions. This ecosystem shows a strongly seasonal behaviour. with primary production, mortality and decomposition sharply timed by soil relative water content. Both drought and water excess seem to limit plant production, even more during wet years when the savanna might remain flooded for up to 4 mo. Some structural and functional differences between the grazed and the protected systems are demonstrated. but under the actual, relatively low stocking rate, the grazed savanna produces as much forage as the ungrazed one.","WOS:000220913000009",19,0.54836976,1

A confinement gradient related to an increase in macrophyte density and determined by the nearest distance from permanent waters seemed to be a key factor in structuring the fish community in the flooded grasslands. Along this gradient, Cyprinids (essentially 0+) dominated near permanent water bodies (95% in abundance) but were substituted further by more tolerant species (Anguilla anguilla and Lepomis gibbosus) and mainly Ameiurus melas (age > 1, 40% in abundance). Although most species (10/13) present in the main permanent channels have been found in flooded grasslands, the efficiency of these grasslands as fish habitat was low compared to other similar sites from literature. We concluded on the importance of a confinement gradient and the water regime, isolating grasslands during summer and responsible of the scarce presence of fish.","WOS:000231173500001",1,0.518136715,0

We examined fish assemblage composition in three mangrove creek systems in Tanzania (East Africa), including two creeks where the upper parts were partly clear-cut of mangrove forest due to the construction of solar salt farms, and one creek with undisturbed mangrove forest. Fish were caught monthly for one year using a seine net (each haul covering 170 m(2)) within three locations in each creek, i.e. at the upper, intermediate and lower reaches. Density, biomass and species number of fish were lower in the upper deforested sites compared to the mangrove-fringed sites at the intermediate and lower parts in the two creeks affected by deforestation, whereas there were no differences among the three sites in the undisturbed mangrove creek system. in addition, multivariate analyses showed that the structure of fish assemblages varied between forested and clear-cut sites within the two disturbed creeks, but not within the undisturbed creek. Across the season, we found no significant differences except for a tendency of a minor increase in fish densities during the rainy season. At least 75% of the fishes were juveniles and of commercial interest for coastal fisheries and/or aquaculture. Mugil cephalus, Gerres oyena and Chanos chanos were the most abundant species in the forested sites. The dominant species in the clear-cut areas were M. cephalus and Elops machnata, which were both found in relatively low abundances compared to the undisturbed areas. The conversion of mangrove forests into solar salt farms not only altered fish assemblage composition, but also water and sediment conditions. In comparison with undisturbed areas, the clear-cut sites showed higher salinity, water temperature as well as organic matter and chlorophyll a in the sediments. Our results suggest that mangrove habitat loss and changes in environmental conditions caused by salt farm developments will decrease fish densities, biomass and species numbers as well as alter the overall fish assemblage composition in the salt farm area but not downstream in the creek.

Larvae were sampled over a 2-yr period in 7 wetland types (brackish and freshwater herbaceous swamps, mangrove swamps, freshwater ponds, clear-cut marsh forests, small irrigation canals, and swamp forests), covering 3 environmental gradients (salinity, aquatic vegetation, and habitat permanence). Twelve variables were quantified to describe each habitat. Two species of anophelines were collected. An. aquasalis was the species with the widest distribution, and its highest abundance was in the seasonal brackish mangrove habitat during the rainy season. An. oswaldoi Peryassu was rarely encountered but was mainly associated with the dry season and with the permanent freshwater wetlands (such as ponds). Principal components and correlation analyses revealed that the physicochemical (salinity, disserved oxygen) variables of the wetland were associated most strongly with the spatial distribution of both species. Variations in salinity were strongly associated with the abundance of An. aquasalis. Both the occurrence and abundance of An. oswaldoi were most closely correlated with disserved oxygen. Changes in seasonal abundance of both species were associated with rainfall. The relevance of these results to vector control in northern Venezuela is discussed.","WOS:000089625000008",3,0.609631306,1

Study sites included relatively undisturbed, recently protected mangroves and clear-cut mangrove areas that were sampled during both the wet and dry seasons. Physicochemical parameters, nitrogenase activity, pore water nutrient concentrations and bacterial diversity were measured in sediment depth profiles using both molecular and chemical techniques. Results show that there are significant differences in sediment pore water nutrient concentrations and bacterial diversity in sediments of mangrove areas which have been deforested compared to those which have been protected. Average measured values for protected and deforested areas, respectively, were: sulphide (S-2-),S- < 42 +/- 10 mu M and > 1.9 +/- 0.5 mM at 30 cm depth; ammonium (NH4+), 58 +/- 2 mu M and 113 +/- 12 mu M at 4-5 cm depth; soluble reactive phosphate, 40.2 +/- 11 mu M and 18.4 +/- 1.2 at 4-5 cm depth. Nitrogen fixation rates were lower in deforested areas during day and night, organic content was higher in protected areas (20 +/- 5%) compared to deforested areas (12 +/- 3%).

Because little phenotypic variation has been reported for this species, we investigated genetic, physiological, and/or morphological variations in 18 strains of C. ogasawaraensis isolated from 14 countries. The combined data of plastid-encoded ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene and its spacer, nuclear-encoded large subunit (LSU) rDNA, and mitochondrion-encoded cox spacer region suggested that this species is divided into three groups; Group I contains Australian, Melanesian, and Micronesian strains; Group II includes strains from western Pacific coasts, Micronesia, and Madagascar; and Group III consists eastern Pacific-Atlantic and Malaysian strains. Considering wide distribution range and close genetic similarity within the groups, a long-distance dispersal event does not seem to be rare in this species. Growth of the strains was compared between brackish (salinity = 8) and seawater (salinity = 32) media; most Group I strains grew well in both brackish and seawater media; whereas, all the Group II strains showed better growth in the brackish medium. Morphological analyses of the strains incubated under the same conditions revealed that the Group III strains had wider rhizoids than the other strains. However, this feature was highly variable and easily affected by environmental and algal conditions. Although such morphological and physiological variations suggest speciation of the three phylogenetic groups, more clear-cut features are required to describe them as distinct morpho-species.","WOS:000344067800007",5,0.304799372,0

Mangrove deforestation is widespread in the Greater Caribbean but its impact on macrobenthos has not been evaluated to date. In order to assess the impact of mangrove conversion to pasture, densities and shell sizes of two dominant gastropods (Neritina virginea and Melampus coffeus) were compared among four mangrove types: 1) Rhizophora mangle-dominated fringing mangroves, 2) Avicennia germinans-dominated basin mangroves, 3) Mixed-species basin mangroves, and 4) A. germ mans- basin mangroves converted to pastures, in the Turbo River Delta (Uraba Gulf, Colombia). Mangrove types were polygon-delimited with satellite images and color aerial photographs were taken in 2009. Various (n<5) polygons per mangrove type were sampled in January, July and December 2009, and a total (n<20) 0.025m(2)-quadrats were randomly placed along each polygon. Forest structure variables, pore-water physicochemical variables and sediment-grain metrics were measured in the four mangrove types. Mean density and size of both gastropod species were measured. The results showed that the mean density and size of both species were significantly greater in R. mangle-fringing mangroves. N. virginea density decreased gradually towards the A. germinans-basin mangroves seemly related to the diadromous life-history. This species nearly disappeared in the neighboring pastures because individuals were constrained to a few remaining flooded areas. In the pastures, M coffeus individuals were clumped in the remaining A. germinans trees due to its climbing behavior as a pulmonate. We hypothesize that the decline of these two gastropods was related to physical microhabitat (e.g. trees, prop roots, and seedlings) degradation, and alteration of soil properties (e.g. temperature, pH, organic matter content). Finally, we also hypothesize that the local extinction of N. virginea due to clear-cutting may exert strong negative effects on the ecosystem function because it is a dominant omnivore. Rev. Biol.

The three mangroves surveyed were different in their surroundings, which varied from highly urbanised areas to conservation areas with natural vegetation. Overall, 69 species were collected, and no remarkable difference was detected in species composition and abundances or in the richness, evenness and heterogeneity between sites. The species abundance distribution observed fitted to a theoretical lognormal distribution in the three mangroves. The species richness scored and the performance of the species richness estimators showed an unexpectedly high diversity, considering the very low floristic diversity and the harsh conditions of the environment. Regarding species composition and abundances, the drosophilid mangrove assemblages were shown to be more similar to those found in open environments, with a marked dominance of exotic species.

While biodiversity is traditionally based on species richness and composition, there is a growing concern to take into account functional diversity to assess and manage species communities. In spite of their economic importance, functional diversity quantified by a traits-based approach is still poorly documented in tropical estuaries. In this study, the functional diversity of fishes was investigated within four estuaries in Pernambuco state, northeast of Brazil. These areas are subject to different levels of human impact (e.g. mangrove deforestation, shrimp farming, fishing etc.) and environmental conditions. Fishes were collected during 34 scientific surveys. A total of 122 species were identified and 12 functional traits were quantified describing two main functions: food acquisition and locomotion. Fish abundance and functional dissimilarities data were combined into a multivariate analysis, the Double Principal Coordinate Analysis, to identify the functional typology of fish assemblages according to the estuary. Results showed that Itapissuma, the largest estuary with a wider mangrove forest area, differs from the other three estuaries, showing higher mean values per samples of species richness S and quadratic entropy Q. Similarly, it presented a different functional typology (the first two axes of the DPCoA account for 68.7% of total inertia, while those of a traditional PCA based solely on species abundances provided only 17.4%). Conversely, Suape, Sirinhaem, and to a lower extent Rio Formoso, showed more similarity in their diversity. This result was attributed to their predominantly marine influenced hydrological features, and similar levels of species abundances and in morphological traits. Overall, this study, combining diversity indices and a recent multivariate analysis to access species contribution to functional typology, allows to deepen diversity assessment by providing additional information regarding the functional pattern of fish assemblages.

Over a two-year period, a total of 14 species were recorded with the species diversity (H'(log(2))) ranged from 0.54 to 2.4. The community was dominated by two large polychaetes (Neanthes glandicincta and Potamilla acuminata) and a number of small pollution tolerant species (Tharyx, Capitella capitata and Prionospio cirrifera). It was also characterized by both temporal and spatial variations in terms of abundance and species composition with the lowest species number observed at onshore Station B in August and the highest at offshore Station D in February. Two distinct polychaete communities were formed along the intertidal towards subtidal mudflat, particularly the assemblage at onshore Station B showing a significant difference from those at the other three stations (P < 0.05, N = 32). Results of the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC) indicated a typical impacted community at the whole study area, especially at Station B which was close to the Shenzhen River mouth and mangrove forest. The total organic carbon had a significant positive effect on the abundance of Capitella capitata (P = 0.037, N = 8) while sedimentary compositions were statistically related to the abundance of Potamilla acuminata, Tharyx and total abundance of polychaetes (P < 0.05, N = 8). In conclusion, both the polluted Shenzhen River and nearby mangrove may be responsible for the decline in species richness and diversity as well as changes in community structure. Polychaetes can be used as the appropriate indicators in habitat ecological condition assessment instead of the whole benthic community.","WOS:000280568300008",9,0.722777312,0

This lagoon has been affected by various human activities for decades, in particular fishing, effluents from agriculture and industry, and illegal deforestation. In total, 163 taxa were identified, including 127 species occurring in the mangrove forest and 59 species in the subtidal. Mean density of macrobenthos was 2.5-fold higher in the central (881.8 +/- A 1,151.3 ind. m(-2)) than in the eastern mangrove site (356.3 +/- A 218.8 ind. m(-2)). Community structures differed significantly between these sites and showed a serial shift during the investigation period. Gastropods dominated the community in the central mangrove location, whereas sipunculids, polychaetes and gastropods had similar densities in the eastern site. Differences in community composition were best explained by three sediment properties: pore water salinity, delta C-13(org), and C-org/N. It is suggested that small-scale heterogeneity of food availability and quality is a main factor determining the small-scale variability of the community composition. Compared to other Indo-West Pacific mangroves, species richness and densities are high. However, the dominance of specific taxa, especially of opportunistic species and the comparably low species richness in the subtidal of the lagoon may be attributed to the high sediment input by rivers in the central part and to the large-scale cutting of mangroves. Continuous tree logging will probably lead to a further spread of two fast growing understorey plants and thus to an increase of uniform swamp sites and a decrease of micro-habitats for benthic macrofauna. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study on the spatio-temporal variation of benthic macrofauna in mangroves of Indonesia.","WOS:000272047100006",10,0.678581603,0

In Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA, freshwater discharges into nearshore areas have resulted in the fragmentation of the spatial patterning of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). To understand the ecological consequences of the freshwater-induced SAV seascape fragmentation, fish and crustaceans were sampled using seine nets across seascapes with continuous and highly fragmented SAV spatial configurations and across salinity regimes. Fragmented SAV seascapes supported significantly higher species diversity of fish and crustaceans, especially in areas influenced by freshwater discharges. Also, fragmented seascapes supported a higher abundance of the pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum and the goby Gobiosoma robustum, and higher biomass of generalist predatory fishes than seascapes with continuous SAV. In contrast, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides was more abundant in seascapes with continuous SAV. Faunal assemblage composition differed between zones of contrasting salinity regimes, and the contribution of species occurrence and abundance to the differentiation of assemblage composition between seascape types was associated with the salinity regimes of the seascapes. Thus, water salinity and spatial properties of SAV seascapes are factors that interact to influence faunal community structure in Biscayne Bay. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how environmental context (e.g. salinity regimes) can modulate the influence of benthic spatial patterning on the abundance and biodiversity of nekton communities.","WOS:000431203900002",11,0.505133974,0

A study from Abaco Island, The Bahamas","Habitat fragmentation represents one of the most important threats to biodiversity. Fragmentation of aquatic ecosystems is pervasive, fundamentally altering aquatic community structure and ecosystem function on a worldwide scale. Because of the many ecological changes associated with hydrologic fragmentation of coastal wetlands, there may be cascading effects on non-aquatic organisms. Here we explored if anthropogenic fragmentation of tidal creek wetlands on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, affected bird communities. By comparing fragmented and unfragmented sections of nine separate tidal creeks, we tested whether fragmentation of coastal wetlands (due to roads) affected the richness, abundance, and composition of wetland bird assemblages. Although bird communities significantly differed among tidal creeks (irrespective of fragmentation status), and water salinity was positively correlated with species richness and abundance of wetland-associated birds, we found no significant differences in bird communities between fragmented and unfragmented sections of wetlands. Our findings suggest fragmented portions of tidal creek wetlands support avian communities relatively similar to their unfragmented counterparts, despite a range of differences in environmental features. These results indicate that other ecological factors (i.e., salinity) may be more important than fragmentation per se in affecting bird utilization of wetland habitats in The Bahamas.","WOS:000356540000018",12,0.628458523,1

There remains a lack of understanding of how artificial structures function as habitat compared to natural substrates, particularly those being lost, such as mangrove prop roots. The objectives of this study were to compare benthic epifaunal communities on artificial structures to those on mangrove prop roots across a large spatial scale and to assess seasonal trends of colonizing species within each habitat. Identified species were also classified as either native or non-native to assess whether artificial structures harbor more non-natives compared to mangroves. Results indicated that community composition differed significantly between habitat types, as did richness and diversity. More species were found and in higher percent cover on artificial structures. Only a few species were dominant throughout the study and were present in both habitats, and these species varied in their abundance across sites and time. Colonization at all sites was continuous throughout each season, particularly for those dominant species. Non-native species richness made up 30-50% of the community composition in each of the habitats and was significantly higher on artificial structures. Overall, artificial structures appeared to provide a functional, unique surface for both dominant and rare species and could act as a buffer to biodiversity loss in mangroves, a globally threatened habitat.","WOS:000452891600006",13,0.682583612,0

The lagoon is surrounded by the largest mangrove stand in Java and is under constant anthropogenic pressure, mainly due to logging, land conversion for agriculture, overfishing and industrial pollution. This study aims to determine the crab community composition at different sites of the lagoon in relation to vegetation composition and sediment parameters. In addition it investigates if mangrove crabs can be used as bioindicators to describe the environmental state of mangrove forests (tree diversity, degree of logging). It was assumed to find a low crab diversity and species richness and a strong dominance of a single species at highly disturbed forest sites compared to moderately disturbed sites. A stratified, hierarchical design was used to sample the crab fauna at 13 stations distributed over the entire lagoon. Additionally, abiotic parameters and vegetation composition were recorded. In total 6463 crabs were caught belonging to 49 species, 5 super-families and 10 families, with Ocypodidae and Sesarmidae being the families of most note. Mean density of adult crabs was 27.7 individuals*m(-2) and mean biomass was 12.8 g wet mass*m(-2) or 1.3 g ash free dry mass*m-2. Density and biomass varied strongly within and between stations but they where within the range reported for other mangrove forests of the Indo-West-Pacific. Species composition was significantly different between stations. The distribution of facultatively leaf-feeding grapsid crabs was related to vegetation parameters (tree, seedling and undergrowth density), but the occurrence of single crab and tree species was not correlated. The distribution of ocypodid crabs, feeding on detritus and micro-phytobenthos, correlated with sediment characteristics like median grain size and organic content. The crab community was strongly dominated by one species at six stations, however, this was not correlated to the degree of logging. Leaf-feeding crab and mangrove tree diversity was correlated at areas of one hectare (stations), but not at a lower spatial scale (areas of 100 m(2), ""zone""). Species richness of leaf-feeding crabs was not linked to forest diversity. Hence a functional relation between leaf-feeding crab and tree species diversity could not be proven. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study set out to understand how different wood harvesting regimes have affected the biodiversity of a tropical ecosystem and to identify relationships between the heavy metal concentrations in the mangrove sediments and tree felling. Soil samples were collected and plant diversity studies carried out on seven sites in the mangrove. Physico-chemical, chemical and mineralogical analyses were done on soil samples and plant population structure, species richness, evenness and diversity index at these sites were calculated. Results showed that soils across sites were characteristically clayey and acidic, with high organic matter content. Minerals identified included quartz, gibbsite, goethite, hematite and kaolinite. Heavy metal concentrations were higher in Sites 6 and 7 with a longer history of anthropogenic activity. There were strong negative correlations between the duration of logging and NO3-N (r = -0.838, p = 0.019), total N (r = -0.837, p = 0.019), NH4 (+)-N (r = -0.844, p = 0.017), Mg = (-0.789, p = 0.035), K (r = -0.819, p = 0.024), and Na (r = -0.988, p = 0.002). Sites which had experienced logging for longer periods (sites 3, 6, and 7) had lower nutrient content and lower values for species richness and diversity index. Logging in mangrove ecosystems could alter soil characteristics, decreasing plant diversity and abundance. Logging dynamics around mangrove ecosystems should be considered in the wider strategy for management and conservation of similar mangrove ecosystems.","WOS:000377432000006",15,0.646883186,1

Although wood-inhabiting fungi do not show high host specificity or preference in many tropical areas, several are specific to Dipterocarpaceae trees in Malaysia and some species may preferably inhabit other minor tree species. Tree size and decomposition stage are also important determinants of which fungi are present. Among the polypores described by E. J. H. Corner, 41 and 26 species have been recorded only from Malaysian lowland rainforest and montane forest, respectively. Evidence suggests that both of these forest types in Malaysia are home to unique fungal communities. More than 30 polypore species described by Corner are known only from their type localities. These species are likely rare and may be restricted to old-growth forests. Logging decreases species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi because the number of natural treefalls is decreased in logged forests, and the decline of old-growth forests is a major threat to conservation of Malaysian fungi. However, species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi is relatively high in old secondary forests and forests undergoing reduced-impact logging. The diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi is extremely low in oil palm plantations, whereas several species inhabit rubber-tree and acacia plantations. Preservation of old-growth forest is essential for conserving rare wood-inhabiting fungi in Malaysia, but old secondary forests, reduced-impact logged forests, and matured tree plantations may have some importance for the conservation of some species.","WOS:000307295400012",16,0.768842402,1

They operate relevant ecological roles in terms of structure and function in mangrove ecosystems. The study aims to assess crab diversity and the patterns of their distribution for biodiversity documentation. The survey was carried out in mangrove forests of the Cameroon coastline. Investigations were randomly carried out on 17 degraded mangrove areas where Rhizophora stands dominated. Crabs were collected during the period of low tide, during day and night times in the 4 x 4 m(2) quadrant plots delimited inside each belt zonation throughout transects. In total, 27 crab morphospecies were recorded with global sampling effort equals to 87.5%. Eleven morphospecies were recorded for the first time in Cameroon. Sesarmid crabs were most represented (10 species) with abundant taxa (72.9% of individuals). Crab community has low species richness and diversity indices (d = 0.004; H' = 3.3 +/- 0.1; J' = 0.8). Hill evenness are close to 1, confirms that one species (Guinearma kamermani) tends to dominate the whole community. Armases elegans, Chiromantes buettikoferi, Goniopsis pelii, Metagrapsus curvatus, Guinearma alberti, G.huzardi and G. kamermani were the common species in the study areas. The Center mangrove stands appeared most diverse (E(S-n=401) = 18 +/- 1.1species), followed by the South (E(S-n=401) = 16 +/- 0.5species) and the North (E(S-n=401) = 11 +/- 0.0species). Species abundance is typically distributed as in linear log series (Motomura model) corresponding to the disturbed environments. The lack of conservation strategies in the management of mangrove forests in Cameroon might lead to the disappearance of these ecosystem properties and its relevant components. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The ecotones were in a sequence from scattered mangroves, through salt marsh, rush-marsh. scrub, woodland, to pasture. We developed a method to objectively define, by rapid vegetational change, the position and depth of an ecotone. identifying five ecotones. Their positions were consistent across three sampling schemes and two spatial grain sizes. One ecotone is a switch ecotone, produced by positive feedback between community and environment. Another is anthropogenic, due to clearing for agriculture. Two others are probably environmental in cause, and one may be largely a relict environmental ecotone. Sharp changes in species composition occurred. Three ecotones were associated with a change in plant physiognomy. In two, the ecotone was located just outside a woodland canopy. in the zone influenced by the canopy. Community mosaicity was evident at only one ecotone. There were few strictly ecotonal species, many species occurred more frequently within ecotones than in adjacent vegetation, but there were never significantly more ecotonal species than expected at random. There was little evidence for the spatial mass effect reducing ecotonal sharpness, or leading to higher species richness within ecotones. Species richness was higher than in the adjacent habitat in only one ecotone. It seems that supposedly characteristic ecotone features depend on the particular ecological situation, and the ecology of the species present, rather than being intrinsic properties of ecotones.","WOS:000186226400013",19,0.501809676,0
"201","mang","The effect of the surrounding landscape matrix on mangrove bird community assembly in north Australia","Mangroves are highly threatened ecosystems yet their community ecology is poorly understood. We examined the ecological determinants of bird community assemblage in floristically depauperate mangroves. Birds were surveyed using line transect methods. Large mangrove patches supported fewer species than smaller patches. Patches did not comprise nested species subsets and the bird species richness of several small patches combined was greater than a single large area. The number of mangrove dependent species in a patch was area-dependent suggesting these species may be resource limited, although there was no species density compensation. There was a clear effect of the surrounding habitat, with matrix species accounting for similar to 45% of bird species in a patch. Patches surrounded by tropical savanna were relatively species-poor, while regardless of size, patches including monsoon rainforest were relatively species rich. Null model analysis of non-random assemblage structure (nestedness and species co-occurrence) revealed no deterministic structure to the overall mangrove species assemblage. These analyses described a random pattern of bird distribution and with no evidence of density compensation this suggests that competition is a weak structuring force of mangrove bird assemblages. The lack of nestedness and the random co-occurrence of species are consistent with the matrix-dependence of bird community composition. Conservation plans should treat mangrove patches as part of a habitat mosaic and incorporate many smaller mangrove patches rather than just big ones. Consideration of the nature, extent and diversity of the surrounding matrices is vital in managing and conserving mangrove bird communities. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To our knowledge no study has looked at the long-term consequences of tropical forest fragmentation on the three main components of plant diversity simultaneously: taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. We sampled the vascular flora using belt transects (50 x 4 m) in a continuous tropical semi-evergreen forest (16 transects) and in an adjacent naturally fragmented forest (fragments of 1.7-My-old semi-evergreen forest immersed in a mangrove/sedge matrix) (18 transects), and compared their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic plant diversity. There were 36 species in the continuous forest and 28 in the fragmented forest. Continuous forest was taxonomically more diverse (25%) than the fragmented forest. All functional diversity metricswere greater (6-33%) in the continuous than in the fragmented forest. Phylogenetic diversity was 19% greater and phylogenetically more overdispersed in the continuous forest than in the fragmented forest. The results suggest that in the fragmented forest not only is taxonomic plant diversity lower, but functional and phylogenetic diversity are as well. The negative effects of forest fragmentation on plant diversity seem to be chronic.","WOS:000337763100005",24,0.843069445,1

We investigated the environmental factors influencing tree abundance and regeneration in diverse forest types growing in the riparian area of an urbanizing landscape along the Chao Phraya River. We established 252 0.1-ha circular plots in remnant forest patches along 372 km of the river. Cluster analysis was applied to classify the forest types. The relationships between environmental variables and tree abundance were assessed with ordination analysis, and generalized linear models were used to assess seedling/sapling abundance. The cluster analysis revealed five forest types, including floodplain forest with three sub-forest types, swamp forest, and mangrove forest. The ordination indicated that tree abundance in the floodplain forest was positively affected by distance to the ocean and the proportion of forested area. Swamp forest was positively influenced by the proportion of urbanized area and mean rainfall. Mangrove forest was negatively related to distance to the river. Seedling/sapling abundance of the dominant species in the floodplain forests was positively affected by lowland plain topography and negatively affected by the proportion of urbanized area, whereas swamp and mangrove forest species were positively influenced by the proportion of urbanized area and estuarine topography. Mature tree density influenced seedling/sapling abundance of all forest types. Tree abundance and regeneration of the riparian landscape was prevented by the urbanized area, floodplain, estuarine topography, and mature tree densities in remnant forests. These results suggest that remnant forest patches of conserved riparian forests along the urbanized landscape of the Chao Phraya River must be protected and the factors determining their colonization must be considered to enhance restoration practices.","WOS:000418471500017",47,0.900944954,0

In this process of deforestation karst hills and coastal wetlands have been some of the most severely modified forest types; however, we know little about their bird community dynamics and their relation with habitat variables. To address this issue we studied bird species composition and habitat characteristics in karst forest and two coastal forested wetlands (mangrove and Pterocarpus forest) in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. In each forest type, we conducted 10 point counts monthly for two years and characterized habitat variables. We performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination and a multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) for each year to determine the similarity of bird species composition among monthly censuses and the relation between species composition and habitat variables. This ordination technique grouped censuses into three groups: karst forest, Pterocarpus and mangrove in the migratory period, and Pterocarpus and mangrove in the non-migratory period. The high tree species richness in the karst forest, and the presence of standing water in coastal wetlands were the most important habitat variables associated with the different bird communities. Our results demonstrate that the karst and coastal wetlands forests, even if they are small patches surrounded by a mixed matrix of pasture and urban settlements may be important habitat for both residents and migrants, and suggest that the protection and restoration of these habitats should be high management and conservation priorities.","WOS:000262542100014",49,0.825155414,0

In the southern area of the bay, 82,120 ha of mangrove forest are actively undergoing a management regime conducted by PT. Bintuni Utama Murni Wood Industries (PT. BUMWI). Operations are focused upon woodchip production; however, sustainable forest management is also a priority as the area is Forest Stewardship Council (R) (FSC (R)) certified. Currently, PT BUMWI is approaching the completion of a 25-year rotation (with stands ranging from 0 to 25 years) which presents a good time to examine and evaluate current management practices and their effects on the forest concession. Part of a successful regeneration of a forest stand is attaining the range of ecological integrity and ecosystem functions similar to baseline forests. Forest structure and complexity, along with biodiversity at the stand level could function as regeneration criteria to evaluate the success of a sustainable forest management program. The objective of the study was to observe if the forest structure and biodiversity in secondary stands, considered as proxies for ecological integrity, would regenerate to similar levels within the 25 years as baseline forests. Post-harvest forest regeneration was evaluated in different aged secondary forest stands by measuring biomass, species composition and forest structure in circular plots along transects. Nonlinear regression was used to determine and predict different forest structure dynamics (sapling and stem densities, tree height, DBH), diversity and volumes throughout and beyond the 25-year rotation period. Dynamics in species composition and diversity of tree species was observed. Results suggest that the forest structure in secondary stands follows a natural regeneration dynamic over the rotation period but had not yet attained the same structure and composition as baseline forests at 25 years. Furthermore, growth models suggest that the harvest rotation may need to be extended to 30-40 years for secondary stands to attain similar ranges of forest structure, compositions and volumes to that of baseline forests. These observations will help future forest management of the concession as the company strives to manage secondary forests to keep the same ecosystem functions and high volumes observed in baseline forests.

Thirty-two study sites, >2000 ha each, were surveyed throughout the country, including all major vegetation types from 1981 to 2003 during >5472 hr of effective daylight raptor searches. Census techniques took into account the behavior and detectability of every species to assess their abundance and habitat associations. The French Guiana raptor community included 27 forest species, five species restricted to forest edges and large gaps, five species of wetlands and mangroves, eight coastal grassland specialists, four nearctic migrants, and seven occasional taxa of unconfirmed status. In the 19 undisturbed primary forest sites, the most common raptor was the Lined Forest-Falcon (Micrastur gilvicollis). Many species were rare or patchily distributed: 15% of all species were found in only 5-11% of the 32 localities sampled and <30% were present in almost all of them. The abundance index was correlated with site occupancy frequency. There was no significant difference in species richness among parts of the country.

These variations provide a platform to explore species diversity, distribution, abundance, microhabitat, and other ecological parameters to understand the distribution patterns and to facilitate conservation and management of sensitive or important species and areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity and distribution of anuran species in different types of habitat on Langkawi Island. Specimens were collected based on active sampling using the Visual Encounter Survey (VES) method. We surveyed anuran species inhabiting seven types of habitat, namely agriculture (AG), coastal (CL), forest (FT), pond (PD), mangrove (MG), riparian forest (RF) and river (RV). A total of 775 individuals were sampled from all localities, representing 23 species from 12 genera and included all six families of frogs in Malaysia. FT and RF showed high values of Shannon Index, H', 2.60 and 2.38, respectively, followed by the other types of habitat, CL (1.82), RV (1.71), MG (1.56), PD (1.54), and AG (1.53). AG had the highest abundance (156 individuals) compared to other habitat types. Based on Cluster Analysis by using Jaccard coefficient (UPGMA), two groups can be clearly seen and assigned as forested species group (FT and RF) and species associating with human activity (AG, CL, PD, MG and RV).

We determined, through surveys in 29 sites, how birds with different dietary and nesting requirements responded in terms of guild richness and abundance to various facets of urbanisation in Singapore. The sites selected were representative of the full range of urbanisation outside of the undisturbed native forests. Among the dietary guilds, we found that insectivores and carnivores were adversely affected by increased urbanisation. Frugivores were favoured by low-density housing, probably because more fruit-bearing ornamental plants were planted in such estates. Richness and abundance of shrub and shrub/tree nesters, and primary cavity excavators declined with increased urbanisation. We believe that the availability of nesting sites was an important factor in their decline. Exotic species accounted for only 13% of the total species richness detected in our surveys but they were numerically dominant (accounting for 61 % of overall bird abundance). Abundance of native resident birds declined monotonically with increasing amount of built-up environment while birds of exotic species appeared to be more abundant in sites with intermediate amount of built-up environment. While urban greenery serves architectural and other functions, it has little effect on overall bird community assembly. The preponderance of exotic species in Singapore city suggests that birds of tropical rainforests are poor colonisers of this relatively novel environment. Many of the native urban species originated from mangrove and coastal scrub forests, so the maintenance of rainforests is necessary for the preservation of many native bird species.

For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km(2) each, had woody floras of 89 +/- 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources ( 92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley. It merits the highest priorities for preservation, as a refuge for Western Ghat species at the northern limits of their distributions.","WOS:000181689600011",113,0.878499147,1

After a history of commercial exploitation the mangroves along the Klong Ngao tidal creek have been assigned conservation status within a new Ranong Biosphere Reserve established in 1997. Over the past 12 years, several areas of mangrove destroyed or degraded by wood harvesting, tin mining and aquaculture, have been rehabilitated on a pilot basis by planting monocultures of mangrove seedlings using four common local species (Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Bruguiera cyclindrica and Ceriops tagal). These plantation forests with different past management histories were compared with a natural, mixed, mature mangrove forest which has been conserved for about 40 years. Macrofauna were sampled within a 100 m(2) vegetation quadrat in each study site. Crustaceans were sampled quantitatively by 3 x 15 min timed hand catches per site. Molluscs were sampled in 3 x m(2) quadrats positioned around three randomly selected trees in each vegetation quadrat. The lowest crustacean and molluscan diversity was recorded from the former tin mining site. The highest diversity was recorded from a Rhizophora plantation in the natural mixed forest area for both crustaceans and molluscs. The vegetation community structure was not correlated with the environmental variables measured, or with macrofauna community structure. Of the environmental parameters chosen, the crustacean community structure was best expressed by shore level, while for molluscan diversity and abundance it was soil moisture content. The macrofauna community structure at the tin mining site was significantly different to the other sites, and was dominated by a single species of crab, Metaplax elegans. Grapsid crabs, especially sesarmid species, dominated over ocypodid crabs in the mature forest site, whereas Uca species and other ocypodids were more abundant than grapsids in the degraded concession forest area. Snails of the families Neritidae and Ellobiidae were the most abundant molluscs in the mature forest, whereas Littoriinidae, Assimineidae and Potamidae species were more representative of the younger plantation sites. The findings from this study suggest that some of these well represented families of mangrove macrofauna could be used as indicators of ecological change as part of a long term environmental monitoring programme in Ranong and other areas in Southeast Asia where mangroves are being rehabilitated.

The stocking was quite variable across the forest types. 60.04% of forested area was under medium to high canopy density. Secondary and degraded forest types were mapped. Information on floristic composition, structure and diversity of various forest types were obtained from 84 field sample plots. An inventory of 423 species of plants from 101 families included 155 trees, 84 shrubs, 150 herbs and 84 climbers. Tree density and mean basal area ranged from 517 to 900 stems ha(-1) and 36.15 to 53.58 m(2) ha(-1) respectively. Evergreen forests accounted for highest diversity followed almost equally by semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests.","WOS:000288426800015",161,0.833277692,0
"214","mang","Mangrove fish: a comparison of community structure between forested and cleared habitats","The fish communities of mangrove and cleared sites were investigated in Gazi Bay, Kenya. Five forested sites were compared with paired sites that had been cleared of mangroves by human activity. Forested sites included plantations and natural stands of Sonneratia alba and natural Rhizophora mucronata stands. Two methods of stake netting were used to take quantitative samples; method one used a single 100-m-long, 18-mm mesh net, method two used paired 24-m-long, 1-mm mesh nets-samples were taken during seven different months in 2002. Mean abundances of fish found in mangrove and cleared sites, respectively, were 0.004 m(-2) and 0.014 m(-2) (method 1) and 0.21 m(-2) and 0.25 m(-2) (method 2). Thirty species were sampled, 12 of which were found exclusively in mangrove habitats and 10 of which were limited to cleared sites. The most abundant species in mangrove plots was Atherina afra (although it was only found in two, large catches); the most abundant in cleared plots was Gerres oyena (found frequently). Mean abundance (using data pooled for all sites) was significantly higher in cleared, compared with forested, sites, and multivariate analysis showed significantly different community structures in the two habitat types. There was large variation in catch rates between dates and sites, with one forested site recording no catches at all. These results do not support the predator refuge hypothesis (which predicts higher abundance of juvenile fish inside mangroves). The low abundance of fish recorded in the mangrove sites may have been due to site-specific factors determining fish abundance within mangrove forests, to the sampling techniques used or to relatively high turbidities at these sites.

To detect tree community changes related to natural edges, we investigated a terrestrial forest island, bordered by grassland and mangrove landscapes, on the Brazilian Amazon coast. Forest structure and tree species composition were examined in 10-m-wide and 100-m-long plots from the forest edge to the interior in relation to both landscapes (8 grassland and 4 mangrove plots). Elevation and soil quality did not reveal strong spatial variability; tidal inundation established a boundary for forest expansion without influencing the forest interior. The tree community consisted of 82 species. No distinct changes in vegetation structure and composition with distance from the border were detected. Ordination procedures gave weak indications for shifts in community composition with distance from the edge and in respect to edge type. Single species occurred more frequently either close to or more distant from the grassland-forest interface. No such tendencies were detected at the mangrove-terrestrial forest interface, probably because the lack of structural differences between terrestrial forest and mangrove canopies did not permit the establishment of edge-related microclimatic gradients. Due to the isolation of the forest island and the harsh coastal environment, the tree community was dominated by generalist species which are well adapted to the conditions at the grassland-forest edge. Furthermore, the patchy distribution of frequent species and the high number of rare species made it difficult to detect spatial patterns related to the forest edge.","WOS:000344810900009",267,0.880079352,0

The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area: rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks. We suggest that the application of NDVI for assessments can be useful for future planning, monitoring and management of the BKP and hence may contribute for increasing biodiversity and complexity of these urban forests.","WOS:000424115000035",274,0.868559537,1

Data on resident forest birds were collected during ten-minute sampling periods at points along altitudinal gradients, in primary and modified forests and in rainforests on different geology. While all species ever reported from Halmahera have been recorded down to near sea level, many of the forest birds of Buru, including a number of restricted-range and endemic species, are largely confined to montane forest, and only common above 800-900 m altitude. The existence of a distinct montane bird community on Buru, but not on Halmahera, is attributed to the relatively large, continuous area of forest at high altitude on this island. Forest on Halmahera at such altitudes is limited and fragmented. While most species survive in modified forests, some were significantly rarer in this habitat and may depend on adjacent areas of primary forest. Mangroves supported impoverished forest bird communities, typically of more adaptable species. On Halmahera, rainforest on ultrabasic rock appears to be impoverished when compared with rainforest on other rock formations, in particular supporting very low numbers of two species of threatened parrot. Implications for conservation concern lowland forests on Halmahera. Despite the surveys, a number of species of conservation concern that occur on Halmahera and Buru still remain largely unknown.","WOS:000089667700003",421,0.89054108,1
"459","mang","Mangrove plantation over a limestone reef - Good for the ecology?","There have been efforts to restore degraded tropical and subtropical mangrove forests. While there have been many failures, there have been some successes but these were seldom evaluated to test to what level the created mangrove wetlands reproduce the characteristics of the natural ecosystem and thus what ecosystem services they can deliver. We provide such a detailed assessment for the case of Olango and Banacon Islands in the Philippines where the forest was created over a limestone reef where mangroves did not exist in one island but they covered most of the other island before deforestation in the 1940s and 1950s. The created forest appears to have reached a steady state after 60 years. As is typical of mangrove rehabilitation efforts worldwide, planting was limited to a single Rhizophora species. While a forest has been created, it does not mimic a natural forest. There is a large difference between the natural and planted forests in terms of forest structure and species diversity, and tree density. The high density of planted trees excludes importing other species from nearby natural forests; therefore the planted forest remains mono-specific even after several decades and shows no sign of mimicking the characteristics of a natural forest. The planted forests provided mangrove propagules that invaded nearby natural forests. The planted forest has also changed the substratum from sandy to muddy. The outline of the crown of the planted forest has become smooth and horizontal, contrary to that of a natural forest, and this changes the local landscape. Thus we recommend that future mangrove restoration schemes should modify their methodology in order to plant several species, maintain sufficient space between trees for growth, include the naturally dominant species, and create tidal creeks, in order to reproduce in the rehabilitated areas some of the key ecosystem characteristics of natural mangrove forests.

Location The metropolitan area of Barcelona, north-eastern Spain. Methods Twenty sampling sites were distributed in two forest size-categories: small forest patches (8-90 ha) and large forest areas (> 18,000 ha). For each forest-size category, five sites were placed adjacent to crops and five sites adjacent to urban areas. Vascular plant species were recorded and human frequentation was scored visually in 210 10 x 10 m plots placed at 10, 50 and 100 m from the forest edge, and additionally at 500 m in large forest areas. Plant species were grouped according to their ecology and rarity categories. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was carried out to detect patterns of variation in species assemblage, and to explore the relationships between these patterns and the richness of the species groups and the studied factors. Factorial ANOVAS were used to test the significance of the studied factors on the richness of species groups. Relationships between human frequentation and the studied variables were assessed through contingency tables. Results Forest-size category was the main factor affecting synanthropic species (i.e. those thriving in man-made or man-disturbed habitats). Synanthropic species richness decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge and, when forests were adjacent to crops, it was higher in small forest patches than in large forest areas. Richness of rare forest species was lower in small forest patches than in large forest areas when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Richness of common forest species and of all forest species together were higher close to the forest edge than far from it when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Forests adjacent to urban areas were more likely to experience high human frequentation, particularly in those plots nearest to the forest edge. Main conclusions Forest-size category and adjacent land use were the most important factors determining species richness and composition. The preservation of large forests adjacent to crops in peri-urban areas is recommended, because they are less frequented by humans, are better buffered against the percolation of nonforest species and could favour the persistence of rare forest species.","WOS:000234412300006",340,0.955944502,1
"28","medit","Breeding bird species diversity in the Negev: effects of scrub fragmentation by planted forests","1. Afforestation of the Northern Negev, Israel, from 1956 resulted in patches of primarily coniferous trees that fragmented large scrubland areas. This alteration in landscape pattern was followed by immigration of mediterranean bird species to the Negev. 2. We counted breeding birds, and measured various environmental variables in scrubland and planted forest patches, to test whether bird assemblages were random subsets of the regional species pool, and whether area or habitat structure was the major correlate with species abundance and distribution. 3. Of 22 bird species recorded, only three appeared in both scrub and forest, showing that these two habitats were occupied by different species assemblages. In both habitats, species richness increased with area at a rate greater than that expected by random sampling. In the scrub this increase was related to area per se, while in the forest it was related to habitat diversity in terms of stand age and tree type. 4. The density of forest species was unaffected by area, but specialist scrubland species declined as area decreased. We suggest that edge effects might reduce species abundance in small scrubland patches. 5. Nested subset analysis indicated that, at the community level, species composition was not random. However, at the species level, the distribution of three forest-dwelling species appeared as random, as it was associated with habitat rather than with patch size. 6. Our results indicate that increased diversity of breeding birds in the Northern Negev will require scrub patches larger than 50 ha among the increasingly forested landscape. In contrast, increasing forest area would hardly increase species diversity in the whole landscape. Future forest management regimes should also aim to increase habitat diversity by adding foliage layers, especially in the understorey. Exotic coniferous forests support fewer species than deciduous forests in mediterranean zones around the world. The suggested management regime may improve such forests as habitat for species-rich bird communities.","WOS:000171692900021",53,0.94881238,1

Location: NE Spain. Methods: Bird presence data were obtained from the Atlas of Spanish Breeding Birds and forest landscape variables were extracted from the Spanish Forest Map developed within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. The analyses were carried out through multiple linear regressions and considering multicollinearity and spatial autocorrelation problems. Results: Forest landscape characteristics influenced more on specialist than on generalist bird species richness, explaining 62% and 52% of total variation, respectively. Forest area was the most important landscape factor, although bird species richness was also considerably favoured by trees species diversity and by the abundance of coniferous forest. Forests with too closed canopy cover (equal or bigger than 80 %) supported less bird species. The effects of forest landscape configuration were weak compared to composition; the only significant configuration index was the mean circumscribing circle index, as a potential indicator of the naturalness of forest landscapes. Conclusions: Forest landscape management should focus on forest habitat availability and forest structure features rather than on a particular forest landscape configuration, promoting an amalgam of forest tree species and avoiding an excessively closed canopy. However, and especially for generalists, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of other non-forest land cover types for an adequate management and conservation of forest bird communities.","WOS:000260441400003",146,0.944993018,0

However, there is still a lack of knowledge on which forest characteristics have a greater influence on biological diversity, particularly in Mediterranean forests. To provide further insights in this respect, we analyzed how different characteristics related to forest composition and structure (forest area, canopy cover, canopy cover diversity, development stage, development stage diversity, coniferous species percentage, tree species diversity, and mono-specific forest percentage) influence the richness of forest breeding bird species (considering 22 specialist and 31 generalist species) in a large dataset comprising 2923 UTM I km x I km cells in Catalonia (NE Spain). Bird species richness was estimated through presence/absence data obtained from surveys conducted within the framework of the Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1999-2002). Forest characteristics were obtained from the Spanish Forest Map (scale 1:50,000), which was developed within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. Best regression models for forest specialists accounted for up to 53% of the variability in species richness, while models for generalist and total species richness accounted for 34% and 49% of total variability, respectively. Species richness was favoured by more developed forest stages and by tree species diversity, but very dense, closed forest canopies (> 70%) decreased species richness for both groups. For specialist species richness the percentage of coniferous forest cover had a slightly negative influence, while generalists were favoured by more diverse canopy closure. We discuss the implications of these results for Mediterranean forest management considering the current situation of Catalan forests. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Defining which habitats favor rich biodiversity is of increasing importance. Beetle and bird diversity was monitored in seven different habitats (cereals, corn, fallow, Robinia pseudoacacia plantations, grassland, cultivation-oak forest ecotone, and oak forest) in central Greece aiming at (a) quantifying the alpha and beta diversity using biotic indicators, (b) evaluating species richness, (c) identifying the most important habitats for beetle and bird species assemblages, and (d) examining species generalism or specialism in habitat use. To assess the impact of habitat type on biodiversity we estimated the abundance (A), species richness (S), the Shannon diversity index (H'), the Simpson dominance index (D), and the Shannon evenness index (E'). During the sampling period a total of 21,647 individuals of ground-dwelling beetles were captured in pitfall traps, classified into 63 species, while 21 bird species were recorded as breeders. The maximum beetle abundance and diversity was observed in grassland, fallow, and cereals. The highest breeding bird density and diversity were recorded in ecotone and oak forest, with the lowest ones in fallow. Cluster analysis demonstrated that the species assemblages were classified into two categories, open agricultural and closed wooded, while following the ""IndVal"" analysis a set of three species were identified as characteristic species of a specific habitat type. Our findings indicated that agro-ecosystems can enhance the faunal diversity of mountainous landscapes, while specific habitat types can significantly influence the species composition.","WOS:000313111500001",109,0.923543822,1

To date no study has been conducted to evaluate the impact of forest management on saproxylic beetle assemblages, although it is known that the Mediterranean is a biodiversity hotspot with a long-lasting human pressure on natural habitats. We provide an overview of saproxylic beetle assemblages of three forest types (mature Pinus halepensis forests, mature Pinus brutia forests, young Quercus calliprinos forests) in the East Mediterranean region using a one-year sample from 12 forest plots located in the north of Israel. The studied forest types differed in forest structure, but we found no significant difference in saproxylic beetle species richness. Aleppo pine forests showed the largest number of saproxylic beetle species. Forests dominated by P. brutia, a non-native tree species in Israel, show the lowest species number of all three forest types. Species composition differs substantially between oak and pine forests. A third of the species found either in P. halepensis or in Q. calliprinos forests being unique to these habitats, while a smaller proportion of unique beetle species is found in P. brutia forests. Several beetle species that were found both in oak and pine plots in our study develop exclusively on broadleaved shrubs or trees. This may be explained by the small distances between the studied pine trees and oaks in their proximity. Biodiversity in pine forests can be increased when these are mixed with broad-leaved trees, e.g. oaks in the understorey layer, as can be observed the natural regrowth in most of the planted pine stands in our research area. There is some evidence from other studies that older successional stages of oak forests are likely to host more species overall than the mature pine forests studied here. In order to enhance structural diversity foresters should allow for aging of single trees or stands, regardless of the tree species. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"83","medit","Bird assemblages in forest fragments within Mediterranean mosaics created by wild fires","The role of habitat heterogeneity as a key factor in determining species pools in habitat mosaics has been acknowledged, but we still know little on the relative importance of the different ecological processes acting within such complex landscapes. We compared species richness and distribution in forest fragments imbedded in shrub-lands to those in continuous forests or in continuous shrublands. We examined the consistency of our data with the predictions of two hypotheses: 1) the Habitat fragmentation hypothesis which states that fragmentation has negative effects on the species from the original continuous habitat; 2) the Habitat supplementation /complementation hypothesis which stipulates that the presence of a matrix habitat around the fragments will mitigate negative effects on the species from the original habitat (supplementation) or allow the presence of species that depend on the presence of both the fragment and matrix habitats (complementation). We show that: 1) species richness in forest fragments did not differ from species richness in segments of continuous forests of equal area; 2) the bird community of forest fragments got impoverished in some forest species but a higher proportion of species common in continuous forests were not affected by fragmentation; 3) fragment communities had a significant proportion of common species that were scarce in, or absent from both continuous forests and shrublands. While, a few forest species supported predictions from the fragmentation hypothesis, occurrence patterns observed in several other species were consistent with either the supplementation or the complementation hypotheses. Our results suggest that there is no single hypothesis that properly captures the consequences of a shift from continuous forests to a mosaic of forest fragments and shrublands and that different ecological mechanisms act in conjunction to determine species pools in habitat mosaics. Habitat heterogeneity at a local scale appears a key factor in maintaining bird diversity in fire driven Mediterranean landscapes.","WOS:000224100600008",186,0.913698562,1

Using the existing forest-management system, and two levels of ICP Forests monitoring as sources of data on the size of habitat, tree composition, developmental phase and stand regeneration, growing stock and increment, dead wood, and level of naturalness of habitat, an attempt of evaluation of the conservation status of the forest habitat types of EU community interest (Habitat Directive 1992, Natura 2000) is presented. In total, the Natura 2000 forest habitat types in Slovenia represent almost one third of all forest area, and the prevailing forest habitat types are Illyrian Fagus sylvatica forests, Luzulo-Fagetum beech forests and Illyrian oak-horn-beam forests. Considering the direct influences of human activities and potential effects of climate change the floodplain and lowland forests of Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior, Riparian mixed forests of Quercus robur and other broadleaves, as well as Illyrian oak-hornbeam forest, are among the most threatened forest habitat types. Taking into account the small area of habitat type and the set of different threats, the priority habitat types of Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines, (Sub-) Mediterranean pine forests and Bog woodland are also endangered. Despite the large number of factors threatening the Slovenian forests, the high level of studied parameters indicates the favourable conservation status of forest habitat types.

Knowing how forest plant communities recovered after the abandonment of forest- management or agricultural practices (including livestock grazing) provides a basis for investigating how previous land management have affected plant species diversity and composition in forest ecosystems. Our study investigated the consequences of historical ""land management"" practices on present-day Mediterranean forests by comparing species assemblages and the diversity of (i) all plant species and (ii) each ecological group defined by species' habitat preferences and successional status (i.e., early-, mid-, and late-successional species). We compared forest stands that differed both in land-use history and in successional stage. In addition, we evaluated the value of those stands for biodiversity conservation. The study revealed significant compositional differentiation among stands that was due to among-stand variations in the diversity (namely, species richness and evenness) of early-, intermediate-, and late-successional species. Historical land management has led to an increase in compositional divergences among forest stands and the loss of late- successional forest species.","WOS:000361797500134",49,0.911413631,1

We analysed the spatial patterns of dung beetle species diversity in three differently structured natural landscapes in a Mediterranean protected area in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. Cabaneros National Park, Central Spain. Diversity components within (alpha) and among (beta) the three main vegetation types in the reserve were compared by using a hierarchical nested design. These were forests, scrublands and grasslands embedded in three different landscapes, where each was the most dominant and structurally connected habitat. Species richness of grassland habitat did not vary across landscapes, but forest habitat showed lower species richness in the grassland-dominated landscape. Scrubland was the least species-rich habitat, but here again there was no significant variation across landscapes. However, in all cases, there was a significant influence of habitat context (configuration of habitat patches within landscape matrix) on similarity of species composition. These tended to be more similar to the dominant landscape matrix where they were embedded, rather than to the same habitat type in other landscapes. Additive partitioning of diversity showed higher than expected values of beta in all landscapes, which indicated a structured response. Highest values of beta in the grassland-dominated landscape suggest that this was the least connected landscape for dung beetles. Our results suggest that in homogeneous conditions of climate and trophic resources, landscape structure may well be more important than habitat type as a determinant of dung beetle distribution in the Mediterranean.","WOS:000265070400013",137,0.909823079,0

Beetles were collected using 2,646 pitfall traps across an area of 138 ha representative of the Mediterranean mountainous landscape. Sampling was performed in cereal fields, corn fields, fallow land, grassland, Robinia pseudoacacia plantations, oak forest - farmland ecotone and oak forest using pitfall traps. A total of 18,275 individuals belonging to 38 species were collected, whereas only seven species constituted the 82.64% of the overall captures. Onthophagus ovatus was the most common species in all habitats. Beetle assemblages varied markedly regarding the number of species, while higher densities were reported during June. Significant differences in beetle richness were found considering habitat preferences with the lowest species richness in corn fields. Carabidae assemblages were both most abundant and diverse in plantations, whereas Scarabaeidae assemblages were most abundant and diverse in fallow land. Among estimated diversity indices, Margalef's index generated similar results with the observed diversity, likewise non parametric estimators. Overall, the results obtained in the present study suggest that agricultural areas in mountainous heterogeneous landscape might be the important factor for conserving rich beetle diversity, whereas supplementary biotic factors should be explored.","WOS:000342047200006",175,0.909507823,1
"133","medit","Effects of forest fragmentation on European birds: implications of regional differences in species richness","Aim In this paper, we adopted a large-scale approach to evaluate the effect of regional richness of forest birds on the number of bird species retained by forest fragments in several localities across Europe. Location We studied bird assemblages in fourteen forest archipelagos embedded in agricultural matrices from southern Norway to central Spain. Tree composition varied from oak and beech forests of the northern localities to oak and pine xerophitic woodlands of the southern ones. The number of fragments in each forest archipelago ranged from eighteen to 211. Methods We used the Gleason equation (s = a + z log A; where s and A are, respectively, the species richness and size of forest fragments and z the rate of species loss) to estimate the species richness for 1- and 15-ha fragments in each archipelago. The regional richness of forest birds was estimated by modelling the geographical distribution of species richness in the European atlas of breeding birds. Results The latitudinal distribution of regional richness displayed a convex form, with the highest values being in central Europe. Along this gradient, the number of species retained by fragments and the rate of species loss was positively related to regional richness. In addition, the percentage of the regional pool of species sampled by fragments decreased in the southern localities. Main conclusions Relationships between regional richness of forest birds and richness in fragments seem to explain why fragments in central Europe shelter more species than their southern counterparts. The decreased ability of southern forest fragments to sample the regional richness of forest birds, could be explained as an effect of the low abundance of many species in the Mediterranean, which could depress their ability to prevent extinction in fragments by a rescue effect. Alternatively, high beta diversity in the Mediterranean could produce undersampling by fragments of the regional pool of species. These regional differences in the response of bird assemblages to forest fragmentation are used to discuss the usefulness of large-scale, biogeographical approaches in the design of conservation guidelines.","WOS:000182456800012",22,0.906663342,1

The presence of all understory vascular plants was recorded on 252 plots of 100 m(2) randomly selected within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 ha to 218 ha. Species were divided into 6 groups, according to their ecology and conservation status. Site condition was assessed at plot level and included physical attributes, human-induced disturbance and Quercus spp. tree cover. Landscape structure and dynamics were assessed from patch metrics and patch history. We also calculated a set of landscape metrics related to potential human accessibility to forests. Results of multiple linear regressions indicated that the variance explained for non-forest species groups was higher than for forest species richness. Most of the main correlates corresponded to site disturbance variables related to direct human alteration, or to landscape variables associated to indirect human effects on forests: Quercus tree cover (a proxy for successional status) was the most important correlate of non-forest species richness, which decreased when Quercus tree cover increased. Human-induced disturbance was an important correlate of synanthropic and total species richness, which were higher in recently managed and in highly frequented forests. Potential human accessibility also affected the richness of most species groups. In contrast, patch size, patch shape and connectivity played a minor role, as did patch history. We conclude that human influence on species richness in periurban forests takes place on a small scale, whereas large-scale effects attributable to landscape structure and fragmentation are comparatively less important. Implications of these results for the conservation of plant species in periurban forests are discussed.","WOS:000243619800011",284,0.90647791,1

Postfire salvage logging is the most commonly applied forestry practice in burned forests world-wide, mainly for economic reasons. However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes. Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. 2. We surveyed breeding birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird community during the first three springs after fire. 3. Most bird species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to the third. 4. Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species, although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. 5. Synthesis and applications. In the Mediterranean Basin, some postfire salvage logging of pine forests can be compatible with bird conservation. We recommend that managers retain some standing dead trees during logging operations and that logged forest is interspersed with unlogged stands. This will provide suitable habitat for the widest range of species.","WOS:000304660500014",489,0.898316605,0
"164","medit","Forest bird diversity in Mediterranean areas affected by wildfires: a multi-scale approach","Fire is a key mechanism creating and maintaining habitat heterogeneity in Mediterranean landscapes by turning continuous woody landscapes into mosaics of forests and shrublands. Due to the long historical role of fires in the Mediterranean, we hypothesised a moderate negative effect of this type of perturbation on forest bird distribution at a landscape level. We conducted point bird censuses in Aleppo pine forest patches surrounded by burnt shrublands and studied the relationships between three ecological groups of bird species (forest canopy species, forest understorey species, and ubiquitous species) and the features of local habitat, whole patch and surrounding landscape. We used a multi-scale approach to assess the effects of landscape variables at increasing spatial scales on point bird richness. Regarding local habitat components, canopy species were positively associated with tall pines while understorey species with the cover of shrubs and plants from holm-oak forests. Forest birds were positively related to patch size and irregular forest shapes, that is, with high perimeter/size ratios. Thus, these species did not seem to perceive edges as low quality but rather favourable microhabitats. We did not detect any negative effect of isolation or cover of woodlands in the landscape on the presence of forest species after local habitat factors had been accounted for. Finally, only local habitat factors entered the model for ubiquitous species. We suggest that mosaic-like landscapes shaped by fires in the Mediterranean basin are not strongly associated with negative effects fragmentation on forest birds other than those related with habitat loss.","WOS:000174928500004",234,0.897832361,0

The three reforested areas had been previously used for agricultural purposes. Samples were collected monthly by pitfall traps for a period of 1 year (March 2009-February 2010). Structural parameters and the arthropod assemblage compositions of the four studied areas were compared. The effects of the different forest types and the influence of environmental variables on the activity density of each species were analyzed, with particular emphasis to forest species. Contrary to centipedes and ground beetles, woodlice showed lower values of richness, diversity and equitability in reforestations than in the natural forest. According to Canonical Correspondence Analysis, forest species of woodlice and centipedes resulted mainly associated with forests characterized by a high structural heterogeneity (natural forest and reforestation with Q. pubescens). In these two forests the activity density of centipede forest species is mainly influenced by the coverage of both shrub and leaf litter layer, and woodlice forest species only by the coverage of the latter. The ground beetle forest species were mainly associated with forests characterized by low structural heterogeneity and an almost total closure of the canopy throughout the year (reforestation with Q. ilex). However, some ground beetle forest species are present also in the natural forest. Our results suggest that reforestations with different native broadleaf species belonging to the local ""potential"" vegetation can contribute to the conservation of the diversity of forest arthropod assemblages in the extremely fragmented agricultural landscape of the middle Tyrrhenian area.

I studied the spatial and temporal distribution of forest passerines in wooded parks in the city of Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons to identify factors relevant to local conservation, and compared these results to previous studies in rural-fragmented forests in central Spain to derive recommendations for local and regional management guidelines. Five independent factors were considered: park size, isolation, density of potential corridors, vegetation structure, and pedestrian rate as an indicator of human disturbance within parks. Species richness and species temporal persistence was positively influenced by park size, shrub and tree cover, number of shrub and tree species, number of thick tree trunks, and negatively by the number of thin tree trunks. Species turnover was negatively affected by park size, such that the temporal persistence of species was enhanced in large parks. The pattern of guild assembly was not random but nested (parks with few species were subsets of progressively richer parks); the accumulation of species being affected mainly by park size and human disturbance, and to a lesser degree by isolation and vegetation structure. With regard to the spatial distribution of individual species, park size and vegetation structure positively influenced five species each, whereas isolation and human disturbance negatively influenced two and one species, respectively. Fragment size and habitat structure were the most relevant factors affecting species richness of forest specialists in both rural and urban fragmented landscapes; therefore, regional conservation strategies to protect these species may also be applicable to urbanized areas in central Spain. However, some specific recommendations should be considered in urban and suburban landscapes: (1) habitat quality ought to be enhanced to meet specific habitat requirements, particularly in large parks; (2) the mechanisms and rates of dispersal of forest birds through the urban matrix should be further studied to improve the movements between regional and local populations; and (3) species-specific variations in tolerance to pedestrians and thresholds levels of human visitation within parks should be determined to minimize human disturbance effects.

"195","medit","Influence of secondary forest succession on plant diversity patterns in a Mediterranean landscape","AimAs a consequence of multiple cycles of deforestation and reforestation, most forest landscapes in Europe consist of a complex mosaic of patches of different successional ages. Despite the biogeographical distinctiveness of the Mediterranean region, studies on the effects of forest age on plant species diversity and composition are almost lacking for this area. This paper evaluates the influence of forest successional age on plant species richness and composition in various forest types of Mediterranean Italy. LocationThe Natura 2000 network of Siena Province, Tuscany, Italy. MethodsOccurrence data on vascular plant species in 208 forest plots were obtained from a larger data set sampled with a stratified random design. The forest successional age of each plot was quantified through a series of historical maps. Species richness and composition were related to the age of the forest by means of GIS techniques and univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. ResultsTotal species richness markedly decreased with increasing successional age due to a significant decrease in the richness of open-habitat species which was not matched by increasing richness of mature forest species. Successional age was the key factor in controlling species richness, while local environmental properties emerged as the main factors shaping community composition. The different forest types showed different temporal trends of species richness and composition and different hierarchies of explanatory factors. Main conclusionsForest successional age emerged as an important factor affecting both species richness and composition, even within the same forest type. Thus, the classification and prioritization of Mediterranean forests exclusively based on present physiognomy or environmental variables causes loss of information about species richness and composition; this could be detrimental for biodiversity conservation.","WOS:000330102600012",81,0.892722282,1
"48","medit","Can native plant species be preserved in an anthro-pogenic forest landscape dominated by aliens? A case study from Mediterranean Chile","Plantations with fast growing exotic tree species can negatively affect native plant species diversity and promote the spread of alien species. Mediterranean Chile experienced major landscape changes with a vast expansion of industrial plantations of Pinus radiata in the past. However, with increasing knowledge of biodiversity effects on ecosystem services Chilean forest owners now aim to integrate the conservation of native biodiversity into forest management, but data on native species diversity and establishment within a plantation landscape is scarce. Here we investigated plant species diversity and composition in four forest management options applied within a landscape dominated by P. radiata plantations in comparison to an unmanaged reference: (i) a clear cut, (ii) a strip cut, (iii) a native canopy of Nothofagus glauca and (iv) a young P. radiata plantation. We wanted to assess if native plant species can be maintained either by natural regeneration or by planting of native tree species (Nothofagus glauca, N. obliqua, Quillaja saponaria) within this landscape. Results show a high diversity of native and forest plant species within the different management options indicating a high potential for native biodiversity restoration within an anthropogenic landscape. In particular, herbaceous species can benefit from management. They are rare in unmanaged natural forests that are characterized by low light conditions and a thick litter layer. Management, however, also promoted a diversity of alien species. The rapid spread of alien grass species after management can deter an initial establishment of native tree species or the survival and growth after planting mainly under dry but less under sufficient moisture conditions. The most unsuccessful option for promoting native plant species was clear cutting in a dry area where alien grasses were abundant. For drought-tolerant tree species such as Quillaja saponaria, though, even a joint establishment with Pinus radiata seems possible.","WOS:000381649500006",4,0.859796566,1
"56","medit","Post-fire salvage logging alters species composition and reduces cover, richness, and diversity in Mediterranean plant communities","An intense debate exists on the effects of post-fire salvage logging on plant community regeneration, but scant data are available derived from experimental studies. We analyzed the effects of salvage logging on plant community regeneration in terms of species richness, diversity, cover, and composition by experimentally managing a burnt forest on a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, S Spain). In each of three plots located at different elevations, three replicates of three treatments were implemented seven months after the fire, differing in the degree of intervention: ""Non-Intervention"" (all trees left standing), ""Partial Cut plus Lopping"" (felling 90% of the trees, cutting the main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ), and ""Salvage Logging"" (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody debris). Plant composition in each treatment was monitored two years after the fire in linear point transects. Post-fire salvage logging was associated with reduced species richness, Shannon diversity, and total plant cover. Moreover, salvaged sites hosted different species assemblages and 25% lower cover of seeder species (but equal cover of resprouters) compared to the other treatments. Cover of trees and shrubs was also lowest in Salvage Logging, which could suggest a potential slow-down of forest regeneration. Most of these results were consistent among the three plots despite plots hosting different plant communities. Concluding, our study suggests that salvage logging may reduce species richness and diversity, as well as the recruitment of woody species, which could delay the natural regeneration of the ecosystem.

The study was conducted within one large complex consisting of pine, mixed pine-hornbeam and typical old oak-linden-hornbeam forests in northern Poland. Epiphytic lichens were recorded in 50 study plots randomly selected within 5 forest stand classes of a different structure and age, ranging from 80 to over 220 years. Altogether 143 lichen species were recorded, of which only 41 were entirely nonspecific, and were occurring in all the studied forest stand classes. Significant differences in lichen species richness between stand classes were found and the number of species increases with the forest age. Lichen species composition also differs and its changes progress towards restoration of lichen biota typical for deciduous forest consistent with the habitat. The age of the forest has the most significant effect on the biodiversity of lichen biota. Microhabitat space provided by oaks is highly desirable since it greatly enriches lichen biota in forests. Phorophyte specificity of particular lichens were assessed. Hornbeam and oak have the greatest number of species mostly confined to them and constitute a main refuge for lichens with a high conservation value. The changes of lichen biota are basically parallel with the changes of the forest stand structure. The selection of some parts within managed pine forests that should not be assigned for cutting in the future can be a simple procedure which helps to restore and preserve forest biodiversity.","WOS:000380111500008",16,0.83341312,1

Forest types investigated were plantations on old fields (31-77 years old, n = 6), plantations on cutover land (19-64 years old, n = 8), young forests naturally regenerated after clear-cutting (27-66 years old, n = 6), and mature natural forests with no recent harvesting activity (80-100 years old, n = 6). Species were categorized by habitat preference (forest, intermediate, disturbed), growth form (12 categories), and life form (15 categories). Forest-habitat species dominated both natural stand types, whereas disturbed-habitat species dominated both plantation types. Mature natural stands contained higher frequency and cover of many herb growth forms, and cutover plantations contained higher values for shrubs. Old-field plantations contained low values for all growth forms. Two life forms, geophytes and rosette hemicryptophytes, were not well represented in either plantation type. All plant functional groups were present in each stand type, suggesting that differences among stand types occur as shifts in the relative abundances of functional groups. We hypothesize that some species may be at risk of local extirpation in plantations because of their limited growth rates and reproductive characteristics.","WOS:000231598900001",19,0.826024649,1

As an example, we selected a Pinus species devoted to the Mediterranean basin in order to validate the naturalness of the plantations. We found that natural Aleppo pine stands are more structurally complex with more developed and diverse understory compared to planted stands. Maintaining a large biodiversity is a major concern for reforestation programmes in the Mediterranean basin, which displays a large area of planted forests. We compared mature planted forests (over 50 years old) to nearby natural forests in relation to the structure, composition and diversity of the understory vegetation. An efficient comparison method should provide guidelines to improve the effectiveness of reforestation management programmes. We selected three pairs of nearby planted and natural Pinus halepensis Mill. stands in southeastern Spain along a precipitation gradient and compared stand overstory structure (density, basal area and canopy cover), and understory vegetation (plant cover, species richness and evenness index). Pine tree density was lower but basal area was higher in natural stands than in the nearby planted stands. Natural stands displayed also higher understory plant cover and species richness, but no difference was found regarding evenness. These differences were larger in the most mesic sites and were due to the density and arrangement of the pine tree cover. These results provide (i) valuable information for evaluating the success of reforestation programmes to recreate natural forest ecosystems and (ii) guidelines for silviculture and management.","WOS:000356794100013",12,0.805174291,1

Our experiment assessed the impact of five different site preparation treatments on the composition, diversity, ecological traits (life-form, pollination mode, leaf morphology, seed dispersal mode), indicator values (shade tolerance, nutrients demand) of the understory vegetation in a mature thinned Pinus halepensis stand in southern France. The treatments-chopping, chopping followed by scarification in one or two directions, prescribed burning, control-were replicated four times and applied on a total of 40 plots. Vegetation relev,s were performed on each plot in the first, second and fourth year following treatment applications. Plant diversity, measured by the species richness or Shannon's index, increased in the non-control treatment plots in the first year but then decreased through time. Vegetation composition differed between treatments, with the chopping treatment exhibiting composition and ecological trait values more comparable to those of control plots than the other treatments. The burning and scarification treatments led to higher abundance of therophytes, plants with malacophyllous leaves and insect-pollinated plants, and shade-intolerant and nutrient-demanding species. However, these changes were transient in time, the shade-intolerant species remained abundant but the ruderal species decreased while the ligneous species increased indicating a gradual return to a forest vegetation composition. For the Mediterranean area, most of the findings were similar to those in temperate forests subjected to the same site preparation treatments.","WOS:000288557700010",14,0.799258224,1

For example, many chestnut groves in France are now abandoned and have turned into 'natural' coppice stands while others are now dear-cut every 10 or 15 years for wood. Species composition and life form diversity of the plant communities have changed markedly both in the abandoned groves and in the periodically clear-cut coppice stands. What are the consequences of these changes on biodiversity at local and regional scales, and what are the implications for 'new Forestry' management intended to conserve biodiversity at the same time as it optimizes productivity and profitability? To answer these questions we studied plant species diversity in the understorey strata along a successional gradient including cultivated grove; abandoned grove: young (15 years old), medium (40 years), and old (>55 years) coppice stands. The results showed that species richness decreased quickly but not steadily along this gradient. but life-form spectra data highlighted that the high levels of plant species biodiversity in cultivated groves were due primarily to the large number of therophytes (annual plants). Ar a shorter time scale, we also studied the consequences of experimental clear-cutting on plans species biodiversity. Direct measurements over four years showed that species richness and diversity in the understorey increased in the first two years after clear-cutting, but decreased during the 3rd and 4th years. This decrease corresponded closely with a steady increase in Leaf Area Index of the forest canopy. These results have been used to suggest some possible ways to manage the biodiversity in these ecosystems.","WOS:000167731900004",2,0.746401012,1

We evaluated the impact of eucalypt plantations on native bats in a Mediterranean area, taking Portugal as a case study. We compared the overall bat activity, species richness and Kuhl's bat Pipistrellus kuhlii (the most abundant bat species in the area) activity between eucalypt plantations and native montado habitat, and examined the influence of stand, landscape and survey variables within plantations on the response variables. A set of 11 plantation stands, three landscape and two survey variables were employed as predictor variables using a zero-inflated Poisson generalized linear mixed model. Hawking and generalist bats of the genus Pipistrellus were the most frequently detected species. Bat activity, species richness and P.kuhlii activity were higher in native montado than in any of the eucalypt stands. Mature eucalypt plantations showed the highest bat activity, while clear-cut areas showed the lowest. Generally, within eucalypt stands, complex high-level vegetation structure, from the ground level up to 3m high, and proximity to water points were associated with higher levels of bat and P.kuhlii activity and species richness. The results suggest that in order to promote bat diversity and activity in exotic eucalypt plantations in the Mediterranean region, it is important to provide a high density of water points, maintain plots of mature plantations and promote understorey clutter.","WOS:000369174200007",10,0.746016861,1

We investigated the effects of three different harvest intensities on the short-term dynamics of understorey vegetation in a natural Maritime pine forest in Spain, and compared the results with uncut controls. Clear-cutting induced both qualitative and quantitative differences with respect to the controls, but intermediate levels of harvesting (25% and 50% removal) induced only quantitative differences. Harvesting reduced the frequency and cover of 56% of characteristic forest species, but only 22% showed an increase. Of the most abundant plant families only the Fabaceae showed a significant response with respect to harvesting intensity.

In a context of forest restoration, natural vegetation distribution patterns and plant community compositions need to be known and integrated in a framework for site classification. Accordingly, we sampled 153 plots at random along 20 transects perpendicular to the contour lines. In every plot we recorded biotic variables (plant species covers) to describe the vegetation composition; abiotic variables (encompassing landscape and soil characteristics) to assess the site quality; and tree population characteristics to define site index of Pinus brutia and Pinus nigra. Five communities were identified using MRPP and indicator species analysis. Indirect gradients were analysed with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). In the ordination, the first NMDS axis (explaining 27% of the variation) separated three groups along an elevation gradient and the second axis (23%) two groups with contrasting exposition at the highest altitudes. Litter characteristics were the main environmental gradient according to PCA, but were only relevant to discriminate between two communities at intermediate altitude. P brutia performed best below 800 m in a Eu-Mediterranean climate. Sites above 1000 m were more suitable for P. nigra.

The Shannon diversity values showed no differences between treatments. These results emphasize that the tree harvest treatments analyzed are not suitable for the management of this P. pinaster stand.

PLANTATIONS","Seed banks play a key role in the recruitment of forest vegetation after severe disturbance, but can originate an undesired plant community. Thus, investigations on seed bank structure, and early changes occurring after clear-cut, are of primary interest for sustainable forest management. Researches were carried out in two mature stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) plantations located in Tuscany (Italy), along the Mediterranean coast. Soil samples were collected in March, July and October of the 2nd and 3rd year after clear-cut, in cut strips and adjacent intact stands. Seed bank size and composition were evaluated through the number of seedlings and species emerged from soil samples. Intact plantations differed in seed bank richness and composition, but not in abundance that was approximately 1,200 seeds m(-2). Clear-cut doubled seed density in soil, did not change seed bank richness, and affected markedly composition. Seed banks of cut strips were richer in annual and open space species, and poorer in perennial, forest and disturbed sites species. Seeds of Erica scoparia dominated the seed bank, with a relative abundance of 60% in intact stands and 43% in cut strips. Proportion of annual seeds was slightly less than 20% in intact stands, but increased up to 50% after clear-cut. Between the 2nd and 3rd year from clear-cut, the proportion of seeds from species typical of stone pine forests decreased, while that of non-forest species and aliens increased. The scarcity of seeds from most forest species and the lack of tree seeds make the recruitment of understorey vegetation from seed banks critical. In addition, the increased seed density of alien and disturbed site species in intact seed banks with time from clear-cut, suggests that disturbance caused by cutting in narrow strips threatens the integrity of intact plantations.","WOS:000324790100004",1,0.673171621,1

Today sweet chestnut stands are very common around the western Mediterranean Basin, and it is necessary to analyze the dynamic of plant species diversity in different chestnut stand types (groves and coppices) to guide management strategies that will allow the conservation of biodiversity. Our objective was to analyze consequences on plant species diversity of various management strategies in chestnut stands of three Mediterranean areas, Salamanca (Spain), the Cevennes (France), and Etna volcano (Italy). We found that plant species diversity is different according to management types; it is higher in groves than in coppice stands. We also demonstrated that Castanea sativa cultivated groves were characterized by small heliophillous therophytes. C. sativa abandoned groves, mixed C. sativa-Quercus pyrenaica coppice stands, Q. pyrenaica coppice stands, and young C. sativa coppice stands were characterized by hemicryptophytes with anemochorous dispersal mode and chamaephytes. Medium and old C. sativa coppice stands (that differ by the shoot age) were characterized by phanerophytes with zoochorous dispersal mode. Human perturbations maintain a quite high level of species diversity. In contrast, the abandonment of chestnut stands leads to homogeneous vegetation with decreasing diversity. One solution could be to maintain a landscape mosaic constituted of diverse chestnut stands modified by human activities (groves, cultivated or abandoned, and coppice stands). This could enhance regional plant diversity.","WOS:000238453600005",15,0.659512703,1

Forest treatments, such as forest thinning, have been suggested to mitigate climate change impacts on vegetation by reducing competition between trees, thus increasing water availability. Studies addressing the combined effects of climate and forest thinning on belowground fungal communities are still scarce, being fundamental to elaborate adaptive strategies to global warming. he aim of this study was to evaluate the tree density reduction effects on soil fungal communities and their response to inter-annual changes in weather conditions. The temporal dynamics of soil fungal communities in relation to these two drivers (i.e., forest management and weather conditions) were studied from 2009 until 2014 in a set of 12 pairs of thinned and un-thinned plots dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. Thinning (from 30% up to 70% reduction in stand basal area) was conducted in 2009 and soil fungal community composition was studied during 4 years. Here, we used autumn precipitation and temperature to describe the impact of inter annual weather changes. We used Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons to study fungal communities in soil samples. Forest thinning did not significantly affect fungal community composition nor fungal species richness and diversity, indicating that the soil fungal community is resistant to forest thinning regardless of its intensity. However, fungal species composition changed progressively across years, both at the species level and with regards to functional guilds. These changes in community composition were partly driven by inter-annual variation in precipitation and temperature, with free-living fungi increasing in abundance under wetter conditions, and symbiotic fungi being more prominent under drier and colder conditions. The results indicate that mycorrhizal communities in Mediterranean forest ecosystems can resist forest thinning, if enough trees and functional roots from thinned trees are retained.","WOS:000437967900039",18,0.646032611,1
"879","medit","Plant functional types: a promising tool for management and restoration of degraded lands","Throughout the Mediterranean region, vegetation dynamics are affected by human activities which are either 'stresses' or 'disturbances', depending on their frequency, intensity and spatial distribution. To minimize or reduce anthropogenic degradation caused by land use and other disturbances, it is necessary to understand and predict the various responses of plant communities to disturbances. In particular, detailed but integrative approaches are required to assimilate large databases on vegetation and to make them directly useful for managers and restorers. We describe two case studies undertaken to evaluate the effects of logging or overgrazing on plant species diversity in pine forests of southern France and steppe ecosystems of southern Tunisia. Both studies employed the same methodology to identify plant functional traits (morphological, life history and regeneration traits) associated with community response to disturbance. The results of these analyses allowed us to develop state and transition models that could be used to plan and predict ecosystem trajectories, assess ongoing degradation processes and monitor community and ecosystem responses to management and restoration practices. We discuss the relevance and the use of plant functional types (PFTs) as tools for ecosystem management and planning and for monitoring restoration in southern Europe, northern Africa and elsewhere. Using this approach it is possible to improve management strategies for the conservation, restoration and sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and of ecosystems.","WOS:000220133300015",7,0.568566219,1

To estimate these effects, the objective of the present study was to test three hypotheses: (1) each soil surface disturbance type is characterized by a group of plant species that emerges following the disturbance. (2) each emergent group of plant species has distinct, recognizable biological traits, (3) in two different bio-geographic plant communities; each soil surface disturbance type is characterized by the same set of biological traits. We present results from Atlantic oak (Quercus pubescens Willd- Q. robur L. and Q. petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.) coppices and natural Mediterranean Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Miller) forests of southern France. Both studies use the same methodology based on a typology of soil surface perturbation 1-3 years after logging combined with a vegetation inventory. Plant functional traits (morphological, life history and regeneration), not necessarily linked with taxonomic attribution. were used to constitute putative functional groups to allow comparison between the two studies. Results were similar in the two studies and confirmed the working hypotheses.","WOS:000220783000019",5,0.556318169,1
"1227","medit","Ecology and classification of forests in Turkey","Turkey possesses all types of parent materials or bedrocks like metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic belonging to different geological era and periods. Some parent materials contain evaporitic sediments with salt, gypsum and high contents of alkaline materials which mostly prevent the growth of climax vegetation. The country has a rugged and high topography, related to tectonic movements, and volcanic activities which mainly occurred in Tertiary and Quaternary eras. The mountains are divided into three groups in terms of formation and ecological importance namely; orogenic mountains, volcanic mountains and uplifted blocks or horst mountains. The ecological importance of the topography is fully stressed by altitude, aspect and climate. The forests in Turkey can be classified on the basis of ecological features as: humid-mild deciduous, humid-cold coniferous on the north facing slopes of coastal belt of Northern Anatolian Mountains; subhumid-cold continental coniferous in the north facing slopes of backward part of Northern Anatolian Mountains; subhumid-semiarid semi continental coniferous on the plateau and mountains of southern basins of northern Anatolian Mountains; semiarid continental timer Anatolia Quercus spp. - Juniper spp. - Pinus nigra, semiarid-subhumid Quercus spp., Mediterranean Pinus brutia and oro-Mediterranean coniferous. The excessive cutting, wrong silvicultural practices, opening of agricultural fields inside the forests, and clear-cutting system are changing the vegetation structure of forests. Some of the forests in the country are accepted as relict forests. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","WOS:000335821200089",8,0.470527488,0
"1317","medit","Past tree range dynamics in the Iberian Peninsula inferred through phylogeography and palaeodistribution modelling: A review","The forests in the Iberian Peninsula have been strongly influenced by past climatic changes, but reconstructing their historical distributions and dynamics is very difficult due to the complex climatic characteristics and relief of the region. Research disciplines such as phylogeography and species distribution modelling can describe the past range dynamics of individual tree species in relatively great detail and help elucidate how these species have reacted to climatic changes. Here we review phylogeographical and modelling studies from species representative of the major Iberian forest types and attempt to extract general trends from the diversity of individual species histories in the Peninsula. To date most studies focus on geographical range dynamics during the Pleistocene, but an increasing body of evidence shows that some species have also retained the genetic imprints of much more ancient processes. Many widespread Iberian species show a deep and often remarkably clear-cut divide between populations from the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic regions of the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting that both areas have independently sustained viable populations over extended periods. In fact, phylogeographical studies commonly find that species had several glacial refugia across the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, distribution models help identifying further suitable areas that could have sustained so far undetected refugia. Such studies are of interest for species conservation, because refugium populations are high-priority targets due to their long-term persistence and unique evolutionary trajectory. Overall, we conclude that palaeoecology, phylogeography and species distribution modelling have a great potential to inform each other because of their complementary perspectives and results. A true integration of these approaches is therefore fundamental for further progress in our understanding of past Iberian environments and the organisms they harboured. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this work is to compare plant diversity, bare soil percentage, biomass and botanical composition between grazed and non-grazed areas at different times following grazing exclusion. Methods - Vegetation was assessed on exclosures established in 2006 and on nearby areas open to grazing by feral horses in December 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2009 we added 15 year old exclosures to the analysis. Key results - Species richness declined 24 months after grazing exclusion, mainly due to a decrease in the abundance of forb species. Bare soil percentage was significantly reduced 12 months after exclosures were built. Above-ground biomass showed a 3-fold increase 12 months after grazing exclusion. After three years, species richness and biomass were similar to those corresponding to older exclosures (15-years old). The composition of plant communities also changed following horse exclusion, with three and 15-years old exclosures dominated by perennial grasses typical of late seral stages. Conclusions - Our results support the hypothesis that natural montane grasslands in the Southern Pampas of Argentina may recover fast from grazing by large herbivores without application of specific restoration techniques.","WOS:000309900100003",1,0.694896589,1

Here, we seek to understand how grazing intensity influences swamp vegetation, with an emphasis on their diversity, structure and function. Six swamps were selected, two each in high, moderate and low intensity grazing sites, from the tropical montane swamps of the Upper Nilgiri Mountains, southern India. We recorded a total of 78 species belonging to 63 genera and 31 families. Our results showed that species richness, abundance and species composition differed significantly across grazing treatments. Moreover, mean vegetation cover and mean height differed significantly across grazing treatments, indicating that grazing significantly affected the vegetation structure and growth of swamp plant communities. Species compositional patterns showed that moderately grazed plant communities were significantly different from low and high grazing sites. In summary, grazing intensity influenced swamp species richness, abundance, and swamp plant communities. Specifically, high grazing pressure reduced vegetation cover causing changes in swamp community structure leading to the gradual conversion of the swamp habitat into grasslands.","WOS:000387850600015",2,0.798948772,1
"310","montgrass","Diversity and guild structure of insect assemblages under grazing and exclusion regimes in a montane grassland from Central Argentina","The effects of grazing disturbance on insect communities were examined at a montane grassland in Central Argentina, by comparing two grazed sites differing in cattle load (heavy and continuous or moderate and discontinuous) and two cattle exclusions differing in age (7 and 19 years). Two aspects of insect diversity (taxonomic and guild structure) and two levels of taxonomic resolution (family and species) were considered. Four monthly samples were taken with a suction sampler in two 1 m(2) areas at each site. Collected specimens were counted, identified to family (all insects) or species (Coleoptera) level, and allocated to trophic guilds. Abundance, richness, diversity and biomass of the insect assemblages had minimum values in the most intensely grazed habitat, which also differed from the other sites in terms of insect families and Coleoptera species composition. It also showed a distinct guild structure, with fewer secondary consumers, and chewers replacing suckers as the most abundant herbivore group. According to these observations, intense grazing in montane grasslands in Central Argentina could result in taxonomic and guild changes in the associated insect communities, but such effects would not be noticeable with less intensive use. Moreover, using family taxonomic level could be as or even more appropriate than species level in order to characterize insect communities in the studied habitats under varying disturbance regimes.","WOS:000174605900003",3,0.784844109,1

We estimated the effects of grazing-induced changes in vegetation and soil and of increased predation on small mammals in a Mediterranean grassland landscape. We measured vegetation structure, soil compaction and small mammal abundance and species composition in 22 plots of 8 Sherman live traps each, arranged according to an unbalanced two-way ANOVA design with two grazing levels (grazed areas and cattle exclosures) and two predator abundance levels (increased densities of Eurasian kestrets Falco tinnunculus by means of nest boxes and control). Plots were sampled during 2 consecutive years in early summer and earty fall. Exclosure from cattle increased significantly vegetation height and volume and decreased soil compaction. Grazing-induced changes in vegetation height and volume and in soil compaction produced strong effects on small mammal abundance and species richness. Increased kestrel. densities did not have significant additive or interactive effects, with the effects of grazing-induced vegetation and soil gradients on abundance or richness of small mammals. Our results suggest that the effects of grazing on small mammal communities in Mediterranean montane grasslands were mainly due to reduced food availability and by negative effects of trampling on the suitability of soils for building burrow systems. Decreased food quality and increased predation in grazed areas seemed to play a minor rote, if any. Reductions in stock densities would then favor generalist predator populations in Mediterranean grasslands through the expected positive effects of such reductions on the availability of food and burrows for small mammals.

Which grazing and precipitation variables best predict cover of vernal pool specialists and species with broader habitat requirements? Is vernal pool species diversity correlated with livestock exclosure, and at what spatial scales? Location: Montane vernal pools, northeast California, USA. Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 20 vernal pools, including pools where livestock had been excluded for up to 20years We compared plant species composition, functional group composition and species diversity among sites that varied in grazing history and seasonal precipitation using CCA and LMM. Results: Although vernal pool specialists were dominant in montane vernal pools, over a third of plant cover was comprised of species that occur over a broad range of wetland or upland environments. The species composition of vernal pool plant communities was influenced by both livestock grazing and precipitation patterns, however the relative effects of these environmental variables differed by functional group. Livestock exclosures favoured perennial vernal pool specialists over annual vernal pool specialists. In contrast, the cover of habitat generalists was more strongly influenced by seasonal precipitation than livestock grazing. At small spatial scales, species richness and diversity decreased as the number of years a pool had been fenced increased, but this relationship was not significant at a larger spatial scale. Conclusions: Both livestock grazing and seasonal precipitation structure the montane vernal pool plant community. We found that livestock grazing promotes the cover of annual vernal pool specialists, but at the expense of perennial vernal pool specialists. Wetter vernal pools, however, support higher cover of wetland generalist species regardless of whether pools are grazed.","WOS:000425120600003",5,0.659743304,1

Carabids were censused in 2001 and 2002 in 21 mown and 20 grazed meadows by means of pitfall traps. Mean species richness was significantly higher in mown plots than in grazed plots and species composition was significantly different between these two management types. Additionally, different species characteristic for mown and grazed plots were found. These results suggest that mown meadows and grazed meadows represent two habitat types for carabid beetles. Within both habitats, management intensity was quantified by fertilizing intensity, the number of cuts, cattle density and/or grazing intensity. The relationship between management intensity and the number of individuals and species was positive. Higher fertilizing intensity was the most important factor for higher species richness and had a significant influence on species composition in both habitats. Other variables positively related to the number of individuals, were the number of cuts in mown meadows and grazing intensity and altitude in grazed meadows. Additionally to fertilizing intensity, cattle density was positively related to the number of species in grazed meadows. These results illustrate that in the extensive management systems found in the Swiss Alps and Prealps, even intensively managed meadows can sustain high carabid diversity and abundance.

It is unclear how increased dominance of unpalatable species would affect the botanical diversity of these grasslands. We investigated whether there was any relationship between plant species diversity and the abundance of unpalatable species and whether soil conditions affected this relationship. In three species-rich montane pastures in western Switzerland, we related plant species richness to soil attributes, the relative cover of all unpalatable species and the relative cover of the locally dominant, toxic Veratrum album in 25 plots of 4 m(2). We furthermore determined species richness in small transects through patches of V. album. Species richness was significantly lower in and near (<= 0.3 m) patches of V. album. At the field scale, plant species richness was best described by total soil N:P ratio (positive relation) in one site and the relative abundance of unpalatable species (negative relation) and soil N:P ratio (positive relation) in a second site. In the third site, species richness was not significantly related to any measured variable. Vegetation diversity (Simpson's D) was negatively related to the relative abundance of unpalatable species in one site and positively related to pH in another site. The results suggest that no single factor can explain plant species richness and diversity in montane pastures. At very high densities unpalatable species can have adverse effects but soil nutrient status appears to be a more general determinant of plant species richness. Conservation efforts should give priority to the prevention of intensification of these pastures.","WOS:000242448300010",7,0.828135699,0

Conservation of arthropod diversity in montane wetlands: effect of altitude, habitat quality and habitat fragmentation on butterflies and grasshoppers. journal of Applied Ecology, 36, 363-373].

We investigated the importance of habitat variables at different scales on the richness and abundance of bumble bees both annually and seasonally in Sierran montane meadows over two years. We found that both patch and landscape factors influence the species richness and abundance of bumblebees and these factors have a seasonal component to their importance. The proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat was the most consistent positive influence on both species richness and abundance across years. In the second year, 2003, patch factors, plant species richness and current livestock grazing also influenced bumblebee species richness; plant species richness was positively correlated and current livestock grazing was negatively correlated with bumble bee species richness. Bumblebee abundance was positively influenced by meadow wetness and proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat in both years. These data suggest conservation of pollinators depends on conservation planning with attention to the quality and context of the landscape. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Montane Pampas grasslands are highly productive and have evolved with the influence of grazing by native herbivores. Thus we proposed, firstly that grazing by feral horses would increase seed bank diversity, without changing seed density in grazed areas and secondly that there is a greater similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation in exclosure areas. The study area is located in sub-humid montane grassland in mid-eastern Argentina. Sampling took place at the beginning and end of summer in 2008 and 2009, in three one-year-old exclosures and grazed areas. Soil and litter samples were collected and established vegetation cover was visually recorded in every area. Each sample was elutriated and sieved. Seed composition was recorded using a dissecting microscope. Seed density and species richness of the samples was analyzed using ANOVA and species composition was analyzed by multivariate analysis. Grazing reduces the seed density and richness of grasses, but forb species are not affected. The seed density of grasses increases in soil samples at the end of summer, while the density of forb species does not change. Similarity between the established vegetation and the seed bank was low. Grazing affects seed bank composition which could limit restoration time after the removal of herbivores. However, grass seed availability increases considerably during a short period after exclosure establishment, showing high potential for recovery in sub-humid grasslands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The experimental sites were under controlled grazing regimes (heavy, moderate, light and abandonment) for 10 years. Data were collected during one season; plant species composition, the number of species and above-ground and below-ground biomass were evaluated. Species richness was significantly reduced with increasing grazing intensity and abandonment. The greatest differences in species composition were recorded for the heavily grazed site owing to the appearance of a group of grasslands species typical of nutrient-rich soil. Heavy grazing increased therophytes and decreased the proportion of chamaephytes and geophytes. Above-ground productivity at the season's peak was typical of subhumid grasslands (up to 500 g m-2) and was significantly the highest in the abandoned pasture. Below-ground biomass was significantly the lowest in the heavily grazed sites and the highest in those that were moderately or lightly grazed. We could conclude that grazing intensification and abandonment have significant effects on the structure of these pastures. Low- or moderate-intensity (4-7 sheep ha-1) grazing seems to be the most appropriate treatment since it can maintain the species richness and typical floristic composition of those pastures.

Sites differed in management regime (grazing vs, mowing) and altitude. In addition, several environmental variables were measured. Bryophyte diversity was determined as species density (mean of 5 plots per site), as species richness (number of all species of a site) and as beta -diversity. Species richness was 20% higher at grazed than at mown sites. We interpret this as the result of higher environmental heterogeneity at grazed sites. This could also be the cause for the significantly higher beta -diversity at grazed sites. However, there was a significant management x altitude interaction caused by species-poor sites at low altitudes under grazing. This interaction might be caused by more intensive grazing at low altitude. Grazed sites contained the higher overall species richness (117 vs. 79), more exclusive species (47 vs. 9), and more Red List-species (12 vs. 6). Altitude had only an effect on the number of exclusive species, which was highest at high-altitude sites. No differences could be found for species densities both between management regimes and between altitude classes. This result indicates no differences in habitat heterogeneity at the within-plot scale. For analysis of effects of environmental variables on bryophyte communities, we used a direct ordination technique (CCA). The variables pH, amount of total carbon in the soil and management turned out to be the most important in explaining variation in the species data. However, variation explained by total carbon could also be explained in terms of total nitrogen or moisture. For preserving bryophyte diversity in montane wet meadows, extensive grazing by cattle is crucial. Due to slightly different bryophyte communities under the different management regimes, however, bryophyte diversity at the landscape level will be highest when both types of management are maintained.","WOS:000169385700002",12,0.850293981,1
"134","montgrass","Low-intensity management promotes bryophyte diversity in grasslands","Bryophytes constitute an important and permanent component of the grassland flora and diversity in Europe. As most bryophyte species are sensitive to habitat change, their diversity is likely to decline following land-use intensification. Most previous studies on bryophyte diversity focused on specific habitats of high bryophyte diversity, such as bogs, montane grasslands, or calcareous dry grasslands. In contrast, mesic grasslands are rarely studied, although they are the most common grassland habitat in Europe. They are secondary vegetation, maintained by agricultural use and thus, are influenced by different forms of land use. We studied bryophyte species richness in three regions in Germany, in 707 plots of 16 m(2) representing different land-use types and environmental conditions. Our study is one of the few to inspect the relationships between bryophyte richness and land use across contrasting regions and using a high number of replicates. Among the managed grasslands, pastures harboured 2.5 times more bryophyte species than meadows and mown pastures. Similarly, bryophyte cover was about twice as high in fallows and pastures than in meadows and mown pastures. Among the pastures, bryophyte species richness was about three times higher in sheep grazed plots than in the ones grazed by cattle or horses. In general, bryophyte species richness and cover was more than 50% lower in fertilized than in unfertilized plots. Moreover, the amount of suitable substrates was linked to bryophyte diversity. Species richness of bryophytes growing on stones increased with stone cover, and the one of bryophytes growing on bark and deadwood increased with larger values of woody plant species and deadwood cover. Our findings highlight the importance of low-intensity land use and high structural heterogeneity for bryophyte conservation. They also caution against an intensification of traditionally managed pastures. In the light of our results, we recommend to maintain low-intensity sheep grazing on sites with low productivity, such as slopes on shallow soils.","WOS:000447356800019",13,0.852457324,1

This calls for regional agriculture policies that efficiently protect their flora and fauna without jeopardizing agricultural viability. We experimentally sought a sustainable management, testing the effects of fertilisation (slurry) and aerial irrigation (sprinklers) separately and in combination (at different levels of intensity) on the arthropod communities occurring in extensively-managed montane and subalpine meadows in the SW Swiss Alps. Four years after the start of the intensification experiment, we measured the abundance, species richness, community composition and variability (beta-diversity) of ground-dwelling beetles and spiders. The abundance of both taxa showed a curvilinear relationship with management intensity. Spider abundance peaked at a moderate level of intensification while ground beetle abundance appeared to be more resilient to intensification, peaking at a high level of intensification. These responses were mainly driven by fertilisation, while irrigation played a minor role. For both taxa, we found no impact of irrigation or fertilisation, either when applied separately or in combination on species richness. Community composition was altered by management intensification in both taxa, but community variability was not. Given these taxon-specific patterns for abundance, applying organic fertiliser and water at levels corresponding to two-thirds of the quantity necessary to achieve local maximum hay yield appears to be compatible with the maintenance of rich ground-dwelling arthropod communities in mountain grasslands.","WOS:000414880300006",14,0.725250955,0

In the Italian Alps, we studied plant diversity, forage value and trophic traits in six large-scale heterogeneously grazed Nardus pastures, in their central and peripheral parts, and across the montane, lower and upper subalpine zones. Seventy cover-abundance floristic releves were performed in randomly located permanent plots, half at the pasture edge (M-plots) and half in their central part (C-plots). Plant diversity varied significantly with respect to the distance from the edge, being higher in M-plots because of shrub invasion as a consequence of reduced cattle pressure. Nardus cover was slightly higher in C-plots and negatively related to plant diversity. Forage value was lower in M-plots and negatively correlated with the cover of Nardus and woody species, implying that different grazing pressure was negatively influencing sward productivity. Differences in trophic traits of swards between C- and M-plots existed mostly as trends. Forage value significantly decreased in the lower subalpine and montane pastures, which are further grazed in late summer. Heterogeneous grazing management was therefore exerting positive effects on plant diversity and negative effects on forage value.

The major difference between the soils was the content of the stony fraction, which was significantly higher (P<0.05) in the slope savannas than in the flat savannas. A total of 57 dicot, 42 monocot, and 7 fern species were recorded in all studied savannas.

In this study we examine the responses of a high-Andean bird community to changes in vegetation and topographical characteristics across an Andean tree-line ecotone and adjacent cloud forest and puna grassland vegetation in southern Peru. Over a 6-month period, birds and vegetation were surveyed using a 100 m fixed-width Distance Sampling point count method. Vegetation analyses revealed that the tree-line ecotone represented a distinctive high-Andean vegetation community that was easily differentiated from the adjacent cloud forest and puna grassland based on changes in tree-size characteristics and vegetation cover. Bird community composition was strongly seasonal and influenced by a pool of bird species from a wider elevational gradient. There were also clear differences in bird community measures between tree-line vegetation, cloud forest and puna grassland with species turnover (beta-diversity) most pronounced at the tree-line. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that the majority of the 81 bird species were associated with tree-line vegetation. Categorizing patterns of relative abundance of the 42 most common species revealed that the tree-line ecotone was composed primarily of cloud forest specialists and habitat generalists, with very few species from the puna grassland. Only two species, Thlypopsis ruficeps and Anairetes parulus, both widespread Andean species more typical of montane woodland vegetation edges, were categorized as ecotone specialists. However, our findings were influenced by significant differences in species detectability between all three vegetation communities. Our study highlights the importance of examining ecotones at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale. Selecting a suitable distance between sampling points based on the detection probabilities of the target bird species is essential to obtain an unbiased picture of how ecotones influence avian richness and diversity.","WOS:000304389700007",17,0.793678931,0

The study areas included mature rainforests that were converted to pine forests, milpas, pastures and shrub/herbaceous plant communities via burning and logging. Seasonal patterns in AMF spore species richness and sporulation significantly differed across disturbance types at two of the three sites surveyed. Contrasting patterns of sporulation among AMF families across different disturbance types helped to explain how species richness and composition were maintained despite dramatic changes to the host plant community. Meaning, in most cases, disturbance induced changes in when different AMF taxa sporulated but not what taxa sporulated. Only conversion from mature pine-oak-Liquidambar-Persea forests to pine-dominated stands severely reduced AMF spore richness and total sporulation. Surprisingly, in pine-dominant stands no concomitant negative impacts on soil glomalin (MAb32B11 immunoreactive soil protein) concentrations were detected. However, soils of mature forests containing no pines had the highest concentration of glomalin. Conversion to pasture and milpa (diverse cornfield) had a strong negative impact on the concentration of soil glomalin concentrations. In sharp contrast, the same disturbance types improved AMF sporulation and AMF spore richness. It appears that disturbance type, and not AMF community measures used herein, best predicts changes in soil glomalin concentration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, knowledge about the impact of farming on the habitat quality there is rather poor. The influence of various management types (permanent sheep pen, irregular grazing, mowing) on Orthoptera diversity and species determining assemblages of these habitats were analysed on 72 plots in Polana Mts Biosphere Reserve. Altogether, 36 Orthoptera species (15 Ensifera, 21 Caelifera) were found, whereas the highest number of species was found on plots with irregular grazing (28 species), followed by plots with mown grass (17) and permanent sheep pens (14). All four measures of the assemblages' diversity confirmed significant differences. Using Discriminant Function Analysis, correct classification rate of Orthoptera assemblages was unambiguous according to the type of management. Each form of the management harboured several characteristic species. Thus implications regarding the biodiversity conservation and grassland management were given.","WOS:000299102900022",19,0.778398806,1
"202","montgrass","Seed arrival, ecological filters, and plant species richness: a meta-analysis","Theoretical models predict that effects of dispersal on local biodiversity are influenced by the size and composition of the species pool, as well as ecological filters that limit local species membership. We tested these predictions by conducting a meta-analysis of 28 studies encompassing 62 experiments examining effects of propagule supply (seed arrival) on plant species richness under contrasting intensities of ecological filters (owing to disturbance and resource availability). Seed arrival increased local species richness in a wide range of communities (forest, grassland, montane, savanna, wetland), resulting in a positive mean effect size across experiments. Mean effect size was 70% higher in disturbed relative to undisturbed communities, suggesting that disturbance increases recruitment opportunities for immigrating species. In contrast, effect size was not significantly influenced by nutrient or water availability. Among seed-addition experiments, effect size was positively correlated with species and functional diversity within the pool of added seeds (species evenness and seed-size diversity), primarily in disturbed communities. Our analysis provides experimental support for the general hypothesis that species pools and local environmental heterogeneity interactively structure plant communities. We highlight empirical gaps that can be addressed by future experiments and discuss implications for community assembly, species coexistence, and the maintenance of biodiversity.","WOS:000270828100015",20,0.646642652,0

One hundred and five plots in seven different pasture plant communities were sampled: (1) nitrophilous, (2) montane mesic, (3) subalpine mesic, (4) calcareous montane, (5) calcareous subalpine, (6) acid montane, and (7) acid subalpine pastures. Forward selection and variation partitioning were applied to identify the most important factors controlling the species composition and plant traits in the pastures. Aggregated weighted averages were calculated for each plot using the published values of average height, specific leaf area, and seed mass for each species. Explanatory variables were recorded for each site to reflect climate, soil properties, and grazing pressure. We hypothesised that species composition and functional variation in pastures of the Southern Alps are controlled by three main environmental filters: climate, resource availability, and grazing pressure. We found that variables of climate and soil properties had a major role in explaining the species composition and variations in plant traits, while grazing pressure showed a lower independent effect. Species composition and plant traits depended mainly on temperature, soil fertility, and variables of bedrock type - soil pH. Our results confirm the importance of taking the effects of climate and resource availability into account when describing plant and community functions of grasslands.","WOS:000305074400006",21,0.629933547,1

The objective was to determine the effects of breed and season on the composition of plant fragments in the faeces of cattle grazing a heterogeneous semi-natural grassland. Twelve heifers of the traditional Swedish Vaneko breed (live weight 309 kg) and twelve heifers of the Charolais breed (live weight 431 kg) were allocated to three pastures per breed. Faeces samples were collected in spring, summer and autumn for micro-histological examination of plant fragments. On the same occasion, defoliation of four competitive plant species was recorded. Faecal plant fragments mainly consisted of grasses but also herbs, whereas Cyperaceae, despite their abundance on the pastures, only composed a small proportion of fragments. Season affected the composition of plant fragments in the faeces, with a higher proportion of Cyperaceae and herbs in spring than later in the grazing period (P < 0.001), and the heifers ingesting more grasses and woody plants in autumn. In spite of a clear difference in live weight between the two breeds, no effects of breed on the composition of plant fragments in faeces were observed, although Vaneko heifers defoliated more Filipendula ulmaria in spring than the Charolais heifers (P < 0.01). In addition, defoliation of Alnus glutinosa increased later in the grazing period (P < 0.05), especially for the Vaneko heifers, indicating control of pernicious brushwood by grazing may be more effective in autumn.","WOS:000253121000008",22,0.615345368,0
"231","montgrass","Comparison and origin of forest and grassland ant assemblages in the high plateau of Madagascar (Hymenoptera : Formicidae)","We assessed species richness and composition of ant assemblages in adjacent montane forest and secondary (anthropogenic) grassland habitats in the central plateau of Madagascar. We used five quantitative methods (leaf litter sifting, two types of pitfall traps, beating low vegetation, and soil digging) and compared methods within and across habitats. Sample-based and occurrence-based accumulation curves demonstrated that the efficiency of ant inventory methods is habitat specific. Litter sifting, however, was the single most efficient method in both habitats. Overall, our analyses of the relative efficiency of methods recommend the use of sifting and beating in the montane forest site, and sifting alone in the grassland site. In four of five methods, more species were collected in the grassland site (31 spp.) than in the forest site (26 spp.). Occurrence-based accumulation curves based on all methods demonstrated that species richness was similar in the two habitats, reaching a maximum difference of approximately one species. Only five species were shared between the grassland and forest sites. The presence of a high number of ant species restricted to the grassland site (18 spp.) is the first record of high endemism in this habitat in Madagascar and may have strong implications for the reconstruction of the natural vegetation types at the time humans arrived. Their presence suggests that a comparable open habitat, such as montane woodland, shrubland, or thicket, was present on Madagascar long before humans developed the secondary grasslands less than 2000 years ago. These results are contrary to the ""classical hypothesis"" that the central plateau was a continuous region of closed forest. These results support the hypothesis that the montane regions, including the central plateau, once contained areas of habitat with an open structure and that the endemic ants now found in the secondary grasslands were originally native to such a habitat.","WOS:000175063600015",23,0.874787482,1
"311","montgrass","Consequences of pastoral abandonment for the structure and diversity of the alpine avifauna","1. There is a long-term trend of depopulation of rural areas and pasture abandonment throughout the Alps. This trend peaked after the Second World War and is now omnipresent. Its ecological consequences are evident mostly below the timberline, where grassland gradually turns into shrub and, ultimately, to forest. This study addresses the consequences of land abandonment and the decline of pastoral practices on the diversity and structure of the bird communities of the Italian Alps. 2. The breeding birds of Gran Paradiso Natural Park in north-western Italy were surveyed, and bird diversity, abundance of grassland, ecotone, woodland and shrub species were analysed using regression in relation to a set of explanatory variables including elevation, local habitat variables, landscape variables and grazing intensity. 3. Avian diversity increased in abandoned pastures as higher numbers of shrub species followed tree and shrub encroachment. Conversely, open habitat species that benefited from grazing were mostly confined to pure grasslands and high altitudes. 4. The effects of grazing were more evident in the montane belt. Grazing maintained open habitats by limiting tree and scrub encroachment, thereby favouring grassland bird species. At higher altitudes, however, grazing had little effect on typical open habitat alpine species (choughs Pyrrhocorax spp., water pipit Anthus spinoletta, alpine accentor Prunella collaris, wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe, snow finch Montifringilla nivalis, rock thrush Monticola saxatilis) and only skylark Alauda arvensis and linnet Carduelis cannabina preferred grazed meadows. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the abandonment of grazing in the Alps has significant effects on bird species diversity and abundance, especially below the timberline where pastoral decline leads to significant changes in vegetation structure. However, grazing importance differs markedly depending on whether the focus is avian alpha-diversity or grassland bird abundance. Pastoral abandonment leads to an overall increase in avian diversity, but most species invading abandoned pastures are already common, whereas several grassland bird species that are dependent upon grazed pastures have an unfavourable conservation status. Overall, in terms of bird conservation objectives, large-scale abandonment of long-established pastoral habitats and their complete replacement with scrub, or even forest, is likely to be detrimental.","WOS:000220587800009",31,0.877301588,1
"36","montgrass","Breeding bird community composition in different successional vegetation in the montane coniferous forests zone of Taiwan","To examine the relationship between forest succession following fire and the composition of bird communities, we investigated the vegetation structure, bird population density, foraging behavior and guild structure in bamboo grasslands (11 years since the last fire), pine savanna (41 years), pine woodland (58 years), old-growth hemlock forest (never burned), and old-growth spruce forest (never burned) in the Tatachia area of central Taiwan. Canopy height, total foliage cover, tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags, foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation. Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Present and former land uses, tree, shrub and herb species, soil properties and the percentage cover and height of trees, shrubs and herbs were determined in 40 plots. An indirect ordination of these plots showed that species composition was primarily determined by successional stage and agricultural disturbance. In forest plots (ordinated separately) where the widest range of former and current grazing intensities had occurred, evidence of grazing history, soil phosphorus and vegetation height correlated negatively with the strongest ordination axis. Least grazed forest plots had fewer tree seedlings and saplings than more intensively grazed plots. This may be due to the increase in Mimulopsis alpina (Acanthaceae) in less grazed forest where tree regeneration might otherwise be more advanced. Tree seedlings and saplings were uncommon in the forest, rarely exceeding 30 cm in height and there was no tree understorey. Although grazing is important for preserving species diversity in Mount Elgon National Park through the maintenance of species-rich grasslands, long-term effects on montane forest communities must be considered in future park management.","WOS:000087496700009",37,0.891986935,1

At four sites a 150 x 10 m belt transect was established perpendicular to the forest/pasture edge. Vegetation transect censusing included recording of seed plane species presence and abundance (aerial crown/shoot cover), as well as assessment of seedling sapling and tree stem diameter and height. A total of 290 seed plant species were found in 159 genera and 85 families. Asteraceae is with 47 species the most speciose family. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index showed no significant difference between forest and pastureland, with the exception of a pastureland site which had experienced intensive land use. Sorensen's similarity index showed significant differences in species composition between forest and pastureland. Vegetation at the forest edge consisted mainly of secondary shrub and tree species. From the forest interior towards the edge, numbers of seedlings, saplings and secondary trees increased, while numbers of mature forest trees declined. Edge effects are expressed in a reduction of canopy height and an increase in subcanopy stature from the forest interior towards the edge, causing thr merging of forest canopy and subcanopy layers at the edge. Intensively used pasturelands only harboured a low herbaceous vegetation, while their abandoned equivalents showed the presence of patches of secondary shrub vegetation and recovering forest in a grassland matrix. Expected spatio-temporal changes at the forest edge include the encroachment of secondary vegetation and the levelling of the forest/pasture border as time advances and land use becomes less intense. Transitional second,growth edge vegetation may buffer the remaining mature forest core and simultaneously induce forest recovery processes in adjacent abandoned pasturelands. It is recommended to include forest edge tree species in programs focused at the ecological restoration of tropical montane cloud forests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The montane grasslands were the most important habitats in terms of species of conservation concern, whereas the agricultural mosaics were the most species-rich habitats. The mixed pine-beech woods were significantly richer than the pinewoods, whereas pinewoods and broad-leaved woods did not differ significantly between them. The bird diversity was significantly correlated with the number of tree layers, the vertical structural complexity and the maximum height of trees. The presence of grassland, forest and agricultural habitat type, as well as the altitude and the vegetation structural complexity were the main environmental parameters determining species composition (Canonical Correspondence Analysis). We identified a set of 17 typical species (IndVal analysis) to be used in the monitoring scheme of the Park, which were characteristic of the main bird habitat types distinguished by Ward's hierarchical clustering. Conservation measures should involve maintenance of the traditional agricultural practices, montane grasslands, old growth woods, as well as the vertical vegetation complexity and high trees in forest stands.

We collected 46 phytosociological releves during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011. Species composition and species richness were studied at two spatial scales (1 m(2) and 16 m(2)) in relation to soil parameters (soil depth, pH (KCl), content of P, K, mg, N and C), management regime (mowing, grazing, ploughing in the past and burning), and other factors (altitude, litter cover, open soil, inclination, solar radiation and animal excrement). Seven grassland types were distinguished belonging to 3 classes and 4 alliances, namely the Nardetea strictae including the Violion caninae (mesic pastures at altitudes of 400-600 m mostly on moderate slopes) and the Nardo strictae-Agrostion tennis (grasslands on moderate slopes at altitudes of 700-900 m usually managed by mowing and grazing the aftermath); the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, including the Arrhenatherion elatioris (submontane grasslands originated mostly on former fields after their abandonment in the past) and the Cynosurion cristati (intensive pastures); and the Festuco-Brometea including the Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati (abandoned grasslands dominated by Brachypodium pinnatum and Inula salicina). Detrended correspondence analysis indicated that the major compositional turnover was related to altitude and soil reaction. A canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that altitude had the strongest effect on species composition in the analysed dataset, followed by management treatments (former ploughing, grazing intensity). For vascular plant species richness, regression tree analysis identified grazing intensity as the most important predictor at the 1 m(2) scale. At the 16 m(2) scale, soil humus content was evaluated as the most important predictor of vascular plant species richness, followed by litter cover and grazing intensity. The number of bryophytes was not determined by the studied environmental factors at either of the two spatial scales.

In this study we analysed the effects of abandonment on plant species composition and species richness over a period of nine years in a montane grassland in the Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) region Eisenwurzen (Styria, Austria). Additional investigations concerned the number of Red Data List species, plant strategy types, Ellenberg indicator values, indicator values for mowing, grazing and trampling tolerance, temporal sequence of phenological phases and seven plant traits. We differentiated two topography-related habitat types: an initially species-rich sheep pasture on a steep, south-facing slope and a less species-rich meadow on a flat site immediately below, with a comparatively higher nutrient and water supply in the topsoil. Testing a possible management alternative, the effects of continued low-intensity sheep grazing on the slope were also analysed. In spring 2001, one permanent plot of 50 m(2) was established in the centre of each habitat type and treatment. Our results show that the long-term effects of abandonment on grassland vegetation depend largely on local site conditions. Nutrient availability in the soil seems to be an especially important factor. On the abandoned flat site, floristic composition and physiognomy changed dramatically within four years; a high species turnover and a decline in phytodiversity could be observed. In contrast, we found only minor effects on the abandoned slope site even nine years after abandonment. If the maintenance of existing phytodiversity is a conservation target, suitable management operations have to be carried out at shorter intervals (at least every 3 years) in habitats with nutrient-rich soils than in nutrient-poor habitats (approx. 5 to 10 years). From a nature conservation point of view, low-intensity sheep grazing may be a suitable management alternative to mowing.","WOS:000312525200002",66,0.820003667,1

How are epiphytic assemblages affected by different degrees of human disturbance, and what are the driving forces? An inter-Andean dry forest landscape at 2300 m elevation in northern Ecuador. We sampled epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants on 100 trees of Acacia macracantha in five habitats: closed-canopy mixed and pure acacia forest (old secondary), forest edge, young semi-closed secondary woodland, and isolated trees in grassland. Total species richness in forest edge habitats and on isolated trees was significantly lower than in closed forest types. Species density of vascular epiphytes (species per tree) did not differ significantly between habitat types. Species density of bryophytes, in contrast, was significantly lower in edge habitat and on isolated trees than in closed forest. Forest edge showed greater impoverishment than semi-closed woodland and similar floristic affinity to isolated trees and to closed forest types. Assemblages were significantly nested; habitat types with major disturbance held only subsets of the closed forest assemblages, indicating a gradual reduction in niche availability. Distance to forest had no effect on species density of epiphytes on isolated trees, but species density was closely correlated with crown closure, a measure of canopy integrity. Microclimatic changes but not dispersal constraints were key determinants of epiphyte assemblages following disturbance. Epiphytic cryptogams are sensitive indicators of microclimate and human disturbance in montane dry forests. The substantial impoverishment of edge habitat underlines the need for fragmentation studies on epiphytes elsewhere in the Tropics.","WOS:000263701500008",68,0.914106619,1

Vesicles and aseptate hyphae were the structures most frequently observed in the plant roots. After trap culture for 5 months, 25 AM fungal taxa were identified in the soil samples collected, of which nine belonged to Glomus, ten to Acaulospora, one to Entrophospora and five to Scutellospora. The frequency of occurrence of different genera and species varied greatly. Glomus was the dominant genus, and the most frequent and abundant species was Glomus mosseae. Over the whole sampling area, spore density in the rhizosphere soil of different host plant species ranged from 2 to 66 per 20 g air-dried soil. Overall AM fungal species richness was 2.10 and species diversity was 2.35. AM fungal diversity was also compared among the four different land use types (farmland and normal, disturbed and highly disturbed montane scrub grassland). Spore densities in the farmland and normal grassland were much higher than in the grasslands that had been degraded to varying degrees. The species richness in normal grassland was the highest of the four land use types examined.

Little is known of the population biology of amphibian species inhabiting montane forests in Central and West Africa, where anthropogenic activities such as farming and cattle raising are major threats to native biodiversity. We used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) to assess the population genetic structure of two poorly known species, Cardioglossa schioetzi and Leptodactylodon bicolor (both in the Arthroleptidae), in and around Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve on the Mambilla Plateau in eastern Nigeria. The landscape comprises continuous forest on steep slopes and small riparian forest fragments in a grassland matrix. While increased fragmentation is well documented for these and other forests in the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria over the past century, there are no previous assessments of the impact of forest fragmentation on montane amphibian populations in this region. Our estimates of genetic diversity are similar across populations within each species with levels of heterozygosity values consistent with local population declines. Except for a pair of populations (C. schioetzi) we did not observe genetic differentiation between forest and riparian forest fragment populations, nor across sites within continuous forest (L. bicolor). Our results demonstrate recent gene flow between forest fragments and the adjacent protected forests and suggest that small forest corridors connecting these may lessen the genetic consequences of at least 30 years of intense and severe fragmentation in Ngel Nyaki.","WOS:000441738000047",78,0.836403267,1

In NW Spain, the recent abandonment of traditional farming practices and the gradual decrease in grazing pressures are reducing the number and extent of montane grasslands. In this context, we investigated the composition of carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages that inhabit semi-natural grasslands situated in long-term managed oak and beech forested landscapes. According to their spatial arrangement, the studied grasslands were classified into: (1) interior or gap grasslands (small and completely surrounded by continuous forest) and (2) exterior grasslands (large and connected to a variety of habitat types). Our results indicate that, within each forested landscape, the gap and exterior grasslands harboured particular carabid assemblages (i. e. exclusive or abundantly collected species), which were also distinct from the surrounding forest carabid fauna. Dissimilarities between gap and exterior grasslands in each landscape suggest great carabid diversity at the regional scale. We also detected species-specific responses as several carabids were mainly associated with gap or exterior grasslands. Consequently, in highly modified forested landscapes, semi-natural grassland remnants may constitute great value for the protection of the carabid fauna. Specifically, we recommend conservation strategies that preserve variety in grassland features and maintain proper management activities to prevent the loss of specialised species and a decrease in regional carabid diversity.","WOS:000294460300007",96,0.872483153,0

Post-classification comparison of land cover maps of 1972 and 2010 was used to quantify the level of persistence, net gains, losses and swaps among urban, natural vegetation, and agriculture categories; framed in a hierarchical land use/cover classification. The spatial distribution of land cover changes was related to environmental and socio-economic variables. The overall land cover change pattern of ""periurban forest transition"" was characterized by urban expansion, agriculture adjustment and associated forest recovery. Montane forests showed a net increase of 10%, expanding over mountain grasslands, which in turn lost 66% of their original area. Dry forests experienced high levels of swaps, being relocated into more humid areas and further away from access roads. Simultaneously, herbaceous agriculture was concentrated in flat areas more suitable for modern mechanized agriculture. In the foothills of the San Javier range, urban areas tripled their original extension replacing fertile agricultural lands.(mainly sugar cane). Forest recovery and land-use intensification patterns are usually considered as an opportunity for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, these new forests are characterized by the abundance of exotic species with little known ecological properties. Also, the replacement of highly productive agriculture by urban developments, and of natural montane grasslands by forests, imply negative changes in terms of agriculture production, the conservation of grassland biodiversity and landscape configuration with high recreational value.

It results in considerable changes in the composition of both plant and animal communities. Ants have many critical roles in the maintenance and functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore, the response of ants to clear-cutting and the time it takes for an ant community to recover after clear-cutting are important indicators of the effect of this harvesting technique on the forest ecosystem. We investigated ground-dwelling ant communities during secondary succession of deciduous forests in Transylvania, Romania. Using space-for-time substitution, we explored a chronosequence from clear-cuts to mature forests (> 120 years). The object was to determine if cutting has measurable effects on ant community structure, and if ant species richness differs between successional stages. We recorded a total of 24 species of ants, 11 characteristic of forests and seven of open landscape. Ant species richness was higher in clear-cuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands. Number of ant individuals was highest in young age classes and lowest in closed-canopy age classes. There was no drastic change in species richness during the succession, however differences in community composition at different stages were recorded.

Knowledge on the biology and habitat demands of individual species is generally limited. We examined the influence on flat bugs of stand-age and clear-cutting, comparing five classes of spruce stands. The five classes were: clear-cut, unthinned, and thinned (all three products of current clear-cutting forestry), mature managed and old-growth stands (these two had never been clear-cut). We also compared unburned and recently burned mature pine forest. Fire, but not stand age, had a pronounced effect on species richness and total abundance. Aradus depressus showed a significant association with older forest stands. Aradus betulae occurred only in clear-cuts and burned forest indicating that this species is favored by disturbance in general. Aradus lugubris, Aradus crenaticollis and Aradus brevicollis were found only in the burned forest. Aradus brevicollis has not previously been shown to be associated with fire.","WOS:000274095700002",3,0.740942964,1
"45","taiga","Proportions of saproxylic beetle populations that utilise clear-cut stumps in a boreal landscape - Biodiversity implications for stump harvest","Many saproxylic insects (insects dependent on deadwood) are threatened because the amounts of suitable substrate, coarse woody debris (CWD), are low in managed forests. Harvesting clear-cut stumps for bioenergy will decrease these amounts further and may therefore contribute to loss of biodiversity. Earlier studies have demonstrated that many saproxylic beetle species utilise clear-cut stumps. However, the importance of stumps compared with other kinds of deadwood remains unknown. In particular, some species adapted to sun-exposed deadwood created by disturbances might, in managed forest landscapes, be dependent on stumps in clear-cuts. In the present study we quantify the proportions of landscape-wide populations of saproxylic beetles that are recruited from clear-cut stumps in a managed boreal forest landscape. The amount of bark on clear-cut stumps and population densities (beetles per m(2) bark) were estimated for a 24,499 ha landscape in Sweden. Our data were pooled with estimates from a similar study in the same landscape, including all other types of CWD and beetle densities. The clear-cut stumps were estimated to contribute 15.5% of total bark to CWD in the landscape. For spruce, clear-cut stumps contributed 37.9% of the total bark. Of 39 analysed beetle species, 13 were estimated to have more than 10% of their populations in clear-cut stumps, 9 more than 50%, and 5 more than 80%. Clear-Cut stumps are thus an important breeding substrate for many beetle species and consequently, intensive stump harvest risks decreasing biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"55","taiga","Does the decline of red wood ants after clear-cutting favour epigeic arthropods?","In forest ecosystems in the temperate and boreal zones in Europe, red wood ants (RWA, Formica rufa group) have a significant affect as predators and competitors in communities of ground-dwelling arthropods. Therefore, the spatiotemporal distribution and abundance of RWA affect the distribution of many other species. The hypothesis that a reduction in the abundance of RWA in clear-cut areas enables other arthropods to increase in abundance was tested. The study was conducted in NW Poland in 2007 and 2008. A total of 276 1x1 m plots were sampled and 1,696 individuals recorded. The probability of the occurrence of RWA decreased significantly towards the center of clear-cut areas and increased with increasing plant cover. The frequency of Lasius platythorax, Formica fusca and spiders in the plots significantly increased towards the edge of a clear-cut area. Moreover, the occurrence of L. platythorax was negatively associated with the presence of RWA, while that of the Myrmica species was positively associated. The effect of the distance to the edge of a clear-cut area seems to be much more pronounced than the effect of RWA. This suggests that the arthropods studied prefer habitats close to the edge that are utilized by RWA than RWA-free sites located in the centre of clear-cut areas.","WOS:000291955100013",5,0.716081004,1
"67","taiga","Effects of low severity burning after clear-cutting on mid-boreal ant communities in the two years after fire","Fire is important in maintaining a diversity of communities and landscapes in boreal ecosystems, but, in recent times, forest management has suppressed fires. Managers now commonly burn a proportion of clear-cuts in Sweden to conserve components of the fire-favoured fauna, but effects of these treatments on the ant fauna are unknown. We compared ant communities between burned and control clear-cuts to determine their value for this important faunal group. Ants were collected in 1995 and 1996 from 5 burned and 5 control clear-cuts in mid-boreal Sweden. We compared abundances of workers and reproductive females of common species between the treatments. Burned and control clear-cuts supported similar abundances of common species, differing only in the abundance of Leptothorax acervorum queens collected in 1995. This suggests that L. acervorum was attracted to the burning, but we did not detect an increase in the abundance of its workers the following year. The abundance of dominant red wood ants (E rufa group) was not correlated with that of any other species, suggesting that their patchy occurrence did not conceal differences between treatments. Our findings suggest that nests of many ant species survive low severity fires. Habitat structure is likely to be important in determining ant community structure and low severity burning in disturbed open habitats, such as the clear-cuts examined in this study, may not significantly alter habitat structure relative to unburned habitats in the short term.","WOS:000245699800009",6,0.794995068,1
"76","taiga","Pelagic food webs of humic lakes show low short-term response to forest harvesting","Forest harvest in the boreal zone can increase the input of terrestrial materials such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) into nearby aquatic ecosystems, with potential effects on phytoplankton growth through enhanced nutrient (i.e., positive) or reduced light availability (i.e., negative), which may affect ecosystem productivity and consumer resource use. Here, we conducted forest clear-cutting experiments in the catchments of four small, humic, and nitrogen-limited unproductive boreal lakes (two controls and two clear-cut, 18% and 44% of area cut) with one reference and two impact years. Our aim was to assess the effects of forest clear-cutting on pelagic biomass production and consumer resource use. We found that pelagic biomass production did not change after two years of forest clear-cutting: Pelagic primary and bacterial production (PP, BP), PP:BP ratio, chl a, and seston carbon (seston C) were unaffected by clear-cutting; neither did tree harvest affect seston stoichiometry (i.e., N:phosphorus [P], C:P) nor induce changes in zooplankton resource use, biomass, or community composition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that pelagic food webs of humic lakes (DOC > 15 mg/L) might be resilient to a moderate form of forest clear-cutting, at least two years after tree removal, before mechanical site preparation (e.g., mounding, plowing) and when leaving buffer strips along lakes and incoming streams. Thus, pelagic food web responses to forest clear-cutting might not be universal, but could depend on factors such as the time scale, share of catchment logged, and the forest practices involved, including the application of buffer strips and site preparation.","WOS:000454685500002",7,0.565383057,0
"87","taiga","Resilience of bryophyte communities to clear-cutting of boreal stream-side forests","We asked if short-term changes in bryophyte communities in response to clear-cutting of boreal stream-side forests are persistent and whether species with low resilience may survive in narrow riparian buffer strips. To assess short-term changes and the function of buffer strips we compared the bryophyte community in permanent 0.1 ha plots of mature forest before and after clear-cutting. Persistent changes were inferred by pair-wise comparisons of 0.1 ha plots of mature forests with carefully matched 0.1 ha plots in stands established after clear-cutting 30-50 years earlier. Total bryophyte species richness did not respond significantly to clear-cutting. However, richness changed in many subgroups defined by phylogenetic, habitat or substrate affinity. Numbers of both liverwort and forest species were significantly reduced on clear-cuts and these differences remained significant, although smaller, 30-50 years after clear-cutting. In contrast, there were short-term increases in richness of mosses and of species growing on disturbed mineral soil, but these species numbers returned to mature-forest levels in the young stands. Number of species associated with convex substrates, especially woody debris species, was strongly reduced by clear-cutting and showed no significant recovery after 30-50 years. Hence, most of the negative effects of clear-cutting on bryophyte species persist almost halfway into the next forestry rotation period. However, narrow buffer strips (10 m on each side) prevented most of the short-term extirpations of species with low resilience on clear-cuts. Buffer strips may thus be effective in conserving the bryophyte flora of stream-side forests, but their longterm function as refugia and their contribution to population recovery in other parts of the landscape need further evaluation.

"95","taiga","Forestry Alters Foraging Efficiency and Crop Contents of Aphid-Tending Red Wood Ants, Formica aquilonia","Forest management alters species behaviours, distributions and interactions. To evaluate forestry effects on ant foraging performance, we compared the quality and quantity of honeydew harvested by ants among clear-cuts, middle-aged and mature spruce-dominated stands in boreal forests in Sweden. Honeydew quality was examined using honeydew collected by squeezing the gasters of laden Formica aquilonia workers. We used fifteen laden individuals at each study site (four replicates of each stand age) and analysed honeydew chemical composition with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. To compare the quantity of honeydew collected by individual ants, we collected and weighed five ants moving up and five ants moving down each of ten trees at the twelve sites (totally 1200 ants). The concentration of trehalose in honeydew was lower in clear-cuts compared with middle aged and mature stands, and similar trends were shown for sucrose, raffinose and melezitose, indicating poorer honeydew quality on clear cuts. Concentrations of the amino acid serine were higher on clear-cuts. The same trend occurred for glutamine, suggesting that increased N-uptake by the trees after clear cutting is reflected in the honeydew of aphids. Ants in mature stands had larger heads and carried proportionally more honeydew and may therefore be more efficient foragers. Human alternation of habitats through clear-cutting thus affects food quality and worker condition in F. aquilonia. This is the first study to show that honeydew quality is affected by anthropogenic disturbances, likely contributing to the reduction in size and abundance of F. aquilonia workers and mounds after clear cutting.","WOS:000303129700016",9,0.61125085,0
"106","taiga","Saproxylic beetles in high stumps and residual downed wood on clear-cuts and in forest edges","This study evaluates how the placement and the different possible outcomes of a spruce retention tree affected species richness and assemblages of spruce-associated saproxylic beetles. In a field experiment in the boreal zone of central Norway, high stumps were created and compared with residual wood pieces (i.e. top boles with branches), in clear-cuts versus in forest edges. Flight interception traps were mounted close to the substrate. The results were analysed using rarefaction techniques, ordination (DCA) and ANOVA. It was found that the placement of retention trees of spruce does matter: beetle assemblages were significantly different in stumps in the four treatments. For all species pooled, the species richness was higher in stumps in clear-cuts than in stumps or boles in the forest edge. Four red-listed species were more abundant near stumps than boles, and two red-listed species were more abundant in clear-cuts than forest edge. To cater for the variety of habitat preferences among forest beetles in managed forest, managers should leave both standing spruce trees (many of which will end up as windthrown, downed holes) and some high stumps (to secure some upright dead wood), in both exposed clear-cut and semi-shaded forest edge.","WOS:000271827400005",10,0.831005026,1
"1110","taiga","Comparison of moth communities following clear-cutting and wildfire disturbance in the southern boreal forest","Nocturnal macrolepidopteran fauna (moths) of the southern boreal forest of Ontario, Canada, were compared between forests clear-cut or burned by wildfire approximately 5 years previously to assess whether their assemblages differed following disturbance. Moths were light-trapped for 27 days during the summer in three burned and three clear-cut sites that had been formerly mature mixed jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest. The dominant species varied throughout the summer (Protorthodes oviduca dominated in June, Orthodes cynica in July and Idia americalis in August), but they were similar between disturbance types. Diversity indices were similar although ordinations showed significant differences between the two disturbance types. Nine species were more significantly abundant in burn than clearcut sites (Callopistra cordata, Cyclophora pendulinaria, Gluphisia septentrionis, Hyppa nr. xylinoides, Nemoria rubrifrontaria, Semiothisa neptaria, Spiramater lutra, and Tacparia detersata), whereas the converse was true for three species (Acronicta innotata. Phyllodesma Americana, and Euxoa comosa). Vegetation composition, disturbance age, percentage of jack pine pre-disturbance, and amount of downed woody debris and snags were the most important environmental correlates of moth community composition. Our study supports that of previous work on the effects of forest disturbance and biodiversity suggesting that clear-cutting may emulate wildfire for some organisms, but not for others. Thus, forest managers must consider multiple aspects of forest structure in attempting to use clear-cuts to mimic fire. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"125","taiga","History matters: Impact of historical land use on butterfly diversity in clear-cuts in a boreal landscape","In Swedish boreal landscapes, the loss of species-rich semi-natural grasslands is largely due to a long history of agricultural abandonment. Large areas historically managed as meadows have become mature coniferous forest. This study focused on the potential biological legacy following a long period of grassland abandonment. The butterfly fauna in clear-cuts which was historically meadows and abandoned long enough to allow a generation of conifers to mature (70-90 years) was compared with clear-cuts which were historically coniferous forest. The results showed that clear-cuts historically managed as meadows were: (i) much richer in individuals, (ii) more species-rich, and (iii) contained many more grassland specialists than clear-cuts with a history as forest, with many of these species threatened in other parts of Europe. The results from our study demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the legacy of historical land-use in remnant plant communities can affect butterfly diversity in clear-cuts and hence the large-scale dynamics over a timescale of a full tree rotation. The results of this study have implications for forest management practices. Replanting clear-cuts on land that was previously meadows with deciduous trees or allowing the forest to regenerate naturally instead of planting conifers would make it possible to preserve a greater diversity of habitats for butterflies and other organisms.

"135","taiga","Relative importance of thinned and clear-cut stands for bryophyte diversity on stumps","The interest in harvesting logging residues in the form of stumps has recently increased markedly in the Nordic countries of Europe due to the steadily growing market for bio-fuel from forestry. Yet, stumps are currently harvested without a solid knowledge of their importance for forest organisms. To assess the relative importance of thinned, clear-cut, and burned clear-cut stands for the diversity of bryophytes on stumps we investigated bryophyte species composition and richness on 755 spruce stumps in 27 forest stands in southern-boreal Finland. Stumps were sampled within both wet and dry sites. For comparison we also surveyed bryophytes on 669 ground plots in the same stands to assess if patterns were consistent regardless of substrate type. Stand type (i.e. thinned, clear-cut, or burned clear-cut) was the main predictor of both species richness and composition on stumps. Stumps in thinned stands were more species rich than in clear-cuts, and the lowest richness was found on stumps in burned clear-cuts. Differences in species composition were explained by higher frequency of occurrence of species in thinned than in clear-cut stands. Thus, stumps in clear-cut stands tended to host a subset of species from the thinned stands, but there was also a pattern of turnover where different species were present in thinned and clear-cut stands, respectively. The results were similar for bryophytes on ground indicating that canopy cover strongly affected the diversity of bryophytes regardless of substrate. We conclude that stump harvest in open, clear-cut stands will probably have minor effects on bryophyte diversity on dead wood in the managed forest landscape. Conservation efforts in thinned stands (e.g. retention and creation of dead wood) may be important for promoting the diversity of bryophytes in managed forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"146","taiga","Time-lagged lichen extinction in retained buffer strips 16.5 years after clear-cutting","Tree retention on clear-cuts is a relatively new measure in forestry aimed at lifeboating' forest species during young seral periods. However, the effectiveness of tree retention for maintaining biodiversity for more than a few years is still poorly known. We investigated lichen persistence in retained buffer strips along small streams after clear-cutting of the surrounding forest, and compared with clear-cuts and un-cut references. Specifically, we compared richness and frequency of red-listed/signal species, calicioids and pendulous species before clear cutting with 2.5 years and 16.5 years after clear-cutting, and also analysed their colonization-extinction dynamics over time. The results show that the richness of red-listed/signal species and calicioids in buffer strips had declined significantly after 16.5 years, but not after 2.5 years, while frequency displayed a significant difference already after 2.5 years. The richness of pendulous lichens remained relatively stable over time, but the frequency had declined significantly after 16.5 years. In clear-cuts all groups declined more than in buffer-strips (-2-3.5 times more) and the main decline had occurred already after 2.5 years. References remained stable over time. The colonization-extinctions dynamics reflected the richness declines, with high early extinction in clear cuts and lower but late extinction in buffer-strips, and low (re)colonization. We conclude that retained buffer strips cannot maintain lichen richness over time due to time-lagged extinction, but they are clearly more effective than clear-cuts. Wider buffer strips could potentially reduce tree mortality and decrease lichen extinction. The large amounts of standing dead wood makes buffer strips potential future colonization targets.","WOS:000442003900006",14,0.574325272,0

However, since the late 1900s, forest-management practices have been modified to better consider biodiversity while harvesting timber. For example, green-tree retention, gap felling, and lighter top-soil preparation methods (harrowing) have been introduced, but little is known about the ecological effects of these changes. We sampled carabid beetles in seven clear-cut stands that were subsequently harrowed. We studied the effects of (1) clear-cut size by comparing carabid catches of small gaps (ca. 0.16 ha) with those of larger clear-cuts (ca. 2 ha), and (2) microsite type within stands by comparing carabid catches of strips of bare soil to those of drifted humus (adjacent to bare-soil strips) and undisturbed (not scarified) forest floor. We detected only slight effects of clear-cut size on the assemblage structure, but clearer differences at species and ecological-group levels among the three compared micro-site types. The catches of forest carabids, and flightless carabids, were higher in the undisturbed micro-sites as compared to bare-soil ones, whereas open-habitat carabids showed the opposite abundance pattern. The variation among study blocks, and logging per se (compared to un-logged mature stands), had more pronounced effects on carabid assemblage structure than either clear-cut size or micro-site.

Stump extraction for bio energy is a new forestry activity and before large-scale implementation occurs, it is important to analyse its consequences. Saproxylic beetles depend on dead trees and stump extraction will reduce the amount of habitat available for this group. 2. Early warning signs of impending regional species extinctions were looked for in areas where stump harvest has only been conducted for about 3years. In a paired design (N=8), the beetle fauna was sampled in stumps on ordinary clear-cuts and on clear-cuts from which stumps had been extracted. Sampling in extraction clear-cuts was possible because 25% of the stump volume was retained. Samples were collected by bark sieving ten Norway spruce, Picea abies, stumps per clear-cut. 3. In total, 6959 individuals of 46 species were found. Several early warning signs were seen: stump extraction reduced the number of species per stump and per clear-cut and reduced the species evenness in individual stumps. 4. Species at higher trophic levels (predators and fungivores), in particular, suffered negative effects. Stump extraction reduced the number of species of fungivores and facultative predators/fungivores at the clear-cut level and reduced the relative abundance of predators at the stump level. 5. These results indicate that if stumps are extracted from a high proportion of the clear-cuts in a region, the present recommendations of leaving 15-25% of the stump volume will be insufficient for preserving the beetle fauna in the stumps. Further studies are needed to identify levels of stump retention that do not lead to species loss.","WOS:000321501800004",16,0.618646063,1
"175","taiga","Slope aspect modifies community responses to clear-cutting in Boreal forests","Slope aspect modifies microclimate and influences ecological processes and spatial distribution of species across forest landscapes, but the impact of slope aspect on community responses to disturbance is poorly understood. Such insight is necessary to understand landscape community dynamics and resilience. We compared bryophyte (liverworts and mosses) communities in matched 0.02-ha plots of four boreal stand types in central Sweden: recently clear-felled and mature stands dominated by Norway spruce in south-facing and north-facing slopes. Differences between forests and clear-cuts were interpreted as effects of clear-cutting, and differences between south- and north-facing slopes as effects of aspect. In response to clear-cutting, bryophyte cover and composition changed more in south-facing slopes. Only one out of ten significantly declining species in south- facing slopes also declined significantly in north-facing slopes. North-facing slopes lost fewer bryophyte species, and among those, fewer forest species and fewer species associated with wood and bark. In north-facing slopes, the average proportions of mosses and liverworts shared between the forest and the clear-cut plot were 88% and 74%, respectively. Corresponding numbers for south- facing slopes were 79% and 33%. In addition, more bryophyte species were added in north-than south- facing slopes after clear-cutting, somewhat reducing the difference in compositional change between aspects. South- and north-facing mature forests differed in species composition, mostly due to higher richness of mosses in south- facing slopes. The smaller changes in bryophyte communities on north-facing slopes in response to clear- cutting have implications for ecosystem dynamics and management as high local survival may enhance landscape-level resilience.","WOS:000245668500024",17,0.698354923,1
"185","taiga","Clear-cuts in production forests: From matrix to neo-habitat for butterflies","Butterfly conservation in Europe is mainly focused on well-defined grassland habitat patches. Such an approach ignores the impact of the surrounding landscape, which may contain complementary resources and facilitate dispersal. Here, we investigated butterfly species richness and abundance in a habitat normally regarded as unsuitable matrix: production forestry clear-cuts. Butterflies were recorded in 48 clear-cuts in southern Sweden differing with regards to the time since clear-cutting and land-use history (meadow or forest based on historical maps from the 1870s). All clear-cuts had been managed as production forests for at least 80-120 years. A total of 39 species were found in clear-cuts of both land-use histories, but clear-cuts with a history as meadow had on average 34% higher species richness and 19% higher abundance than did clear-cuts with a history as forest. No effect of the time since clear-cutting was found, irrespective of land-use history, which was likely due to the narrow timespan sampled (<8 years). The absence of temporal effect suggests that clear-cuts may provide butterflies with valuable resources for 10-15 years. Assuming a 100 year forest rotational cycle, this means that 10-15% of the total forested area are made up by clear-cuts valuable to butterflies, which corresponds to an area about four times as large as that of species-rich semi-natural grasslands. The study illustrates the importance of considering land-use legacies in ecological research and question the landscape-ecological view that clear-cuts make up an unsuitable matrix for butterflies. Moreover, forest conservation management with special attention to land-use history may increase the quality of the landscape, thus facilitating butterfly metapopulation persistence. Given their large area and assets of nectar and host plant resources, clear-cuts must be considered as a butterfly habitat in its own right. Being a man-made environment with short history, we might call it a neo-habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.","WOS:000366079700009",18,0.798807302,1

The investigation was carried out in 2007 in following treatments: clear-cut stands (EXT), wildfire stands (FIR) and control spruce stands (REF). Significantly lower abundance of Oribatida was found in FIR and EXT compared to REF stands. REF stands had clearly higher total species richness followed by EXT and FIR stands (47, 34, 29 species, respectively). NMS ordination showed considerable differences in the composition of Oribatida communities between treatments. The abundance of dominant Hermannia gibba, Oppiella nova and Tectocepheus velatus velatus was significantly lower in EXT and FIR compared to REF stands. The abundances of surface living H. gibba and Liacarus corracinus were low in EXT stands, whereas in FIR stands, H. gibba was rare and L. coracinus was totally absent. On the other hand, Oribatula tibialis had higher abundance in FIR stands than in others.

For each disturbance six edge transects 100 m long were established. Spiders were collected with pitfall traps 10 m apart from 50 m inside the disturbances to 50 m in the forest interior. Measurements of the forest floor structure and the habitat around the traps were also taken. Most habitat variables varied similarly across both wildfire and clear-cut edges but two variables, coarse woody debris and shrub cover changed more abruptly at edges of clear-cuts than at wildfire edges. Two separate CA analyses of the burned and clear-cut edge transects showed that changes in spider community species composition were more abrupt at clear-cut edges than at burn edges. A species indicator analysis (INDVAL) was used to identify species that were significantly associated with specific edge zones. Eight species were significantly associated with open (disturbed) habitats, one species was significantly associated with both burned and clear-cut edges, and four species were significantly associated with the forest interior. T-tests of slope coefficients from separate simple regressions of abundance and richness over distance showed that open habitat specialist's abundance and richness changed significantly more abruptly at clear-cut edges than at wildfire edges. Locally weighted smoothed regressions showed that the extent of edge influence on ground-dwelling spider guilds (open habitat and forest interior specialist) penetrated 20-30 m into the disturbances, 30 m into the forest interior at clear-cut edges, and at least 50 m into the forest interior for wildfire edge transects. Our results suggest that a minimum width of 100 m is necessary to maintain characteristics of forest interior spider assemblages in forest remnants, riparian or road buffers, and forest strips between cut-blocks.

The number of species in 10 km transects was positively correlated to the proportions of forest > 40 yrs and Mixed forest > 40 yrs, as well as the number of fragments of the latter, while negatively correlated to the proportions of clear-cuts and young forest. Transects with > 60% older forest including > 6% mixed habitats showed the highest number of bird species and individuals. The positive effect on species numbers of mixed forest was stronger in the study area where deciduous rich habitats were generally less abundant. Bird species richness in points of similar habitat was negatively correlated to the degree of fragmentation of the surrounding older forest. However, in a species-by-species analysis at the transect level no effects of fragmentation were found. The number of bird species at points was positively influenced by the increase from 0 to 5% deciduous trees, while no effect of higher deciduous site proportions showed. The hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) appeared as a significant indicator of high bird diversity at the transect ( landscape) level, by all methods used. However, the conclusion was reached that forests where the hazel grouse, blue tit (Parus caeruleus), treecreeper (Certia familiaris), jay (Garrulus glandarius) and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) are present are most likely to hold the potential for high bird species richness.","WOS:000183612100004",273,0.916255328,1

We found that bird and vegetation communities are currently similar, but retain some differences in species composition. Rank abundance curves for primary and secondary forest bird communities showed very similar patterns of species dominance. Species composition was also similar on the two sites which shared 24 of the 25 most frequently recorded species. Nonetheless, comparisons of density estimates derived from distance sampling showed three bird species were more abundant on primary forest sites and that one bird species was significantly more abundant on secondary forest sites. Notably, comparisons based on raw counts (unadjusted for potential differences in detectability) produced somewhat different results. Analyses of vegetation samples for the paired sites also showed relative similarity, but with some differences between primary and secondary forests. Primary forest sites had more large trees (trees greater than 50 cm diameter at breast height) and late successional species. Primary forest sites had a denser tall shrub layer while secondary forest sites had a denser canopy layer. Nonetheless, tree species richness, basal area of live trees and number of standing snags did not differ between primary and secondary forest sites. Results indicate that breeding bird communities on sites within the park that were logged commercially 70 years ago are currently quite similar to bird communities on sites with no history of human disturbance. Similarities between the bird communities on previously disturbed and undisturbed sites in Great Smoky Mountains National Park may exceed those on more fragmented landscapes because large patches of primary forest, adjacent to commercially logged sites, remained in the park when it was established in 1935. These patches of primary forest may have served as source areas for commercially logged sites. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","WOS:000236959600002",445,0.945960745,1
"474","taiga","Forest edges have high conservation value for bird communities in mosaic landscapes","A major conservation challenge in mosaic landscapes is to understand how trait-specific responses to habitat edges affect bird communities, including potential cascading effects on bird functions providing ecosystem services to forests, such as pest control. Here, we examined how bird species richness, abundance and community composition varied from interior forest habitats and their edges into adjacent open habitats, within a multi-regional sampling scheme. We further analyzed variations in Conservation Value Index (CVI), Community Specialization Index (CSI) and functional traits across the forest-edge-open habitat gradient. Bird species richness, total abundance and CVI were significantly higher at forest edges while CSI peaked at interior open habitats, i.e., furthest from forest edge. In addition, there were important variations in trait-and species-specific responses to forest edges among bird communities. Positive responses to forest edges were found for several forest bird species with unfavorable conservation status. These species were in general insectivores, understorey gleaners, cavity nesters and long-distance migrants, all traits that displayed higher abundance at forest edges than in forest interiors or adjacent open habitats. Furthermore, consistently with predictions, negative edge effects were recorded in some forest specialist birds and in most open-habitat birds, showing increasing densities from edges to interior habitats. We thus suggest that increasing landscape-scale habitat complexity would be beneficial to declining species living in mosaic landscapes combining small woodlands and open habitats. Edge effects between forests and adjacent open habitats may also favor bird functional guilds providing valuable ecosystem services to forests in long-standing fragmented landscapes.","WOS:000381216300007",474,0.924742352,0

Two old naturally regenerated forest types (ca. 100 years old) were chosen: hemlock-spruce forests (Tsuga chinensis and Picea brachytyla) and birch forests (Betula albo-sinensis). Three young regenerating forest types (ca. 40 years old), including spruce plantations (P. brachytyla), larch plantations (Larix kaempferi and Larix mastersian), and natural broad-leaved forests, were established after the logging of the old naturally regenerated forests. Using pitfall traps, we compared the distribution of carabid beetles in the five forest types. Three replicated plots for each forest type were chosen, and each plot was investigated with four trap sites twice each month during the growing season (May to October) in 2004. Our results showed that species richness and abundance were significantly higher in the young regenerating forests than in the old naturally regenerated forests. Analysis of complementarity in carabid species lists across the forest ages and types showed that the old naturally regenerated birch forests had the lowest similarity with the young regenerating larch plantations, and the highest similarity was shown between the two young regenerating plantations. Although PCoA ordination grouped the carabid assemblages according to forest type and forest age, the overall similarity among all forest types was high. Moreover, quantitative character species analysis did not detect significant species associated with forest types and ages. Based on the specificity and fidelity, most carabid species were abundant in all habitats, and only a few species were restricted in one or two forest types. Multiple linear regression between the species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity of carabids and of five environmental variables showed that the cover of canopy and herbaceous layer, and the depth of leaf litter had significant effects in determining richness, abundance and diversity of carabid beetles. Thus, the young regenerating forests at the mature stage could provide an appropriate habitat for most forest species of carabids survived in adjacent old naturally regenerated forests and might replace the role in part of the old-growth forests in sustaining the diversity of carabid assemblages. But some species are still restricted in old naturally regenerated forests, so in order to protect the diversity of carabid assemblages, it is necessary to sustain the intact old naturally regenerated forests when reforesting with some native tree species following natural succession.

"514","taiga","Effects of forest floor disturbances by mechanical site preparation on floristic diversity in a central Ontario clearcut","The effects of forest floor disturbance by six mechanical site preparation (MSP) treatments on structural and compositional diversity of early successional communities were examined in a clearcut in central Ontario. Periodic assessment of floristic diversity and abundance was performed to quantify treatment effects on species richness and abundance of three discrete plant life forms (cryptogam, herbaceous and woody) in the first five growing seasons after MSP. Botanical surveys of the surrounding uncut forest provided an estimate of pre-harvest forest species composition of the clearcut study site. Intensity of forest floor disturbance differed significantly among MSP treatments, creating a variety of microsites. The percentage of mineral soil exposure and abundance of downed woody material ranged from 7% to 52% and 18% to 1%, respectively, from the least to most severe treatments. Five years after MSP, 134 species (50 cryptogams, 47 herbaceous, 37 woody) were present in the clearcut study site, compared with 102 species (54 cryptogams, 25 herbaceous, 23 woody) in the uncut forest. Species richness and abundance of cryptogam, herbaceous and woody plant species increased with time after MSP, except for herbaceous species richness. MSP treatment significantly influenced species richness of cryptogams, herbaceous and woody plants, and abundance (percent cover) of woody plants. Treatment differences in richness and abundance were strongly correlated with intensity of forest floor disturbance. Scalping treatments that created the most mineral soil exposure and removed the most downed woody material typically supported the lowest species diversity and lacked several native forest species. Cryptogams were most affected by MSP, with higher richness and abundance where forest floor disturbance was relatively low. MSP did not affect the incidence of alien plant species: only two alien species were observed on the study site, representing less than 1% of total cover. Evaluation of MSP effects on early successional plant communities based on beta diversity in an ordination analysis revealed several distinct species groups associated with specific treatments. The relative amount of forest floor disturbance and downed woody material among treatments were strong predictors of species groupings within the ordination. Plant communities in slash piles were distinct from those resulting from MSP and contained several remnant forest species. Examination of species' autecology provided supporting evidence that the displacement of downed woody material and forest floor organic layers was the leading cause of changes in species richness and abundance on this site.

We assessed bryophyte species richness in these novel forests and sought correlations with geological substrate, past land use, forest edge and patch area, forest structure, elevation, microhabitat diversity, tree species richness, and microclimatic conditions. Transects were established (edge and forest interior) in nine moist forest patches dominated by Spathodea in north-central Puerto Rico. These Spathodea forest patches ranged from 0.6 to 9 ha. ANOVA, Chi-square, correlation, and cluster analyses were used in data analyses. We found 57 bryophyte species. There was a significant difference in bryophyte richness among patches. Those on karst exhibited highest bryophyte richness due to microhabitat diversity, past land use, and shorter hydroperiods. Alluvial sites scored lowest in bryophyte species richness, and forest structure was important for bryophyte communities on these sites. Significant differences in temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity were observed between edge and forest interior. These appeared important for establishing bryophyte species cover but not richness and composition. Microhabitat diversity, patch area, and forest age were more related to bryophyte species richness than elevation, exposed edge, and tree species richness, regardless of geologic substrate. Collectively, Spathodea patches were similar to mature forests on the Island with respect to bryophyte species richness and composition. Novel Spathodea forests have conservation value due to their habitat suitability for bryophyte communities.","WOS:000310729200007",545,0.916181427,0
"547","taiga","Effects of landscape design of forest reserves on Saproxylic beetle diversity","Increasing the density of natural reserves in the forest landscape may provide conservation benefits for biodiversity within and beyond reserve borders. We used 2 French data sets on saproxylic beetles and landscape cover of forest reserves (LCFR) to test this hypothesis: national standardized data derived from 252 assessment plots in managed and reserve stands in 9 lowland and 5 highland forests and data from the lowland Rambouillet forest, a forested landscape where a pioneer conservation policy led to creation of a dense network of reserves. Abundance of rare and common saproxylic species and total saproxylic species richness were higher in forest reserves than in adjacent managed stands only in highland forests. In the lowland regional case study, as LCFR increased total species richness and common species abundance in reserves increased. In this case study, when there were two or more reserve patches, rare species abundance inside reserves was higher and common species richness in managed stands was higher than when there was a single large reserve. Spillover and habitat amount affected ecological processes underlying these landscape reserve effects. When LCFR positively affected species richness and abundance in reserves or managed stands, >12-20% reserve cover led to the highest species diversity and abundance. This result is consistent with the target of 17% forested land area in reserves set at the Nagoya biodiversity summit in 2010. Therefore, to preserve biodiversity we recommend at least doubling the current proportion of forest reserves in European forested landscapes.","WOS:000368938000011",547,0.916850697,1
"578","taiga","Effects of forest management on ground-dwelling beetles (Coleoptera; Carabidae, Staphylinidae) in Central Europe are mainly mediated by changes in forest structure","Forest management is known to influence species diversity of various taxa but inconsistent or even contrasting effects are reported for arthropods. Regional differences in management as well as differences in regional species pools might be responsible for these inconsistencies, but, inter-regional replicated studies that account for regional variability are rare. We investigated the effect of forest type on the abundance, diversity, community structure and composition of two important ground-dwelling beetle families, Carabidae and Staphylinidae, in 149 forest stands distributed over three regions in Germany. In particular we focused on recent forestry history, stand age and dominant tree species, in addition to a number of environmental descriptors. Overall management effects on beetle communities were small and mainly mediated by structural habitat parameters such as the cover of forest canopy or the plant diversity on forest stands. The general response of both beetle taxa to forest management was similar in all regions: abundance and species richness of beetles was higher in older than in younger stands and species richness was lower in unmanaged than in managed stands. The abundance ratio of forest species-to-open habitat species differed between regions, but generally increased from young to old stands, from coniferous to deciduous stands and from managed to unmanaged stands. The response of both beetle families to dominant tree species was variable among regions and staphylinid richness varied in the response to recent forestry history. Our results suggest that current forest management practices change the composition of ground-dwelling beetle communities mainly by favoring generalists and open habitat species. To protect important forest beetle communities and thus the ecosystem functions and services provided by them, we suggest to shelter remaining ancient forests and to develop near-to-nature management strategies by prolonging rotation periods and increasing structural diversity of managed forests. Possible geographic variations in the response of beetle communities need to be considered in conservation-orientated forest management strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"604","taiga","Effects of forest composition and structure on bird species richness in a Mediterranean context: Implications for forest ecosystem management","There is a growing need to manage forest ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on which forest characteristics have a greater influence on biological diversity, particularly in Mediterranean forests. To provide further insights in this respect, we analyzed how different characteristics related to forest composition and structure (forest area, canopy cover, canopy cover diversity, development stage, development stage diversity, coniferous species percentage, tree species diversity, and mono-specific forest percentage) influence the richness of forest breeding bird species (considering 22 specialist and 31 generalist species) in a large dataset comprising 2923 UTM I km x I km cells in Catalonia (NE Spain). Bird species richness was estimated through presence/absence data obtained from surveys conducted within the framework of the Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1999-2002). Forest characteristics were obtained from the Spanish Forest Map (scale 1:50,000), which was developed within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. Best regression models for forest specialists accounted for up to 53% of the variability in species richness, while models for generalist and total species richness accounted for 34% and 49% of total variability, respectively. Species richness was favoured by more developed forest stages and by tree species diversity, but very dense, closed forest canopies (> 70%) decreased species richness for both groups. For specialist species richness the percentage of coniferous forest cover had a slightly negative influence, while generalists were favoured by more diverse canopy closure. We discuss the implications of these results for Mediterranean forest management considering the current situation of Catalan forests. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"615","taiga","Landscape-scale disturbances and changes in bird communities of boreal mixed-wood forests","Bird community response to both landscape-scale and local (forest types) changes in forest cover was studied in three boreal mixed-wood forest landscapes modified by different types of disturbances: (1) a pre-industrial landscape where human settlement, agriculture, and logging activities date back to the early 1930s, (2) an industrial timber managed forest, and (3) a forest dominated by natural disturbances. Birds were sampled at 459 sampling stations distributed among the three landscapes. Local habitat and landscape characteristics of the context surrounding each sampling station (500-m and 1-km radius) were also computed. Bird communities were influenced by landscape-scale changes in forest cover. The higher proportion of early-successional habitats in both human-disturbed landscapes resulted in significantly higher abundance of early-successional bird species and generalists. The mean number of mature forest bird species was significantly lower in the industrial and pre-industrial landscapes than in the natural landscape. Landscape-scale conversion of mature forests from mixed-wood to deciduous cover in human-disturbed landscapes was the main cause of changes in mature forest bird communities. In these landscapes, the abundance of species associated with mixed and coniferous forest cover was lower, whereas species that preferred a deciduous cover were more abundant. Variation in bird community composition determined by the landscape context was as important as local habitat conditions, suggesting that predictions on the regional impact of forest management on songbirds with models solely based on local scale factors could be misleading. Patterns of bird species composition were related to several landscape composition variables (proportions of forest types), but not to configuration variables (e.g., interior habitat, amount of edge). Overall, our results indicated that the large-scale conversion of the southern portion of the boreal forest from a mined to a deciduous cover may be one of the most important threats to the integrity of bird communities in these forest mosaics. Negative effects of changes in bird communities could be attenuated if current forestry practices are modified toward maintaining forest types (deciduous, mixed-wood, and coniferous) at levels similar to those observed under natural disturbances.","WOS:000088529100004",615,0.95174587,1
"716","taiga","Local and landscape-scale forest attributes differ in their impact on bird assemblages across years in forest production landscapes","Forest management practices and forest fragmentation are commonly recognised as factors influencing species distribution and diversity, but it remains largely unknown how species turnover and fluctuations across years might affect generalisations from short-term predictions. There is also much uncertainty about how compositional heterogeneity within forests, through their partitioning into differently managed stands, influences species occurrence and diversity. We aimed to investigate bird species richness in different forest stands in a heterogeneous landscape and asked whether short-term studies commonly used are sufficient to describe diversity habitat relationships. Breeding birds were monitored in 50 stands of differing forest types and management regimes in 2008 and 2009 in the heterogeneous forest production landscape of the Schwabische Alb in SW Germany. Based on a database of 25 and 21 species observed in 2008 and 2009, respectively, we estimated local species richness and species turnover with Bayesian hierarchical multi-species occupancy models to account for imperfect detection. A suite of forest attributes at stand level (from local field inventories) and landscape level, between 100 and 2000 in in extent, which were derived from forest management maps, were screened for their explanatory power regarding bird species richness. The most meaningful variables were included in a final set of models to account for effects of forest attributes on species occurrence and resulting gradients in species richness and turnover. Bird species richness in 2008 was mostly explained by stand composition heterogeneity over a distance of 800 m around sample locations, whereas in 2009 local stand features like stand succession type and stand age mostly explained species richness. Species turnover was significantly higher in young forest stands of thicket and pole-wood stages compared with old forest stands of timber stages. Variable multi-scale impacts of forest attributes on local species richness and turnover, together with year-to-year fluctuations in the regional species pool, emphasise that the relative importance of local versus landscape-scale factors in determining bird species richness may vary across years. Long-term and multiple-scale investigations that take structural and compositional forest heterogeneity into account are necessary for improved prediction of species habitat relationships.","WOS:000290502800001",716,0.937797783,1
"780","taiga","No difference in plant species diversity between protected and managed ravine forests","The influence of management practices on forest ecosystems is usually analyzed by a comparison of species composition and richness. Different types of management practices increase plant species richness, mainly due to an increase in the number of ruderal and open habitat species. So far, most of the studies have been performed in the forest types that were most common in the studied regions. In this study we focused on broadleaved ravine forests that are spatially limited to specific habitat conditions, including steep rocky slopes with skeletal soil and unstable ground. These forests are local biodiversity hotspots, and, due to limited accessibility, have been subject to only limited management practices, mainly removal of single trees. We collected a dataset of 215 plots sampled between 1991 and 2015 in both managed forests and protected areas. We used multivariate techniques to compare the differences in the overall species composition. In addition, we compared differences in diversity, structural and habitat indices to find any possible differences. There were no differences in both the plot level and accumulative species richness and diversity indices between protected and managed forests. In addition, a comparison of habitat conditions and different ecological groups, including ruderal and open habitat species, alien species and ancient forest indicator species also revealed no differences. The only significant differences between the protected and managed forests related to the evenness and shrub cover. We concluded that low intensity forest management in ravine forests resembles natural disturbances, which are characteristic of natural ravine forests. The species composing these communities are adapted to frequent natural disturbances and thus forest management did not influence significant habitat conditions. However, to fully understand the effect of these practices on biodiversity, a comparison of structural characteristics is needed.","WOS:000449137300057",780,0.919159476,1
"952","taiga","Biodiversity Differences between Managed and Unmanaged Forests: Meta-Analysis of Species Richness in Europe","Past and present pressures on forest resources have led to a drastic decrease in the surface area of unmanaged forests in Europe. Changes in forest structure, composition, and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species. The possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management (i.e., anthropogenic pressures related to direct forest resource use), however, have never been assessed at a pan-European scale. We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe. We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management. Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests. Species dependent on forest cover continuity, deadwood, and large trees (bryophytes, lichens, fungi, saproxylic beetles) and carabids were negatively affected by forest management. In contrast, vascular plant species were favored. The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns. The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity. Clearcut forests in which the composition of tree species changed had the strongest effect on species richness, but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes. Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others, but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations. Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests.","WOS:000273686700015",952,0.927226667,0

A total of 240 point-count locations, 120 in each of the managed and wilderness areas, were sampled three times across ten paired transects in 2010 and 2011. Transects were paired near lotic systems that cross each management type, with half of the points adjacent to (100 m) or distant (400 m) from the riparian corridor. Total number of individuals and species richness detected per count were higher within the unmanaged forest (F-1,(9) = 9.76, p = 0.01; F-1,F-9 = 11.17, p < 0.01) and forest adjacent to the riparian corridor (F-1,F-9 = 28.30, p < 0.001; F-1,F-9 = 42.12, p < 0.001). These results were negatively correlated with increased area of regenerating forests (mainly from logging) within the managed forest and positively correlated with tree species richness and over-story height of forest stands within the wilderness forest. Of 35 species analyzed individually, Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Least Flycatcher (Empidonax minimus), Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), Winter Wren (Troglodytes hiemalis), and Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris) were more common in the wilderness forest. Only the Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) were more common in the managed forest. Species associated with mature or mixed forests tended to be found in the wilderness area at higher densities, but most species associated with early-successional habitats did not differ between the managed and wilderness landscapes. Results suggest that forests with natural disturbance and succession regimes provide habitat for a higher density and richness of bird species. Responses by breeding birds were similar in both management types regarding distance from riparian areas. To adequately provide for effective conservation of the avian community, forested regions should include wilderness forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the ways in which management affects macrofungal and plant communities and diversity of mountain temperate forests still remain poorly understood. We performed a random sampling stratified by stand age and stand type on the sites of temperate montane fir-beech forests. Diversity of macrofungi and the vascular plant understorey in beech- and spruce-dominated managed stands was investigated and compared to primeval forests located in the PoA 3/4 ana Biosphere Reserve, Western Carpathians. Both the vascular plant and the macrofungal communities were altered by management, and the response of the macrofungal species (especially wood-inhabiting fungi) was more pronounced in terms of species composition change. Species turnover evaluation seems to be an important tool of forest natural status assessment, because alpha diversity did not change as much as species composition. Certain species of Carpathian primeval forests were confirmed as good indicators for natural forest change; others were proposed. Species pool and mean number of species per plot were the highest in unmanaged fir-beech forests, and species diversity significantly decreased in spruce plantations. The number of species decreased significantly due to the change of canopy tree species composition only in the macrofungal communities. As an outcome for forest management, we recommend keeping mixed forests involving all natural tree species and providing at least a minimal amount of dead wood necessary for wood-inhabiting organisms and leaving some area of unmanaged natural forests within complexes of managed stands.","WOS:000433533500004",988,0.91626221,1

High cover of forest in the landscape matrix has been shown to weaken the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on grassland butterflies. No studies have however focused on examining species-specific responses of grassland butterflies to forest. 2. The data from 3 years of butterfly monitoring in Southern Finland were used to test whether the amount of forest cover in the surrounding landscape affected the abundance of grassland butterfly species in semi-natural grasslands, field margins, and forest edges. 3. More than half of the studied species benefitted from high cover of forest. Species with the strongest preference for forested landscapes were Lycaena virgaureae, Argynnis adippe, Argynnis aglaja, and Boloria selene, which probably find suitable resources in herbaceous habitats at forest edges and clearings. 4. Several small-sized species were positively affected by surrounding forest cover in field margins but not in the other habitat types. Although field margins are suboptimal habitats for grassland butterflies, they provide important corridors for dispersal. High cover of forest in the landscape matrix may enhance butterfly dispersal along field margins by reducing windiness, which is likely to be most important for small-sized species with poor dispersal capacity. 5. The most abundant grassland species showed little or no preference for forested landscapes. 6. Our results suggest that high cover of forest enhances the persistence of most grassland butterflies, including declining species, in boreal agricultural landscapes.

"1077","taiga","Old rural parks support higher biodiversity than forest remnants","One of the main challenges in biodiversity conservation is to curb a further degradation and loss of high-quality habitats. In agricultural matrix landscapes, the detection of alternative habitats for habitat specialists may be a solution. Historic old parks or landscape gardens around manor houses and castles are cultural heritage of nobles, but their value in harbouring biodiversity is poorly acknowledged. Therefore we evaluated the potential of old rural parks to serve as a habitat for nemoral forest species. We recorded stand structure and the presence of forest biodiversity indicators in 74 closed-canopy stands of historic parks and compared them with 93 neighbouring mature forest remnants on ancient forest land. We estimated the importance of stand structure in relation to habitat type on biodiversity indicators. Finally we suggest single-value indicator-complexes for the cost-efficient assessment of the conservation value of forests and forest-like habitats. Park stands outclassed reference forests in several individual structural characteristics, and in combined indicators of habitat quality and biodiversity. Forests had higher estimates for the combined indicator of dead wood, but large-diameter dead wood types were more abundant in parks. Woodpeckers, several old-growth indicator epiphytes and forest herbs had successfully become established in planted forest-like park fragments. Old rural parks resemble high-conservation-value forests more than the best preserved contemporary forest remnants. After the century needed to overcome immigration delay, old parks do provide a refugium for temperate deciduous forest species. Consequently, biodiversity-targeted management should retain and enhance old-growth attributes in forests and on the peripheries of parks: e.g. preserving old trees to provide service for epiphytes, hollow trees and an understorey mosaic for birds and bats; dead wood elements for saproxylic insects and fungi; limited mowing frequency and increased cutting height for forest herbs. Forestry should enhance the recovery of mixed deciduous stands and avoid conifer plantations.","WOS:000317352100008",1077,0.920520771,1

Sites included a chronosequence of stands from 1 to 27 years post-harvest, and four types of mature forest that had not been disturbed by fire for at least 80 years. In all, 19 sites were sampled between 1989 and 1991. A total of 98 species were identified, nine of which are reported for the first time in Alberta. Staphylinids were more abundant in mature forest stands but assemblages were more diverse in regenerating stands. Thirty-four rove beetle species showed significant indicator value for particular stands or groups of stands, including mature forest, young forest, and open ground specialists. After harvesting, the catch rate of many forest species decreased dramatically, and open ground species were more commonly collected. Populations of some forest species remained active on logged sites for one or 2 years before disappearing. As stands regenerated, they were colonized by species characteristic of young stands, but true forest species were found only in older unharvested stands. The beetle assemblages from regenerating stands became more similar to those from mature stands as they aged, but still differed considerably from them 27 years after harvesting. Transects across forest-clearcut edges revealed a significant beetle response to habitat edges. Staphylinids assemblages were compared to the ground beetle (Carabidae) assemblage sampled via the same pitfall trapping regime. Mature forest specialists are threatened by fragmentation and loss of habitat. In order to conserve these beetle assemblages, forest managers should retain adequate patches of older successional stages on working landscapes. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted three-visit breeding bird surveys in a total of 37 study squares of 1 km(2), and used National Forest Inventory data to evaluate habitat associations of birds linked with old forests in three geographical regions: southern, eastern and northern Finland. All study squares were located within managed forests. Out of the total of 23 pre-selected old-forest species, 12 were recorded in the study squares of all three study regions; the number of species varied between 16 and 21 among the regions. The total abundance did not significantly vary among the regions, but the abundances of many single species varied significantly among the regions. Forest-patch size was the single most important factor, positively affecting the abundance of most of the species considered. Development class affected most species in the south and east, and species associated with mature and old forest stands in general. Tree height and stand age were included into the models more often than tree species and diameter. In general, forest patch size, developmental class, age and tree height were among the most important factors in explaining the abundance of old-forest bird species in commercially-used forests. These stand characteristics appeared particularly important for resident species and cavity nesters. Our results indicate that the responses of old-forest bird species to environmental variation in managed, forested landscapes are individualistic, and different factors may affect them in different regions. Variables included in the patch-level forest-inventory data well explained abundance variation of species associated with old forests. Our results underscore the importance of integrating national forest-inventory and bird-survey data to obtain information about species habitat requirements and forest-sector related information about the effects of forestry on birds.","WOS:000291964800001",1790,0.916757658,1
"120","tempbroad1","Land use types influenced avian assemblage structure in a forest-agriculture landscape in Ghana","The conservation of biodiversity within tropical forest regions does not lie only in the maintenance of natural forest areas, but on conservation strategies directed toward agricultural land types within which they are embedded. This study investigated variations in bird assemblages of different functional groups of forest-dependent birds in three agricultural land types, relative to distance from the interior of 34 tropical forest patches of varying sizes. Point counts were used to sample birds at each study site visited. Data from counts were used to estimate species richness, species evenness, and Simpson's diversity of birds. Mean species richness, evenness, and diversity were modeled as responses and as a function of agricultural land type, distance from the forest interior and three site-scale vegetation covariates (density of large trees, fruiting trees, and patch size) using generalized linear mixed-effect models. Mean observed species richness of birds varied significantly within habitat types. Mean observed species richness was highest in forest interior sites while sites located in farm centers recorded the lowest mean species richness. Species richness of forest specialists was strongly influenced by the type of agricultural land use. Fallow lands, density of large trees, and patch size strongly positively influenced forest specialists. Insectivorous and frugivorous birds were more species-rich in fallow lands while monoculture plantations favored nectarivorous birds. Our results suggest that poor agricultural practices can lead to population declines of forest-dependent birds particularly specialist species. Conservation actions should include proper land use management that ensures heterogeneity through retention of native tree species on farms in tropical forest-agriculture landscapes.","WOS:000414873600002",2389,0.961529576,1
"213","tempbroad1","Land use and conservation value for forest birds in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia)","Unprecedented deforestation is currently underway in Southeast Asia. Since this trend is likely to continue, it is critical to determine the value of human-modified habitats (e.g., mixed-rural habitat) for conserving the regional native forest avifauna. The impacts of ongoing deforestation on the highly endemic avifauna (33%) of Sulawesi (Indonesia) are poorly understood. We sampled birds in primary and secondary forests in the Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi, as well as the surrounding plantation and mixed-rural habitats. Species richness, species density and population density of forest birds showed a consistent decreasing trend in the following order: primary forests > secondary forests > mixed-rural habitat > plantations. Although primary forests contained the highest proportion (85%) of a total of 34 forest species recorded from our point count surveys, 40-yr old secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat showed high conservation potential, containing 82% and 76% of the forest species, respectively. Plantations recorded only 32% of the forest bird species. Fifteen forest species had the highest abundance in primary forests, while two species had higher abundance outside primary forests. Our simulations revealed that all forest birds that were sensitive to native tree cover could be found in areas with at least 20% continuous native tree cover. Our study shows that although primary forests have the highest conservation value for forest avifauna, the potential of degraded habitats, such as secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat, for conserving forest species can be enhanced with appropriate land use and management decisions.

"313","tempbroad1","Landscape-scale disturbances and changes in bird communities of boreal mixed-wood forests","Bird community response to both landscape-scale and local (forest types) changes in forest cover was studied in three boreal mixed-wood forest landscapes modified by different types of disturbances: (1) a pre-industrial landscape where human settlement, agriculture, and logging activities date back to the early 1930s, (2) an industrial timber managed forest, and (3) a forest dominated by natural disturbances. Birds were sampled at 459 sampling stations distributed among the three landscapes. Local habitat and landscape characteristics of the context surrounding each sampling station (500-m and 1-km radius) were also computed. Bird communities were influenced by landscape-scale changes in forest cover. The higher proportion of early-successional habitats in both human-disturbed landscapes resulted in significantly higher abundance of early-successional bird species and generalists. The mean number of mature forest bird species was significantly lower in the industrial and pre-industrial landscapes than in the natural landscape. Landscape-scale conversion of mature forests from mixed-wood to deciduous cover in human-disturbed landscapes was the main cause of changes in mature forest bird communities. In these landscapes, the abundance of species associated with mixed and coniferous forest cover was lower, whereas species that preferred a deciduous cover were more abundant. Variation in bird community composition determined by the landscape context was as important as local habitat conditions, suggesting that predictions on the regional impact of forest management on songbirds with models solely based on local scale factors could be misleading. Patterns of bird species composition were related to several landscape composition variables (proportions of forest types), but not to configuration variables (e.g., interior habitat, amount of edge). Overall, our results indicated that the large-scale conversion of the southern portion of the boreal forest from a mined to a deciduous cover may be one of the most important threats to the integrity of bird communities in these forest mosaics. Negative effects of changes in bird communities could be attenuated if current forestry practices are modified toward maintaining forest types (deciduous, mixed-wood, and coniferous) at levels similar to those observed under natural disturbances.","WOS:000088529100004",138,0.95174587,1

To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.","WOS:000327080000003",1079,0.948134774,1
"69","tempbroad1","Effects of surrounding landscape composition on the conservation value of native and exotic habitats for native forest birds","The contribution of different production land uses to the conservation of native forest birds in modified, fragmented landscapes is a question of increasing relevance worldwide. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the abundance of native forest birds increases with increasing area of exotic plantation forests surrounding native forest remnants due to a reduction of negative effects of forest fragmentation and the provision of additional habitat. Conversely, farmland was not expected to provide such benefits to the same extent. Nine species of native birds were sampled in 238 plots in native forests, exotic plantation forests and mixed farmland on Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand, where these land cover types are highly interspersed in a variety of spatial configurations. Around each sampling plot we determined the cover of native forest, plantation forest and mixed farmland within seven buffer zones ranging in radius from 200 m to 3000 m, using the New Zealand Land Cover Database 2. In native forests, the abundance of all but one species was negatively correlated with the amount of farmland surrounding points whereas the opposite applied when points were surrounded by native forest. There was a variable effect for native forest surrounded by plantation forest. In exotic plantation forests and farmland, the abundance of most species was positively correlated with the amount of native forest surrounding points. By contrast, for most species there was a small or moderate negative correlation with surrounding plantation forest. In farmland plots, bird abundance was positively correlated with native forest cover whereas plantation forest and farmland cover negatively affected most species. These results suggest that exotic plantation forests may mitigate effects of forest fragmentation for some native forest birds but not for others, and this appeared to depend on the landscape context. The maintenance of native forest remnants and forest restoration across the landscape, including within production land areas are important for the long-term conservation of the New Zealand's forest avifauna.

"77","tempbroad1","Conservation value of degraded habitats for forest birds in southern Peninsular Malaysia","Clearance of tropical forest for agricultural purposes is generally assumed to seriously threaten the survival of forest species. In this study, we quantified the conservation value, for forest bird species, of three degraded habitat types in Peninsular Malaysia, namely rubber tree plantations, oil palm plantations, and open areas. We surveyed these degraded habitats using point counts to estimate their forest bird species richness and abundance. We assessed whether richness, abundance, and activities of different avian dietary groups (i.e. insectivores and frugivores) varied among the habitats. We identified the critical habitat elements that accounted for the distribution of forest avifauna in these degraded habitats. Our results showed that these habitats harboured a moderate fraction of forest avifauna (approximately 46-76 species) and their functions were complementary (i.e. rubber tree plantations for moving; open habitats for perching; shrubs in oil palm plantations for foraging). In terms of species richness and abundance, rubber tree plantations were more important than oil palm plantations and open habitats. The relatively high species richness of this agricultural landscape was partly due to the contiguity of our study areas with extensive forest areas. Forecasts of forest-species presence under various canopy cover scenarios suggest that leaving isolated trees among non-arboreal crops could greatly attract relatively tolerant species that require tree canopy. The conservation value of degraded habitats in agricultural landscapes seems to depend on factors such as the type of crops planted and distance to primary forest remnants.","WOS:000239798200012",143,0.940371146,1
"89","tempbroad1","Dung beetles as indicators of change in the forests of northern Borneo","1. We reviewed the use of dung beetles as indicators of environmental change, highlighting the influence of natural forest dynamics on species distributions in primary forest and suggesting new ways in which this can be used to understand and interpret the effects of disturbance such as logging. These ideas were applied to rainforest dung beetle communities in Sabah, Malaysia. 2. Dung beetle samples, using baited pitfall and flight intercept traps, were examined from primary, logged and plantation forests. Cluster analysis on dung beetle assemblages from primary forest samples showed clear species associations that had a high degree of fidelity to a particular biotope or vegetation type. Beetles were grouped into riverine-edge, riverine, interior-primary and 'even' (equitable distribution between biotopes) associations. Although biotope-specific associations were spatially separate in primary forest, these associations overlapped at forest margins (riverine forest) and in logged forest (to form 'composite assemblages'). 3. Species associations showed different responses to disturbance: the riverine association included many species that showed a positive response to at least some types of disturbance, whereas others were neutral or negative in response; the even association species were mostly neutral; the primary forest associations were almost entirely negative in response. 4. The greatest faunal similarities were found between logged forest and riverine assemblages. Diversity was lower in logged compared with primary forest, and the lowest species richness and diversity were recorded in plantation forest. Small-scale species richness in logged forest was generally higher than in individual transects from primary forest due to the presence of overlapping species ranges (composite assemblages) that were usually spatially separate in primary forest. Data suggested that increased species richness at a fine scale does not necessarily mean that species richness is greater at a larger scale, and that species mixing in derived ecosystems is dependent on the type of disturbance. Forest management should aim to minimize the mixing of the components of different biotopes, by implementing low impact (i.e. reduced-impact logging) harvesting techniques.","WOS:000169479900009",139,0.940350895,1

The invasive exotic tree species was introduced to the area in 1960s and planted as a pure plantation stand to assist in rehabilitating logged primary forest sites. By 1990s, the species had established in nearby secondary and plantation forest stands in which it was not planted. The study sought to determine how invasion of the exotic species had affected species diversity, species evenness and stand density in plantation and secondary forests within the rainforest. The study w'as carried out in nine forest types. namely: old-growth secondary forest, middle-aged secondary forest, young secondary forest, mixed indigenous plantation, Maesopsis, Cupressus, Pinus and Bischofia monoculture plantations, and disturbed primary forest. These forest types were nested as sub-blocks in three forest blocks. The results indicated that B. javanica was the only non-native woody species among several native woody species that recruited naturally in plantation and secondary forests. It did not grow in the disturbed primary forest. Its recruitment was significantly more aggressive than that of native species. It lowered species diversity but increased species evenness in all plantation and secondary forests. Its relative abundance was 30.6%, dominating the seedling, sapling and tree densities of plantation and secondary forests. It is necessary to remove the tree species from the rainforest before it takes over the whole forest ecosystem.","WOS:000440208900012",2146,0.939626823,1
"108","tempbroad1","Dynamics of avian species and functional diversity in secondary tropical forests","Deforestation for agriculture in the tropics, followed by abandonment, has resulted in large areas of secondary forest. Some authors have suggested that this secondary regrowth could help prevent mass extinction in the tropics by providing habitat for forest species. However, there is little generalised understanding of the biodiversity value of secondary forest. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an analysis of avian responses to secondary forest succession, comparing data from 44 tropical secondary forest sites with nearby primary forest sites and investigating both species and functional diversity based metrics. Total species richness in secondary forests was 12% lower than in primary forests and was not related to secondary forest age. In contrast, forest specialist species richness increased with time since disturbance, reaching 99% of primary forest values after 100 years. In terms of functional diversity, functional dispersion (FDis) and functional divergence (FDiv) were similar in primary and secondary forests. However, functional evenness (FEve) was 5% higher in secondary than in primary forests. The standardized effect size of functional diversity (sesFD) was higher in young secondary forests than primary forests and declined with time since disturbance. Overall, these results suggest that secondary tropical forests can support provision of ecosystem services but that these services may be less stable in young forests. Therefore, secondary tropical forests, particularly older regrowth, have biodiversity value and can support important ecosystem functions. These secondary forests should be protected from further disturbance but preserving primary forest is vital for supporting overall and forest specialist species richness.","WOS:000404809900001",898,0.937918398,1

A comparative analysis of private, local and central government forest reserves in central Uganda","This paper investigated the influence of forest tenure on vegetation characteristics for selected forests under private, District Forestry Services of local governments and National Forestry Authority in central Uganda. Two hundred and twelve plant species in 65 families and 168 genera were recorded. The family Moracette was the most species rich in Central Forest Reserves (CFRs), while Euphorbiaceae were the most species rich in private forests and Local Forest Reserves (LFRs), respectively. There were 174 species in CFRs, 144 species in LFRs and 112 species in private forests. Our findings indicated a remarkable shift in floristic composition among the studied forests from Albizia-Piptadeniastrum-Celtis species primary dominance by 1964 report to current secondary and colonising species of Trilepisium-madagascariensis-Funtumia africana-Pseudospondias macrocarpa and Macaranga schweinfurthii. Diversity measured by two indices, i.e., the Shannon diversity and evenness for the different growth forms differed significantly among the forest ownership categories. The CFRs were the most diverse for the trees, while the private forests were the most diverse for the ground flora species. Plant species richness also expressed by the two indices: Species density and Margalef's diversity index followed the same trend, with CFRs being the most species rich for the trees, followed by the private forests and LFRs. The population structure characteristics i.e. stem densities, mean DBH and basal area of saplings and trees were higher in private forests than CFRs and LFRs. Diameter size for all species combined followed the inverse J-shape, typical of mixed-age stands. LFRs and CFRs were highly affected by human disturbances which may be an indicator that government agencies are not as much in control as private forest owners. We found that the composition and distribution of species in the Mpigi forests is complex because it is influenced by two conflicting factors i.e. ecological stability versus human disturbances. We conclude that human activities influenced by forest tenure reduced plant species diversity and composition at different sites; confirming the argument by common property theorists that open access resources are not compatible with biodiversity conservations. There is thus a need for forest managers to regulate human activities for effective conservation of forests.","WOS:000287635100002",2032,0.937707778,1
"126","tempbroad1","High value of short rotation coppice plantations for phytodiversity in rural landscapes","The demand for wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations as a renewable energy source is currently increasing and could affect biodiversity in agricultural areas. The objective was to evaluate the contribution of SRC plantations to phytodiversity in agricultural landscapes assessed as species richness, speciesarea relationships, Shannon indices, detrended correspondence analysis on species composition, Sorensen similarities, habitat preference proportions, and species proportions found in only one land use. Vegetation surveys were conducted on 12 willow (Salix spp.) and three poplar (Populus spp.) coppice sites as well as on surrounding arable lands, grasslands and forests in central Sweden and northern Germany. SRC plantations were richer in plant species (mean: 30 species per 100 m(2)) than arable land (10), coniferous forests (13) and mixed forests in Germany (12). Comparing SRC plantations with other land uses, we found lowest similarities in species composition with arable lands, coniferous forests and German mixed forests and highest similarities with marginal grassland strips, grasslands and Swedish mixed forests. Similarity depended on the SRC tree cover: at increased tree cover, SRC plantations became less similar to grasslands but more similar to forests. The SRC plantations were composed of a mixture of grassland (33%), ruderal (24%) and woodland (15%) species. Species abundance in SRC plantations was more heterogeneous than in arable lands. We conclude that SRC plantations form novel habitats leading to different plant species composition compared to conventional land uses. Their landscape-scale value for phytodiversity changes depending on harvest cycles and over time. As a structural landscape element, SRC plantations contribute positively to phytodiversity in rural areas, especially in land use mosaics where these plantations are admixed to other land uses with dissimilar plant species composition such as arable land, coniferous forest and, at the German sites, also mixed forest.","WOS:000309450100014",403,0.936349012,1
"137","tempbroad1","Tree species diversity relative to human land uses in tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi","The large-scale exploitation and conversion of tropical forests causes growing concern about the continued existence of the rich biodiversity of these forests. In the framework of the interdisciplinary STORMA project in Lore Lindu National Park area in Central Sulawesi, we studied tree diversity in six different land use types in the margins of submontane rain forest: undisturbed forest, forest with rattan extraction, selectively logged forest, cacao forest gardens, cacao plantations with mixed canopy of planted trees, and cacao plantations with a monospecific canopy. By analyzing such a finely subdivided use gradient it was attempted to answer the question how human usage and biodiversity conservation in the study area may be reconciled. Tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were sampled in 24 plots of 0.25 ha in all six land use types (4 replicates each). In total, 251 tree species (143 genera, 59 families) were recorded. Number of tree species per 0.25 ha was 51-63 in primary forest and gradually decreased towards the studied cacao systems. However, when native and cultivated tree species were considered separately, significant differences were detected among plantation types in terms of tree diversity. Tree endemism in forest plots totalled ca. 15% and was in good accordance with endemism in woody plants of Sulawesi. The number of endemic species was strongly reduced in cacao systems, although percentage endemism did not decline significantly in cacao forest gardens. Roughly one third of tree species in the forest plots were of economic importance as commercial timber trees; timber diversity was little affected by moderate human use of the forest but was significantly reduced in cacao forest gardens and dropped to near zero in other plantation types. The mean basal area of 57 m(2) (36-80 m(2)) per ha in natural forest was lower than the previously recorded value from the study area but is still almost double as high as the mean value typical for tropical lowland forests in Southeast Asia. The results of this study support the notion that tree diversity in the sub-montane forests of Central Sulawesi is unusually high and rich in large-sized timber trees, although tree size varies locally. Moderate human use of the forest ecosystems does not significantly affect tree diversity. We conclude that conservation of tropical tree diversity is compatible with human exploitation of tropical forest as long as a canopy of native trees is maintained. Future conservation policies in rain forest margin areas should therefore focus on developing measures aimed at sustainable use of the natural resources. Promotion of such activities may help to stabilize tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi.","WOS:000248525000016",932,0.936242721,1

Although intact primary forests harbor many Himalayan birds during breeding, a large number of bird species use agricultural lands during winter. We assessed how Himalayan bird species richness, abundance, and composition during winter are affected by forest loss stemming from agriculture and grazing. Bird surveys along 12 elevational transects within primary forest, low-intensity agriculture, mixed subsistence agriculture, and intensively grazed pastures in winter revealed that bird species richness and abundance were greatest in low-intensity and mixed agriculture, intermediate in grazed pastures, and lowest in primary forest at both local and landscape scales; over twice as many species and individuals were recorded in low-intensity agriculture than in primary forest. Bird communities in primary forests were distinct from those in all other land-use classes, but only 4 species were unique to primary forests. Low-, medium-, and high-intensity agriculture harbored 32 unique species. Of the species observed in primary forest, 80% had equal or greater abundance in low-intensity agricultural lands, underscoring the value of these lands in retaining diverse community assemblages at high densities in winter. Among disturbed landscapes, bird species richness and abundance declined as land-use intensity increased, especially in high-intensity pastures. Our results suggest that agricultural landscapes are important for most Himalayan bird species in winter. But agricultural intensificationespecially increased grazingwill likely result in biodiversity losses. Given that forest reserves alone may inadequately conserve Himalayan birds in winter, comprehensive conservation strategies in the region must go beyond protecting intact primary forests and ensure that low-intensity agricultural lands are not extensively converted to high-intensity pastures.","WOS:000395713800018",365,0.9350046,1

Far less is understood about how more-common species, that are less dependent on interior forests, use both forested and non-forested habitat in fragmented landscapes. Using both behavioral observations and radio-tracking relocation data, I quantified the within-territory use of different land cover types for three tropical songbird species, the dusky antbird (Cercomacra tyrannina), red-throated ant-tanager (Habia fuscicauda), and cocoa woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus susurrans). Small forest fragments (<50 ha) were also surveyed for these same species. Territories of all three species were mostly forest (>75%), with different amounts of non-forested land cover. As predicted, all three species had increased use in forest cover and decreased use where neighboring territories overlapped. In addition all three species had higher use of areas where there were more forest gaps and/or 'soft edges' in the vicinity. Dusky antbirds were less likely to use monocultures of non-native grass and impervious surfaces, while the other two species had mixed responses to non-forested habitats. Dusky antbirds and cocoa woodcreepers were observed foraging at higher-than-expected frequencies along 'hard edges' of forested habitat. All three species were found in forest fragments even smaller than a minimal home range area estimate. Conservation of more-common bird species in fragmented landscapes can include secondary forests and small remnants but for these three species non-forested land cover alone would not be expected to provide breeding habitat.

Local vs. landscape factors predicting species richness and composition of land molluscs in Swedish conservation forests","Aim To investigate the relative role of local versus landscape factors for local species diversity of snails and slugs in conservation forests. In landscapes with small, isolated patches of semi-natural habitats, many species that require large habitat areas have disappeared or are threatened. We asked whether small sedentary taxa that depend on local conditions, such as molluscs, are affected if total habitat area decreases in the landscape. Location Temperate broadleaved and oak-rich forest in southern Sweden. Methods We sampled molluscs in 25 small conservation forests that are well-spaced out over a large region. In each forest, sampling was conducted in two plots, each of 1 ha, separated by about 25-100 m. Factors potentially influencing local diversity of molluscs were measured in the plots and in the surrounding landscape at different scales (in space and time) and were analysed by stepwise multiple regression and ordination (PCA and NMS). Results We recorded 53 species, and mean species richness per forest (plots pooled) was 22.6. The pH of the plant litter predicted both species richness and composition; other local (plot) factors of lower importance were canopy openness, stony ground and tree species. The area of conservation forest (woodland key habitat) within 10 km of plots was positively associated with species richness, and was also related to species composition. Openness of the landscape (agriculture) was a negative factor, but historical plot openness (1938-59) seemed to be unimportant. In addition, climate/topography (temperature and altitude) also predicted species composition of the sites. Main conclusions We rejected the hypothesis that microhabitat factors alone, or mainly, determine local species richness and composition of land molluscs. These representatives of small, sedentary organisms seem to be substantially influenced by the surrounding landscape, which should be considered in conservation work and in plans for the protection of forest biodiversity.","WOS:000255714800008",250,0.933824019,1

Here we evaluate the long-term effects of selective logging and forest multiple-use on Southern Brazilian subtropical Araucaria mixed conifer-hardwood forest resilience at the landscape-scale. Long-term effects of different management regimes were compared between control undisturbed forests and forest stands subjected to early (55 years before this study) and recent (13 years) selective logging followed by undisturbed postharvest periods, and forest fragments subjected to selective logging followed by unregulated multiple-use by private landowners. Forest structure (tree density, basal area and height, and regeneration density) in early-logged areas was indistinguishable from control areas. Fragmentation and chronic disturbance, however, degraded forest fragments and kept them at early successional stages, with higher tree density, reduced basal area and scarce or absent regeneration. Mixed forests showed compositional resilience in the angiosperm component but not in the conifer component. Chronic disturbance kept forest fragments floristically away from mature and undisturbed secondary forests. Species richness in control and recently-logged plots did not differ significantly and was higher than richness in early-logged plots. Species richness was much reduced in degraded forest fragments. Density of the conifer Araucaria angustifolia, characteristic of the mature forest, was reduced in the fragments and in logged stands. We discuss how native forest management practices can be implemented to contribute positively to the conservation of the Araucaria mixed forest biodiversity.","WOS:000305228400004",232,0.932809366,1
"186","tempbroad1","Bird assemblages in a mixed woodland-farmland landscape: The conservation value of silviculture-dependant open areas in plantation forest","Although considered by some as a less ""ecologically suitable"" forestry model than ""near-natural"" stand management, even-aged plantation forest management, with regeneration procedure involving clearcutting, creates temporary habitat for many early-successional birds. The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a ""conservation value index"", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities.

Collembola reacted not only to changes in the diversity of the landscape, but also to the composition of that diversity and the area occupied by each land-use type at each LUU. Although species richness patterns were not concordant among the different countries, the total number of species per LUU (landscape richness) was generally higher in natural forests and mixed-used landscapes, and lower in agricultural dominated landscapes. Moreover, high richness and diversity of Collembola at each LUU were associated with a diverse landscape structure, both in terms of number of patches and patch richness. Despite this comparable species richness between mixed-use landscapes and those dominated by natural forests, average species richness on forested areas (local richness) decreased along the gradient, showing that forest patches on mixed-use landscapes support a lower richness than in landscapes dominated by forest. This aspect is important when addressing the role of native forests in structuring biodiversity in disturbed and fragmented landscapes. Although a diverse Landscape can support a high biodiversity, the results suggest that intensive fragmentation should be avoided with the risk of collapsing local species richness with the consequent result for regional biodiversity.

"204","tempbroad1","Effects of forest height and vertical complexity on abundance and biodiversity of bats in Amazonia","Anthropogenic activities have accelerated habitat change, loss, and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity over large portions of the tropics. The resulting anthropogenically created landscape mosaics often include forests of different successional stages or that have experienced different levels of anthropogenic use, which affect the physical structure of the forest (e.g., forest height, vertical complexity of vegetation). These physical characteristics of forests may affect the abundance and biodiversity of forest inhabitants, and obscure effects of landscape changes (e.g., percent forest cover) on animal species. Because bats are ecologically diverse and include seed dispersers, pollinators, and top predators, they contribute to the structure and function of forests, and directly affect forest integrity and regeneration. Thus, understanding how variation in the vegetative structure of forests affects the abundance and biodiversity of bats may provide important information to effectively manage and conserve forest fragments. We surveyed bats at 24 sites in the southern Brazilian Amazon, and quantified vegetation structure (density, height, and basal area of trees, density of understory, and canopy openness). Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we tested simple relationships of each structural characteristic with community- (taxonomic and phylogenetic dimensions of biodiversity), guild-, and population-level attributes of bats. Models for total abundance, taxonomic biodiversity (species diversity and dominance), and phylogenetic diversity were significant, increasing with tree height and basal area, and decreasing with canopy openness. At the population level, abundances of frugivores (Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Artibeus planirostris, A. obscurus, A. lituratus, Uroderma bilobatum) and nectarivores (Lonchopylla thomasi, Glossophaga soricina) were related significantly to vegetation structure. Abundances of some understory frugivores exhibited negative relationships with tree height, choosing younger forests, whereas abundances of canopy frugivores were highest in closed canopy forests. Of the nectarivores, L. thomasi was more abundant in older forests (negative relationship with density of trees), whereas G. soricina was more abundant in areas with low canopies and low basal area (i.e., earlier successional forest). Consequently, effective management of forest fragments should include consideration of local forest age and vegetation structure, as well as forest connectivity and patch size. In general, protecting areas with large trees and closed canopies enhances the persistence of pollinators and seed dispersers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"215","tempbroad1","Effects of forest management practices on the diversity of ground-occurring beetles in mixed northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region","Ground-occurring Coleoptera were sampled over 2 years using pitfall traps in 23 northern hardwood or eastern hemlock-dominated sites representing even-aged, uneven-aged, or old growth forests. Overall, 65,586 individuals were obtained, representing 33 families and 192 species. Carabids comprised 54% of the total catch in 1996, when all the families were tallied. There was little variation in the number and relative abundance of carabid species caught between seasons. No differences in overall species richness or abundance were observed among forest management regimes or habitat types. However, there were substantial differences in species composition. Thirteen species showed significant habitat associations among the five forest management regimes, and 21 species were associated with specific habitat features of the sites, such as dominant tree species or canopy structure. More species (16) were affected by the presence of forest management than by tree species dominance (6) or canopy structure (5). Halpalus fulvilabris, Pterostichus coracinus, Carabus nemoralis, Glischrochilus siepmanni, Nicrophorus orbicollis, and Nicrophorus sayi were more commonly caught in managed than in old growth forest sites, while Carabus sylvosus, Platynus decentis and Oiceoptoma novaboracensis were more commonly associated with old growth sites. Calosoma frigidum and Necrophila americana were associated with northern hardwood sites, while Platynus decentis was significantly associated with sites dominated by eastern hemlock. Calosoma frigidum,, Necrophila americana, and Nicrophorus vespilloides were more common in even-aged sites, while a lampyrid and a leiodid morphospecies were more common in sites with an uneven-aged canopy structure. The importance of microsite features was reflected in the high variability observed among sites and among traps within sites. Results indicate that conservation of a range of forest types is required in order to maintain the diversity of ground-occurring beetles on a regional scale. This will be quite challenging, since forest types such as old growth hemlock-hardwood are rare across the landscape due to habitat fragmentation and logging. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

"222","tempbroad1","Bird assemblages in secondary forests developing after slash-and-burn agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon","Although indigenous farmers and other traditional peoples have disturbed Amazonian forests for centuries, few studies investigate the effects of these disturbances on biodiversity. This short-term study investigates how bird assemblages are affected by agricultural practices adopted by the residents of a national park in the Brazilian Amazon. Twelve sites in secondary forest (four sites in three age categories) and 12 sites in primary forest were selected for bird sampling. Audio-visual censuses of birds were conducted in small plots (1 ha) of young secondary growth (4-5 y), middle-aged (7-15 y), and old (20-3 5 y) secondary forests. Each site in secondary forest had a corresponding control site in adjacent primary forest. Young secondary growth had fewer species than old secondary and primary forests. Bird species richness was similar in middle-aged, old secondary and primary forests. Bird communities of young secondary habitat were dominated by species normally found in open habitats, such as agricultural fields and igapo flooded forests. The bird species composition of young secondary growth was more similar to that of middle-aged forest, which in turn was more similar to that of old secondary forests. Bird species composition differed between young secondary growth and old secondary forests and primary forests and between middle-aged secondary and primary forests. Nectarivore/insectivores and frugivore/insectivores of monospecific flocks are significantly associated with secondary forests, especially in initial stages of forest regeneration. In contrast. specialized insectivorous birds that join mixed-flocks show a significant association with primary forest.","WOS:000248398700009",208,0.927356415,1
"232","tempbroad1","Avian communities of managed and wilderness hemiboreal forests","We compared breeding bird communities of hemiboreal forests in multiple-use managed forests and relatively unmanaged wilderness forests in northern Minnesota. A total of 240 point-count locations, 120 in each of the managed and wilderness areas, were sampled three times across ten paired transects in 2010 and 2011. Transects were paired near lotic systems that cross each management type, with half of the points adjacent to (100 m) or distant (400 m) from the riparian corridor. Total number of individuals and species richness detected per count were higher within the unmanaged forest (F-1,(9) = 9.76, p = 0.01; F-1,F-9 = 11.17, p < 0.01) and forest adjacent to the riparian corridor (F-1,F-9 = 28.30, p < 0.001; F-1,F-9 = 42.12, p < 0.001). These results were negatively correlated with increased area of regenerating forests (mainly from logging) within the managed forest and positively correlated with tree species richness and over-story height of forest stands within the wilderness forest. Of 35 species analyzed individually, Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Least Flycatcher (Empidonax minimus), Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), Winter Wren (Troglodytes hiemalis), and Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris) were more common in the wilderness forest. Only the Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) were more common in the managed forest. Species associated with mature or mixed forests tended to be found in the wilderness area at higher densities, but most species associated with early-successional habitats did not differ between the managed and wilderness landscapes. Results suggest that forests with natural disturbance and succession regimes provide habitat for a higher density and richness of bird species. Responses by breeding birds were similar in both management types regarding distance from riparian areas. To adequately provide for effective conservation of the avian community, forested regions should include wilderness forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the old-growth forests, species richness was explained by site productivity, amount and quality of coarse woody debris (CWD), and tree species composition. Many of the explaining variables, e.g., site productivity, volume of living timber and volume of CWD were intercorrelated. Beetle assemblages varied according to the site fertility and successional stage. The species compositions of non-saproxylic species were rather similar in the seed-tree-cut areas and in the old-growth pine forests, but the species composition of saproxylics differed between the two forest types. On the contrary, the species compositions of both saproxylics and non-saproxylics differed distinctly between the old-growth spruce forest and clear-cut sites. Species colonising recently died trees, soil-dwelling open-habitat species and some polypore-living cisids were more abundant in regeneration areas than in old-growth forests, whereas species of many other mycetophagous beetle fan-dlies were practically absent from the logged sites. Compared with old-growth forests, the proportion of nationally rare saproxylic species was high at the recently cut sites, but clearly lower at the old regeneration sites. This indicates that in the long run the changes in the amount and quality of CWD may have detrimental effects to rare saproxylic species in the regeneration areas.","WOS:000174479300009",13,0.879916499,1

In each of these forests, we placed pitfall traps in young, medium-aged and mature stands (3 stages). We evaluated the effect of treatment, tree species composition, silvicultural system, stage and habitat type (silvicultural system + stage) on indicators of community conservation value and ecological structure. The species composition and the ecological structure of carabid beetles of the managed stands were then compared to that of nine unmanaged stands (without tree exploitation). In the managed forests, species richness was highest in large young stands (3-10 years old) and in forests managed by even-aged systems (with large clear-cuts), mainly due to eurytopic and opportunist carabid species with high dispersal abilities. Oak and beech, uneven-aged, and mature stands were mainly inhabited by typical forest species, and even-aged conifer stands mainly by ubiquitous species. Several typical forest species recorded in unmanaged stands were lacking from the managed forests. Large scale clear-cutting allows open-habitat species to enter the forest, which increases the species richness at a landscape level but can disfavour typical forest species by competition. Long rotations should be implemented and more areas left unmanaged in Belgium, in order to help typical forest species to re-colonise managed forests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This study distinguishes the effects of clear-cutting, planting and thinning on species richness and community composition of polypore fungi. In 2008-2009, 181 forest compartments (ranging from naturally regenerated deciduous stands to planted Picea abies stands and 0-137 years post clear-cutting) were explored in a hemi-boreal landscape subjected to even-aged management. Altogether 104 polypore species were recorded. For species richness, time since clear-cutting was the most influential factor at both stand and landscape scales, followed by thinning. Clear-cuts had distinct polypore communities (including several red-listed species) whose species richness declined in time. Following 20 years post clear-cutting, species richness started to increase along different community-composition pathways determined by regeneration type. The communities developed after planting were moderately species rich at stand scale but homogeneous over larger areas. Thus, at landscape scale, mature unmanaged naturally regenerated stands hosted most species; thinning reduced species richness by approximately 15%, and among thinned stands, planted areas had a further 9-22% fewer species than naturally regenerated areas. In such variably managed landscape, silviculture appeared to create particularly distinct communities in young stands on nutrient-rich soils, which naturally provide polypores with a rich supply of small deciduous snags absent from stands artificially planted with P. abies and intensively thinned.","WOS:000294712600005",11,0.864007109,1
"178","tempbroad1","Understory vegetation and environment responses to tillage, forest harvesting, and conifer plantation development","Increasing demand to conserve biodiversity in managed forests necessitates better understanding of the impacts of forestry practices on the species-rich herbaceous layer. We compared composition and diversity of understory vegetation, environmental features, and stand structure of forests in New Brunswick, Canada, under four different management scenarios, including: young (24-66 yr) naturally regenerated forests and conifer plantations (19-64 yr) established after clear-cutting, mature (77-100 yr) naturally regenerated forests originating from natural disturbance (insect defoliation), and old-field plantations (31-77 yr) established on abandoned agricultural fields. The objectives were to determine how plant composition, forest structure, and microenvironment differed among stand types and which environmental or structural features were related to understory species. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP) indicated that stand types differed in species composition and environments. Plantations were significantly lower in density of snags, deciduous canopy cover, and leaf substrate, and higher in coniferous canopy cover and needle, twig, and moss substrates than the natural stands. Old-field plantations had less cover of pits and mounds than all other stand types. Mature natural stands contained the greatest amount of coarse woody debris (CWD) in all decay classes and snags >14 cm diameter, and the lowest density of trees >5 cm diameter and moss cover. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that species in both natural stand types are associated with decayed CWD, deciduous cover, and leaf substrate. Species in cutover plantations were associated with coniferous cover and needle substrate. Species composition in old-field plantations Was distinct, with the lowest species richness and diversity of all stand types. We present a conceptual model illustrating the initial direct effects of previous land use and harvesting or postharvest treatments and the subsequent indirect effects associated with plantation or natural stand development on environmental features and understory vegetation. We recommend extending plantation harvest cycles to facilitate reestablishment and expansion of plant populations and maintaining diverse tree canopy composition, coarse woody debris, and pit and mound topography to sustain critical habitat for vascular understory plant species in managed forests.","WOS:000187616400015",12,0.860954526,1
"225","tempbroad1","Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. I. Diversity of stand structure","1. Variable retention harvests or 'green-tree retention systems' are important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone. Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological processes. 2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation) and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than in clear-cut sites. 3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. 4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m(2) ha(-1), with significantly higher levels on patch-cut (23.4 m(2) ha(-1)) and uncut forest (39.0 m(2) ha(-1)) sites. Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha(-1) on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites, to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha(-1) on the patch-cut and uncut forest sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m(3) ha(-1)) of fallen wood (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from 116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs, shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites. 5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among the other sites. 6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest. The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites. 7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance, species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4 years post-harvest.","WOS:000173050100006",9,0.84935233,1
"236","tempbroad1","Vegetation diversity and vertical structure as indicators of forest disturbance","Plant species composition and vertical structure of oak-mixed Atlantic woodlands differing on disturbance regime were studied in the Basque Country, northern Spain. Four different disturbance groups were considered depending on the time since last thinning and the presence/absence of grazers. Plant species cover varied among disturbance groups for 17 out of the total 47 species present in the study area. In general, disturbance by clear-cutting favoured the cover of Betula alba, Castanea sativa and Quercus robur. The shrub species most affected by disturbance were heathers. Among these, the most drastic effect was found for Calluna vulgaris, Daboecia cantabrica and Erica vagans which disappeared in those woodlands subjected to grazing. Several nemoral species, such as Vaccinium myrtillus, Blechnum spicant and Lamiastrum galeobdolon, were absent in these same grazed forests. By contrast, generalist species, such as Ruscus aculeatus, Geranium robertianum and Veronica officinalis, were mostly present in the grazed woodlands. Diversity was measured as Species Richness as well as with the Shannon's and Simpson's indices. Plant species richness did not vary with disturbance treatment, however, it was highest for trees and shrubs at those woodlands in an advanced stage of regeneration, and for herbs in the lowest and highest disturbance groups. Besides, only the third vertical layer (2.5-10 m) was affected by disturbance treatment. Simpson's was the best index to explain the observed differences in the structure of woodlands subjected to unalike levels of disturbance. Species diversity was highest in woodlands with lowest disturbance or in an advanced state of regeneration. Woodlands with lowest disturbance had the highest diversity of trees and those woodlands in an advanced state of regeneration showed the highest diversity of shrub species. Regarding vertical structure, diversity was mostly affected in the intermediate layer (2.5-10 m), with highest values found in woodlands at the lowest disturbance group, i.e. at least 100 years of no disturbance. Two indices of evenness, i.e. Pielou's and Simpson's were also calculated in this study. Results here presented suggest that plant species composition, percent cover of individual plant species, and the Simpson's diversity index (applied considering the different growth-forms and vertical layers) are suitable and complementary indices to evaluate disturbance at the studied woodlands.

We compared stands recently treated by CPRS or PCT with established stands dominated by deciduous or coniferous trees in two large blocks of mixed forests. We measured habitat components and abundance of small mammals in the four stand types. Trees (DBH >= 9 cm) became very rare in CPRS stands and remained at low density in PCT stands, which stimulated the growth of herbs and seedlings, resulting in increased lateral cover. Tree harvest also generated coarse woody debris in CPRS stands, which did not persist in PCT stands. Small mammals responded to these disturbances in a species-specific manner but, overall, relative abundance and species richness of small mammals were lower in PCT stands than in CPRS and closed stands. Our results suggest that forest managers should exclude some stands from PCT following CPRS or natural perturbations, to maintain ecosystem diversity at the landscape level.","WOS:000235231000006",19,0.829096031,1

We examined songbird communities in the boreal mixed-wood forest of Alberta, Canada, to investigate the effect on songbird abundance of (1) logging and (2) retaining variable densities of residual trees in cutblocks (10-133 trees/ha or basal area of 0.50-10.65 m(2)). We surveyed songbirds in logged and forested, aspen-dominated, mixed-wood stands in the year before, the year after, and three years after logging. We analyzed changes in abundance of 27 common songbird species: 23 present in the forest prior to logging and four that appeared after logging. Ten species declined with logging and were termed ""forest species."" Ten more species did not change with logging and were called ""habitat generalists."" The seven species that increased with logging were called ""cutblock species."" When the effect of residual tree retention was examined in terms of basal area (rather than density) of residual trees, more songbird species were found to be both positively and negatively affected by residual tree retention, despite the fact that the two tree measures were highly correlated. In the first year after logging, four bird species (two forest, one generalist, and one cutblock) increased, and none decreased with increasing residual tree retention in cutblocks. In the third year after logging, again four species increased with increasing retention, but these were different species than in the first year after logging (one forest and three generalist species). Furthermore, four cutblock species decreased with increasing retention. Based on these findings, we conclude that retention of residual trees may be beneficial to some species, although conservation of unlogged reserves is also important. Most importantly, we recommend that research be continued to examine a larger range of tree retention and longer term effects on the avifauna.","WOS:000172456700008",14,0.828924898,1
"419","tempbroad1","Colonisation by vascular plants after soil disturbance in the Bavarian Forest - key factors and relevance for forest dynamics","Tree uprooting and timber harvesting cause soil disturbances in forests. Plants colonise disturbed patches in two ways: generative (with germination of seeds) and vegetative (with ramets). In this study, the relative importance of the two means of colonisation was assessed and the influences of seed availability and site conditions on colonisation were explored. In a mixed mountain forest in southern Germany, topsoil was disturbed experimentally and colonisation with vascular plants was observed afterwards for 15 months. The compositions of the soil seed bank and the seed rain were investigated. Experiments were carried out in 12 forest stands with different canopy covers and forest management histories. In each stand between 10 and 18 soil disturbance plots were established. Species richness on experimental plots was significantly higher I year after soil disturbance than before the disturbance. The most numerous species emerging after soil disturbance was Rubus idaeus, followed by species of the genus Carex. R. idaeus colonised disturbed plots both generatively and vegetatively, but the vegetative colonisation of this species was important only on clear-cuts with high light intensities. The decisive factor for generative colonisation (considering all species) was the number of germinable seeds of R. idaeus in the soil seed bank, whereas the seed rain was unimportant. The factor with the highest explanatory power for vegetative colonisation was the cover of the adjacent vegetation. The results indicate that soil disturbances in forests increase germination rates, which are responsible for small-scale increases in species richness. R. idaeus on clear-cuts has high cover values because (1) soil disturbances by vehicle traffic and timber hauling during the harvest enhance its germination and (2) the high light intensities on clear-cuts favour the spread of this species vegetatively. Since R. idaeus is a potential competitor for tree seedlings, these findings are important for planning forest management. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"5141","tempbroad1","Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. II. Diversity and population dynamics of small mammals","1. Variable retention harvests in temperate coniferous forests provide various intensities and sizes of disturbance across a gradient, from clear-cutting to single-tree harvesting. These 'green-tree retention systems' leave large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand. It is unclear what effect these harvesting patterns will have on wildlife in general, and small mammals in particular. 2. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that: (i) the abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals will decline with lower levels of tree retention; (ii) the abundance, reproduction and survival of Microtus spp. and southern red-backed vole Clethrionomys gapperi populations will decline and increase, respectively, with the basal area and density of residual trees after harvest; and (iii) habitat heterogeneity generated by variable retention harvesting will limit population size of Microtus, thereby reducing feeding damage to tree seedlings planted on harvested areas. 3. Small mammals were intensively live-trapped from 1996 to 1999 in replicated clearcut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed natural forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. The seed-tree harvesting system leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. The patch-cut system harvests timber from small (< 1-ha) units dispersed over a given area of forest. 4. Contrary to hypothesis (i), the mean total abundance of small mammals was similar among sites, and mean species richness and diversity of small mammals was lowest in the uncut forest but similar across the other four treatments. 5. The overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of Microtus spp. was higher on clear-cut (11.3) sites than single seed-tree (6.0), group seed-tree (3.9), patch-cut (1.8) or uncut forest (0.1) sites. Overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of C. gapperi was similar in uncut forest (16.2) and group seed-tree (10.0) sites, which were both higher than patch-cut (6.4), clear-cut (4.2) or single seed-tree (2.7) sites. 6. The recruitment of new Microtus spp. differed significantly among sites, declining from clear-cut to uncut forest. The recruitment of C. gapperi exhibited the opposite trend. The mean number of successful pregnancies was similar among treatments for Microtus spp. but for C. gapperi was highest in uncut forest, group seed-tree and patch-cut sites. The survival of each vole species was similar across treatment sites. 7. Hypothesis (ii) was supported. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was inversely, and that of C. gapperi positively, related to mean basal area and density of residual trees after harvest. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was also inversely related to percentage cover and crown volume index of residual trees, and positively related to number of lodgepole pine cones (seeds) in logging debris. 8. In terms of hypothesis (iii), vole feeding damage to planted lodgepole pine seedlings appeared highest in the patch-cut sites during the 1997-98 and 1998-99 overwinter periods, and appeared to have been caused mainly by C. gapperi rather than Microtus spp. 9. The group seed-tree and patch-cut systems achieved both aims of C gapperi persistence and prevention of Microtus outbreaks. These harvesting methods are as good for overall small mammal abundance, species richness and diversity as any other.","WOS:000173050100007",5,0.791716423,1

The sites were managed in two alternative ways, either slash was removed (SR), or slash was left (SL). Overall, the number of morphospecies per trap was significantly higher on SL sites than on SR sites. Species richness differed significantly between the regions, the Western region being the poorest in number of species per trap. Rarefaction plots of species richness in four sites suggested that accumulation rate of species differed between two SR sites but rates were similar for two SL sites. Microhabitat structure was measured by aboveground height of slash heaps. Slash height was positively correlated with the number of sticks in slash heap and fractal dimension, respectively. There was a positive relationship between the number of individuals per trap and slash height in SR sites in the Western and Eastern regions, but not in the Northern one. We concluded that extensive slash removal leads to impoverish species richness of Coleoptera. at a local scale. Slash heaps left on site may provide important refuges for ground-active beetles. Moreover, our results supported the general theory that microhabitat structure affects arthropod abundance and diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"653","tempbroad1","Arthropod responses to harvesting and wildfire: Implications for emulation of natural disturbance in forest management","Although natural disturbance has been widely adopted as a template for forest management that protects biodiversity, this hypothesis has not been adequately tested. We compared litter-dwelling arthropod assemblages (Coleoptera: Carabidae and Staphylinidae; Araneae) in aspen-dominated stands originating as clear-cuts or wildfires across three age classes (1-2, 14-15, and 28-29 years old) to test whether the post-harvest and post-fire assemblages converged following disturbances, and to compare faunal succession. These findings were compared to data about epigaeic arthropods in old and mature pyrogenic aspen stands (> 70 years old) to determine whether diversity and community composition of arthropods from the younger age-classes approached what may have been typical predisturbance conditions. The resulting data-set of almost 27,000 arthropods and 230 species showed convergence in most taxa, and some general similarities between 28- and 29-year-old stands and old and mature stands. However, not all taxa responded similarly, and faunal succession following clear-cutting appeared to progress more rapidly than following wildfire. Rarefaction-estimated diversity was elevated in 1-2-year-old stands, compared to unharvested stands, reflecting a mix of closed-canopy and open-habitat species. Nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling ordinations showed that samples from young wildfire disturbed stands (1-2 years old) included more variable assemblages than all other study sites, and contained species that may depend on unique post-fire habitat characteristics. The fauna of old and mature stands exhibited low diversity, but contained species with limited dispersal abilities, and species tied to old-growth habitats such as dead wood. Harvesting systems that do not allow adequate recovery following a first harvesting pass, or do not maintain microhabitat features associated with older fire-origin forests, may threaten persistence of some elements of boreal arthropod faunas.

A 115-year-old stand of mixed Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in central Sweden was clear-cut in March 1999. Injune 1999, two plots on the clear-cut were burnt and two plots were left unburnt according to an experimental design with two blocks. Two plots of adjacent uncut forest were used as controls. The burning combusted the ground vegetation and the upper half of the 6-cm thick organic layer. In comparison with the unburnt clear-cut, burning decreased the abundances of Collembola, Protura, Mesostigmata, Araneae and Diptera larvae throughout the 5-year period, whereas Enchytraeidae, Lumbricidae, Oribatida, Prostigmata, Astigmata and Tardigrada decreased immediately after the fire but showed tendencies of recovery. Burning also decreased species richness. The majority of the species still absent after 5 years was surface-living species. Even animals with good ability to disperse (Diptera, Coleoptera and Araneae) had not recovered, which indicates a change of habitat or lack of food. Clear-cut burning was particularly detrimental to fungivores and predators, whereas microbidetritivores and herbivores were less affected. Prescribed burning, which is considered to increase aboveground biodiversity, dramatically reduced the soil fauna species richness for at least 5 years and did not add any species to those already present in the forest or clear-cut.

We used before/after-harvest comparisons to determine whether there were significant effects of edge creation in the first and second year after harvest. We also investigated 5- and 16-yr-old edges to determine whether their structure and composition were significantly different from interior forest. Distance of edge influence (20 - 60 m) was not extensive compared to findings from studies conducted in other forest types. In the first two years after harvest, there were significant primary responses to edge creation including increased tree mortality, snag breakage and amount of downed coarse woody debris; as well as secondary responses including prolific vegetative regeneration of Populus spp. and a decrease in total shrub cover. Significant edge effects were still detectable 5 and 16 yr after edge creation, despite the rapid regeneration of Poppidus-dominated forest in the adjacent clear-cuts. These older edges showed evidence of past primary and secondary responses, including a more heterogeneous canopy, along with additional changes in understory composition. At both younger and older edges the distance of edge influence was greater for secondary responses (up to 60 m) than for primary responses (10 - 20 m). We hypothesize that secondary responses to edge creation start later than primary responses and that the distance of edge influence is greater for secondary (vs. primary) responses.","WOS:000178961700009",4,0.738787268,1
"945","tempbroad1","Short-term effects of selection and clear cutting on the shrub and herb layer vegetation during the conversion of even-aged Norway spruce stands into mixed stands","The conversion of even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) H. Karst.) stands into more site adapted mixed stands is the main silvicultural goal in Germany and many other European countries. The conversion will primarily be achieved with the help of selection cutting, removing single target diameter trees and creating small gaps. At sites highly susceptible to windthrow, however, small scale clear cutting (up to 1 ha) might be an appropriate alternative. Both selection and clear cutting will affect the understorey vegetation, an important component of forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Thus, with the help of a BACI-experiment (before-after/control-impact), the short-term effects of selection and small scale clear cutting on the herb and shrub layer vegetation were studied at two sites in the Solling Hills (Lower Saxony, Germany). Both treatments led to an increase in herb and shrub layer species numbers, due to persistent and invading (mainly pioneer tree species and indicators of disturbance) species and to a shift in plant traits. Most responsible for the changes in vegetation was a higher light availability, and to a lesser degree soil disturbance. The number of annuals and ruderals, however, increased only immediately after clear cutting, whereas on selection cutting plots the numbers remained high. Gaining in number and coverage were competitive perennials (Epilobium angustifolium, Juncus effusus, Rubus idaeus) especially on the clear cuttings, fulfilling a nutrient retention function. The competitives did not deter tree species from regenerating in the clear cut plots, whereas on selection cutting plots the large expansion of R. idaeus appeared to be hindering tree colonisation. Suffering under clear cut conditions were predominantly shade-tolerant, closed-forest species, but no loss of these species could be detected. This indicates the potential for a fast recovery of these forest species, as soon as, pioneer trees expand. Although the vegetation changed in similar directions at both study sites, differences in species numbers and composition were found, indicating the importance of site conditions in the beginning of succession. In conclusion, our study shows no overall negative effects on shrub and herb layer biodiversity and trait composition after clear cutting. It is suggested that small scale clear cutting may be considered an appropriate alternative to silvicultural methods which cause a moderate rate of disturbance, to reach the goal of Norway spruce forest conversion.

Results indicate that shallow disturbances (litter left in place or removed) were more frequent than deep disturbances (topsoil removed, subsoil exposed, rut exposed) regardless of the logging tractor used. The forests with previously cultivated terraces were the least disturbed. Moreover, with the aid of a functional group analysis we distinguished four plant species response groups to soil surface disturbance types. The mosaic created by these groups after clear-cutting and log removal probably contributes to a rapid auto-regeneration of a mixed plant community similar to that existing just prior to the clear-cutting.

In order to preserve habitats of biodiversity and decrease ecological disasters, it now becomes urgent to restore them to the climax. An adapted forest dynamics model is used to simulate the change in tree species composition, density, and stem productivity of forests regenerating from clear-cuts of the mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forest (MKPF) and the introduction of species over 100 years in the region. The model shows that the restoration of climax forests on these sites can be accelerated by the introduction of proper tree species. For the current secondary forest of Quercus mongolica, Populus davidiana and Betula platyphylla, if the medium-type of shade tolerant tree species are introduced into the communities, the dynamics of tree species will change, and the stem productivity will decrease by 20%. If Larix olgensis is introduced into the forest communities, it will become dominant in the forests, with stem productivity increasing about 110%. If Pinus koraiensis is introduced, it will dominate the communities after 90-100 years, although the density and stem productivity will not change significantly. If P. koraiensis is introduced into the current secondary forest of medium-type trees, the dynamics of the forest will change significantly and the growth of medium-type trees will increase after 20 years. If the medium-type trees are introduced into the plantations of pure R koraiensis, both the tree density and stem productivity will increase dramatically, and the earlier stem divergence, earlier branching, of P. koraiensis can be improved.

This paper describes approximately 20 years of change in species composition, aboveground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and nutrient pools in the 59-ha mixed hardwood forest of watershed 7 following commercial clear-cutting in winter 1977. We measured woody species in 24 permanently marked plots before cutting in 1974 and during subsequent years (1977-1997). By 1997 (approximately 20 years after cutting), aboveground biomass was 81.7, 96.9, and 85.4 Mg.ha(-1) in the cove hardwood; mesic, mixed-oak; and dry, mixed-oak communities, respectively. Leaf biomass and LAI accumulated relatively faster than total aboveground biomass in all three communities. By 1984, only 7-8 years after cutting, leaf biomass and LAI were nearly equal to the amount estimated for the precut forest. In 1997, nitrogen accumulation was 36, 44, and 61% and phosphorus accumulation was 48, 66, and 59% in the cove-hardwoods; mesic, mixed-oak; and dry, mixed-oak communities of the corresponding precut communities, respectively.

Aboveground biomass, nutrient contents (N, P, K and Ca) and species composition of ground vegetation were determined I year before and for 7 years after clear-cutting of a mixed forest dominated by Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.] in eastern Finland. The biomass of the feather mosses [Pleurozium schreberi Brid. and Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) B. S.& G.] and the dwarf shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus L. and V. vitisidaea L.), which had dominated the ground vegetation in the mature forest, significantly decreased after clear-cutting. However, with the exception of H. splendens, these species had recovered within 3-5 years. The biomass of Deschampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin. considerably increased soon after clear-cutting, and Epilobium angustfolium L. appeared 3-5 years after cutting. These species contributed to the retention of nutrients not simply because of their biomass but also because of higher nutrient concentrations in their tissues. Total biomass and nutrient contents of the ground vegetation exceeded those of the pre-cutting levels. The proportion of ground vegetation biomass and nutrient contents represented by mosses decreased after cutting, while V. myrtillus, although reduced after cutting, remained a marked nutrient sink. The results suggest that H. splendens is the most sensitive species to cutting, but the biomass of P. schreberi, V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea return to initial levels soon after clear-cutting as do the nutrient contents of ground vegetation.","WOS:000233245400004",1,0.520957431,1

The landscape is currently composed of four types of forest: primary F. crenata forest, shelterwood logged F. crenata forest, abandoned coppice forest, and coniferous plantation. Species richness per plot (alpha diversity) and in each forest type (gamma diversity) and species turnover among plots in each forest type (beta diversity) reached their highest values in plantation forests. While the difference in species composition between primary and shelterwood logged forests was not significant, the other pairs of forest types showed significant differences. Ordination analysis revealed that variation in species composition within the plantations seemed to be related to the dominance of naturally regenerated tree species, which reflected the intensity of tending. Although the species composition of less intensively tended plantations was similar to that of abandoned coppice forests that had been repeatedly cut in the past, their species composition differed from that of the primary forests. This suggests that most of the plantation and coppice forests, which were clear-cut at least once, do not revert to primary forest conditions after management is abandoned.","WOS:000235231000008",13,0.96203042,1

However, studies comparing plant species diversity in forests with different management types and intensity, extending over different regions and forest stages, and including detailed information on site conditions are missing. We studied vascular plants on 1500 20 m x 20 m forest plots in three regions of Germany (Schwabische Alb, Hainich-Dun, Schorfheide-Chorin). In all regions, our study plots comprised different management types (unmanaged, selection cutting, deciduous and coniferous age-class forests, which resulted from clear cutting or shelterwood logging), various stand ages, site conditions, and levels of management-related disturbances. We analyzed how overall richness and richness of different plant functional groups (trees, shrubs, herbs, herbaceous species typically growing in forests and herbaceous light-demanding species) responded to the different management types. On average, plant species richness was 13% higher in age-class than in unmanaged forests, and did not differ between deciduous age-class and selection forests. In age-class forests of the Schwabische Alb and Hainich-Dun, coniferous stands had higher species richness than deciduous stands. Among age-class forests, older stands with large quantities of standing biomass were slightly poorer in shrub and light-demanding herb species than younger stands. Among deciduous forests, the richness of herbaceous forest species was generally lower in unmanaged than in managed forests, and it was even 20% lower in unmanaged than in selection forests in Hainich-Dun. Overall, these findings show that disturbances by management generally increase plant species richness. This suggests that total plant species richness is not suited as an indicator for the conservation status of forests, but rather indicates disturbances.","WOS:000324035600006",23,0.937075665,1
"314","tempconif","Plant species diversity in abandoned coppice forests in a temperate deciduous forest area of central Japan","We investigated plant species diversity as it related to stand structure and landscape parameters in abandoned coppice forests in a temperate, deciduous forest area of central Japan, where Fagus crenata was originally dominant. The species occurring in the study plots were classified into habitat types based on a statistical analysis of their occurrence bias in particular habitats (e.g., primary forest, coniferous plantation) in the landscape studied. The relationships between stand structure, which reflected the gradient of management, and forest floor plant species diversity (H' and J') and richness (number of species per unit area) were not significant. However, these factors did influence the forest floor plant composition of the different types of habitat. According to the multiple regression analysis, species diversity and the richness of forest floor plants was affected by landscape parameters rather than by stand structure. For trees, species richness was mainly affected by the relative dominance of F. crenata, which is one of the stand structure parameters that decreases with intensive management. This is probably because many of the tree species that are characteristic diversity (H' and J') of trees was positively correlated with some landscape parameters, including the road density around the study plot, which may be associated with the intensity of management activity. The number of disturbance-tolerant species increased with increasing road density. Stand structure mainly affected disturbance-intolerant forest floor plant species and disturbance-tolerant tree species. Thus, the species diversity responses differed between forest floor plants and trees. The impact of forest management on species diversity was more prominent for forest floor plants.","WOS:000182132400012",103,0.932983555,1

In agricultural matrix landscapes, the detection of alternative habitats for habitat specialists may be a solution. Historic old parks or landscape gardens around manor houses and castles are cultural heritage of nobles, but their value in harbouring biodiversity is poorly acknowledged. Therefore we evaluated the potential of old rural parks to serve as a habitat for nemoral forest species. We recorded stand structure and the presence of forest biodiversity indicators in 74 closed-canopy stands of historic parks and compared them with 93 neighbouring mature forest remnants on ancient forest land. We estimated the importance of stand structure in relation to habitat type on biodiversity indicators. Finally we suggest single-value indicator-complexes for the cost-efficient assessment of the conservation value of forests and forest-like habitats. Park stands outclassed reference forests in several individual structural characteristics, and in combined indicators of habitat quality and biodiversity. Forests had higher estimates for the combined indicator of dead wood, but large-diameter dead wood types were more abundant in parks. Woodpeckers, several old-growth indicator epiphytes and forest herbs had successfully become established in planted forest-like park fragments. Old rural parks resemble high-conservation-value forests more than the best preserved contemporary forest remnants. After the century needed to overcome immigration delay, old parks do provide a refugium for temperate deciduous forest species. Consequently, biodiversity-targeted management should retain and enhance old-growth attributes in forests and on the peripheries of parks: e.g. preserving old trees to provide service for epiphytes, hollow trees and an understorey mosaic for birds and bats; dead wood elements for saproxylic insects and fungi; limited mowing frequency and increased cutting height for forest herbs.

These conditions provide an opportunity to study the response of bird communities to forest management. Here we focused on the effects of tree species composition and tree age on bird species richness. We counted birds in two types of montane forest (beech and mixed) replicated in three age classes (managed 55-65 years, managed 85-95 years, unmanaged over 200 years) in the Vtacnik Mountains, Slovakia. Number of bird species at individual study sites (local richness) was predicted solely by the tree age and not by the forest type. Specifically, the number of species was highest in the oldest stands, while the stands of 55-65 and 85-95 years did not differ from each other. By contrast, forest type seems important for total bird species richness (number of species recorded in all study sites of a given type) with more species recorded in mixed forests than in beech forests. The local richness seems thus limited by the amount resources available at a given site, which is highest in the oldest stands irrespective to forest type, probably due to largest amount of food, dead wood or tree cavities, being particularly suitable for habitat specialists. However, larger species pool in mixed forest, enriched by birds adapted to coniferous trees, increases the total number of species observed in this type. We thus recommend to shift the harvest to the highest possible age and to include some other tree species into parts of beech monocultures.","WOS:000368886700015",58,0.919354421,1

Cluster analysis and a stand ordination, using detrended correspondence analysis, indicated that plant species composition in forest stands was primarily influenced by the previous land-use history (as meadows or coppices) compared with either the current status of the stand (semi-natural forest or plantation) or site micro-topography. Species occurrence was also dependent on the previous land-use, with a significantly greater proportion of native woodland species being present in former coppice stands. Species richness, however, was higher in plantations and stands developing on former meadow sites. This was true of perennial forbs and climbing plants, but not the evergreen species which were originally common in native woodland of the region. Species diversity indices (Shannon's H') showed a similar tendency to species richness. The light environment within forest stands, evaluated by gap light intensity (GLI) using hemispherical photography, had less effect on species richness. We conclude that previous land-use has a significant effect on the species composition and diversity of forest, persisting even after the establishment of conifer plantations, and that the restoration of the original 'woodland' species composition and diversity will require the retention of efficient seed sources near stands which have developed on land previously cleared of native forest cover.

The species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole breeding bird assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the linear models of different groups varied between 20% and 60%, and the relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably. These results indicate that forest management may considerably influence the diversity and the composition of birds, as all the structural elements affecting birds deeply depend on it. Within the shelterwood management system, the elongation of the rotation and regeneration periods, and the relatively high proportion of retention tree groups after harvest could contribute to the conservation of forest birds. Our results also showed that for the forest bird communities, both the prevalence of big trees and the presence of a dense understory layer are important. Management regimes which apply continuous forest cover might be more appropriate for providing these structural elements simultaneously on small spatial scales, and for the maintenance of a more diverse bird community, thus healthier forest ecosystems.","WOS:000369429000003",44,0.913420598,1

After clear-cutting, differences in the restoration process of forest ecosystems, in terms of vegetation structure and woody debris, will affect the community structure of wood-inhabiting aphyllophoraceous fungi. In this study, we conducted field surveys in broad-leaved secondary forests and in planted conifer forests to examine the chronosequential pattern of fungal community development after clear-cutting and the relationships between environmental conditions and the fungal community structure in central Japan. In 2002, we collected 1476 records from 95 fungal species. Sixty-five species were recorded only in secondary forests, 17 were recorded only in planted conifer forests, and 13 were recorded in both forest types. Fungal species composition was different between the two forest types. Redundancy analysis showed that the amount of coarse woody debris in the broad-leaved secondary forests and basal area of coniferous trees in the planted forests correlated with the fungal species composition of the forests. In the broad-leaved secondary forests, species density showed significant positive correlations with stand age, and number of records and species composition changed with stand age. In the planted conifer forests, the number of records of brown rot fungi, which has a preference for conifers, was positively correlated with stand age. Our study suggested that differences in fungal community structure between the two forest types strongly reflect the preference of fungal species for different host substrates and vegetation structure, and that each forest type maintains specialists for the dominant trees. A mosaic of different forest types will promote the maintenance of high species diversity at the landscape level, as long as secondary or primary forests cover a large enough area to maintain high species diversity.

This study explores the effect of widely conducted management practices (forest logging and livestock) in Pinus uncinata forests in the Pyrenees range (NE Spain) on the structure and composition of ground ant communities compared to those of old-growth stands. Forest structure clearly differed in stands with different forest managements. These stands managed for different uses also showed marked differences in structure and composition of ground ant communities. There was a great dominance of a single species, Formica lugubris, which accounted for 99% of ants collected in pitfall traps. Rarefaction curves indicated that species richness was highest in old-growth stands and lowest in even-aged ones, with woodland pasture stands showing an intermediate value. Classification methods allowed us to identify two groups of species: six species related to old-growth plots and three species (including F. lugubris) associated to managed stands. Habitat structure played an important role in determining the structure of ant communities: forests with high tree density but low basal area were the most favourable forest type for F. lugubris, while the abundance of the remaining ant species was negatively affected by the abundance of F. lugubnis and by tree cover.

"129","tempconif","Effect of forest management on temperate ant communities","Human management of ecosystems can have direct or indirect effects on species communities. How species communities are affected by management is a key question in ecology and nature conservation. As keystone taxon, changes in ant communities can have sustained consequences for entire ecosystems. In forests, management has been shown to have an overall negative effect on ant communities in tropical and a positive effect in boreal forests. However, in temperate forests, it is unclear what components of forest management affect ant communities and how. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of forest management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in 150 temperate forest stands in three regions in Germany. Using a multi-model inference approach and structural equation models, we analyzed the effects of 18 variables, including variables of forest management, forest structure, arthropod diversity, and biomass, as well as abiotic factors, on ant species richness, abundance, and functional trait diversity (Rao's Q) based on morphological (FDM) and life-history traits (FDLH). In total, we found 28 ant species occurring on 120 plots. Main direct effects of forest management on ant abundance and species richness were caused by tree species selection, measured as dominant tree species. The main positive indirect effect was mediated by a reduced canopy cover with an increasing proportion of oak and pine, resulting in a higher temperature amplitude. Due to the low number of species in two regions, we analyzed functional diversity for the most ant species diverse region only. FDLH was affected positively by tree harvesting and negatively by structural complexity. FDM showed no response to forest management, potentially due to the low morphological diversity of temperate forest ants. Our results show that forest management practices in temperate forests strongly impact ant community structure. This can be beneficial for ants if management reduces the canopy cover, either by tree harvesting or by changing the tree species composition toward shade-intolerant tree species. To promote ant diversity as key taxon for maintaining ecosystem processes in forest ecosystems, we suggest to integrate forest stands with more open and warmer conditions in future management strategics.","WOS:000439997600019",41,0.902671294,1

To investigate the relationship between forest type and edaphic Collembola assemblages, we established 36 study sites in the Strict Nature Reserve that represented the most valuable old growth forest stands and included most of the variability in forest type. The faunas of the humid and boggy deciduous forests were more abundant than those of the moderately humid forests. Three primary groups of assemblages were revealed by multivariate analysis to be typical of the following forest types: (i) coniferous bog forest, (ii) humid and moderately humid coniferous forest, and (iii) deciduous forest. Collembola assemblages were only moderately related to specific forest types but instead changed continuously along the environmental gradient that they formed. At the species level, the correlations to forest type were stronger, and approximately one-third of the collembolan species qualified as significant forest type indicators; both forest specialists and forest generalists were identified. Six species were revealed to be forest generalists because they indicated a wide spectrum of forest types. Nine species were significantly correlated with four to six forest types and were identified as broad specialists, and seventeen indicator species were associated with one, two or three forest types and were classified as narrow specialists. Because the correlation between the edaphic Collembola faunas and forest type revealed a gradual rather than categorical change in the community assemblages, we suggest that this relationship be considered in the development of future forest monitoring programmes.

However, there is a remarkable lack of information of these plantations on the value for conservation biodiversity. To evaluate these plantations as habitat for wildlife, I studied bird communities in native secondary forest and in plantation of exotic tree species (Pinus oocarpa and Cupressus lusitanica) in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, Costa Rica. Bird assemblage composition, richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness were compared between habitats using the fixed-radius point count method. Fieldwork was conducted from September 2008 to May 2009. A total of 743 birds of 79 species corresponding to 10 orders and 25 families were recorded. The bird composition varied across habitats, sharing 51.9% of the same bird species. Although I found no significant differences in the patterns of bird diversity or evenness, the native forest had a greater bird richness and abundance than the plantation. This could be explained by the higher spatial heterogeneity and productivity in the native forest than in the plantation. On the basis of these results, secondary native forests seem to have a greater value for bird conservation than conifer plantations. Therefore, some management measures could favor bird communities in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, such as the implementation of strategies for ecological restoration in order to gradually replace the exotic vegetation by native species which offer more resources available for bird populations. The continuation of studies in plantations of exotic conifers may provide more knowledge that will allow a better understanding of the role played by exotic plantations in maintaining bird populations and biodiversity in general.","WOS:000282804500003",38,0.898759123,1

We conducted systematic studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forests (800-1700 m a.s.l.) in 1963 and 2006 respectively. The aim of this comparison is to assess the long-term effects of the protection on plant biodiversity of CNR during the interval 43 years. The research was carried out in three types of forests: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found different in the same elevations and forest types during the 43-year interval. The floral composition and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layers, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF from 1963 to 2006. However, originally dominant species, P. koraiensis for example, tended to decline, while the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers trended to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the under canopy fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. Comparison of the alpha diversity in the three forests shows that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased with time. During the process of survey, we also found some rare and medicinal species disappeared. Analysis indicates that the changes of the diversity pattern in this region are caused by both nature and human factors. Meteorological records revealed that climate has changed significantly in the past 43 years. We also found the most severe human disturbance to the CNR forests in the process of another field survey that is the exploitation of herb medicines and Korean pine nuts. We hope this research would give some guidance to the future reserve management in Changbai Mountain area.","WOS:000259527400011",91,0.895538197,0

In addition to the existing data, we conducted botanical inventories in 32 plots (0.28 ha in size) from five different silvicultural regimes in 1997. Based on these inventories, understory species richness normalized to a total area sampled of 1.13 ha was significantly greater in plots under plantation (80 species) and shelterwood (77 species) management compared to plots in reserve sites (i.e., approximately 80 year with no active management, 48 species). This pattern in species richness was consistent in the larger data set. Based on 372 plots sampled between 1977 and 1996, plantations and shelterwoods routinely had the highest species richness and the reserve units routinely were the least rich. Stands under single-tree selection had species richness values closer to those of the reserve stands. The relative diversity observed in group selection plots varied from year to year. Based on the 1997 data, canopy closure and seedbed were significantly correlated to understory plant diversity. Plots that were more open and had more bare ground tended to have higher species richness. This result supports the suggestion that in addition to the total amount of biomass removed, post-harvest practices also affect plant diversity. There were considerable differences in the composition of the understory communities among silvicultural treatments. Plots under a group selection, single tree selection or reserve management regime had a greater proportion of late-seral vs. early-seral species and a lower proportion of introduced exotic species compared to plantations and shelterwoods. In this forest, more intensive management maximized species richness,but the lower intensity practices better conserved understory plants typical of late-seral stands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

"187","tempconif","Succession Influences Wild Bees in a Temperate Forest Landscape: The Value of Early Successional Stages in Naturally Regenerated and Planted Forests","In many temperate terrestrial forest ecosystems, both natural human disturbances drive the reestablishment of forests. Succession in plant communities, in addition to reforestation following the creation of open sites through harvesting or natural disturbances, can affect forest faunal assemblages. Wild bees perform an important ecosystem function in human-altered and natural or seminatural ecosystems, as they are essential pollinators for both crops and wild flowering plants. To maintain high abundance and species richness for pollination services, it is important to conserve and create seminatural and natural land cover with optimal successional stages for wild bees. We examined the effects of forest succession on wild bees. In particular, we evaluated the importance of early successional stages for bees, which has been suspected but not previously demonstrated. A range of successional stages, between 1 and 178 years old, were examined in naturally regenerated and planted forests. In total 4465 wild bee individuals, representing 113 species, were captured. Results for total bees, solitary bees, and cleptoparasitic bees in both naturally regenerated and planted conifer forests indicated a higher abundance and species richness in the early successional stages. However, higher abundance and species richness of social bees in naturally regenerated forest were observed as the successional stages progressed, whereas the abundance of social bees in conifer planted forest showed a concave-shaped relationship when plotted. The results suggest that early successional stages of both naturally regenerated and conifer planted forest maintain a high abundance and species richness of solitary bees and their cleptoparasitic bees, although social bees respond differently in the early successional stages. This may imply that, in some cases, active forest stand management policies, such as the clear-cutting of planted forests for timber production, would create early successional habitats, leading to significant positive effects for bees in general.","WOS:000315603700071",28,0.890656578,1

Studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forest (800-1700 m a.s.l.) were conducted in 1963 and in 2006. The aim of this comparison was to assess the long-term effects of the protected status on plant biodiversity during the intervening 43 years. The research was carried out in three forest types: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found to differ for the same elevations and forest types after the 43-year interval, while the beta diversity indicated by the Cody index depicted the altitudinal patterns of plant species gain and loss. The floral compositional pattern and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layer, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF. However, originally dominant species, such as Pinus koraiensis, tended to decline, the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers showed a trend to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the understory fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. A comparison of the alpha diversity indices among the three forest types reveals that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased, and some rare and medicinal species disappeared.

"205","tempconif","Succession in ant communities (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in deciduous forest clear-cuts - an Eastern European case study","Clear-cutting, the main method of harvesting in many forests in the world, causes a series of dramatic environmental changes to the forest habitat and removes habitat resources for arboreal and epigeal species. It results in considerable changes in the composition of both plant and animal communities. Ants have many critical roles in the maintenance and functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore, the response of ants to clear-cutting and the time it takes for an ant community to recover after clear-cutting are important indicators of the effect of this harvesting technique on the forest ecosystem. We investigated ground-dwelling ant communities during secondary succession of deciduous forests in Transylvania, Romania. Using space-for-time substitution, we explored a chronosequence from clear-cuts to mature forests (> 120 years). The object was to determine if cutting has measurable effects on ant community structure, and if ant species richness differs between successional stages. We recorded a total of 24 species of ants, 11 characteristic of forests and seven of open landscape. Ant species richness was higher in clear-cuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands. Number of ant individuals was highest in young age classes and lowest in closed-canopy age classes. There was no drastic change in species richness during the succession, however differences in community composition at different stages were recorded. Open landscape species are able to rapidly colonize following disturbance but disappear when the forest sites mature and many forest ant species are capable of surviving clear cutting.","WOS:000396466400012",1,0.887549263,1

Residual live trees (""legacy trees"") provide mature forest habitat, increase structural diversity, and provide continuity in the regenerating stand. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that, at up to 8 years after harvest, abundance and species diversity of communities of (i) understory plants and (ii) forest-floor small mammals, and (iii) relative habitat use by mule deer (Odocoileits hemionus), will decline with decreasing levels of tree retention. Communities of plants and forest floor small mammals were sampled in replicated clearcut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch cut, and uncut forest sites in mixed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest in southern British Columbia, Canada from 2000 to 2003 (5-8 years post-harvest). Habitat use by mule deer was measured during summer and winter periods each year from 1999 to 2003 in these same sites. Mean total abundance (crown volume index) of herbs, shrubs, mosses, and lichens was similar among sites. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs, and total plants was similar among sites, but total species diversity and structural diversity were significantly lower in the patch cut and uncut forest sites than in the other harvesting treatments. Thus, hypothesis (i) was not supported. Mean total abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals were similar among sites, contrary to hypothesis (ii). However, the southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) declined in abundance as conditions became intolerable for this microtine to persist at numbers > 1/ha in the clearcut and seed-tree sites. The early successional and mycophagist northwestern chipmunk (Tamias amoenus) occurred at 2.3-4.4 times higher abundance on the seed-tree sites than the other sites. Relative habitat use by mule deer was highest in the seed-tree sites during summer periods and highest in the group seed-tree, patch cut and uncut sites in winter periods. The responses to our treatments were species specific, and hence a range of different harvesting systems should be used to maintain plant and mammal diversity across forest landscapes.

Continuous forest without gaps was used as a control for both management types (old-growth and managed forests). Passerines' response to disturbance was examined by estimating species richness and abundance of different ecological groups. Species richness and the total abundance of birds did not differ between gap and non-gap plots, neither did the abundance of most ecological groups. Management type or study year were the most important factors explaining abundances. Our results differ from studies conducted in temperate forests, mainly in North America, where small-scale disturbance have been found to increase avian diversity and abundance.

However, a comprehensive study analyzing lichen species richness in relation to several management types, extending over different regions and forest stages and including information on site conditions is missing for temperate European forests. In three German regions (Schwabische Alb, Hainich-Dun, Schorfheide-Chorin), the so-called Biodiversity Exploratories, we studied lichen species richness in 631 forest plots of 400 m(2) comprising different management types (unmanaged, selection cutting, deciduous and coniferous age-class forests resulting from clear cutting or shelterwood logging), various stand ages, and site conditions, typical for large parts of temperate Europe. We analyzed how lichen species richness responds to management and habitat variables (standing biomass, cover of deadwood, cover of rocks). We found strong regional differences with highest lichen species richness in the Schwabische Alb, probably driven by regional differences in former air pollution, and in precipitation and habitat variables. Overall, unmanaged forests harbored 22% more threatened lichen species than managed age-class forests. In general, total, corticolous, and threatened lichen species richness did not differ among management types of deciduous forests. However, in the Schwabische-Alb region, deciduous forests had 61% more lichen species than coniferous forests and they had 279% more threatened and 76% more corticolous lichen species. Old deciduous age classes were richer in corticolous lichen species than young ones, while old coniferous age-classes were poorer than young ones. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of stand continuity for conservation. To increase total and threatened lichen species richness we suggest (1) conserving unmanaged forests, (2) promoting silvicultural methods assuring stand continuity, (3) conserving old trees in managed forests, (4) promoting stands of native deciduous tree species instead of coniferous plantations, and (5) increasing the amount of deadwood in forests.","WOS:000315483200052",24,0.873476394,1

This study clarified changes in the forest landscape of the cool-temperate forest region of central Japan from 1947 to 1997. We used a geographic information system to reconstruct past forest landscapes at four times (1947,1962, 1975, and 1997) based on interpretation of aerial photographs and landscape metrics calculated using the FRAGSTATS software for spatial pattern analysis. Our results showed that secondary forests, the dominant land use in 1947, decreased greatly in area and became more fragmented, whereas coniferous plantations, which occupied approximately 20% of the total land area in 1947, became the dominant land use (almost 40% of the total land) by 1997. The young coniferous plantations have been established at increasing elevations over time and were mainly created by conversion of secondary forest until 1975. The number of young coniferous plantations and their patch spacing depended on the type of forest management. In the study area, landscape structure changed in response to changes in management of national forests, especially the expansion of afforestation in the 1950s and 1960s and changes in harvesting systems.

Our study investigated changes in the effects of forest composition and structure on bat and bird diversity across Europe. We compared the taxonomic and functional diversity of bat and bird assemblages in 209 mature forest plots spread along gradients of forest composition and vertical structure, replicated in 6 regions spanning from the Mediterranean to the boreal biomes. Species richness and functional evenness of both bat and bird communities were affected by the interactions between latitude and forest composition and structure. Bat and bird species richness increased with broadleaved tree cover in temperate and especially in boreal regions but not in the Mediterranean where they increased with conifer abundance. Bat species richness was lower in forests with smaller trees and denser understorey only in northern regions. Bird species richness was not affected by forest structure. Bird functional evenness increased in younger and denser forests. Bat functional evenness was also influenced by interactions between latitude and understorey structure, increasing in temperate forests but decreasing in the Mediterranean. Covariation between bat and bird abundances also shifted across Europe, from negative in southern forests to positive in northern forests. Our results suggest that community assembly processes in bats and birds of European forests are predominantly driven by abundance and accessibility of feeding resources, i.e., insect prey, and their changes across both forest types and latitudes.","WOS:000383669300019",36,0.867527224,0

Simultaneously, forest tree species penetrate into abandoned agricultural lands, the areas of which have noticeably increased during the last decades. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the development of regenerating forest tree communities in terms of their growth, competition and species composition in ecosystems affected by various environmental stressors such as windthrows, insect pests, fungal diseases, traditional clearcuttings and agricultural land-use legacy. Lithuania, being located in the transition between the boreal and continental biogeographical regions of Europe, has been considered a favourable research area as both conifer and broadleaved tree stands as well as mixed ones are common here. Research methods used included inventory of vegetation and assessment of quantitative characteristics and sanitary condition of six regenerating forest tree species - Scots pine, Norway spruce, silver birch, pedunculate oak, common ash and black alder - in 7-8 circular research plots (50.24 m(2) each) per study site with total 17 study sites. Results of the study demonstrated that forest regeneration takes place in all disturbed ecosystems, although high variation in space and time was present. Species composition of the regenerating forest ecosystems depends on those prevailing before disturbance, although, pioneer species out-compete the others. The most intensive forest regeneration takes place in those forest ecosystems which were subjected to direct human impact, i.e., clear cuttings, and less intensive regeneration, particularly, that with the target species, takes place on sites cleared of windthrows and where sanitary fellings were applied. Although non-target species depending on habitat type usually prevail on cutting sites, numbers of saplings of target species are sufficient for the regeneration of high productivity forest ecosystems and development of the new ones given the competing species will be controlled by silvicultural measures.

This requires an understanding of the impacts of management disturbance on species diversity relative to natural drivers such as climatic or edaphic conditions on the relevant temporal scales, i.e., centuries. We examined the effects of long-term management disturbance on understory plant diversity in coniferous forests by comparing structure types (ages since disturbance) between regions with comparable abiotic settings but contrasting management history, i.e., management for centuries in central Europe versus the first logging in primary forests in western Canada. We systematically sampled three age classes after disturbance and compared their alpha diversity and species composition. The structure types (age classes) showed similar differences in alpha diversity in both landscapes, while the response of species compositions differed between the two. Fewer late-successional specialists occurred in the European landscape. Within the setting of our study, the structure types, which reflect the time since major forest management disturbance, affected understory species richness and composition at least as strongly as environmental conditions such as climate, soil, and tree layer diversity across the broad altitudinal gradients that we sampled. Our results suggest that forest management affects the diversity of coniferous forests, with management for centuries disadvantaging late-successional specialists. Furthermore, it appears that human action is becoming the major determinant of diversity of coniferous forests, emphasizing the need for sustainable management schemes.","WOS:000306612800007",124,0.866702713,1
"351","tempconif","Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. I. Diversity of stand structure","1. Variable retention harvests or 'green-tree retention systems' are important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone. Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological processes. 2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation) and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than in clear-cut sites. 3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. 4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m(2) ha(-1), with significantly higher levels on patch-cut (23.4 m(2) ha(-1)) and uncut forest (39.0 m(2) ha(-1)) sites. Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha(-1) on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites, to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha(-1) on the patch-cut and uncut forest sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m(3) ha(-1)) of fallen wood (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from 116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs, shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites. 5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among the other sites. 6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest. The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites. 7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance, species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4 years post-harvest.","WOS:000173050100006",4,0.84935233,1

Variable retention harvests in temperate coniferous forests provide various intensities and sizes of disturbance across a gradient, from clear-cutting to single-tree harvesting. These 'green-tree retention systems' leave large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand. It is unclear what effect these harvesting patterns will have on wildlife in general, and small mammals in particular. 2. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that: (i) the abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals will decline with lower levels of tree retention; (ii) the abundance, reproduction and survival of Microtus spp. and southern red-backed vole Clethrionomys gapperi populations will decline and increase, respectively, with the basal area and density of residual trees after harvest; and (iii) habitat heterogeneity generated by variable retention harvesting will limit population size of Microtus, thereby reducing feeding damage to tree seedlings planted on harvested areas. 3. Small mammals were intensively live-trapped from 1996 to 1999 in replicated clearcut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed natural forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. The seed-tree harvesting system leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. The patch-cut system harvests timber from small (< 1-ha) units dispersed over a given area of forest. 4. Contrary to hypothesis (i), the mean total abundance of small mammals was similar among sites, and mean species richness and diversity of small mammals was lowest in the uncut forest but similar across the other four treatments. 5. The overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of Microtus spp. was higher on clear-cut (11.3) sites than single seed-tree (6.0), group seed-tree (3.9), patch-cut (1.8) or uncut forest (0.1) sites. Overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of C. gapperi was similar in uncut forest (16.2) and group seed-tree (10.0) sites, which were both higher than patch-cut (6.4), clear-cut (4.2) or single seed-tree (2.7) sites. 6. The recruitment of new Microtus spp. differed significantly among sites, declining from clear-cut to uncut forest. The recruitment of C. gapperi exhibited the opposite trend. The mean number of successful pregnancies was similar among treatments for Microtus spp. but for C. gapperi was highest in uncut forest, group seed-tree and patch-cut sites. The survival of each vole species was similar across treatment sites. 7. Hypothesis (ii) was supported. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was inversely, and that of C. gapperi positively, related to mean basal area and density of residual trees after harvest. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was also inversely related to percentage cover and crown volume index of residual trees, and positively related to number of lodgepole pine cones (seeds) in logging debris. 8. In terms of hypothesis (iii), vole feeding damage to planted lodgepole pine seedlings appeared highest in the patch-cut sites during the 1997-98 and 1998-99 overwinter periods, and appeared to have been caused mainly by C. gapperi rather than Microtus spp. 9. The group seed-tree and patch-cut systems achieved both aims of C gapperi persistence and prevention of Microtus outbreaks. These harvesting methods are as good for overall small mammal abundance, species richness and diversity as any other.","WOS:000173050100007",6,0.791716423,1
"791","tempconif","Effects of logging residue removal on ground-active beetles in temperate forests","Logging residue (""slash"") left on clear-cuttings may affect the microhabitat complexity, and thereby indirectly the beetle (Coleoptera) populations. In three regions (West, North and East) of south and central Sweden, we studied short-term effects of slash removal on species richness and abundance of beetles, collected by pitfall trapping in 16 clear-cuttings (<1 year old) in coniferous and mixed forests. The sites were managed in two alternative ways, either slash was removed (SR), or slash was left (SL). Overall, the number of morphospecies per trap was significantly higher on SL sites than on SR sites. Species richness differed significantly between the regions, the Western region being the poorest in number of species per trap. Rarefaction plots of species richness in four sites suggested that accumulation rate of species differed between two SR sites but rates were similar for two SL sites. Microhabitat structure was measured by aboveground height of slash heaps. Slash height was positively correlated with the number of sticks in slash heap and fractal dimension, respectively. There was a positive relationship between the number of individuals per trap and slash height in SR sites in the Western and Eastern regions, but not in the Northern one. We concluded that extensive slash removal leads to impoverish species richness of Coleoptera. at a local scale. Slash heaps left on site may provide important refuges for ground-active beetles. Moreover, our results supported the general theory that microhabitat structure affects arthropod abundance and diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

What is the difference in structure between natural and anthropogenic edges? LocationTemperate and boreal forests across all of Sweden, spanning latitudes 55-69 degrees N. MethodsWe sampled more than 2000 forest edges using line intersect sampling in a monitoring programme (National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden). We compared edge length, ecosystem attributes (width of adjacent ecosystem, canopy cover, canopy height, patch contrast in canopy height, forest type) and boundary attributes (profile, abruptness, shape) of natural edges (lakeshore, wetland) with anthropogenic edges (clear-cut, agricultural, linear disturbance) in five regions. ResultsAnthropogenic edges were nearly twice as abundant as natural edges. Length of anthropogenic edges was largest in southern regions, while the abundance of natural edges increased towards the north. Edge types displayed unique spectrums of boundary structures, but abrupt edges dominated, constituting 72% of edge length. Anthropogenic edges were more abrupt than natural edges; wetland edges had the most gradual and sinuous boundaries. Canopy cover, canopy height, patch contrast and forest type depended on region, whereas overall boundary abruptness and shape showed no regional pattern. Patch contrast was related to temperature sum (degree days5 degrees C), suggesting that regional variability can be predicted from climate-controlled forest productivity. Boundary abruptness was coupled with the underlying environmental gradient, land use and forest type, with higher variability in deciduous than in conifer forest. ConclusionsEdge origin, land use, climate and tree species are main drivers of broad-scale variability in forest edge structure. Our findings have important implications for developing ecological theory that can explain and predict how different factors affect forest edge structure, and help to understand how land use and climate change affect biodiversity at forest edges.","WOS:000375147500007",9,0.770831284,0

An important goal of forest management is to increase stand diversity, provide wildlife habitat and improve forest species diversity. We synthesize results from natural spruce forests in southeast Alaska and suggest strategies for managing Sitka spruce plantations in other parts of the world to benefit biodiversity and enhance a variety of forest ecosystem services. We also discuss the roles of fungi in increasing both biological and structural diversity in Sitka spruce forests. New silvicultural systems that use partial cutting in older spruce forests could alleviate some of the problems associated with conventional even-aged management and increase both stand structural diversity and biodiversity. We found that mixed red alder-conifer stands in Alaska provided more heterogeneous structures than the pure conifer stands that typically develop after clear cutting. Well-planned silvicultural systems that include broad leaved species such as alder or birch could provide trees for timber production, improve wildlife habitat and a variety of other ecosystem services that are often compromised in young pure conifer forests.","WOS:000335912700002",15,0.765590123,0

Here we investigated differences in understory vegetation by comparing naturally regenerated deciduous forests (NR) and reforested spruce plantations (SP) aged 20-40 years on 12 similar clear-cuts of subalpine old-growth spruce-fir forests from the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We found that 283 of the 334 vascular plant species recorded were present in NR plots, while only 264 species occurred in SP plots. This was consistent with richer species, higher cover, and stem (or shoot) density of tree seedlings, shrubs, and ferns in the NR plots than in the SP plots. Moreover, understory plant diversity was limited under dense canopy cover, which occurred more frequently in the SP plots. Our findings implied that natural deciduous tree regeneration could better preserve understory vegetation and biodiversity than spruce reforestation after clear-cutting. This result further informed practices to reduce tree canopy cover for spruce plantations or to integrate natural regeneration and reforestation for clear-cuts in order to promote understory vegetation and species diversity conservation.","WOS:000336905000008",2,0.752768154,1

The species richness of longicorns, which were collected with Malaise traps, was the highest in young stands, decreasing with the age of the stand for both broad-leaved and conifer stands. A canonical correspondence analysis divided the 18 plots into three groups based on longicorn assemblages and environmental variables. These three groups consisted of (1) very young (1-4 years old) stands after clear-cutting or plantation; (2) 12- to over 100 year-old broad-leaved stands; (3) 7- to 76-year-old conifer stands. The species richness of the longicorns was the highest in the young stands followed, in order of decreasing species richness, by broad-leaved stands and conifer stands. Possible causes of the high species richness in young stands include large amounts of coarse wood debris and flowers, which are resources for oviposition and nutrition for adults, respectively. The lower longicorn diversity in conifer stands than in broad-leaved stands may be due to the lower diversity of trees available as host plants in the former. Almost all species that occurred in conifer stands were also collected in young and/or broad-leaved stands, but the reverse was not true, suggesting that conifer plantations cannot replace broad-leaved stands in terms of longicorn biodiversity. We argue that an extensive conversion of broad-leaved forests into conifer plantations will lead to an impoverishment of the longicorn fauna, which may result in the degradation of ecosystem functions possibly carried out by them.","WOS:000246179100003",12,0.659510866,1

The main hosts were oaks (primarily Quercus leucotrichophora and Q. floribunda), pines (Pinus roxburghii and P. wallichiana) and deodar (Cedrus deodara). The species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi was 43 in oak forests and 55 in conifer forests, which is close to midpoint values on the range derived from the literature for similar forest types. The major genera in terms of species were Amanita (15 sp.), Russula (13 sp.), Boletus (12 sp.), Lactarius (9 sp.), Hygrophorus (4 sp.) and Cortinarius (4 sp.). Some of these genera showed clear-cut host specificity -Amanita was primarily associated with conifers and Russula and Boletus with oaks.

The objective of this study was to examine relationships among ECM fungal community measures, local soil nutrients, and stand age along a chronosequence of mixed forest stands that were similar in vegetation composition and site quality. Six combinations of age class (5-, 26-, 65-, and 100-year-old) and stand initiation type (wildfire and clearcut) were replicated on four sites, each representing critical seral stages of stand development in Interior Cedar-Hemlock (ICH) forests of southern British Columbia. We found significant relationships between ECM fungal diversity and both available and organic P; available P was also positively correlated with the abundance of two ECM taxa (Rhizopogon vinicolor group and Cenoccocum geophilum). By contrast, ECM fungal diversity varied unpredictably with total and mineralizable N or C to N ratio. We also found that soil C, N, available P, and forest floor depth did not exhibit strong patterns across stand ages. Overall, ECM fungal community structure was more strongly influenced by stand age than specific soil nutrients, but better correlations with soil nutrients may occur at broader spatial scales covering a wider range of site qualities.","WOS:000266486000003",14,0.64468364,1

The seed bank consisted of 36-plant species altogether, of which 14 were not represented in the vegetation. There were 42 phanerogam species in the forest understory, which were not represented in the seed bank.

Although a few stand-level studies have been conducted, a broad-scale study is needed to understand the general tendency of vegetation recovery and to obtain information for the management of such extensively distributed abandoned clearcut sites. This study is a province-level study that aims to interpret the patterns and factors in early-stage vegetation recovery at abandoned plantation clearcut sites. We also discuss the potential indicators that may determine whether a certain site recovers towards evergreen broad-leaved forest consisting of Castanopsis cuspidata and Quercus glauca or towards deciduous broad-leaved forest comprising Q. serrata and Q. acutissima. A cluster analysis revealed that five types of vegetation (evergreen trees, evergreen trees-deciduous pioneer shrubs, pioneer species, deciduous trees, and deciduous shrubs) were observed from an early stage of succession. The first two vegetation types were considered to recover successfully to the target vegetation of evergreen broad-leaved forest, but the remaining three vegetation types did not show any tendency to recover to the target vegetations. According to the results of the detrended correspondence analysis, a smaller size of the abandoned site with adjacent evergreen broad-leaved forest and a longer time after clearcutting were identified as factors that enhance the invasion of evergreen tree species; these factors are also useful to predict the future successional tendency. In conjunction with these factors, the existence of regeneration sources (i.e., stumps) that allow sprouting appeared to be an important indicator for predicting the early-stage vegetation recovery.","WOS:000266160200002",17,0.575681246,0

These changes are likely to be paralleled by shifts in microbial community composition with potential feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Here, we assessed fungal communities across a chronosequence of managed Pinus sylvestris stands and investigated correlations between taxonomic composition and extracellular enzyme activities. Not surprisingly, clear-cutting had a negative effect on ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance and diversity. In contrast, clear-cutting favoured proliferation of saprotrophic fungi correlated with enzymes involved in holocellulose decomposition. During stand development, the re-establishing ectomycorrhizal fungal community shifted in composition from dominance by Atheliaceae in younger stands to Cortinarius and Russula species in older stands. Late successional ectomycorrhizal taxa correlated with enzymes involved in mobilisation of nutrients from organic matter, indicating intensified nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that maintenance of functional diversity in the ectomycorrhizal fungal community may sustain long-term forest production by retaining a capacity for symbiosis-driven recycling of organic nutrient pools.","WOS:000397281200005",3,0.514703408,1

Large areas of native forests and grasslands are being turned into tree plantations without assessing their impacts on natural communities. We evaluated the effects of replacing native forests by non-native pine (Pinus taeda) plantations on the diversity and composition of assemblages of terrestrial mammals and ground-dwelling and understory birds, in a forest productive landscape of the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina. Camera-trap stations were deployed in three different ""environments"": 53 in a continuous forest, 69 in forest fragments, and 62 in tree plantations. The evaluation focused on the effect of the environment, the structural complexity of the vegetation, the cost-distance (distance weighted by connectivity) to the continuous forest, the percentage of native forest within different radii, and the cost of human access (as a proxy for hunting pressure) on both mean species richness per station and species composition. Alpha diversity of the assemblages of each environment was estimated using Hill numbers (effective number of species): (q(0) = richness, q(1) = number of common species and q(2) = number of dominant species. Changes in community composition were evaluated by comparing the assemblages of the three environments using three similarity indices: Sorensen (q(0) = similarity in species identity), Horn (q(1) = similarity in common species), and Morisita-Horn (q(2) = similarity in dominant species). For mammals and birds, richness was significantly higher in forest stations (both continuous and fragmented) than in those located in plantations. For both taxa, it also decreased with the distance to the continuous forest (but with a negative quadratic term in birds). Tree plantation stands contained biased and impoverished subsets of the original assemblages. Mammal composition was affected by the environment, the distance to the continuous forest, the proportion of native forest in the landscape, and human access. The bird assemblages of plantations were seriously affected, and their composition was also influenced by changes in vegetation structure. Alternative management practices (e.g. pruning, thinning) and landscape features can partially mitigate the negative effect of tree plantations on mammal and bird assemblages. Large areas of forest that function as population sources and forest fragments immersed in the matrix of plantations are strictly necessary to preserve the original native mammal and bird assemblages in the productive landscape. Promoting connectivity and improving hunting controls will also support their conservation.","WOS:000437967900021",138,0.953668893,1
"218","tempgrass","Bird assemblages in a mixed woodland-farmland landscape: The conservation value of silviculture-dependant open areas in plantation forest","Although considered by some as a less ""ecologically suitable"" forestry model than ""near-natural"" stand management, even-aged plantation forest management, with regeneration procedure involving clearcutting, creates temporary habitat for many early-successional birds. The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a ""conservation value index"", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities.

Restoration and connectivity of forest fragments are crucial to maintain viable populations of forest-dependent species. During winter and summer, we studied the bird diversity, its components and composition (including specialist and generalist species) in three different vegetation types: mature forest (MF), secondary forest (SF) and grassland (G) of an ecological corridor in Misiones, Argentina. We determined the influence of alpha diversity (of each habitat) and beta diversity (species turnover between habitats) on gamma diversity (regional diversity in the corridor), to provide conservation management recommendations. MF showed the highest values of bird diversity, richness, evenness and abundance, followed by SF and G, in both seasons. Only MF showed a possible seasonal variation in diversity and richness. The species composition of SF was similar to MF. However, G, where pasture specialist and edge species were the most common species recorded (70% of its avifauna), had very low similarity to MF, where the most forest specialist species were found (53%). As alpha diversities were higher than beta values, the bird diversity in the studied corridor mainly resulted from the diversity in each vegetation type, in both studied seasons. We therefore recommend preservation of both MF and recovering SF due to their high bird diversity and the presence of forest-dependent, threatened and endemic bird species. We also urge the creation of ecological corridors between protected forest remnants of the Atlantic Forest.","WOS:000368472400006",14,0.924779343,1

In a mountainous area on Sado Island, a large number of abandoned paddies were converted into wetlands and open terrestrial vegetation. In this study, we used pitfall traps to examine the effects of the creation of open vegetation on carabid beetle assemblages by investigating 14 sites spanning five vegetation types: six sites in secondary forests (three coppice forests and three 40-year-old regenerating forests on abandoned paddies), three each in clear-cuts and paddy levees, and two in grasslands. The 14 study sites were clearly separated into two groups different in the species composition of carabid beetles: secondary forest and grassland-levee groups. The species composition of two clear-cut sites was similar to that of secondary forests, whereas that of the remaining one clear-cut site was similar to that of grasslands. Analyses of species responses showed various habitat preferences, e.g., for only coppice forests, for two types of secondary forests, for secondary forests and clear-cuts, for clear-cuts and grasslands, and for grasslands or levees, or no clear preference. There were no characteristic species in the regenerating forests. These results suggest that the 40-year-old regenerating forests may sustain only a limited subset of the carabid fauna found in coppice forests and that the creation of open vegetation in the abandoned paddies enhances carabid diversity at the landscape level by raising diversity among the different vegetation types.","WOS:000325352800002",2,0.908849798,1

It is composed of diverse vegetation types, including secondary forests, paddy fields and cultivated fields in a narrow area (ca. 1 km(2)). To clarify the characteristics of butterfly assemblage and the relative contribution of each vegetation type to butterfly diversity and endemism in satoyama, we conducted a line-transect survey along a 1.1-km route with five sections (two forest interior, one interior-edge, one edge-openland and one openland). Life history features (voltinism, host plant range and host plant type) and endemism of butterflies were discussed in relation to their abundance and vegetation association. Fifty-one species and 856 individuals were recorded. Species richness was highest in the two sections with edges, 32 and 36 species, respectively. Analysis of vegetation association of each butterfly species showed that 16 species were forest interior species, 24 forest edge species and 11 openland species, indicating that vegetation diversity enhanced butterfly diversity. However, the point is that forest interior and edge species contained many specialists sensitive to human impact (univoltine and/or oligophagous species) and many species within temperate East Asia including all endemic species. In contrast, most openland species were generalists (multivoltine and/or polyphagous species) feeding on herbs/grasses with the widest geographic range. Since secondary forests kept more butterfly diversity and specialists than openlands, and had all endemic species, they must be maintained without over fragmentation in order to avoid loss of specialists and endemics in satoyama.","WOS:000246802700013",62,0.901577299,1

Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A range of habitats typical of cattle grazing enterprises was sampled and site variables included lithology, slope position, tree density, soil disturbance, soil enrichment and grazing. Results were compared with a previously published survey of temperate grasslands. Lithology, slope position and tree density had relatively minor effects on plant species richness, although in both surveys there was some evidence of lower species richness on the more fertile substrates. Soil disturbance and soil enrichment significantly reduced the richness of native species in both surveys, while exotic species were insensitive (subtropics) or increased (temperate) with disturbance. Rare native species were highly sensitive to disturbances, including grazing, in the temperate study. Although some trends were similar for rare species in the subtropics, the results were not significant and there were complex interactions between grazing, lithology and slope position. Grazing did not have a negative effect on native species richness, except in the closely grazed patches within pastures, and then only on the most intensively developed property. At the scale recorded (30 m(2)), the native pastures, roadsides and stock routes sampled in the subtropics appear to be among the most species-rich grasslands ever reported, both nationally and globally. Native species richness was approximately 50% higher than the temperate survey figures across all the comparable habitats.

Do responses of species richness depend on degree of habitat specialization (specialists vs generalists) and/ or scale of the study? Location: O "" land, Sweden. Methods: Richness of herbaceous vascular plants (subdivided into richness of grassland specialists and generalists) was recorded within 50 9 50 cm plots and 0.1-4.8 ha grassland polygons. Generalized linearmodels and hierarchical partitioning were used to identify local factors (habitat area and heterogeneity, grazing intensity, habitat continuity) and landscape factors (proportion of surrounding grassland in 2004, 1938 and 1800, and landscape diversity in 2004) associated with the richness estimates. Results: At the polygon scale, both specialist and generalist richness was positively associated with local habitat area and heterogeneity and, independently of area and heterogeneity, with grazing intensity, habitat continuity and amount of surrounding grassland in 1800. At the plot scale, specialist species richness was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity, amount of surrounding grassland in 2004 and landscape diversity. Plot-scale generalist richness was negatively associated with surrounding grassland in 1938 and positively associated with local grazing intensity. Conclusions: Because both habitat specialization and study scale influence conclusions about relationships between species richness and local and landscape factors, the study highlights the need to consider species diversity at multiple spatial scales when making decisions about grassland management. Large-scale (polygon) species richness is influenced by immigration processes, with both specialists and generalists accumulating in old grasslands over centuries of grazing management. Habitat heterogeneity increased specialist species richness at both scales, suggesting that management policies should favour maintenance of a heterogeneous mosaic of open areas, trees and shrubs in temperate grazed grasslands. Although grassland specialists are sensitive to grassland isolation, in extensively managed landscapes with high landscape diversity input of grassland species from the landscape matrix may buffer negative effects of habitat fragmentation on grassland communities.","WOS:000298919100006",89,0.894566714,1

Impacts of forest plantations on biodiversity are controversial; forest plantations could positively influence biodiversity by producing a buffer zone between native forests and agriculture, while replacement of native forests with plantations could reduce biodiversity. Chile is one of the main producers of wood worldwide, and production is largely based on intensively managed monocultures of exotic tree species. Only a few studies have looked at the effects of forestry plantations on biodiversity in Chile, mainly focusing on pine plantations. The aim of this study was to characterize habitat use and richness of bats between native forests, eucalyptus plantations and grasslands in a biodiversity hotspot in southern Chile to determine how land use affects an important mammalian taxa. We found no difference in use or richness of bats in eucalyptus plantations versus native forests. Regional context within the larger Valdivian watershed (Andes, central valley, coastal range) had a stronger influence on bat activity and richness than land use type (native forest, plantation, grassland), with the Andean region being the most diverse and where most bat activity is concentrated. Our results suggest that the composition and structure of the surrounding landscape mosaic may be fundamental to determine the impacts of forestry and human land use on biodiversity.","WOS:000338237500006",223,0.890752123,1
"1113","tempgrass","Native and non-native herbaceous species dependence on tree cover in grazing systems from northern Chilean Patagonia","Grazing systems that combine grasslands and woodlands represent changes in tree cover that influences herbaceous vegetation and may threaten the native forest flora. We studied these influences in Chilean Patagonia where recent colonization resulted in the fragmentation of the lenga (Nothofagus pumilio) forests leading to a mosaic-type landscape. The herbaceous vegetation, transmitted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and other forest structure characteristics were sampled in 15 (20 m x 20 m) plots differing in tree cover for two years, while considering the relative position (below or beyond) of tree crowns. Herbaceous species were classified as forest, non-forest, and forest indifferent species according to their preference, rejection or indifference to the forest environment. Species richness decreased with increasing PAR but this was dependent on the response of non-natives. Species composition varied gradually from open grasslands to dense forests, according to transmitted PAR values. Native species were associated to either forests or open areas, but the number of native species did not vary along the tree cover gradient (beyond tree crowns) or even decreased (below tree crowns). Non-native species dominated in the open grasslands and beyond tree crowns and its richness increased with transmitted PAR. The occurrence of grasslands and dense forests within this grazing system is shown to promote higher species richness. Management will consider that dense forest patches are necessary for maintaining a high diversity of native species, since isolated trees or low wooded areas do not guarantee the persistence of all native species associated to the original forests.

"1210","tempgrass","Ecology of pollination in a tropical Venezuelan savanna","Pollination modes ecology of a total of 164 plant species was evaluated according to habitats and plant life forms in the Venezuelan Central Plain. Frequency distribution of nine pollination modes showed that, at the community level bee pollination (38.6%) was dominant. Butterfly (13.9%), fly (12.7%), and wasp (10.8%) pollination were the second most frequent. Moth (6.2%) and wind (10.4%) pollination occurred with similar frequency, and the least common were bird (3.1%), beetle (2.3%) and bat (1.9%) pollination. There was a significant interaction effect indicating that pollination mode was affected by the type of habitat. Bee pollination was the most common pollination mode in all habitats with butterfly, fly and wasp pollination being secondary for forest and forest-savanna transition; and butterfly, wasp, wind and fly pollination being secondary for savanna. Wind, butterfly and fly pollination were found in disturbed areas as secondary pollination modes. Pollination modes were significantly associated and affected by life forms. Bee pollination was dominant in all life forms with wasp, butterfly and fly pollination being the secondary for trees, shrubs, and lianas; and butterfly and wind pollination being the secondary for herbaceous species. The number of pollination modes (richness) among life forms ranged between four and nine for epiphytes and perennial herbs respectively. The highest values of diversity indexes among life forms were found in trees and shrubs. The richness and diversity indices of pollination modes were statistically higher for more structured habitats, forest and forest-savanna transition, than herbaceous habitats, savanna and disturbed areas, which is associated with the highest values of diversity indexes in trees and shrubs. Equitability was higher for forest and disturbed areas than forest-savanna transition and savanna. The results of comparative richness, equitability, diversity indices, and the frequency distribution of pollination modes of 19 samples from tropical and temperate communities indicated that richness of pollination modes may be different between tropical and temperate communities. The proportion of each pollination mode suggests four grouping: (1) rain forests and their strata, (2) grassland savanna, and associated disturbed areas, (3) temperate communities, and (4) the most heterogeneous group, contained mostly neotropical communities, including the four habitats of the Venezuelan Central Plain. The frequency of pollination modes, richness, diversity and equitability of communities, habitats, successional stages, and vegetation strata varies with respect to geography, vegetation structure, and plant species richness.","WOS:000221685500003",82,0.882306698,0
"1310","tempgrass","How can we preserve and restore species richness of pollinating insects on agricultural land?","During recent decades, concern about the loss of biodiversity on agricultural land has increased, and semi-natural grasslands have been highlighted as critical habitats. Temperate European agricultural landscapes require distinct and appropriate management to prevent further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent for pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our aim was to examine how species richness of three important groups of pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are related to different farm characteristics, and if there are any differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if red-listed species are related to any farm characteristics. Species richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all semi-natural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50 km(2) in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species richness of solitary bees increased with the area of semi-natural grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural grassland species richness was strongly positively related with the density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with the proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed solitary bees was positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after mid-July) and decreased with increased farm isolation. The number of burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation height, flower density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with traditional hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting traditional hay-meadows, late extensive grazing and the herb K. arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high species richness of pollinating insects and support red-listed species. Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects.","WOS:000262639100003",294,0.878280903,1
"149","tempgrass","Assessing rodent community responses in disturbed environments of the Chilean Patagonia","The effects of a perturbation gradient on a Patagonian rodent community were assessed over the course of a year by comparing the community parameters in natural and different disturbed environments in the central Chilean Patagonia. The studied habitat types were mature forest, second-growth forest, forest plantations, and agricultural grassland. We recorded eight species of sigmodontine rodents (Abrothrix longipilis, Abrothrix olivaceus, Chelemys macronyx, Geoxus valdivianus, Irenomys tarsalis, Loxodontomys micropus, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, and Reithrodon auritus). Most species experience an increment in abundance from summer to autumn, with a notable decrease in winter and spring. The grassland showed lower species abundance than the mature forest. However, we did not detect significant differences in diversity, evenness, or species richness among the forest habitats. Our results suggest that rodents basically distinguish between forested and open areas, but not the specific plant composition of each habitat. Thus, the change in land use in the central Chilean Patagonia has not significantly affected the community parameters of diversity, evenness, or species richness.","WOS:000318225300009",26,0.878064671,1
"157","tempgrass","Floristic diversity of meadow steppes in the Western Siberian Plain: effects of abiotic site conditions, management and landscape structure","Temperate grasslands have suffered from severe habitat loss and degradation worldwide. In Russia, vast areas of forest-steppe grasslands have been converted to cropland during Soviet times, whilst remaining grasslands were often intensively grazed. Contrastingly, the collapse of the Soviet Union have resulted in a massive reduction in livestock numbers and cessation of management. Albeit relatively large natural grassland areas remained in the Western Siberian Plain, their present condition is poorly studied. We analysed plant species composition, functional structure and richness of grassland communities and tested for the effect of local factors (management, abiotic site conditions) and landscape factors (patch size, proportion of land cover types) on diversity patterns. Abiotic site conditions, mainly soil moisture and salinity, differentiated distinct community types. Overall, species richness was highest in meadow steppe communities with lower soil moisture and salinity. Grazing intensity and litter accumulation due to cessation of management were significant negative related to species richness and shaped the functional structure. At the landscape scale, diversity in meadow steppe grasslands was higher in forest-grassland mosaics and in small remnants isolated in a matrix of cropland. Our findings highlight that meadow steppes suffered massively under the historical habitat loss and high grazing pressure. Small species-rich remnants are evidence of the former extent of meadow steppe habitats in agricultural landscape, but are likely threatened by an extinction debt. Low intense, irregular mowing maintained species-rich meadow steppe in forest- grassland mosaics, but currently such practices are declining.","WOS:000386500700009",32,0.876292178,1
"1610","tempgrass","Native forest replacement by exotic plantations in southern Chile (1985-2011) and partial compensation by natural regeneration","Although several studies have reported rates of deforestation and spatial patterns of native forest fragmentation, few have focused on the role of natural forest regeneration and exotic tree plantations on landscape dynamics. The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamics of land cover change in order to test the hypothesis that exotic tree plantations have caused a major transformation of temperate forest cover in southern Chile during the last three decades. We used three Landsat satellite images taken in 1985 (TM), 1999 (ETM+), and 2011 (TM) to quantify land cover change, together with a set of landscape indicators to describe the spatial configuration of land cover. Our results showed that the major changes were dynamic conversion among forest, exotic tree plantation and shrubland. During the study period, the area covered by exotic tree plantations increased by 168% (20,896-56,010 ha), at an annual rate of 3.8%, mostly at the expense of native forest and shrubland. There was a total gross loss of native forest of 30% (54,304 ha), but a net loss of initial cover of only 5.1% (9130 ha), at an annual net deforestation rate of 0.2%. The difference between gross and net loss of native forest was mostly the result of conversion of shrubland and agricultural and pasture land to secondary forest following natural regeneration. Over the course of the study period, exotic tree plantations showed a constant increase in patch density, total edge length, nearest-neighbor distance, and largest patch index; maximum mean patch size occurred in the middle of the study period. Native forest exhibited an increase and then a decrease in patch density and total edge length, whereas mean patch size and largest patch index were lowest in the middle of the period. Overall, the observed trends indicate expansion of exotic tree plantations and increase in native forest loss and fragmentation, particularly between 1985 and 1999. Forest loss included both old-growth and secondary forests, while native forest established after secondary succession differed in diversity, structure, and functionality from old-growth and old growth/secondary forests. Since different successional stages influence the provision of ecosystem services, the changes observed in our study are likely to have consequences for humans that extend beyond immediate changes in land use patterns.

In low-input, low-productivity grazing systems in Australia, the modification of natural woodlands through overstorey tree and woody regrowth removal are vegetation management options used by landholders to increase native grass production for livestock grazing; however, there is little empirical evidence to indicate at what tree densities biodiversity attributes are compromised. We examined the effects of overstorey tree density and understorey regowth on the floristic composition, stand structure and species richness of eucalypt woodlands in a grazing landscape in the Traprock region of southern Queensland, Australia. We sampled 47 sites stratified according to vegetation type (Eucalyptus crebra/Eucatyptus dealbata woodland; Eucalyptus melliodora/Eucalyptus microcarpa grassy woodland), density of mature trees (< 6 trees/ha; 6-20 trees/ha; > 20 trees/ha), and presence/absence of regrowth. Distinct patterns in composition were detected using indicator species analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling, with low density areas compositionally indistinguishable, although distinct from other land management units. Within vegetation type, medium tree density woodlands were compositionally similar to high density and reference woodlands. Species richness ranged from 18 to 67 species per 500 m(2) across all sites. No differences in total or native species richness were detected across management units: however, some differences in exotic species richness were detected. Differences in grass cover existed between low and high density management units, yet no difference in grass cover was evident between low and medium density management units. Our results suggest that medium tree densities may provide biodiversity benefits concordant with more natural areas, yet not adversely impact on pasture production. Retaining trees in grazing landscapes provides significant landscape heterogeneity and important refuges for species that may be largely excluded from open grassland habitats. Maintaining a medium density of overstorey trees in grazed paddocks can provide both production and biodiversity benefits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Vegetation was sampled across a range of habitats using 77 0.1024-ha quadrats; the relative abundance of species was recorded. Classification analysis clustered the sites into three main groups that corresponded to intensity of grazing/clearing followed by groups based on underlying lithology (basalt, metasediment, granites). Using Canonical Correspondence Analysis, exogenous disturbance and environmental variables were related to the relative abundance of species; grazing intensity had the highest eigenvalue (0.27) followed by tree canopy cover (0.25), lithology (0. 18), altitude (0.17) and slope (0.10). Based on two-dimensional ordination scores, six species response groups were defined relating to intensity of pastoralism and nutrient status of the landscape. Abundance and dominance of native shrubs, subshrubs, twiners and geophytes were strongly associated with areas of less-intense pastoralism on low-nutrient soils. The strongest effects on species richness were grazing followed by canopy cover. Continuously grazed sites had lower native species richness across all growth forms except native grasses. There was no indication that intermediate grazing intensities enhanced forb richness as a result of competitive release. Species richness for all native plants was lowest where trees were absent especially under grazed conditions. Canopy cover in ungrazed sites appeared to promote the co-existence of shrubs with the herbaceous layer. Predicted declines in forb richness in treeless, ungrazed, sites were not detected. The lack of a disturbance- mediated enhancement of the herbaceous layer was attributed to habitat heterogeneity at 0. 1 ha sampling scale.","WOS:000182915300001",18,0.862298771,1
"1910","tempgrass","Habitat complexity of the Pannonian forest-steppe zone and its nature conservation implications","Eurasian forest-steppes are among the most complex ecosystems in the northern temperate zone. Alternating forest and grassland patches form a mosaic-like landscape, stretching in a stripe from eastern Europe almost to the Pacific coast. Although the edges (contact zones between woody and herbaceous vegetation) may play an important ecological role, their study has been neglected in the forest-steppes. In this study, we aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis on the components of a sandy forest-steppe in the Pannonian ecoregion (Hungary), with special regard to the edges. 2 m x 1 m coenological releves were made in forest interiors, in edges and in grassland interiors. We carried out microclimate measurements in each habitat type. Compositional and structural characteristics of the forests, edges and grasslands were compared, including species number, Shannon diversity, summarized cover, life-form and geoelement spectra. Diagnostic species for each habitat type were identified, and the role of the habitats in harbouring protected and endemic species was also assessed. Based on the frequencies and cover values of tree seedlings and saplings in the three habitat types, we formulated tentative assumptions on vegetation dynamics. We found that edges possessed their own distinct species composition, having a considerably higher species number, Shannon diversity and vegetation cover than habitat interiors. Edges hosted relatively large numbers of edge-related species, and proved to be highly different from habitat interiors with regard to life-form and geoelement spectra. It seemed that the spatial interaction of two neighbouring communities resulted in the emergence of a third, unique community, the edge. The microclimate of the forests and the grasslands differed strikingly, whereas that of the edges fell between them. Except Populus alba, trees had very few seedlings and no saplings, which may have serious consequences if the current warming and drying trend continues. We conclude that in the study area, intermediate microclimate of the edges supports a community that is not intermediate compositionally and structurally: the edge should be recognized as a distinct community, although strongly connected to the neighbouring communities. As a consequence, forest-steppes have three integral components: forest, grassland and edge. Our results emphasize the conservation importance of all components. The conservation value of the sandy grasslands has long been recognized, but the contribution of edges and forest patches to species and habitat diversity should not be neglected either. Conservation activities should focus on maintaining the complexity of the forest-steppe ecosystem, with all of its integral components. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, systematic analyses identifying the share of the regional species pool that can take advantage of this opportunity are missing. We assessed the importance of such forest openings for open-habitat butterflies in Estonia in Northern Europe by comparing butterfly species richness and composition in forest clear-cuts with their regional species pool. The species richness of butterflies in clear-cuts appeared to be remarkably high: we recorded altogether 81% of the total regional species pool across the study sites. Clear-cuts were inhabited by a very high share (79%) of regionally occurring grassland species, as well as nearly complete sets of open-habitat generalists and forest species. Redundancy analysis showed that clear-cuts in forests with different environmental characteristics harbour distinct butterfly assemblages, their contribution to the butterfly fauna in forest landscapes being thus complementary. This as well as several other lines of evidence indicate that most butterfly species can form resident populations in harvested forest landscapes. Our findings demonstrate that considering novel types of forest openings as 'temporary meadows' can substantially improve the conservation prospects for butterflies and other organisms that have traditionally been considered to inhabit grasslands and other open habitats in agricultural landscapes. Human-altered ecosystems may thus prove to be a viable alternative where restoring or maintaining natural and semi-natural habitats is impossible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although sheep grazing is rarely considered the best method for delivering conservation objectives in seminatural temperate grasslands, the literature does not provide unequivocal evidence on the impact of sheep grazing on pasture biodiversity. Our aim was therefore to review evidence of the impacts of stocking rate, grazing period and soil fertility on plant communities and arthropod populations in both mesotrophic grasslands typical of agriculturally improved areas and in native plant communities. We therefore conducted a literature search of articles published up to the end of the year 2010 using 'sheep' and 'grazing' as keywords, together with variables describing grassland management, plant community structure or arthropod taxa. The filtering process led to the selection of 48 articles, with 42 included in the stocking rate dataset, 9 in the grazing period dataset and 10 in the soil fertility dataset The meta-analysis did not reveal any significant trends for plant species richness or plant community evenness along a wide stocking rate gradient. However, we found frequent shifts in functional groups or plant species abundance that could be explained by the functional properties of the plants in the community. The meta-analysis confirmed that increasing soil fertility decreased plant species richness. Despite the very limited dataset, plant species richness was significantly greater in autumn-grazed pastures than in ungrazed areas, which suggests that choosing an appropriate grazing period would be a promising option for preserving biodiversity in sheep farming systems. Qualitative review indicated that low grazing intensity had positive effects on Orthoptera, Hemiptera (especially phytophagous Auchenorrhyncha) and, despite a diverse range of feeding strategies, for the species richness of Coleoptera. Lepidoptera, which were favoured by more abundant flowering plants, also benefited from low grazing intensities. Spider abundance and species richness were higher in ungrazed than in grazed pastures. In contrast, there are insufficient published studies to draw any firm conclusions on the benefits of late grazing or stopping fertilization on insect diversity, and no grounds for including any of this information in decision support tools at this stage.","WOS:000304602900013",15,0.834950317,0

Study area: El Palmar Grande de Colon (31 degrees 52'S, 58 degrees 17'W), Argentina. Methods: We surveyed dense Butia yatay palm savannas in two neighboring protected areas, El Palmar National Park (EPNP), under cattle exclusion since 1970 with sporadic burning; and La Aurora Wildlife Refuge (LAWR), under moderate cattle density, and not burnt since 1997. In each area, we randomly selected ten dense savanna stands, established 500 m(2) plots and undertook floristic survey in spring and summer to produce exhaustive plant-species lists. We statistically compared the two samples in terms of: local and global diversities; compositional heterogeneity among stands; mean similarity to a historical record from the area; overall species composition; and abundance and numbers of species with different growth habits and origins. Results: Differences between our samples are clear-cut. Savannas at EPNP have significantly increased local and global species richness and exhibit decreased similarities with the historical record. They have a novel understory, with significantly increased abundances and species numbers of fire-resistant grassland shrubs and fire-sensitive trees, and a groundcover with significantly increased richness of subshrub and perennial graminoid species. Savannas at LAWR have virtually no woody understory, and exhibit a groundcover dominated by an impoverished suite of perennial grasses, with significantly increased abundances and numbers of annual and of exotic species. Conclusions: Our results suggest that large-scale, long-term cattle exclusion and sporadic fires have resulted in changes in the structure and composition of the savanna vegetation leading to increased plant species diversity. Apparently, conservation of these humid savannas in protected areas requires periodic fire, while domestic cattle are a poor alternative for maintaining their plant species diversity.","WOS:000440825400002",10,0.823378525,1

Harvesting impacts on understory plant diversity depends on their intensity. Variable retention has been proposed to mitigate the harmful effects of timber harvesting, but its effectiveness remains unknown in southern Patagonian Nothofagus pumilio forests. The objectives of this study were to: (i) define a baseline of understory plant diversity in old-growth forests along a site quality gradient and under canopy gaps; (ii) evaluate stands with three different variable retention treatments compared to old-growth forests; and (iii) assess temporal changes during 4 years after harvesting (YAH). A 61 ha N. pumilio forest was selected. Understory plant (Dicotyledonae, Monocotyledonae and Pteridophyta) richness, cover (including woody debris and bare forest floor) and above-ground dry biomass were characterized in summer for 5 years. Before harvesting, baseline samples were conducted along a site quality gradient and outside/inside canopy gaps. Analyzed treatments include a control of old-growth forest (OGF) and three different harvesting treatments with variable retention: (i) dispersed retention (DR) of 30 m(2) ha(-1) (20-30% retention); (ii) aggregated retention (AR) with one aggregate per hectare and clear-cuts (28% retention); and (iii) combined dispersed and aggregated retention (DAR) with one aggregate per hectare and dispersed retention of 10-15 m(2) ha(-1) (40-50% retention). Data analyses included parametric and permutational ANOVAs, multivariate classification and ordinations. Before harvesting, 31 plant species were found, where richness, cover and biomass were directly related to site quality. The presence of canopy gaps did not have a significant impact on the measured variables. After harvesting, 20 new species appeared from adjacent associated environments (two from N. antarctica forests and 18 from grasslands and peatlands). At the stand level, understory values were higher in AR > DR > DAR > OGF. Most (81-95%) plant richness at baseline conditions was conserved in all treatments, where inside the aggregates understory remained similar to OGF. Combination of aggregated and dispersed retention (DAR) better limited exotic species introduction and protected sensitive species, improving conservation in harvested stands. Changes in understory variables were observed after the first YAH in all treatments; greater changes were observed in the harvested areas than in aggregates. Changes stabilized at the fourth YAH. As a conclusion, the location of retention aggregates should be selected to preserve species understory diversity of more speciose and diverse habitats or particularly uncommon stands. Implementation of different kinds (patterns and levels) of retention for improvement of biodiversity conservation in harvested forests should be included in timber and forest management planning.

Although recent studies have indicated the importance of clear-cuts as alternative habitats for grassland butterflies, there is paucity of studies that directly compare biodiversity and habitat quality between grasslands and clear-cuts using multiple taxa. In this study, we compared the plant and butterfly richness between grasslands and clear-cuts, with a focus on the distribution of butterfly resources (nectaring flowers and host plants) and endangered plant and butterfly species, in a cool temperate area of central Japan. We established three or six transects in five grassland and five clear-cut sites, and measured the richness of plants and butterflies and environmental variables such as vegetation height and coverage at both transect and site levels. At the site level, there were no differences in the richness of all plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants, but there were significant or marginal differences in the richness of endangered plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants. Almost all endangered plants and butterflies were found in the overall grasslands, but only half of the endangered butterfly species were observed in the overall clear-cuts. At the transect level, species richness of endangered plants and butterflies peaked at an intermediate vegetation height. Our results indicate the primary importance of existing semi-natural grasslands and the necessity of management when the vegetation becomes too high. We recommend active creation of clear-cuts near or between the existing grasslands, so that clear-cuts can provide source or backup populations and act as stepping stones to connect the isolated grassland populations.","WOS:000449137300033",1,0.78581954,1

Mowing reduces biomass but is not widely practiced in conservation reserves because of concerns about facilitating exotic plant invasion and altering ecosystem function. We asked whether regular mowing affected (1) the diversity of native and exotic functional groups, (2) spatial turnover in vegetation composition (beta-diversity), (3) vegetation attributes relating to biomass and structural heterogeneity, (4) community composition and (5) the distribution and abundance of individual native and exotic species. Location: Five temperate grassland reserves, south-eastern Australia, encompassing C-3 and C-4 dominated communities. Methods: Vegetation within reserves had been cut to 10 cm, once per year, for 10 years in late spring/early summer to maintain access tracks. We surveyed plant communities in mowed areas and nearby (<5 m) unmowed control areas (40 subplots per reserve, 200 total) and used linear mixed-effects models to examine the effects of mowing. Results: Of 24 functional groups, the richness of 16 native and exotic groups significantly increased with mowing. In 14 of these cases, effects were consistent across C-3- and C-4-dominated grassland. Mowing reduced spatial turnover, but this did not reduce species richness at any spatial scale. When accounting for species abundance and evenness (Shannon diversity), effects of mowing were generally positive for native species and neutral for exotic species. Mowing increased native perennial grass cover and bare earth, decreased exotic perennial grass cover and litter, and changed community composition. Mowing reduced vegetation height but not structural heterogeneity. Mowing positively affected six individual native species and no exotic species. One native (Asperula conferta) and two exotic (Avena spp. and Nassella neesiana) species were found in lower abundance on mowed plots. Conclusions: Annual mowing can be a useful conservation tool for threatened temperate grasslands but should be heterogeneous to ensure the persistence of mowing-sensitive native species. Good vehicle hygiene is essential and localized complementary management (e.g., herbicide) might be required to reduce exotic forbs and grasses.","WOS:000430912500005",16,0.768814945,1

Two fragments of different shapes, squarish and linear, were studied without seed immigration from the outside. Both fragments consisted initially of two patches, a 4-ha clear-cut area and a 1-ha remnant forest, mimicking a common forest management regime in Japan. Stochastic simulations using the model reveal several differences in the dynamics and equilibrium structure of the tree population between the fragments. In the squarish fragment, the forest structure reached an equilibrium state in 500-600 years, but the linear fragment took 2100-2400 years. At equilibrium, the proportion of treeless area was significantly larger in the linear fragment than in the squarish fragment. The mean area of gaps was also larger in the linear fragment. The population expansion rate from the remnant forest into the cleared area differed significantly between the two fragments: 0.63 m year(-1) in the squarish fragment, and 0.43 m year(-1) in the linear fragment. These differences are explained as arising from the spatial configuration of seed dispersal: in the linear fragment, the density of seedlings was lower by half than in the squarish fragment, because a greater proportion of seeds produced within the linear fragment were deposited outside the fragment and were lost. However, the density effect (i.e., one-sided competition among trees) mitigates the negative impact of dispersal loss on the adult population density at equilibrium. Forest fragments with linear shapes should be preferred by fugitive light-demanding species in forested landscapes.","WOS:000221178600011",6,0.761587859,0

In closed canopy mixed oak forest in Sweden, about 25% of the tree basal area and 50-90% of the understory was removed (mainly spruce, birch, aspen, lime, rowan and hazel).

Losses of species were similar in experimental and control plots (15-16%). The harvest increased species richness by 4-31% (mean 18%); also species diversity (H) increased. Several ruderals increased in experimental plots, but most changes occurred in grassland and forest species; partial cutting led to complex, partly unpredictable early changes in the herb community. A review of early effects of partial cutting (eight experiments) indicated that it increases herb species richness in stands of broadleaves, but apparently not in conifer stands; there was no evidence that partial cutting increases species losses. Thus, with respect to early changes after harvest, we found no negative effects of partial cutting on herbs. We suggest, however, that some proportion of closed-canopy mixed oak forest should not be harvested, to protect rare, potentially sensitive herbs, and to create stand diversity.

"1121","tempgrass","Species diversity of woody recruits within Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations established on grasslands: the effects of site conditions and landscape","Plantations established on grasslands have low recruitment of broadleaved trees and therefore may require particular attention when developing biodiversity-oriented management practices. In this study, we tested four hypotheses concerning woody recruits in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations established on grasslands with respect to their distance from the nearest Konara oak (Quercus serrata) forest. Our four hypotheses were as follows: (1) both species richness and occurrence frequency (the number of subplots in which recruits were present) decline with increasing distance; (2) the strength of the effect of distance differs depending on the growth form, seed dispersal type, or life history trait; (3) the species richness of recruits does not increase in response to a disturbance or other site conditions; (4) and species composition of recruits also changes with distance. Our results showed that species richness and occurrence frequency generally declined with increasing distance. This result supports the first hypothesis. The effect of distance was stronger in wind-dispersed species than in bird-dispersed species, as predicted by the second hypothesis. Disturbances such as thinning or wind throw did not increase but rather did decrease species richness, as predicted by the third hypothesis. Furthermore, distance had the strongest impact on species composition, as predicted by the fourth hypothesis. These findings show that, in biodiversity-oriented management, it may be more challenging to increase biodiversity using stand-level management in plantations established on grasslands than in plantations established after clear-cutting of broadleaved forests. Thus, landscape-level management may be required for these cases.","WOS:000433141300003",9,0.753893069,0

The reptile assemblage of these temperate woodlands, while relatively speciose, is believed to be in decline. We report on the abundance and diversity of terrestrial reptiles in native pastures in south-eastern Australia in relation to landscape and local factors; in particular, latitude and grazing management and tree retention. Reptiles were sampled on 24 paired farms spread widely over the south-western slopes of south-eastern Australia. Each pair comprised one farm under rotational grazing and a neighbouring farm with continuous grazing. Twenty-one species were detected, dominated numerically by several skinks and a pygopodid, with clear disparities in the biogeographic distribution of reptiles and also variation owing to survey technique, location, grazing regime, and the presence of trees. Multivariate models showed that the distribution of reptiles is influenced by factors operating at several levels and, to a lesser extent, by farm management. Reptile occurrence was regularly explained by correlations with site-level structural heterogeneity (e.g. native plant richness, number of large trees and log cover) as well as showing strong underlying latitudinal variation. The presence of woodland is critical to reptile occurrence in grazed (and fragmented) landscapes. If the reptile assemblage of this agroecosystem is to benefit from altered farm management, then different management and policy responses may be required, depending on the levels of habitat structural complexity and agricultural intensification that already exist.

PLANTATIONS","Seed banks play a key role in the recruitment of forest vegetation after severe disturbance, but can originate an undesired plant community. Thus, investigations on seed bank structure, and early changes occurring after clear-cut, are of primary interest for sustainable forest management. Researches were carried out in two mature stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) plantations located in Tuscany (Italy), along the Mediterranean coast. Soil samples were collected in March, July and October of the 2nd and 3rd year after clear-cut, in cut strips and adjacent intact stands. Seed bank size and composition were evaluated through the number of seedlings and species emerged from soil samples. Intact plantations differed in seed bank richness and composition, but not in abundance that was approximately 1,200 seeds m(-2). Clear-cut doubled seed density in soil, did not change seed bank richness, and affected markedly composition. Seed banks of cut strips were richer in annual and open space species, and poorer in perennial, forest and disturbed sites species. Seeds of Erica scoparia dominated the seed bank, with a relative abundance of 60% in intact stands and 43% in cut strips. Proportion of annual seeds was slightly less than 20% in intact stands, but increased up to 50% after clear-cut. Between the 2nd and 3rd year from clear-cut, the proportion of seeds from species typical of stone pine forests decreased, while that of non-forest species and aliens increased. The scarcity of seeds from most forest species and the lack of tree seeds make the recruitment of understorey vegetation from seed banks critical. In addition, the increased seed density of alien and disturbed site species in intact seed banks with time from clear-cut, suggests that disturbance caused by cutting in narrow strips threatens the integrity of intact plantations.","WOS:000324790100004",3,0.673171621,1
"259","tempgrass","Impacts of elevated atmospheric CO2 and temperature on plant community structure of a temperate grassland are modulated by cutting frequency","To determine the impacts of climate change and defoliation on the community structure and plant diversity of a semi-natural temperate grassland, monoliths of a permanent grassland were exposed to ambient or elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient + 235 ppmv) and temperature (ambient + VC) from October 1998 to December 2000. The monoliths were subjected to two different cutting frequencies, either two or six cuts per year. The grassland community structure changed during the course of the experiment and was more responsive to changes in management than to changes in climate. Increased cutting frequency stimulated plant diversity by enhancing the number of forb species, but plant diversity was not significantly affected by climate change. The contribution of individual plant species to the vegetation cover revealed species-specific responses to climate change and cutting frequency, but for most species significant interactions between climate change and cutting frequency were present. There were no clear-cut effects of treatments on the total annual yield and the proportion of forbs present, as significant interactions between climate change and cutting frequency occurred. It is concluded that differential grassland management will modify plant species-specific responses to climate change and resulting changes in the botanical composition of mixed-species, temperate grasslands.","WOS:000222181500005",8,0.64754087,0
"266","tempgrass","How should we view temperate semi-natural grasslands? Insights from butterflies in Japan","In humid temperate regions, it has been commonly thought that closed forests represent original states and grasslands are unstable human artifacts that persist only as ""semi-natural"" states. This perspective underrates grasslands, because it makes the recent decline in grassland excusable. A contrasting perspective was recently proposed for temperate Europe and North America, stating that grasslands are intrinsically natural and stable, and hence could have survived without human presence during the postglacial age. However, few quantitative analyses have been performed to test the validity of these two perspectives. Considering that the evolutionary history of species is reflected in species traits, analyzing traits of grassland species in relation to habitat stability is expected to identify the intrinsic nature of grasslands (stable or unstable) and test the validity of these two perspectives. Here, using temperate Japanese butterflies, I compared ecological traits, geographic range, endemism and habitat types in the Eurasian continent between grassland species and forest (stable habitat) and ruderal (unstable habitat) species. I found that grassland butterflies shared similar ecological traits with forest butterflies, but not with ruderal butterflies. Moreover, grassland butterflies were primarily associated with natural and stable steppes and meadows in the Eurasian continent. Furthermore, Japanese grassland species are evolutionarily unique, nurturing many endemic subspecies with narrow geographic ranges. These results indicate that grasslands should not be regarded as unstable, transient, and artificial, but as intrinsically natural and stable in humid temperate regions. These grasslands may have persisted in a stable state without human intervention during the Holocene due to natural disturbances and severe environmental conditions, which are currently immensely suppressed or altered by human. Such perspective also holds true for humid temperate regions in Europe and North America. Thus, temperate semi-natural grasslands should be conserved with high priority in these regions considering that few natural grasslands are left resulting from the present intensive land use pressures and disturbance suppression.

(ii) How does time since the last clear-cut change seed bank composition during post-clear-cut succession? Methods One data set was compiled per succession type using the following selection criteria: (i) the data set included a successional series, (ii) plots were located in mesotrophic forest plant communities and (iii) vegetation data were available. The post-agricultural succession data set comprised 76 recent forest plots (eight studies); the post-clear-cut succession data set comprised 218 ancient forest plots (three studies). Each data set was analysed separately using either linear mixed models or generalized linear models, controlling for both environmental heterogeneity and variation between study locations. Results In the post-agricultural succession data set, land use and time significantly affected nearly all the studied seed bank characteristics. Seed banks on former arable land recovered poorly even after 150 year of restored forest cover, whereas moderate land use intensities (grasslands, heathlands) yielded more rapid seed bank recovery. Time was a significant determinant of all but two soil seed bank characteristics during post-clear-cut succession. Seed banks in managed ancient forest differed strongly in their characteristics compared to primary forest seed banks. Conclusions Forest seed banks bear the marks of former land use and/or forest management and continue to do so for at least 150 years. Nevertheless, time since the last major disturbance, being either former land use or clear-cutting, remains a significant determinant of the seed bank.","WOS:000281551000014",4,0.598512169,1

In this study, we assessed the patterns in communities of birds among forests of varying age consisting of clear-cuts of former coniferous plantations, selectively logged compartments and primary forests in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Birds were surveyed by 10-minute point counts at 174 randomly located points in nine forest areas during September-October 2011. A total of 2 688 birds representing 115 species were recorded. The species density, diversity and dominance of all birds, and dominance of forest specialists showed no differences between forest areas, whereas the species density and diversity of forest specialists differed significantly between forest areas. The composition of communities of all birds and of forest specialists varied significantly among the forest areas. Our results show that even after 19 and 43 years, respectively, communities of birds in clear-cuts of former coniferous plantations and selectively logged forests have not fully recovered from the disturbances of logging, highlighting the need to preserve primary forests for conservation of birds.","WOS:000370812200007",1,0.910222351,1

Hook., Pinus massoniana Lamb., and hardwood forest in southeastern China is a major assemblage in natural secondary forests, and of national and international importance in terms of both timber and ecosystem services. However, over-harvesting has threatened its long-term sustainability, and there is a knowledge gap relating to the effect of harvesting on the ecosystem. After conifer species were selected for harvesting, the mixed Chinese fir, pine, and hardwood forest was changed into mixed evergreen broadleaf forest. In this context, we observed the restoration dynamics of plant communities over a period of 15 years (1996 to 2011) with different levels of harvesting intensity, including selective harvesting at low (13.0% removal of growing stock volume), medium (29.1%), high (45.8%), and extra-high (67.1%) intensities, as well as clear-cut harvesting (100.0%), with non-harvesting as the control, based on permanent sample plots established in a randomized block design in these forests in southeastern China. The impact on the richness, diversity, and evenness of plant species derived from descriptive statistical analyses was shown to initially increase, and then decrease, with an increase in harvesting intensity. The most critical impacts were on the richness, diversity, and evenness of shrub and herb species. Richness, diversity, and evenness of plant species recovered and increased under selective harvesting at low and medium intensities, while these parameters had not recovered and significantly decreased under selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities, as well as with clear-cut harvesting. The impact on the plant community stability was derived from the stability test method of the improved Godron M. The plant community stability was closest to the point of stability (20/80) under selective harvesting at medium intensity, followed by selective harvesting at low intensity. The plant community stability was far from the point of stability (20/80) under selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities, as well as with clear-cut harvesting. Of these treatments, clear-cut harvesting had the greatest effect with regard to reducing stability. Therefore, these results indicate that the selective harvesting at low and medium intensities is conducive to preserve or increase the species diversity and community stability. In order to prioritize promoting plant species diversity, clear-cut harvesting and selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities should be avoided with regard to this type of forest in this region. This study sheds light on the practice of forest operation in the study region and subtropical forests with the same environment.","WOS:000424115000039",2,0.728104289,0

We assessed the patterns in tree communities in logged and primary forests in Kibale National Park, Uganda, representing 9- to 19-year-old clear-cuts of former conifer plantations, 42- to 43-year-old logged forests and primary forests. Species density and diversity were lower and dominance higher in the 9- to 19-year-old forests compared to the 42- to 43-year-old forests or primary forests. The tree species density, diversity and dominance of 42- to 43-year-old forests did not differ significantly from primary forests. However, they had a lower stem density, and higher cover of Acanthus pubescens, a shrub known to arrest the succession in Kibale. The tree community compositions of 9- to 19-year-old, 42- to 43-year-old and primary forests differed from each other. A large group of tree species (21) were primary forest indicators, that is, they were either missing or relatively rare in logged forests. The results of this study show that even after four decades of natural recovery, logged Afrotropical forests can still be distinguished from primary forests in their tree community compositions, emphasizing the slow community recovery and the important role of primary forests when preserving the tree communities in tropical rainforests.","WOS:000376151600010",3,0.880359391,1

We hypothesised that species number, cover of herbs and mosses is higher in the edge, and species penetrates from nearby grasslands into forest interior. The study was conducted in the Southwestern Lithuania. The edge effect on overall herbaceous species composition of coniferous forests was evaluated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The species richness of herbs and mosses in the coniferous forest was highest in the forest edge and declined towards interior. The highest decrease in the number of species occurred within 0 to 5 m to the edge. The highest cover of herbs and mosses was in the forest edge and decreased towards the forest interior. CCA biplot showed a good correlation of overall species composition and the distance to the forest edge. Distribution of species along edge to interior gradient depended on the species response to different ecological factors. Ellenberg value of light was higher in the edge.

Their structures and ecological functions are complex to understand. Functional group is defined as a group of species that play similar roles in an ecosystem. The functional group approach has been regarded as an effective way of linking the compositions of complex ecosystems with their ecological functions. To understand the variation of functional groups in species-rich ecosystems after disturbance, the present study investigated the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of woody plants in a typically fragmented natural forest landscape of Hainan Island in South China. The study area was classified into eight landscape types based on vegetation type, disturbance manner and the time of recovery. The woody plant species were aggregated into seven functional groups based on the growth form, successional status and plant size. The results gained from the present study showed that all functional groups, except for the emergent and canopy tree species, were present in all eight landscape types. Each landscape type had different numbers of dominant functional groups. There are similar species richness and stem abundance structure among functional groups between mid-successional clear cut lowland rainforest and old growth tropical coniferous forest. This similarity exists in selective logged lowland rainforest and old-growth lowland rainforest, as well as among landscape types of montane rainforest. The functional groups with the same successional status had similar patterns of species richness and stem abundance ratios among different landscape types. The variation patterns of functional groups along the successional stages in terms of species richness and stem abundance among the tropical lowland rainforest landscape types were more similar to each other than those in the tropical montane rainforest landscape types. This study provides further support for the competition-colonization tradeoff and successional niche theory as opposed to models of neutrality and ecological equivalence.","WOS:000255464400005",5,0.792370966,1

Litter decomposition was chosen as the focal process because it plays a central role in stream ecosystems and is easy to study in the field. Impacts of two stressors that occur across the continent, nutrient pollution and modified riparian vegetation, were examined at >200 paired sites in nine European ecoregions. In response to the former, decomposition was dramatically slowed at both extremes of a 1000-fold nutrient gradient, indicating nutrient limitation in unpolluted sites, highly variable responses across Europe in moderately impacted streams, and inhibition via associated toxic and additional stressors in highly polluted streams. Riparian forest modification by clear cutting or replacement of natural vegetation by plantations (e.g. conifers, eucalyptus) or pasture produced similarly complex responses. Clear effects caused by specific riparian disturbances were observed in regionally focused studies, but general trends across different types of riparian modifications were not apparent, in part possibly because of important indirect effects. Complementary field and laboratory experiments were undertaken to tease apart the mechanistic drivers of the continental scale field bioassays by addressing the influence of litter, fungal and detritivore diversity. These revealed generally weak and context-dependent effects on decomposition, suggesting high levels of redundancy (and hence potential insurance mechanisms that can mitigate a degree of species loss) within the food web. Reduced species richness consistently increased decomposition variability, if not the absolute rate. Further field studies were aimed at identifying important sources of this variability (e.g. litter quality, temporal variability) to help constrain ranges of predicted decomposition rates in different field situations. Thus, although many details still need to be resolved, litter decomposition holds considerable potential in some circumstances to capture impairment of stream ecosystem functioning. For instance, species traits associated with the body size and metabolic capacity of the consumers were often the main driver at local scales, and these were often translated into important determinants of otherwise apparently contingent effects at larger scales. Key insights gained from conducting continental scale studies included resolving the apparent paradox of inconsistent relationships between nutrients and decomposition rates, as the full complex multidimensional picture emerged from the large-scale dataset, of which only seemingly contradictory fragments had been seen previously.","WOS:000399647700004",6,0.423499499,1
"714","tropconif","Conifer seedling response to northern temperate forest gaps","Studies of gap dynamics have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of small-scale disturbance in forest ecosystems, but have been little used by foresters for predicting tree responses to partial cutting. Fifth year growth and survival of five commonly planted tree species were contrasted in canopy gaps (single-tree to 5000 m(2)), in the forest understory and in the open conditions of a clear-cut. There were strong and consistent trends in growth response among the tree species as gap size increased. Growth of all the species increased rapidly from small single-tree gaps to about 1000 m(2) gaps, but thereafter, showed little change up to 5000 m(2). Tree size and current growth rates for all species were highest in full open conditions. Performance of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the most light-demanding species, exceeded that of all other species in large gaps (1001-5000 m(2)) and clearcuts. In large and medium gaps (301-1000 m(2)), the largest trees of all species were found in the middle gap position and there was little difference between the sunny north and shady south positions, except for lodgepole pine which clearly grew poorly in the south position. Total size and growth rates of all species were nearly identical in small gaps (20-300 m(2)) and again in the forest understory. The light advantage expected off the north end of high latitude gaps was not a benefit for tree growth, suggesting that below-ground effects of canopy edge trees have an important influence on seedling growth in these forests. Differences in mortality among the tree species were evident, with the most light demanding species having the greatest early mortality in shaded areas of medium gaps, in small gaps and in the forest understory. Careful matching of tree species to gap size and gap position can minimize early mortality and maximize growth rates. Opening sizes need not be very large (0.1-0.2 ha or larger) in order for most tree species to achieve growth rates similar to those found in the open conditions of clearcuts.

"812","tropconif","Site and neighborhood effects on growth of tree saplings in subtropical plantations (China)","Reforestation and afforestation often takes place in the form of monocultures. These have increasingly come under criticism due to their greater susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions and pathogens and because of the negative long-term impacts they have on soil fertility. Moreover, reservations have frequently been expressed as to whether monoculture is the only way to maximize biomass productivity. Subtropical forests in China are not only rich in tree species but are also diverse in terms of topography. However, historical clear-cutting and the high demand for wood have meant that considerable areas of these forests have been degraded or lost entirely. In recent years, great efforts have been made in subtropical China to restore and afforest vast areas. Nonetheless, conifer monoculture plantations are still prevalent owing to the lack of data on the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and the limited knowledge of the growth performance of native broad-leaved tree species in plantations in this region. In this study, we investigated the growth response of individual tree saplings in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment established in a highly heterogeneous environment in subtropical China (BEF-China). The experiment was established during the period November 2008 to April 2009 and incorporates a species pool of 24 tree species across 261 plots (0.067 ha each) and a broad richness gradient with 1-24 species per plot. Annual growth rates of tree height, stem diameter and crown width for 6723 saplings of 24 species in the third year after establishment were used as response variables. We analyzed the effects of initial size, local abiotic site conditions and local neighborhood on growth performance using mixed effects models. Initial size, local topographic (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation) and edaphic variables (total nitrogen, C/N ratio) as well as local neighborhood variables (competition index, Shannon index) were included as fixed effects. Random effects were plot and species identity. The results showed that growth performance of tree saplings was markedly species-specific and strongly affected by initial size and local site conditions. In this early stage of the experiment, local Shannon diversity did not yet explain a significant amount of variation in sapling growth. However, the significant effect of the increasing size of neighboring trees indicated that tree-tree interactions had already occurred. A greater investment in height growth at the expense of diameter growth suggested that light intercept is the priority for tree sapling growth. This study stresses the importance of better understanding the effects of local site conditions on initial growth in mixed-species plantations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We trapped butterflies monthly along a successional gradient for one year. Traps were placed in intact primary forest compartments, heavily logged forest compartments with and without arboricide treatment approximately 43years ago, and in conifer-clearcut compartments, ranging from 9 to 19years of age. The species richness, total abundance, diversity, dominance, and similarity of the community composition of butterflies in the eight compartments were compared with uni- and multivariate statistics. A total of 16,728 individuals representing 88 species were trapped during the study. Butterfly species richness, abundance, and diversity did not show an increasing trend along the successional gradient but species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate stages. There was monthly variation in species richness, abundance, diversity and composition. Butterfly community structure differed significantly among the eight successional stages and only a marginal directional change along the successional gradient emerged. The greatest number of indicator species and intact forest interior specialists were found in one of the primary forests. Our results show that forest disturbance has a long-term impact on the recovery of butterfly species composition, emphasizing the value of intact primary forests for butterfly conservation.","WOS:000332089400011",9,0.936484408,1

Here we evaluate the long-term effects of selective logging and forest multiple-use on Southern Brazilian subtropical Araucaria mixed conifer-hardwood forest resilience at the landscape-scale. Long-term effects of different management regimes were compared between control undisturbed forests and forest stands subjected to early (55 years before this study) and recent (13 years) selective logging followed by undisturbed postharvest periods, and forest fragments subjected to selective logging followed by unregulated multiple-use by private landowners. Forest structure (tree density, basal area and height, and regeneration density) in early-logged areas was indistinguishable from control areas. Fragmentation and chronic disturbance, however, degraded forest fragments and kept them at early successional stages, with higher tree density, reduced basal area and scarce or absent regeneration. Mixed forests showed compositional resilience in the angiosperm component but not in the conifer component. Chronic disturbance kept forest fragments floristically away from mature and undisturbed secondary forests. Species richness in control and recently-logged plots did not differ significantly and was higher than richness in early-logged plots. Species richness was much reduced in degraded forest fragments. Density of the conifer Araucaria angustifolia, characteristic of the mature forest, was reduced in the fragments and in logged stands.

I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged Lit low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community cornposition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected Lit HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result ill significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park.

Previous studies in this ecosystem have focused on vertebrates, while only a few studies have been performed on the relationship between spiders and pine plantations. We aimed to estimate changes in spider richness and species composition over the course of a pine plantation forestry cycle of 15 years. We expected that the increase in environmental similarity (vegetation, prey availability) between native forest and tree plantations through the plantation growth cycle would promote its use by native spider species. We used six collection methods to characterize the spider assemblages and their potential prey in five replicates of native forest and pine plantations of three different ages representing the forest cycle (1-2, 5-6, 10-11 years old). Additionally, we described vegetation structure and recorded ground temperature and humidity during the sampling period. Analyses were carried out combining spiders from all sampling methods and independently on each vertical stratum. As expected, spider richness increased and the dissimilarity in relation to the native forest spider community decreased through the growth cycle of the pine plantation, associated with an increase in potential prey abundance and richness (but not vegetation structure). The response of spiders on each stratum showed interesting trends; opposite to the general pattern, in young plantations the ground strata exhibited a rich and distinctive spider assemblage while herbaceous strata showed similar diversity (richness and species composition) in all three plantation ages. Our results showed a rapid increase in spider richness in the first 6-7 years after plantation and a subsequent stabilization. Also, the proportion of native species in plantations increased from 6% in the first years to 34% and then remained constant until cutting age (11-12 years). Differences in species composition were mainly due to both differences in richness and species composition in young plantations, while in middle-aged and mature plantations it was mainly due to species replacement. The increase in prey abundance (and probably the increase in vegetation complexity and the decrease of extreme microclimatic conditions) through the plantation cycle increase the suitability for native forest species. However, a deeper understanding of the ecological and physiological requirements of spiders is necessary to improve the ability of tree plantations for native diversity.","WOS:000437967900050",12,0.825134896,1
"1311","tropconif","Changes of dominant ground beetles in black pine forests with fire severity and successional age","This study analyzes the effect of fire on the composition and abundance of ground beetles in Pinus nigra forests. We used pitfall traps to sample beetles in burned P.nigra forests in Catalonia (Spain). Since fire dramatically alters forest structure and composition and beetles follow vegetation changes, we expected drastic changes in beetle composition and abundance immediately after fire. Because P.nigra forests do not recover after fire, we also expected beetles in burned and unburned areas to differ along a chronosequence. Beetle abundance per plot increased in canopy-fire-burned areas, but per plot species richness, diversity, and dominance were not affected by fire. Species composition varied depending on fire intensity. Some species were associated with canopy fire and low vegetation cover. Other species were associated with shrub cover and time since fire. Finally, some species were not dependent on fire or vegetation cover. Beetle abundance in burned areas was independent of time since fire. This lack of medium-term convergence between burned and unburned P.nigra forest agrees with our second hypothesis. Given the increase in fire frequency and size in submediterranean areas and the observed slow recovery of beetle species, a decline ill beetle diversity at a regional scale is expected.","WOS:000261940600004",13,0.839891097,0
"1410","tropconif","Effect of forest management on temperate ant communities","Human management of ecosystems can have direct or indirect effects on species communities. How species communities are affected by management is a key question in ecology and nature conservation. As keystone taxon, changes in ant communities can have sustained consequences for entire ecosystems. In forests, management has been shown to have an overall negative effect on ant communities in tropical and a positive effect in boreal forests. However, in temperate forests, it is unclear what components of forest management affect ant communities and how. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of forest management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in 150 temperate forest stands in three regions in Germany. Using a multi-model inference approach and structural equation models, we analyzed the effects of 18 variables, including variables of forest management, forest structure, arthropod diversity, and biomass, as well as abiotic factors, on ant species richness, abundance, and functional trait diversity (Rao's Q) based on morphological (FDM) and life-history traits (FDLH). In total, we found 28 ant species occurring on 120 plots. Main direct effects of forest management on ant abundance and species richness were caused by tree species selection, measured as dominant tree species. The main positive indirect effect was mediated by a reduced canopy cover with an increasing proportion of oak and pine, resulting in a higher temperature amplitude. Due to the low number of species in two regions, we analyzed functional diversity for the most ant species diverse region only. FDLH was affected positively by tree harvesting and negatively by structural complexity. FDM showed no response to forest management, potentially due to the low morphological diversity of temperate forest ants. Our results show that forest management practices in temperate forests strongly impact ant community structure. This can be beneficial for ants if management reduces the canopy cover, either by tree harvesting or by changing the tree species composition toward shade-intolerant tree species. To promote ant diversity as key taxon for maintaining ecosystem processes in forest ecosystems, we suggest to integrate forest stands with more open and warmer conditions in future management strategics.","WOS:000439997600019",14,0.902671294,1
"158","tropconif","Characterization of Unexplored Deadwood Mycobiome in Highly Diverse Subtropical Forests Using Culture-independent Molecular Technique","The deadwood mycobiome, also known as wood-inhabiting fungi (WIF), are among the key players in wood decomposition, having a large impact on nutrient cycling in forest soils. However, our knowledge of WIF richness and distribution patterns in different forest biomes is limited. Here, we used pyrotag sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region to characterize the deadwood mycobiome of two tree species with greatly different wood characteristics (Schima superba and Pinus massoniana) in a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. Specifically, we tested (i) the effects of tree species and wood quality properties on WIF OTU richness and community composition; (ii) the role of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the WIF communities; and (iii) the relationship between WIF OTU richness, community composition and decomposition rates. Due to different wood chemical properties, we hypothesized that the WIF communities derived from the two tree species would be correlated differently with biotic and abiotic factors. Our results show that deadwood in subtropical forests harbors diverse fungal communities comprising six ecological functional groups. We found interesting colonization patterns for this subtropical biome, where Resinicium spp. were highly detected in both broadleaved and coniferous deadwood. In addition, the members of Xylariales were frequently found in Schima. The two deadwood species differed significantly in WIF OTU richness (Pinus > Schima) and community composition (P < 0.001). Variations in WIF community composition of both tree species were significantly explained by wood pH and ecological factors (biotic: deadwood species, basal area and abiotic: soil pH), but the WIF communities derived from each tree species correlated differently with abiotic factors. Interestingly, we found that deadwood decomposition rate significantly correlated with WIF communities and negatively correlated with WIF OTU richness. We conclude that the pattern of WIF OTU richness and community composition are controlled by multiple interacting biotic and abiotic factors. Overall, our study provides an in-depth picture of the deadwood mycobiome in this subtropical forest. Furthermore, by comparing our results to results from temperate and boreal forests we contribute to a better understanding of patterns of WIF communities across different biomes and geographic locations.","WOS:000399525200001",15,0.629455618,0
"1612","tropconif","Geographic locality and host identity shape fungal endophyte communities in cupressaceous trees","Understanding how fungal endophyte communities differ in abundance, diversity, taxonomic composition, and host affinity over the geographic ranges of their hosts is key to understanding the ecology and evolutionary context of endophyte-plant associations. We examined endophytes associated with healthy photosynthetic tissues of three closely related tree species in the Cupressaceae (Coniferales): two native species within their natural ranges [Juniperus virginiana in a mesic semideciduous forest, North Carolina (NC); Cupressus arizonica, under xeric conditions, Arizona (AZ)], and a non-native species planted in each site (Platycladus orientalis). Endophytes were recovered from 229 of 960 tissue segments and represented at least 35 species of Ascomycota. Isolation frequency was more than threefold greater for plants in NC than in AZ, and was 2.5 (AZ) to four (NC) times greater for non-native Platycladus than for Cupressus or Juniperus. Analyses of ITS rDNA for 109 representative isolates showed that endophyte diversity was more than twofold greater in NC than in AZ, and that endophytes recovered in AZ were more likely to be host-generalists relative to those in NC. Different endophyte genera dominated the assemblages of each host species/locality combination, but in both localities, Platycladus harboured less diverse and more cosmopolitan endophytes than did either native host. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses for four classes of Ascomycota (Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Eurotiomycetes) based on LSU rDNA data (ca 1.2 kb) showed that well-supported clades of endophytes frequently contained representatives of a single locality or host species, underscoring the importance of both geography and host identity in shaping a given plant's endophyte community. Together, our data show that not only do the abundance, diversity, and taxonomic composition of endophyte communities differ as a function of host identity and locality, but that host affinities of those communities are variable as well.

In this paper, saproxylic beetle assemblages associated with different host trees in the subtropical forests in southwestern China were investigated. A total of 277 species (1439 specimens) in 36 beetle families were collected from 117 dead wood samples, of which 101 samples were identified and respectively belonged to 12 tree genera. The number of saproxylic beetle species varied greatly among logs of different tree genera, with the highest diversity on logs of Juglans. Generally, broad-leaved trees had a higher richness and abundance of saproxylic species than coniferous trees. Cluster analysis revealed that assemblages from broad-leaved tree genera were generally similar (except for Betula) and assemblages from coniferous trees formed another distinct cluster. The subsequent indicator analysis proposed that there are different characteristic species for different cluster groups of host tree genera. In our study, log diameter has no positive influence on beetle species density. Conversely, comparisons of individual-based rarefaction curves suggested that beetle species richness was highest in the small diameter class both in coniferous and broad-leaved tree genera. With increased wood decay, proportion of habitat specialists (saproxylic beetles living on one tree genus) decreased, whereas proportion of habitat generalists (living on more than three tree genera) increased. The beetle species density was found to be higher in early stages, and decreased in later stages as well. A negative influence of altitude on saproxylic beetle species richness and abundance was detected. It was indicated that different tree genera and altitudes possibly display cross effects in modulating the altitudinal distribution and host preference of the beetles.","WOS:000256312700008",17,0.740605054,0

We examined the extent to which Afrotemperate forest has recovered from widespread, stand-levelling logging that followed the European settlement of south eastern South Africa approximately 150 years ago. We used plot-based tree census data to compare ecological characteristics (diversity, composition, structure) of primary, secondary and degraded Afrotemperate forests. Forests impacted by colonial logging events show no evidence of converging on the composition and above ground standing stock of old-growth forests. Primary forest canopies were dominated by two conifer species (Podocarpaceae) and a suite of long-lived pioneer angiosperms dominated the canopies of secondary forests. Old-growth canopy trees (>= 20 cm dbh) were taller (similar to 26 m vs similar to 16 m) and had broader girths (similar to 94 cm vs similar to 54 cm) compared with those in secondary forest. Canopy tree size differences translated to considerable (2 to 3-fold) differences in above ground carbon: we estimated that primary forest stores >240 Mg C ha(-1) compared with the range of 80.7-114.3 Mg C ha(-1) estimated for the two secondary forests and 84.3 Mg C ha(-1) for the degraded forest. Measures of rarefied species richness and diversity (Shannon exponential) were markedly lower for primary forest canopy trees, consistent with the proposition that the composition of Afrotemperate forests converges on podocarp dominance at the old-growth stage. In contrast, diversity measures for small (2.5-10.0 cm dbh) and medium (10.1-19.9 cm dbh) trees were noticeably higher in secondary and degraded forests indicating the considerable conservation value of these formerly disturbed forests.

We collected dead wood-dwelling arthropods from April 2010 to October 2011 by using a vacuum aspirator and an electric chain saw in three areas (Mt. Woonak, Mt. Wolchul, Mt. Jingang) in Korea. We identified them to species levels and classified them into functional groups. We collected 8792 arthropods (5 classes, 20 orders, 58 families, and 93 species). The species richness and abundance of arthropods increased with the progress of decay in dead woods. The evenness index seemed to be shown at a lower value at late decay stage than at early- and mid-decay stages. The diversity index (H) in conifers was lower than that in deciduous dead woods at the early decay stage but this situation was reversed at the late decay stage. Arthropod communities of functional groups, except the xylophagous insects, did not differ in the variables, but the proportion of xylophagous insects increased as the decay stages progressed. The abundance of arthropods and xylophagous was statistically significantly different. The patterns generated by non-metric multidimensional scaling in the overall arthropod community composition revealed that the species composition between study areas were significantly different. We confirmed that dead woods play very important roles as arthropods' habitats. Thus, we suggest that the role of dead woods should be emphasized in the management of forest ecosystems.","WOS:000325094900005",19,0.642772947,0

However, these plantations can have adverse environmental effects if improperly managed. To evaluate the effect of forest management practices on biodiversity, the diversity, species richness, dominance and frequency of understory woody plant species in different forests of the Basque Country (northern Spain) were compared. Plantations of exotic conifers (Pinus radiata [D.] Don) of different ages were compared with deciduous forests of Quercus robur L. and Fagus sylvatica L. The effects of different types and intensities of management were taken into account. The differences observed were mainly conditioned by the intensity of forestry management, although the response varied according to forest type and age. In unmanaged pine plantations, the diversity and species richness of the understory increased rapidly after planting (while dominance decreased), remained stable in the intermediate age range, and reached a maximum in plantations more than 25 years of age. Management practices resulted in decreased understory diversity and species richness, as well as greater dominance. This was more pronounced in younger than in older stands. Moderate management, however, favored a greater diversity of the understory in deciduous forests. The species composition of the plantations and deciduous forests were different, the latter having a wider range of characteristic species. Knowledge of how forestry practices influence biodiversity (in terms of diversity, richness, dominance, and species composition) may allow predictions to be made about the diversity achievable with different management systems.","WOS:000227236800005",21,0.882087892,1

Data on the structure and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Bialowieza National Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species. Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95% of the 135-140 pristine species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80% of the Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands. The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated ""island"", in which preservation of the primeval forest features seems to be impossible.

Nonetheless, the potential for species' range shift responses has recently become severely limited, as exceptionally fast temperature changes coincide with a high degree of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. This study provides rare insights into the effects current temperature increases have on pristine temperate forest ecosystems, using the forests of Changbai Mountain, NE China, as a case study. On the northern slopes of the mountain at elevations between 750 and 2100 m, the composition of trees, shrubs and herbaceous species was recorded on 60 plots in 1963 and 2006/07. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to establish the response of plant diversity and plant distribution patterns to environmental conditions. Climatic factors proved important in explaining the spatio-temporal trends within the vegetation. The composition of dominant trees remained mostly unchanged over the last 43 years, reflecting a very slow response of the forest canopy to environmental change. The composition of young trees, shrubs and herb species showed varied changes in the different forest types. A homogeneous species composition in the cohort of regenerating trees indicates an increased future uniformity in the mixed broadleaved and coniferous forest. The understory vegetation of high elevation birch forests was invaded by floristic elements of the lower-elevation coniferous forests. Both these trends pose potential threats to forests plant diversity. Future research investigating climate change responses in forest canopy composition needs to be based on even longer timescales, while investigations in the near future need to pay particular attention to the changes in the distribution of rare and threatened herbaceous species.

It was established in 1960 to protect the virgin Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) mixed hardwood forest, a typical temperate forest of northeast China. Studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forest (800-1700 m a.s.l.) were conducted in 1963 and in 2006. The aim of this comparison was to assess the long-term effects of the protected status on plant biodiversity during the intervening 43 years. The research was carried out in three forest types: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found to differ for the same elevations and forest types after the 43-year interval, while the beta diversity indicated by the Cody index depicted the altitudinal patterns of plant species gain and loss. The floral compositional pattern and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layer, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF. However, originally dominant species, such as Pinus koraiensis, tended to decline, the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers showed a trend to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the understory fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. A comparison of the alpha diversity indices among the three forest types reveals that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased, and some rare and medicinal species disappeared. Meteorological records show that climate has changed significantly in this 43-year intervening period, and information collected from another field survey found that the most severe human disturbances to the CNR forests stemmed from the exploitation of Ginseng roots and Korean pine nuts.","WOS:000263175800010",60,0.887638879,0

Against this trend, the area of intensively managed plantation forests increases, and there is much debate about the implications for biodiversity. We provide a comprehensive review of the function of plantation forests as habitat compared with other land cover, examine the effects on biodiversity at the landscape scale, and synthesise context-specific effects of plantation forestry on biodiversity. Natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests but there is abundant evidence that plantation forests can provide valuable habitat, even for some threatened and endangered species, and may contribute to the conservation of biodiversity by various mechanisms. In landscapes where forest is the natural land cover, plantation forests may represent a low-contrast matrix, and afforestation of agricultural land can assist conservation by providing complementary forest habitat, buffering edge effects, and increasing connectivity. In contrast, conversion of natural forests and afforestation of natural non-forest land is detrimental. However, regional deforestation pressure for agricultural development may render plantation forestry a 'lesser evil' if forest managers protect indigenous vegetation remnants. We provide numerous context-specific examples and case studies to assist impact assessments of plantation forestry, and we offer a range of management recommendations.

Forest edges have been well studied in temperate and tropical forests, but less so in less productive, disturbance-adapted boreal forests. We synthesized data on forest vegetation at edges of boreal forests and compared edge influence among edge types (fire, cut, lake/wetland; old vs. young), forest types (broadleaf vs. coniferous) and geographic regions. Our objectives were to quantify vegetation responses at edges of all types and to compare the strength and extent of edge influence among different types of edges and forests. Research was conducted using the same general sampling design in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in Sweden and Finland. We conducted a meta-analysis for a variety of response variables including forest structure, deadwood abundance, regeneration, understorey abundance and diversity, and non-vascular plant cover. We also determined the magnitude and distance of edge influence (DEI) using randomization tests. Some edge responses (lower tree basal area, tree canopy and bryophyte cover; more logs; higher regeneration) were significant overall across studies. Edge influence on ground vegetation in boreal forests was generally weak, not very extensive (DEI usually <20m) and decreased with time. We found more extensive edge influence at natural edges, at younger edges and in broadleaf forests. The comparison among regions revealed weaker edge influence in Fennoscandian forests.Synthesis. Edges created by forest harvesting do not appear to have as strong, extensive or persistent influence on vegetation in boreal as in tropical or temperate forested ecosystems. We attribute this apparent resistance to shorter canopy heights, inherent heterogeneity in boreal forests and their adaptation to frequent natural disturbance. Nevertheless, notable differences between forest structure responses to natural (fire) and anthropogenic (cut) edges raise concerns about biodiversity implications of extensive creation of anthropogenic edges. By highlighting universal responses to edge influence in boreal forests that are significant irrespective of edge or forest type, and those which vary by edge type, we provide a context for the conservation of boreal forests.","WOS:000353640500003",87,0.822623503,1

Attributes relating to proximate land-use, patch shape, isolation and position in the landscape were used to determine putative causes of forest change. The total change in forest area was -5.7% (forest covered 6739 ha in 1996). This is contrasted with previous reports for the period 1880-1940 that estimated change in total forest area of up to -80%. Attrition was the predominant process of forest transformation between 1944 and 1996. Despite little overall change in forest area, 786 mostly small (<0.5 ha) forest patches were lost from the landscape, leaving 1277 forest patches in 1996. An increase in patch isolation, but no change in patch cohesion accompanied the changes in forest area. Ignoring patches that were eliminated, 514 patches decreased in area. This was partly a function of patch size, but the conversion of natural grassland to commercial plantation forestry in the matrix also influenced forest decline. Their small size and irregular shape caused forest patches in the region to be vulnerable to edge effects. Core area declined in a negative exponential way with increasing edge width and the total area of edge habitat exceeded that of core habitat at an edge width of only 50 m. Nevertheless, total core area decreased by only 2%, (65 ha) between 1944 and 1996 because most of the eliminated patches were small and contained no core area.

Large areas of native forests and grasslands are being turned into tree plantations without assessing their impacts on natural communities. We evaluated the effects of replacing native forests by non-native pine (Pinus taeda) plantations on the diversity and composition of assemblages of terrestrial mammals and ground-dwelling and understory birds, in a forest productive landscape of the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina. Camera-trap stations were deployed in three different ""environments"": 53 in a continuous forest, 69 in forest fragments, and 62 in tree plantations. The evaluation focused on the effect of the environment, the structural complexity of the vegetation, the cost-distance (distance weighted by connectivity) to the continuous forest, the percentage of native forest within different radii, and the cost of human access (as a proxy for hunting pressure) on both mean species richness per station and species composition. Alpha diversity of the assemblages of each environment was estimated using Hill numbers (effective number of species): (q(0) = richness, q(1) = number of common species and q(2) = number of dominant species. Changes in community composition were evaluated by comparing the assemblages of the three environments using three similarity indices: Sorensen (q(0) = similarity in species identity), Horn (q(1) = similarity in common species), and Morisita-Horn (q(2) = similarity in dominant species). For mammals and birds, richness was significantly higher in forest stations (both continuous and fragmented) than in those located in plantations. For both taxa, it also decreased with the distance to the continuous forest (but with a negative quadratic term in birds). Tree plantation stands contained biased and impoverished subsets of the original assemblages. Mammal composition was affected by the environment, the distance to the continuous forest, the proportion of native forest in the landscape, and human access. The bird assemblages of plantations were seriously affected, and their composition was also influenced by changes in vegetation structure. Alternative management practices (e.g. pruning, thinning) and landscape features can partially mitigate the negative effect of tree plantations on mammal and bird assemblages. Large areas of forest that function as population sources and forest fragments immersed in the matrix of plantations are strictly necessary to preserve the original native mammal and bird assemblages in the productive landscape. Promoting connectivity and improving hunting controls will also support their conservation.","WOS:000437967900021",206,0.953668893,1

Based on the distribution pattern of 146 bird species, sites were assigned to one of three bird communities (birds of moist forest, dry forest or degraded savanna), each occupying a well-defined position along an environmental gradient reflecting decreasing vegetation structure and density. All three communities were representative of the avifauna of Afrotropical Highland open forest and woodland with a high proportion of invasive and competitive generalist species (31%). Apart from these, exclosures shared more species with forest fragments (20%) than did the grazed matrix (5%), indicating local ecosystem recovery. By increasing habitat heterogeneity, exclosures have the potential to enhance landscape connectivity for forest birds and are, therefore, an effective instrument for conserving species in a fragmented landscape. However, 52 bird species (36%) occurred exclusively within forest patches and many forest birds that use exclosures are unlikely to maintain viable populations when forest fragments disappear, particularly as forest fragments may be a critical resource during the hot dry season. This highlights the high conservation value of small isolated forest fragments for less tolerant, forest-limited and/or biome-restricted species.","WOS:000252302300005",12,0.953613425,1

Using a random design and a density of approximately one plot per 2 ha in all fragments, 31 20x20 m plots were sampled. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests yielded five communities representing two forest types and one degraded savanna habitat. The forest fragments had a species-poor tree and shrub community in which plots were rather homogeneous and most species abundant. NMDS and analysis of variance indicated that a topographical gradient correlated to soil phosphorus, soil depth, stoniness and the proximity to the river system explained the major differences in species composition and separated moist and dry Afromontane forest communities. The grazing intensity further partitioned the habitats. Present communities and their environmental correlates indicate that the secondary climax forest in the area probably consisted of dry Afromontane forest interlaced by broad strips of moist Afromontane forest along rivers and streams and not a continuous, mono-dominant Juniperus forest as is often presumed. Negative effects of the degraded matrix on forest fragments increased with decreasing patch area and increasing shape irregularity. Nevertheless, all remaining fragments are important for their role in the landscape ecology of the region as refuges and species pools and should be protected and managed accordingly. If seed dispersal from forest fragments into exclosures and subsequent tree recruitment are both successful, the vegetation type most likely to establish is Afromontane savanna woodland, and if managed properly, eventually dry Afromontane forest may arise. Increasing the size of small patches and placing forest plantations and exclosures in the vicinity of small forest fragments is expected to yield the most immediate results. This approach may increase the likelihood of patch colonisation by frugivorous forest birds and thus foster the regeneration of native woody species.","WOS:000241164000010",62,0.940394996,1
"516","tropgrass","Matrix effects on bird assemblages in fragmented Afromontane forests in South Africa","We examine the effects of matrix type on forest bird species richness in historically fragmented forests of the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa. Bird species-area relationships for forest fragments within natural grassland were compared with those surrounded by plantation forestry (Pinus spp.). While fragments in grasslands displayed a species-area effect, no such effect (slope similar to0) was detected for fragments in plantations. The critical fragment size to avoid an island effect on species richness was 302 ha for fragments in grasslands, and contained 51 of the 61 forest bird species encountered. Small forest fragments (<50 ha) within grasslands were less species-rich than those surrounded by plantation, while the reverse was true for forests larger than 50 ha. Bird density was significantly lower in larger forest patches within plantation when compared to those in grassland. However, a slight decline in species density with increasing species richness in a patch (i.e. weak density compensation) characterised only those bird assemblages surrounded by a grassland matrix, suggesting these are approaching species saturation. Commercial plantations may increase the likelihood of colonisation of, and immigration from, small forest fragments by birds, reducing the incidence of area-dependent extinction in small fragments, but may also result in lower species richness in larger fragments. The latter is likely a consequence of the promotion by plantations of a wider distribution of generalist species in, and the loss of some specialised or rare species from, large patches. Management options are to avoid planting plantations near large forest patches and to increase the size of small patches where possible. Where afforestation is unavoidable, placing plantations in the vicinity of small forest patches rather than large forest patches may be preferable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, species richness and distribution of hoverfly and wild bee communities were investigated in a changing tropical landscape in southern Yunnan, south-west China by Malaise traps periodically from 2008 to 2009. Species were recorded from the traditional land use types (natural forest, grassland, shrubland and rice field fallows), and from recently established rubber plantations of different ages. Hoverflies (total 53 species) were most common in young successional stages of vegetation, including rice field fallow and shrubland. Species richness was highest in rice field fallows and lowest in forests and showed a highly significant relationship with the number of forb species and ground vegetation cover. In contrast, the highest richness of wild bees (total 44 species) was recorded from the natural forest sites, which showed a discrete bee community composition compared to the remaining habitat types. There was no significant relationship between the bee species richness and the environmental variables, including the numbers of different plant life forms, coverage of canopy and ground vegetation, successional age of vegetation and land use type. At the landscape scale, open land use systems, including young rubber plantations, are assumed to increase the species richness of hoverflies; however, this might decrease wild bee diversity. The present land use change by rubber cultivation can be expected to have negative impacts on the native wild bee communities.","WOS:000311434100006",94,0.922278997,1
"715","tropgrass","Tree population inventory, diversity and degradation analysis of a tropical dry deciduous forest in Afram Plains, Ghana","Forest inventory and diversity assessments are essential to understand the tree population structure and diversity status of forests and to provide information for biodiversity recovery planning. But, unfortunately, the vast majority of forests in developing countries lack inventory data, particularly the dry forests and savanna woodlands where timber potential is considered to be low. Consequently the tree population structure and diversity status of these forests are often insufficient for sound management. In this study, the structure and composition of tree species were studied in a dry semi-deciduous forest in Afram plain, Ghana. The site's status in terms of level of degradation/disturbance was also determined. Two-long rectangular plots (each 20 m x 2000 m) were established, 200 m apart, in five locations within a 40-hectare (ha) area. Each of the plots was sub-divided into 20 quadrats (20 m x 100 m). All tree species >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were identified and their diameters over bark measured at 1.3 m. The forest condition was scored and habitat types classified. In total 44 tree species with 831 individuals belonging to 25 families were recorded at the study site. This corresponds to an average of 21 trees ha(-1) of which 17 had dbh <= 30 cm. Trees with dbh >= 70 cm were less than one tree ha(-1) (mean 0.8 ha(-1)). The Simpson (0.06) and Shannon (4.52) indices reveal a poorly stocked and less diverse forest. Five species (Lophira sp., Daniellia oliveri, Pterocatpus erinaceus, Terminalia glaucescens and Ficus sur) accounted for 50% of the total individuals recorded with the Fabaceae being the most species-rich family recording 22% of all the species in the studied area. Tree basal area (1 m(2) ha(-1)) and volumes (13 m(3) ha(-1)) were at least 49% lower than national means for dry semi-deciduous forest to which the study sites belong. Based on basal area cover, D. oliveri was the single dominant species. The mean forest condition score was 5.7 and vegetation cover type was largely open forests with less than 2% forest cover. These results suggest the area is highly degraded and the loss of biodiversity may be more significant than previously thought. This would indicate a need for rehabilitation interventions and doubling of conservation management efforts in the area. Three pathways of intervention have been recommended: (a) protecting intact native forest and ecological corridors, and undertaking enrichment riparian plantings to protect waterways, (b) developing agroforestry practices for biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems, and (c) establishing plantations in the severely degraded areas.

"813","tropgrass","Unprecedented plant species loss after a decade in fragmented subtropical Chaco Serrano forests","Current biodiversity loss is mostly caused by anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and resource exploitation. Measuring the balance of species loss and gain in remaining fragmented landscapes throughout time entails a central research challenge. We resurveyed in 2013 plant species richness in the same plots of a previous sampling conducted in 2003 across 18 forest fragments of different sizes of the Chaco Serrano forest in Argentina. While the area of these forest remnants was kept constant, their surrounding forest cover changed over this time period. We compared plant species richness of both sampling years and calculated the proportion of species loss and gain at forest edges and interiors. As in 2003, we found a positive relationship between fragment area and plant richness in 2013 and both years showed a similar slope. However, we detected a net decrease of 24% of species' richness across all forest fragments, implying an unprecedentedly high rate and magnitude of species loss driven mainly by non-woody, short-lived species. There was a higher proportion of lost and gained species at forest edges than in forest interiors. Importantly, fragment area interacted with percent change in surrounding forest cover to explain the proportion of species lost. Small forest fragments showed a relatively constant proportion of species loss regardless of any changes in surrounding forest cover, whereas in larger fragments the proportion of species lost increased when surrounding forest cover decreased. We show that despite preserving fragment area, habitat quality and availability in the surroundings is of fundamental importance in shaping extinction and immigration dynamics of plant species at any given forest remnant. Because the Chaco Serrano forest has already lost 94% of its original cover, we argue that plant extinctions will continue through the coming decades unless active management actions are taken to increase native forest areas.","WOS:000451755800029",258,0.914631866,1
"911","tropgrass","The impact of fire and forest conversion into savanna on the bird communities of West Madagascan dry forests","We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity.","WOS:000230020500008",351,0.914440665,1

How are epiphytic assemblages affected by different degrees of human disturbance, and what are the driving forces? An inter-Andean dry forest landscape at 2300 m elevation in northern Ecuador. We sampled epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants on 100 trees of Acacia macracantha in five habitats: closed-canopy mixed and pure acacia forest (old secondary), forest edge, young semi-closed secondary woodland, and isolated trees in grassland. Total species richness in forest edge habitats and on isolated trees was significantly lower than in closed forest types. Species density of vascular epiphytes (species per tree) did not differ significantly between habitat types. Species density of bryophytes, in contrast, was significantly lower in edge habitat and on isolated trees than in closed forest. Forest edge showed greater impoverishment than semi-closed woodland and similar floristic affinity to isolated trees and to closed forest types. Assemblages were significantly nested; habitat types with major disturbance held only subsets of the closed forest assemblages, indicating a gradual reduction in niche availability. Distance to forest had no effect on species density of epiphytes on isolated trees, but species density was closely correlated with crown closure, a measure of canopy integrity. Microclimatic changes but not dispersal constraints were key determinants of epiphyte assemblages following disturbance. Epiphytic cryptogams are sensitive indicators of microclimate and human disturbance in montane dry forests. The substantial impoverishment of edge habitat underlines the need for fragmentation studies on epiphytes elsewhere in the Tropics.","WOS:000263701500008",345,0.914106619,1

Orchid I. is 92 km off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, and its forests are the northernmost tropical forests in East Asia. In this study, the spider diversity was compared in 4 types of habitats with different degrees of human disturbances on this island. Habitat types examined in this study included primary forest, cultivated woodlands with a small degree of disturbance, firewood plantations with an intermediate level of disturbance, and grasslands generated from the clear-cutting of forests. We used 2 replicates for all habitat types, each containing four 5 x 5 m sample plots. Spiders from the ground, understory shrubs, and canopy were collected to obtain a comprehensive representation of diversity from all microhabitats in the sample plots. From the 1718 adult specimens obtained, 123 species from 19 families were identified. The abundance was the highest in the primary forest and lowest in the grassland plots. Plots in the 4 habitat types did riot differ in Margalef species richness, Shannon-Weaver function, or Simpson index. However, plots in the primary forest had significantly lower evenness due to the high relative abundance of dominant orb weaver species. Results of a UPGMA analysis using pair-wise Euclidean distances showed that the sample plots could be clustered into 4 distinct groups, indicating that the composition of spiders among habitat types considerably differed. Plots in the primary forest, cultivated woodland, and firewood plantation habitats were dominated by space web builders and orb weavers, while those in the grasslands contained a much-higher proportion of wandering sheet weavers and ground runners. Results of this study suggest that various forest management activities conducted by the indigenous Yami people seemed to have increased the habitat heterogeneity of Orchid I., thus maintaining a high diversity of spiders.","WOS:000223969600008",7,0.9129563,1

Deer have debarked many trees, causing die-back, gradually changing the primary forest first to light forest with a floor that is densely covered with sasa grass (Sasa nipponica) and then to S. nipponica grassland. To examine the effects of vegetative transformation on the dung-beetle community, we compared the diversity and abundance of dung-beetle assemblages in the primary forest, transition forest, and S. nipponica grassland using dung-baited pitfall traps. The species richness and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) were significantly highest in the primary forest and lowest in the S. nipponica grassland. The evenness (Smith-Wilson index) was highest in the primary forest and nearly equal in the transition forest and S. nipponica grassland. The abundance was apparently greater in the transition forest than in the primary forest and S. nipponica grassland. These results suggest that loss of primary forest resulting from an increasing deer population decreases the diversity of the dung-beetle community while increasing the abundance of dung beetles in the transition forest. Sika deer use transition forests and grasslands more frequently than primary forests as habitat, but an increase in dung supply there does not necessarily increase the diversity or abundance of dung-beetle assemblages.","WOS:000228011500004",373,0.912427347,0

Of the 290 specimens collected, 195 butterfly species were included, of which significant proportion were Nymphalidae. Of the 147 forest species, 111 (75.5%) showed preferences for the forest habitats, while 70 (47.6%) and 34 (23.1%) preferred disturbed and savannah habitats, respectively. Numerically, a comparable proportion of savannah species were recorded in the 18 disturbed (73.9%) and 16 savannah habitats (63.2%). Accumulated species richness and diversity indices were lower in the disturbed habitats compared to the forest reserve, but lowest in the savanna habitats. However, a large proportion of forest species, especially those with either a more restricted geographic range or species for which no information on geographic distribution was available, were exclusively captured in the forest patches. The survey indicated the presence of a rich butterfly fauna, which should be systematically collected for further research and study in order to build a good taxonomic database for Sierra Leone.","WOS:000260493400001",166,0.91205316,1

At four sites a 150 x 10 m belt transect was established perpendicular to the forest/pasture edge. Vegetation transect censusing included recording of seed plane species presence and abundance (aerial crown/shoot cover), as well as assessment of seedling sapling and tree stem diameter and height. A total of 290 seed plant species were found in 159 genera and 85 families. Asteraceae is with 47 species the most speciose family. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index showed no significant difference between forest and pastureland, with the exception of a pastureland site which had experienced intensive land use. Sorensen's similarity index showed significant differences in species composition between forest and pastureland. Vegetation at the forest edge consisted mainly of secondary shrub and tree species. From the forest interior towards the edge, numbers of seedlings, saplings and secondary trees increased, while numbers of mature forest trees declined. Edge effects are expressed in a reduction of canopy height and an increase in subcanopy stature from the forest interior towards the edge, causing thr merging of forest canopy and subcanopy layers at the edge. Intensively used pasturelands only harboured a low herbaceous vegetation, while their abandoned equivalents showed the presence of patches of secondary shrub vegetation and recovering forest in a grassland matrix. Expected spatio-temporal changes at the forest edge include the encroachment of secondary vegetation and the levelling of the forest/pasture border as time advances and land use becomes less intense. Transitional second,growth edge vegetation may buffer the remaining mature forest core and simultaneously induce forest recovery processes in adjacent abandoned pasturelands. It is recommended to include forest edge tree species in programs focused at the ecological restoration of tropical montane cloud forests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Location: Mistbelt Afromontane forests, KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa. Methods: Woody seedling abundance and species richness in 590 1-m(2) plots were sampled at the forest edge (< 10 m from the edge) and interior in 31 old (> 60 a) Afromontane forest fragments (0.05 - 328.5 ha) with closed edges in an ancient grassland matrix. Results: Unlike young (< 20 a) Amazonian fragments, there was no edge- or area-effect on sample plot seedling density and species richness, although these increased significantly with increasing herb cover (less disturbance). Seedling density, but not species richness, declined significantly with herbivory of seedlings, regardless of forest size or plot location. Seedling community composition and richness did not differ significantly between the edge and interior of forests across the range of forest sizes (i.e. no edge-effect). Community composition was nested with small forests retaining a subset of the seedling flora of larger forests. Overall, cumulative seedling species richness increased with forest area (i.e. area-effect). Conclusions: Holocene climatic extinction filtering events and area-dependent species relaxation have potentially selected for tree species with convergent life histories adapted to local fragmentation-effects. Stable environmental conditions at old edges in these naturally fragmented forests cause similar regeneration conditions and seedling species composition between edge and interior. Consequently, seedling density and species richness are controlled more by response to gradients of local disturbance (habitat area, herb cover, herbivory) than by proximity to the edge. Large patches (> 50 ha) with intact edges had the highest tree seedling diversity and are a conservation priority. Although small patches contain no unique species they preserve landscape processes, have conservation value, and require protection. Conservation principles derived from recently created Amazonian fragments and that emphasize edge-effects, require critical evaluation for application to old Afromontane patches.","WOS:000232457000001",28,0.905967948,1

Higher species richness was recorded in plantation than in grassland, indicating that the plantation could support more butterfly species.

The species accumulation trend indicated by a, rarefaction curve suggested that there were many more undiscovered species in the native forest. The. butterflies found in the native forest included many range-restricted species, which were not found in the plantation and grassland. These range-restricted species were thought to be specific to the interior of the native forest and unlikely to colonise the plantations.

Sixty-three species were recorded from each forest remnant from a total of 1329 individuals. Species accumulation curves for both forests did not reach an asymptote. High species similarity was recorded between the forest interior and the surrounding matrix, primarily due to invasion of the forest interior clearings by the savanna species. Despite their small sizes, these forest remnants were found to maintain viable populations of true forest butterflies. However, the number of species was less than half that recorded from the larger forest reserve of Arabuko-Sokoke, located in the same geographical area. Records from Muhaka forest show species unique to it, not found in the larger forest reserves, underscoring the importance of small remnants in the preservation of forest biodiversity. The high species similarity between the forest remnants implied that if habitat corridors were created, gene flow between these remnants and other larger forest reserves would be possible. This would reduce the isolation of true forest butterfly populations within the remnants and potential local extinction.","WOS:000170905600005",106,0.89880492,1

Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Digitized aerial photographs from 1944 and 1996 were examined for changes to the indigenous forest landscape in the Karkloof-Balgowan archipelago in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Attributes relating to proximate land-use, patch shape, isolation and position in the landscape were used to determine putative causes of forest change. The total change in forest area was -5.7% (forest covered 6739 ha in 1996). This is contrasted with previous reports for the period 1880-1940 that estimated change in total forest area of up to -80%. Attrition was the predominant process of forest transformation between 1944 and 1996. Despite little overall change in forest area, 786 mostly small (<0.5 ha) forest patches were lost from the landscape, leaving 1277 forest patches in 1996. An increase in patch isolation, but no change in patch cohesion accompanied the changes in forest area. Ignoring patches that were eliminated, 514 patches decreased in area. This was partly a function of patch size, but the conversion of natural grassland to commercial plantation forestry in the matrix also influenced forest decline. Their small size and irregular shape caused forest patches in the region to be vulnerable to edge effects. Core area declined in a negative exponential way with increasing edge width and the total area of edge habitat exceeded that of core habitat at an edge width of only 50 m. Nevertheless, total core area decreased by only 2%, (65 ha) between 1944 and 1996 because most of the eliminated patches were small and contained no core area. The large Karkloof forest (1649 ha) is a conservation priority for forest interior species, but the ecological role and biodiversity value of small forest patches should not be overlooked.","WOS:000226516800002",1007,0.898351059,0

A range of habitats typical of cattle grazing enterprises was sampled and site variables included lithology, slope position, tree density, soil disturbance, soil enrichment and grazing. Results were compared with a previously published survey of temperate grasslands. Lithology, slope position and tree density had relatively minor effects on plant species richness, although in both surveys there was some evidence of lower species richness on the more fertile substrates. Soil disturbance and soil enrichment significantly reduced the richness of native species in both surveys, while exotic species were insensitive (subtropics) or increased (temperate) with disturbance. Rare native species were highly sensitive to disturbances, including grazing, in the temperate study. Although some trends were similar for rare species in the subtropics, the results were not significant and there were complex interactions between grazing, lithology and slope position. Grazing did not have a negative effect on native species richness, except in the closely grazed patches within pastures, and then only on the most intensively developed property. At the scale recorded (30 m(2)), the native pastures, roadsides and stock routes sampled in the subtropics appear to be among the most species-rich grasslands ever reported, both nationally and globally. Native species richness was approximately 50% higher than the temperate survey figures across all the comparable habitats.

We hypothesised that species number, cover of herbs and mosses is higher in the edge, and species penetrates from nearby grasslands into forest interior. The study was conducted in the Southwestern Lithuania. The edge effect on overall herbaceous species composition of coniferous forests was evaluated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The species richness of herbs and mosses in the coniferous forest was highest in the forest edge and declined towards interior. The highest decrease in the number of species occurred within 0 to 5 m to the edge. The highest cover of herbs and mosses was in the forest edge and decreased towards the forest interior. CCA biplot showed a good correlation of overall species composition and the distance to the forest edge.

Two gradients were sampled, one on red earth at Kidman Springs (5 plots), the other on black cracking clay at Mount Sanford (6 plots). Sites were sampled in April (both sites) and October (Kidman Springs only)1998. The two sites supported distinctly different ant communities, with 70 species at Kidman Springs and 36 at Mount Sanford. Species richness and total abundance did not change significantly with distance from water, although species richness was always greatest at the most distant plot. However, multivariate analysis showed that ant species composition changed markedly. Despite large changes in species composition, the abundance of only six of the 24 most common species (two at Kidman Springs and four at Mount Sanford) were significantly correlated with grazing intensity. The abundance of Bassian taxa was promoted by grazing, whereas the species richness of Torresian taxa and the abundance and species richness of Widespread taxa were suppressed. Ant functional group analysis showed community organisation was resilient, with slight changes being primarily driven by Hot Climate Specialists and dependent on the season. However, the relative richness of five functional groups correlated significantly with grazing intensity, all negatively. Ant variables suppressed by grazing were positively associated with patch cover variables and litter, and negatively correlated with annual grass and bare ground, and may serve as indicators of rangeland condition.","WOS:000165918400001",17,0.865724314,1
"542","tropgrass","Is livestock grazing compatible with biodiversity conservation? Impacts on savanna ant communities in the Australian seasonal tropics","Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread forms of anthropogenic disturbance globally, and can have a major impact on biodiversity and therefore conservation values. Here we use ants to assess the extent to which livestock grazing is compatible with biodiversity conservation in a tropical savanna of northern Australia, where there is growing pressure to intensify pastoral production. We focus on the extent to which ant responses conform with four general patterns identified in a recent global review: (1) soil and vegetation type have a far bigger impact on ant community composition than does grazing; (2) grazing modifies ant species composition but often not species richness or total abundance; (3) a species' response often varies among habitats; and (4) between 25-50% of the species that can be statistically analysed are responsive to grazing. We sampled ants using pitfall traps at 38 sites in two land systems, based on cross-fence comparisons of areas of different grazing intensities. A total of 130 ant species from 24 genera were recorded, with the fauna dominated by species of Iridomyrmex and Monomorium. Land system was the primary driver of variation in ant species richness and composition, and grazing intensity was related to neither species richness nor total abundance. Only 10% of common species appeared to be impacted by grazing. Overall, ant responses to grazing in our study region were generally consistent with the four global patterns, except that the local fauna seems to be particularly resilient. Such resilience indicates that current grazing management practices are compatible with the conservation of ant biodiversity.","WOS:000398111000007",16,0.864962173,1

The aims of this study were to evaluate the richness and abundance of euglossine bees in two fragments of seasonally dry tropical forest (Caatinga), as well as to assess the distribution of euglossine species richness in the Caatinga environment. Males were collected along 12 consecutive months, using traps with aromatic baits. The species richness (S=5) was lower than in rainforests and savannas. Euglossa cordata (L.) was the dominant species in the assemblage, representing 70% of the individuals. The highest abundance occurred in the rainy season. Euglossini fauna presents low local species richness in Caatinga areas, however the beta diversity is higher, since assemblages in different habitats have differences in species composition.","WOS:000442752800016",21,0.83399716,1
"1042","tropgrass","Effects of past and present land use on vegetation cover and regeneration in a tropical dryland forest","Brazilian Caatinga is one of the most diverse dryland ecosystem of the world and is threatened by strong land use pressure and poor protection. In this study, we investigate the effects of past and present land use on plant community richness and structure. We used satellite information to identify 55 Caatinga forest plots with and without past vegetation clearing. We also quantified current land use, i.e. grazing by domestic animals, and selective logging. Caatinga vegetation structure, measured as vegetation cover, vegetation height, basal area and woody plant density, as well as recruitment, measured as woody plant seedling density and species richness, were negatively affected by both past and current land use. Past clear-cut not only had strong effects on most vegetation measures, but also increased current grazing which further negatively affected vegetation structure. Selective logging had little measurable effects but increased recruitment in plots previously clear-cut. Increasing time since the last clear-cut increased negative effects on vegetation, presumably because of a prolonged negative effect of grazing. Our results suggest that grazing needs to be prevented in areas degraded by clear-cut to allow vegetation restoration through natural succession and avoid further degradation and desertification.

Grazing at moderate intensity has been recommended for biodiversity conservation. Few studies, however, have empirically tested the benefits of moderate grazing intensity in systems dominated by native grazers. Here we investigated the relationship between (1) density of native eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, and grass structure, and (2) grass structure and reptiles (i.e. abundance, richness, diversity and occurrence) across 18 grassland and grassy Eucalyptus woodland properties in south-eastern Australia. There was a strong negative relationship between kangaroo density and grass structure after controlling for tree canopy cover. We therefore used grass structure as a surrogate for grazing intensity. Changes in grazing intensity (i.e. grass structure) significantly affected reptile abundance, reptile species richness, reptile species diversity, and the occurrence of several ground-dwelling reptiles. Reptile abundance, species richness and diversity were highest where grazing intensity was low. Importantly, no species of reptile was more likely to occur at high grazing intensities. Legless lizards (Delma impar, D. inornata) were more likely to be detected in areas subject to moderate grazing intensity, whereas one species (Hemiergis talbingoensis) was less likely to be detected in areas subject to intense grazing and three species (Menetia greyii, Morethia boulengeri, and Lampropholis delicata) did not appear to be affected by grazing intensity. Our data indicate that to maximize reptile abundance, species richness, species diversity, and occurrence of several individual species of reptile, managers will need to subject different areas of the landscape to moderate and low grazing intensities and limit the occurrence and extent of high grazing.","WOS:000347146700001",22,0.816188942,1

In particular, the biodiversity consequences of replacing native grasslands with exotic pastures have not been studied. Here we examine how the conversion of the native savanna grasslands affects dung beetle communities. Our study was conducted in 14 native (grassland: campo limpo), and 21 exotic (Urochloa spp. monoculture) pastures in Carrancas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We collected 4996 dung beetle individuals from 66 species: 3139 individuals from 50 species in native pastures and 1857 individuals from 55 species in the exotic pastures. Exotic pastures had lower dung beetle richness, abundance and biomass than native pastures. Species composition between the two pasture types was significantly different and exotic pastures were dominated by few abundant species. Indicator species analysis detected 16 species indicators of native pastures and three of exotic pastures, according to relative abundance and frequency in each pasture system. Our results show that the conversion of native pastures to exotic pastures leads to a predictable loss of local species richness, increasing dominance and changes in species composition. These results highlight the importance of maintaining native pastures in the Cerrado agro-pastoral landscape.","WOS:000296909800008",11,0.815219273,1

Natural savannas in South America have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the Colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the Llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared.","WOS:000410014100026",15,0.814329722,1
"1421","tropgrass","Relationships between biomass and plant species richness in arid-zone grazing lands","1. The relationship between biomass and species richness in temperate vegetation has been described as a hump-back response model. The hump-back model predicts that herbaceous species richness is highest at an intermediate level of biomass. However, this has not been investigated in arid-zone grazing lands. 2. We tested the hump-back prediction in an and tropical grazing region in northern Kenya where a seasonal grazing exclosure system is practised. We compared vegetation structure, species richness and composition on an open range and exclosures at five sites to elucidate the potential mechanisms behind variation in species richness. 3. More biomass was accumulated within seasonal exclosures than in continuously grazed areas. Species richness in exclosure plots varied from 5.3 to 8.3 species In 2, while that in open plots varied from 5.1 to 7.5 species m(-2). A pair-wise test showed no difference in two of the five sites with respect to both total and herbaceous species richness. 4. The primary floristic gradient illuminated through ordination was related to biomass, while the secondary gradient was related to species richness. The exclosure plots had more abundant species, especially compared with open plots, which had more rare and occasional species. A total of 37 herbaceous species was recorded; 22% were indifferent to grazing, 30% grazing intolerant and 48% promoted by grazing. 5. The relationship between biomass and herbaceous species richness showed (i) no trend within the exclosures (maximum biomass 800 g m(-2)); (ii) a positive trend in the open grazing land (maximum of 500 g m(-2)); and a hump-back pattern when (i) and (ii)were analysed together. Optimum richness corresponded to a biomass level of 400-500 g m(-2). Species richness declined with increase in age of exclosures. 6. We confirmed that species richness will decline when biomass exceeds 500 g m(-2), as predicted by the hump-back model, even in and grazing lands. Seasonal grazing exclosures may increase species richness to a certain level, but the decline in species richness with age of exclosures indicates that long-term exclusion of grazing may not necessarily increase species richness in arid-zone grazing lands.","WOS:000170568000013",23,0.802205502,1

Here, we seek to understand how grazing intensity influences swamp vegetation, with an emphasis on their diversity, structure and function. Six swamps were selected, two each in high, moderate and low intensity grazing sites, from the tropical montane swamps of the Upper Nilgiri Mountains, southern India. We recorded a total of 78 species belonging to 63 genera and 31 families. Our results showed that species richness, abundance and species composition differed significantly across grazing treatments. Moreover, mean vegetation cover and mean height differed significantly across grazing treatments, indicating that grazing significantly affected the vegetation structure and growth of swamp plant communities. Species compositional patterns showed that moderately grazed plant communities were significantly different from low and high grazing sites. In summary, grazing intensity influenced swamp species richness, abundance, and swamp plant communities. Specifically, high grazing pressure reduced vegetation cover causing changes in swamp community structure leading to the gradual conversion of the swamp habitat into grasslands.","WOS:000387850600015",20,0.798948772,1
"1821","tropgrass","Use by small mammals of a chronosequence of tropical rainforest revegetation","Context. The conversion of tropical rainforest to grazing pasture results in a drastic change in small-mammal community composition. Restoring the landscape through ecological revegetation is thus an increasingly important management technique to conserve rainforest mammals. Aims. This study aimed to determine the habitat ages at which species of small mammals recolonised revegetated habitats on the southern Atherton Tablelands, north-eastern Queensland, Australia. We focussed on changes in rainforest mammal abundance and diversity with increasing habitat age. Methods. Small-mammal trapping and mark-recapture techniques investigated mammal diversity, abundance and community composition within remnant rainforest, three age classes of ecological revegetation and abandoned grazing pasture. Key results. Small-mammal community composition differed between remnant rainforest and abandoned grazing pasture. The pasture and 3-year old revegetated sites were similar in composition, both lacking rainforest small mammals. Six-and 7-year old revegetation plantings provided suboptimal habitat for both rainforest and grassland mammals, whereas 16-and 22-year old revegetated habitats were dominated by rainforest species, with some individuals being frequently recaptured. Conclusions. As revegetated habitats aged, the small-mammal community composition transitioned from a grassland-like composition to a community dominated by rainforest species. Implications. Although rainforest small mammals were very occasionally captured within the 6- and 7-year old habitats, revegetated plantings were not dominated by rainforest species until the habitat was 16 years old. This highlights the importance of commencing revegetation as early as possible to minimise future population declines and maximise the conservation of rainforest mammals.","WOS:000346373200006",18,0.782933822,1
"2041","tropgrass","Forest degradation and recovery in a miombo woodland landscape in Zambia: 22 years of observations on permanent sample plots","Because dry tropical forests cover 40% of tropical forest area and contain considerable biomass and carbon stocks, deforestation and forest degradation of these forests have global significance. However, in most developing countries with dry forests there is no quantitative information on past trends of forest degradation so that the development of historical reference levels is virtually impossible. This study assessed impacts of forest practices on forest degradation from 1990 to 2012 using data from destructive tree sampling and permanent sample plots in a miombo woodland landscape in central Zambia. Aboveground live wood biomass was estimated using allometric equations developed from 113 felled trees. Resprouting was a major source of regeneration on clear-cut subplots and the rate of aboveground wood biomass accumulation was much higher on re-growth sites than on old-growth sites. Changes in aboveground live wood biomass on uncut subplots were linked to biomass loss due to fire, harvesting and conversion to crop cultivation on the one hand and biomass increment due to growth of remaining trees on the other hand. Forest degradation was estimated to cause aboveground wood biomass loss of 0.3 t ha(-1) year(-1) on the least impacted site to 4.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) on the most impacted site. Control of fire and harvesting for charcoal production is recommended if miombo woodland is to be managed for biomass and carbon storage and sequestration. The study also found that negative trends in woody biomass accumulation rate and standing stocks are good indicators of forest degradation while positive trends in species diversity indices and standing wood biomass are useful indicators of forest recovery. However, the application of these indicators requires repeated inventories at permanent sample plots to establish reference levels against which changes in these indicator variables can be compared.

We compared spore community species richness, composition, abundance, and similarity between old-growth forests and active pastures, as a measure of resistance and examined the trajectory of change in successional fields when pasture use stopped to evaluate recovery. Despite a few changes in species richness, community composition and structure were strikingly similar in all sites, including the active pastures. The spore communities were considered resistant to land use as pastures and showed minor changes along succession when management stopped. We found a significant negative relation between the frequency of Diversisporales and Glomerales indicating a selective species turnover driven: mainly by the families Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae. This was, however, unrelated to land use or successional time. These results suggest the AMF communities of this ecosystem seem resilient to management as pastures.

Two fragments of different shapes, squarish and linear, were studied without seed immigration from the outside. Both fragments consisted initially of two patches, a 4-ha clear-cut area and a 1-ha remnant forest, mimicking a common forest management regime in Japan. Stochastic simulations using the model reveal several differences in the dynamics and equilibrium structure of the tree population between the fragments. In the squarish fragment, the forest structure reached an equilibrium state in 500-600 years, but the linear fragment took 2100-2400 years. At equilibrium, the proportion of treeless area was significantly larger in the linear fragment than in the squarish fragment. The mean area of gaps was also larger in the linear fragment. The population expansion rate from the remnant forest into the cleared area differed significantly between the two fragments: 0.63 m year(-1) in the squarish fragment, and 0.43 m year(-1) in the linear fragment. These differences are explained as arising from the spatial configuration of seed dispersal: in the linear fragment, the density of seedlings was lower by half than in the squarish fragment, because a greater proportion of seeds produced within the linear fragment were deposited outside the fragment and were lost. However, the density effect (i.e., one-sided competition among trees) mitigates the negative impact of dispersal loss on the adult population density at equilibrium. Forest fragments with linear shapes should be preferred by fugitive light-demanding species in forested landscapes.","WOS:000221178600011",2,0.761587859,0

The study took place on a granitic inselberg in the French Guianan (South America) rainforest (Nouragues Natural Reserve: 4 degrees 5'N, 52 degrees 41'W). In a diachronic study (1995-2005) embracing a severe El-Nino event in 1997. we analysed vegetation structure and composition along three transects subsuming whole environmental and topographical variations in the transition zone from shrub vegetation at the fringe of open-rock vegetation to tall-tree rainforest. Data were analysed by PCA. Major variations in species and trait distribution were described in the low forest, with two floristic types evidenced by first PCA component and verified by cluster analysis: one with floristic composition reminiscent of open-rock vegetation but with higher and continuous canopy, the other typical of the low forest. There is no clear-cut boundary between typical open-rock and low forest vegetation. Variation in species composition of typical low forest was evidenced by second PCA component, which displayed differences according to slope and altitude. Small (similar to 1.5 m), although significant, shifts in the spatial distribution of plant species pointed to possible slow encroachment of typical low forest vegetation in the absence of disturbance. However, the stability of species and trait distribution was remarkable within the 10-yr interval considered, despite an otherwise recorded decrease in species richness and recruitment. The boundary between typical low forest and open-rock-like vegetation coincided with the spatial limit of the mineral soil above granite. Despite demographic accidents due to severe El Nino events, plant communities at the fringe of a tropical inselberg are stable at short-time both in composition and spatial distribution. In the absence of strong disturbances such as wildfire and further erosion, soil availability for roots could be interpreted as an environmental constraint to the successional development of forest vegetation. Soil development might thus act as an ecological barrier to forest encroachment, which could only be alleviated by erosion recovery, as otherwise demonstrated. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

"348","tropgrass","What happens to the soil seed bank 17 years after clear cutting of vegetations?","Seed banks play an important role in the resilience of potential anthropogenic areas and are influenced by seasonal variation. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the forests influences the richness and density of the soil seed bank, but there is a hypothesis that such influence can be changed in anthropogenic areas, where we expect to find lower richness and seed density in relation to the seed bank of mature forests. The richness and seasonal density of seeds in the soil depth of a young caatinga forest, 17 years after an agricultural activity was abandoned, were evaluated and compared with those of a mature forest. The study was conducted at the Instituo Agronomic de Pernambuco - IPA (Estacao Experimental Jose Nilson de Melo), located in Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil, in an area of tropical dry forest, known locally as ""caatinga"". The local climate is seasonal, the dry season occurring from September to February and the rainy season concentrated in the remaining months. The average annual rainfall over time (time series of 30 years) is 692mm. In each climatic season (rainy and dry), the seed bank was sampled in 210 20x20cm plots (105 in the leaf litter and 105 at 5cm soil depth). The richness and seed density of the soil samples were evaluated by the method of seedling emergence. The seed bank had 47 species, with a predominance of herbaceous plants. Seasonal variation in richness and seed density in the soil (leaf litter + soil) was not significant, but 42 species of the mature forest were absent from the seed bank of the young forest, despite 17 years of natural regeneration and its proximity to the mature forest. On its own, the soil has greater richness and density of seeds than the leaf litter. The depth of seed deposition in the soil bank of the young forest significantly explained 36% of the species richness and 16% of the seed density, with a significant interaction effect with the climatic season only on species richness, explaining 4% of the variation recorded. The seed density of the young forest (1 277seeds/m(2)) was greater than that the mature forest indicating that the time abandoned had not yet been sufficient for complete recovery of plant diversity and there is no longer any seed limitation of pioneer species for regeneration of the young forest.","WOS:000359961900001",8,0.724200854,1

An important member of forests of the southern hemisphere is the genus Araucaria. Because of clear cutting only small remnants of Araucaria angustifolio forests still exist in Southern Brazil. Attempts at reforestation have had only limited success because of lack of knowledge about the environmental requirements of this species. This is especially true with respect to the root/fungus symbiosis (mycorrhiza) which is necessary for enhanced water and nutrient uptake and present in more than 90% of land plants. Analysis of the root systems of Araucaria trees from forest and grassland (campo) sites revealed mycorrhizal structures (appressoria, penetration and coiled hyphae, vesicles, arbuscules, spores) which are characteristic for the arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) type. The spores of AM fungi at both sites - forest and campo - were identified. The biodiversity at the forest site was much higher, with 13 species, whereas only 6 different species could be identified at the campo site. Glomus and Acaulospora were the only genera present at the campo. The forest, however, also contained spores of Entrophospora and Scutellospora. In addition to the greater biodiversity, the spore number in soil as well as the percent mycorrhizal colonization in roots were significantly higher at the forest site than at the campo site. Because of the low frequency of hyphal coils and the dominating intercellular growth of hyphae, these mycorrhizas can be classified as an Arum-type, which is the first report of this kind in gymnosperms.","WOS:000085349600002",5,0.68614948,1

Here we report changes in the assemblage of small mammals in a rugged sandstone environment (Nawurlandja, in Kakadu National Park) over intermittent sampling between 1977 and 2002. Four native mammal species were commonly recorded in the original sampling: sandstone antechinus (Pseudantechinus bilarni), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), Arnhem rock-rat (Zyzomys maini) and common rock-rat (Z. argurus). Trap success rates declined significantly for the northern quoll, Arnhem rock-rat and all species combined, but increased for the common rock-rat. Despite being recorded commonly in the initial (1977-79) study, no Arnhem rock-rats were recorded in the most recent (2002) sampling. Trap success rates for northern quoll declined by 90% from 1977-79 to 2002. The reasons for change are not clear-cut. Notably, all sampling occurred before the arrival of cane toads (Rhinella marina), a factor that has caused severe decline in northern quoll numbers elsewhere. Fire was more frequent in the sampling area in the period preceding the 2002 sampling than it was in the period preceding the initial (1977-79) sampling, and this may have contributed to change in mammal abundance.","WOS:000439693400007",3,0.537457974,0

The removal of firewood from the native tropical dry forest, called ""Caatinga"", can negatively impact important ecosystem services, such as soil conservation, water resources, biodiversity and atmospheric carbon capture, if performed in an unsustainable manner. Most global climate models indicate that Caatinga will experience temperature increases and rainfall decreases in the next few decades. We used the Century model to simulate the impact of climate changes on woody vegetation growth and on vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks in a Caatinga area managed with a single clear cut or cuts every 10 years, 15 years, and 20 years, followed or not followed by the burning of plant residues (leaves and small branches) left after firewood removal. The effects of future climate projections, (LOW, MIDI and HIGH members of the climate scenario SRES A1B, which corresponded to different CO2 emission predictions, downscaled by the Eta/CPTEC model), were compared to those of the projection of the historical climate. With the current climate, it would take 50 years to regenerate the Caatinga biomass stock to a level close to that before cutting after a single cut, followed or not followed by fire. Therefore, the recommended cutting cycles (10-20 years) were not long enough to allow for the regeneration of a fully mature Caatinga. However, all of these cycles reached sustainable biomass production levels, with similar total productions until the end of the century. Under these conditions, the lower proportions of biomass recovery of shorter cycles would be compensated by more frequent cutting. The model also indicated that burning or not burning the residues would have little effect. On the contrary, if the climate changes as predicted, the biomass of the native Caatinga vegetation and soil organic carbon stock would decrease throughout this century, even without cutting the vegetation. All of the cutting cycles would not provide sustainable firewood production, with reduced production after each consecutive cut. Therefore, if the climate changes as expected, forest management legislation should require longer periods of forest recovery between cutting cycles for sites with environmental conditions (e.g., climate, soil and vegetation) similar to those of the present study.

A major feature of the ecological footprint of oil and gas exploration is seismic lines-narrow corridors used to transport and deploy geophysical survey equipment. These lines, which traverse forests, tundra, uplands, and peatlands, were historically up to 10 m wide. Over the past decade, seismic lines have decreased in width (in some cases down to 1.75-3m); however, their density has increased drastically and their construction is expected to continue in regions of Canada and the United States that are rich in oil and gas resources. We examine the literature related to the environmental impacts of, and restoration and reclamation efforts associated with, seismic lines in the boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America. With respect to conventional seismic lines, numerous studies report significant and persistent environmental changes along these lines and slow recovery of vegetation that translates into a lasting fragmentation of the landscape. This fragmentation has many ramifications for biodiversity and ecosystem processes, including significant implications for threatened woodland caribou herds. While modern, low-impact seismic lines have comparatively lower ecological effects at the site-level, their high density and associated potential edge effects suggest that their actual environmental impact may be underestimated. Seismic line restoration is a critical aspect of future integrated landscape management in hydrocarbon-rich regions of the boreal-arctic, and if widely applied, has the potential to benefit a wide range of species and maintain or re-establish key ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity.","WOS:000433097600008",1,0.473730979,0

Besides the relative role of biotic and abiotic factors as community-structuring processes, addressing how they jointly affect the ecological resilience and resistance of plant communities is crucial to understand better the long-term response of communities facing global changes. Here, we used the results from a long-term (23years) perturbation experiment set up in Fennoscandian mountain tundra to test these mechanisms. The experiment consisted of a transplantation of twenty blocks of Vaccinium myrtillus heath vegetation including upper soil layer from a lower elevation tundra heath habitat to a snowbed habitat 150m higher in elevation where V.myrtillus lies at its upper limit. In the snowbed with contrasting levels of soil wetness, half of the transplanted blocks were protected from mammalian herbivores. Our results revealed that in addition to the important role of environmental conditions as a structuring force, the joint effects of multiple drivers resulted in divergent patterns in both plant functional composition and species diversity among transplanted communities. Under environmental perturbation (i.e. transplantation to snowbed), the heath vegetation was altered by grazing pressure that reduced the cover of shrubs (especially V.myrtillus). In grazed dry snowbed, a species-rich community with high functional type evenness and diversity developed. Reversely, in dry exclosures, V.myrtillus gained high dominance associated with only few graminoids and forbs. In wet snowbed conditions, shrubs tended to decline both in grazed plots and exclosures whereas bryophytes attained high abundance. Grazing promoted species richness while soil waterlogging tended to promote among-plot heterogeneity (-diversity) which was highest in wet exclosures.Synthesis. Our long-term experiment reveals that environmental perturbation, grazing and soil wetness exhibit joint effects that induce divergent trajectories of tundra plant communities. We suggest that a strong environmental perturbation triggers mountain tundra heath community to move away from its equilibrium state. The outcome of this shift depends on the interplay between grazing pressure and soil wetness that drive tundra plant communities toward divergent alternative states.","WOS:000344333800030",2,0.561638058,0
"322","tundra","Changes in the abundance, composition and species richness of mountain vegetation in relation to summer grazing by reindeer","Question: How do reduced levels of summer grazing by reindeer affect the abundance, composition and species richness of mountain plant communities? Location: Arctic-alpine mountain vegetation 700-850 m a.s.l., Saana Conservation Area, northwestern Finnish Lapland. Methods: Permanent plots were established in 1990 and resampled in 1999 or 2001. The number of reindeer had considerably declined from the 1980s to the 1990s and we followed the recovery of vegetation. The comparisons between 1990 and 1999/2001 were made at seven sites differing in their original grazing pressure. Results: At the initially heavily grazed sites, lichen abundances increased, but at the lightly grazed sites the abundances of lichens decreased. Graminoids declined at all sites, but the change seemed to be greatest at the most heavily grazed sites. Forbs increased slightly across all sites. At the species level, lichens and graminoids responded most notably to the reduction of grazing pressure. Individual species responses in shrubs were variable and among forbs, typical species of species-rich Dryas heaths increased. Total species richness increased at all sites and the change was greater at heavily grazed sites. This increase resulted mainly from increased bryophyte and lichen species richness but also from a slight increase in vascular plant species richness. Conclusions: These results suggest that lichens are the group most responsive to the reduction of heavy summer grazing by reindeer and that lichens and forbs typical in arctic-alpine Dryas heaths are favoured over graminoids under reduced grazing. Heavy grazing decreases overall species richness with the most pronounced effects on bryophyte and lichen species richness. The results support the hypothesis that heavy summer grazing may shift the composition of mountain plant communities towards that of grasslands and show how this shift may be reversed under reduced grazing.","WOS:000237611900013",3,0.835356483,0

We tested the role of geese for structuring bryophyte communities at fine spatial scales in the arctic tundra by excluding them from 4 x 4 m areas. We surveyed the presence and absence of bryophyte species in quadrats (10 x 10 cm) divided into 25 cells outside and inside these exclosures, after 5 and 11 years of treatment. Species richness per cell (4 cm(2)) was higher in the presence of geese, especially after 11 years of treatment, while geese had little effect on richness at larger scales (i.e. quadrat and whole exclosure). The slope of the species-area relationship within quadrats was consequently shallower outside exclosures. Our results further suggest that the community outside the exclosures was more variable in space and time than that inside the exclosures. We conclude that goose foraging activity promotes the coexistence of bryophyte species at the centimetre scale.","WOS:000258059000004",4,0.553562322,0

Location Northern Fennoscandia, Europe. Methods We resampled tree line ecotone vegetation sites sampled 26 years earlier. To quantify compositional changes, we used generalized linear models to test relationships between compositional changes and environmental gradients. Results Compositional changes in species abundances are positively related to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based estimate of productivity gradient and to geomorphological disturbance. Competitive species in fertile sites show the greatest changes in abundance, opposed to negligible changes in infertile sites. Change in species richness is negatively related to initial richness, whereas geomorphological disturbance has positive effects on change in richness. Few lowland species have moved towards higher elevations. Main conclusions The sensitivity of vegetation to climate change depends on a complex interplay between productivity, physical and biotic disturbances, plant functional composition and richness. Our results suggest that vegetation on productive sites, such as herb-rich deciduous forests at low altitudes, is more sensitive to climate warming than alpine tundra vegetation where grazing may have strong buffering effects. Geomorphological disturbance promotes vegetation change under climatic warming, whereas high diversity has a stabilizing effect.","WOS:000282982300005",5,0.702187668,0

The purpose of this Study was to test whether this is true for reindeer grazed arctic tundra vegetation. Plant biomass, plant community structure, and species richness were measured along four fences that separated areas grazed by reindeer from ungrazed areas in northern Norway. I found a negative relationship between plant species richness and the change in species richness and biomass Clue to grazing. These results indicate diversity did not confer greater resilience to increased reindeer grazing intensity. No support for higher grazing pressure in diverse habitats were recorded, thus, these results suggest lower resilience to grazing in species-rich arctic tundra vegetation.","WOS:000235385100015",6,0.79831194,0

What are the species-specific associations between shrubs and understorey plants? Location: Tundra habitats along an over 1000-km long range, spanning from NW Fennoscandia to the Yamal Peninsula in northwest Russia. Methods: The data from 758 vegetation sample plots from 12 sites comprised cover estimates of all plant species, including bryophytes and lichens, and canopy height of deciduous shrubs. The relationships between shrub volume and cover of plant groups and species richness of vegetation were investigated. In addition, species-specific associations between understorey species and shrub volume were analysed. Results: Shrub abundance was shown to be associated with the composition of understorey vegetation, and the association patterns were consistent across the study sites. Increased forb cover was positively associated with shrub volume, whereas bryophyte, lichen, dwarf shrub and graminoid cover decreased in association with increasing volume of deciduous shrubs. The total species richness of vegetation declined with increasing shrub volume. Conclusions: The results suggest that an increase of shrubs - due to climatic warming or a decrease in grazing pressure - is likely to have strong effects on plant-plant interactions and lead to a decrease in the diversity of understorey vegetation.","WOS:000294561200008",7,0.697190574,0
"814","tundra","Effects of mammalian herbivores on revegetation of disturbed areas in the forest-tundra ecotone in northern Fennoscandia","Herbivores influence the structure of plant communities in arctic-alpine ecosystems. However, little is known of the effect of herbivores on plant colonisation following disturbance, and on its variability depending on the identity of herbivores and the characteristics of the habitats. To quantify the role of large and small vertebrate herbivores, we established exclosures of two different mesh sizes around disturbed subplots in forest and nearby tundra habitats in four contrasting locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and Norway. The study revealed that herbivores influenced the abundance but not the species composition of regenerating vegetation. Gaps were colonised by the dominant species in the surrounding vegetation. The only exception to this expectation was Empetrum nigrum, which failed to colonise gaps even though it dominated undisturbed vegetation. Significant effects of herbivory were only detected when both small and large herbivores were excluded. Herbivores decreased the abundance of three of the most common species Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis idaea, and Deschampsia flexuosa. The effect of herbivory on the abundance of these three species did not differ between habitats and locations. However, the composition of the regenerating vegetation differed between habitats and locations. The disturbance treatment increased the species richness on the scale of plots, habitats, and sites. However, on the scale of whole locations, all species found in disturbed areas were also found in undisturbed areas, suggesting that the natural disturbance regime in arctic landscapes is high enough to sustain colonising species.","WOS:000231824400010",8,0.837410881,0
"912","tundra","Browsing-mediated shrub canopy changes drive composition and species richness in forest-tundra ecosystems","Changes in climate and in browsing pressure are expected to alter the abundance of tundra shrubs thereby influencing the composition and species richness of plant communities. We investigated the associations between browsing, tundra shrub canopies and their understory vegetation by utilizing a long-term (1013 seasons) experiment controlling reindeer and ptarmigan herbivory in the subarctic forest tundra ecotone in northwestern Fennoscandia. In this area, there has also been a consistent increase in the yearly thermal sum and precipitation during the study period. The cover of shrubs increased 2.87.8 fold in exclosures and these contrasted with browsed control areas creating a sharp gradient of canopy cover of tundra shrubs across a variety of vegetation types. Browsing exclusions caused significant shifts in more productive vegetation types, whereas little or no shift occurred in low-productive tundra communities. The increased deciduous shrub cover was associated with significant losses of understory plant species and shifts in functional composition, the latter being clearest in the most productive plant community types. The total cover of understory vegetation decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of litter showed the opposite response. The cover of cryptogams decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of forbs was favoured by a shrub cover. Increasing shrub cover decreased species richness of understory vegetation, which was mainly due to the decrease in the cryptogam species. The effects were consistent across different types of forest tundra vegetation indicating that shrub increase may have broad impacts on arctic vegetation diversity. Deciduous shrub cover is strongly regulated by reindeer browsing pressure and altered browsing pressure may result in a profound shrub expansion over the next one or two decades. Results suggest that the impact of an increase in shrubs on tundra plant richness is strong and browsing pressure effectively counteracts the effects of climate warming-driven shrub expansion and hence maintains species richness.","WOS:000308634600005",9,0.678068338,0
"1012","tundra","Long-term mammalian herbivory and nutrient addition alter lichen community structure in Alaskan dry heath tundra","Mammalian herbivores in arctic tundra often alter plant species composition and lichen abundance, with effects dependent on grazing season and herbivore preference. We investigated how long-term mammal exclosures designed to exclude large mammals (caribou) alone, large and medium-sized mammals (e.g., ground squirrels), or all mammals (including voles and lemmings) affected lichen abundance and species composition as well as the vascular plant community. The exclosures were partly established in combination with long-term soil nutrient additions to investigate the interaction between mammal activity and nutrient availability. Our study was conducted in dry heath tundra in northern Alaska, dominated by dwarf evergreen shrubs and lichens. Excluding mammals for 17 years allowed the lichen community to increase in biomass, particularly within the genus Cladonia, which also had more intrageneric diversity in the exclosures; after 10 years, results were subtler. Fertilization, however, almost eliminated the lichens, regardless of herbivore treatment. This coincided with a dramatic shift in vascular vegetation toward a more palatable grass-dominated community, similar to studies of other arctic heaths. Our results suggest that with greater soil nutrient availability that occurs with climate warming, lichens will decrease in abundance, and this effect may be exacerbated by increased mammalian herbivory.","WOS:000252869000007",10,0.573109838,0

The oldest study was initiated in 1977-1979 and the latest in 1992. Total species number increased at all sites except for the birch forest site where richness decreased. We found no general pattern in how composition of vascular plants has changed over time. Three species, Calamagrostis lapponica, Carex vaginata and Salix reticulata, showed an overall increase in cover/frequency, while two Equisetum taxa decreased. Instead, we showed that the magnitude and direction of changes in species richness and composition differ among sites.","WOS:000307285200003",11,0.691202545,0
"1213","tundra","Plant species diversity and grazing in the Scandinavian mountains - patterns and processes at different spatial scales","There is a long tradition of grazing by semi-domestic reindeer and sheep in alpine and sub-alpine Scandinavian habitats, but present management regimes are questioned from a conservation point of view. In this review we discuss plant diversity patterns in the Scandinavian mountains in a global regional and local perspective. The main objective was to identify processes that influence diversity at different spatial scales with a particular focus on grazing. In a global perspective the species pool of the Scandinavian mountains is limited, partly reflecting the general latitudinal decline of species but also historical and ecological factors operating after the latest glaciation. At the local scale, both productivity and disturbance are primary factors structuring diversity, but abiotic factors such as soil pH, snow distribution and temperature are also important. Although evidence is scarce, grazing favours local species richness in productive habitats, whereas species richness decreases with grazing when productivity is low. Regional patterns of plant diversity is set by, 1) the species pool, 2) the heterogeneity and fragmentation of communities, and 3) local diversity of each plant community. We suggest that local shifts in community composition depend both on the local grazing frequency and the return-time of the plant community after a grazing session. In addition, an increasing number of grazing-modified local patches homogenises the vegetation and is likely to reduce the regional plant diversity. The time scale of local shifts in community composition depends on plant colonisation and persistence, From a mechanistic point of view, diversity patterns at a regional scale also depend on the regional dynamics of single species. Colonisation is usually a slow and irregular process in alpine environments, whereas the capacity for extended local persistence is generally high. Although the poor knowledge of plant regional dynamics restricts our understanding of how grazing influences plant diversity, we conclude that grazing is a key process for maintaining biodiversity in the Scandinavian mountains.","WOS:000173491900007",12,0.721115579,0

The experimental sites included tundra heath, frost heath and riparian habitats, and the two latter habitats were characterized by hummock-hollow ground forms. The total cover of vegetation, cover of willow (Salix spp.), dwarf birch (Betula nana), dwarf shrubs, forbs and grasses (Poaceae spp.) increased in exclosures in all habitats. The increase in the total cover of vegetation and in the covers of willow and dwarf birch tended to be greatest in the least productive tundra heath. Opposing to the increase in the dominant vascular plant groups, the cover and species number of bryophytes decreased in exclosures. We conclude that the effects of reindeer grazing on vegetation composition depend on environmental heterogeneity and the responses vary among plant groups.","WOS:000258635600009",13,0.693933654,0
"1412","tundra","Herbivory and nutrient limitation protect warming tundra from lowland species' invasion and diversity loss","Herbivory and nutrient limitation can increase the resistance of temperature-limited systems to invasions under climate warming. We imported seeds of lowland species to tundra under factorial treatments of warming, fertilization, herbivore exclusion and biomass removal. We show that warming alone had little impact on lowland species, while exclusion of native herbivores and relaxation of nutrient limitation greatly benefitted them. In contrast, warming alone benefitted resident tundra species and increased species richness; however, these were canceled by negative effects of herbivore exclusion and fertilization. Dominance of lowland species was associated with low cover of tundra species and resulted in decreased species richness. Our results highlight the critical role of biotic and abiotic filters unrelated to temperature in protecting tundra under warmer climate. While scarcity of soil nutrients and native herbivores act as important agents of resistance to invasions by lowland species, they concurrently promote overall species coexistence. However, when these biotic and abiotic resistances are relaxed, invasion of lowland species can lead to decreased abundance of resident tundra species and diminished diversity.","WOS:000390218300021",14,0.472032181,0

Experimental warming caused a 26-36% decrease in species richness, a response that was generally dampened by experimental grazing. Higher species losses occurred at the drier sites where N was less available. Moreover, we observed an indirect effect of climate change on species richness as mediated by plant-plant interactions. Heat stress and warming-induced litter accumulation are potential explanations for the species' responses to experimental warming. This is the first reported experimental evidence that climate warming could cause dramatic declines in plant species diversity in high elevation ecosystems over short time frames and supports model predictions of species losses with anthropogenic climate change.","WOS:000225078000007",15,0.574730466,0

We investigate the effects of these climate change and grazing factors using 5 years of data collected from a relatively long-term (2009-2015), fully-factorial field experiment in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, we investigate: 1) how experimental warming, spring snow addition, and yak grazing independently and interactively affect plant community properties, including diversity metrics and relative contributions of different plant life forms to the total plant cover, and 2) how the changes in plant community properties are associated with the proportional cover of the dominant plant species, Kobresia pygmaea within the total vegetation cover. We found that warming reduced species richness and increased species evenness and the proportional cover of shrubs within the total vegetation cover. Snow addition also increased species evenness. Grazing increased the proportional cover of K. pygmaea within the total vegetation cover, while decreasing that of grasses. Grazing also counteracted warming-induced increases in shrubs. Treatment-induced changes in K. pygmaea cover were strongly correlated with the indices of plant community properties and were generally in the opposite direction of changes in species evenness and diversity. We conclude that the projected increases in spring snowstorms and maintaining moderate levels of grazing can counteract some warming effects on the plant community. Moreover, the performance of the dominant species can regulate plant community responses to climate change and livestock grazing on the central Tibetan Plateau.","WOS:000449236500018",31,0.707566243,0

We tested these predictions using two sets of mountain plant communities assembled along postglacial successional and snow depth (disturbance and stress) gradients in maritime Kamchatka. In each community, we counted the number of species in plots of increasing sizes (0.0025-100 m(2)) and analyzed them using species-area curves fitted by the Arrhenius power function and the Gleason logarithmic function. A comparison of successional communities along a 270-year-old moraine chronosequence behind the receding Koryto Glacier-representing gradients of increasing productivity and resource competition-confirmed the unimodal species richness pattern. The plant diversity peaked in a 60-80-year-old Salix-Alnus stand where light availability was sufficient to sustain a rich understory combining pioneer and late successional herbs. The closed Alnus canopy on older moraines caused a pronounced decrease in species richness for all plot sizes (interactive stage 80-120 years since deglaciation). A slight increase in species richness in the oldest assortative stages (120-270 years), when Alnus stands are mature, was found only at the smaller spatial scales. This reflects (i) the consolidation of clonal understory dominants and (ii) the absence of other woody species such as Betula ermanii whose invasion would eliminate Alnus and increase diversity at larger spatial scales. A comparative study of major mountain plant communities distributed above the Koryto Glacier foreland did not confirm the highest species richness at intermediate levels of disturbance and stress. Contrary to our expectation, the species richness was highest in alpine tundra and snowbed communities, which are subjected to severe winter frost and a short summer season, while less disturbed communities of subalpine meadows, heaths, and Betula ermanii woods were less species-rich. We attribute this pattern to differences in habitat area and species pool size.","WOS:000315491300012",38,0.801523137,0

Location: Alpine heaths, central east Sweden. Methods: Dry heath and grass heath vegetation plots with inferred grazing intensities (high, intermediate and low) were selected a priori from an interpolated pellet count map compiled in 2002. In each plot, faecal pellets were counted, environmental variables measured and vegetation sampled by listing presence and absence. Species composition was compared with a detrended correspondence analysis, and a canonical correspondence analysis was used to infer relations between species composition and environmental variables. Plots were also clustered to provide groupings for an indicator species analysis. Results: Significant differences in faecal pellet count were present between the highest and lowest grazing intensities for both vegetation types, showing that the pattern in the interpolated pellet maps was robust. Differences in species composition between grazing intensities were found for the dry heath only. Here, there was an apparent grazing gradient, with lichens and mosses in the low-use plots and grasses and herbs in the high-use plots. No such gradient was found for the grass heath. Conclusions: Within the dry heath vegetation type, grazing levels had a subtle effect on the vegetation, while no effects were seen in the grass heath, probably as a result of the dominance of more grazing-tolerant graminoids. Even in the dry heath, species richness did not differ between grazing levels, but the relative abundances of species differed.","WOS:000270031300003",47,0.70425066,0

To understand the effects of tundra fire and the resultant thermokarst on revegetation, vegetation and related environmental factors were compared between burned and unburned areas of Seward Peninsula, Alaska, using a total of 140 plots, 50 cm x 50 cm each. The area was burned in 2002 and surveyed in 2013. Seven vegetation types were classified by a cluster analysis and were categorized along a fire-severity gradient from none to severe fire intensity. The species richness and diversity were higher in intermediately disturbed plots. Severe fire allowed the immigration of fire-favored species (e.g., Epilobium angustifolium, Ceratodon purpureus) and decreased or did not change the species diversity, indicating that species replacement occurred within the severely burned site. Although thermokarsts (ground subsidence) broadly occurred on burned sites, due to thawing, the subsidence weakly influenced vegetation patterns. These results suggest that the fire directly altered the species composition at a landscape scale between the burned and unburned sites and it indirectly altered the plant cover and diversity through the differential modification, such as thermokarst, at a small scale within the burned site.","WOS:000428603800014",59,0.733242784,0

Nutrient availability, defoliation and soil disturbance are important factors that influence the richness of plant communities. However, few studies have examined the interactions between these factors, especially in harsh environments. We therefore examined the effects of fertilization, defoliation and soil disturbance on plant species richness in an alpine meadow in northern Sweden. 2. From 2002 to 2005, plots were fertilized, mowed and disturbed annually in a factorially designed experiment. Plant species richness, colonization and extinction were recorded in permanent subplots. Seedling densities and recruitment from seed of Potentilla crantzii were also estimated in order to examine the mechanisms whereby these treatments influence colonization by new species. 3. Species richness peaked in the absence of disturbance in unfertilized plots and with light disturbance in fertilized plots. Colonization by new vascular plant species, seed recruitment and seedling density were all increased by soil disturbance, suggesting that colonization was increased because conditions were more favourable for seed recruitment following the disturbance treatment. Extinction of species was highest in the mowed, intensively disturbed and unfertilized plots and lowest in the fertilized, lightly disturbed and unmowed plots. 4. Local extinction was negatively correlated with both moss and vascular plant biomass. Local colonization, seedling density and recruitment of P. crantzii were all strongly negatively correlated with the biomass of mosses. In contrast, the biomass of vascular plants was only weakly correlated with local colonization, seedling density and recruitment of P. crantzii. 5. This study suggest that the level of disturbance at which species richness peaks should move towards higher disturbance levels when productivity increases. However, lower extinction rates rather then higher colonization rates seem to be causing the increase in species richness following disturbance.","WOS:000249166700003",64,0.746390401,1

Macrolichen abundance was estimated from 45, 0.38-ha plots. Eighteen of those plots, scattered throughout the southern Seward Peninsula, represented two levels of grazing, heavy and light. We found lightly grazed areas had taller lichens and greater total lichen cover than heavily grazed sites. Minor yet statistically significant changes in community structure were also observed between heavily and lightly grazed sites. However, lichen species richness did not differ by grazing status. Overall, average lichen height appears to be the best indication of grazing intensity on the Seward Peninsula. Apart from the 18 grazing plots, 8 additional plots were established in previously burned sites to represent reference conditions with a known time since disturbance date. These plots provided a framework of vegetation recovery from severe, recent disturbance towards pre-disturbance conditions. Patterns in lichen, bryophyte and vascular plant characteristics from these fire plots in combination with our findings from the grazing plots were then used to interpret the disturbance history of new plots. These new plots comprise the remaining 19 plots (of the total 45) that were sampled within the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve (BELA). We believe the location of BELA, regardless of disturbance history, is more favorable to vascular plants and Sphagnum, and lichens grow taller in response, compared to areas on the Seward Peninsula further south. In addition, lower cover in the Preserve may be attributed to site or climatic differences rather than grazing.","WOS:000253903400004",70,0.742881069,0

Although knowledge of the effect of herbivores on specific plants and communities is quite extensive, little is known about the relative impact of large and small vertebrate herbivores and how it might vary among different habitats. To address this key issue, we established exclosures with two different mesh sizes in forest and nearby tundra at three different sites in four contrasting locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and Norway. Plant community composition was recorded annually in three permanent plots within each exclosure and an unfenced control. Local densities of vertebrate herbivores were estimated in spring and autumn from 1998 to 2002. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) were the most abundant large vertebrate while Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) and grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus) were the most common small vertebrates. The study reveals that voles and lemmings have larger effects on the vegetation than reindeer in both habitats in all four locations, even though densities of reindeer differ between locations and only two locations experienced lemming peaks during the period of the experiment. The relative abundance of five of the fifteen most common species was significantly influenced by voles and lemmings whereas only a single species was significantly influenced by reindeer. Different analyses give contrasting results on the importance of herbivory in forest versus open heathlands. A principal component analyses revealed that herbivory influenced the vegetation more in open heathlands than in forests. However, an importance index of herbivores did not differ between forest and open heathlands. Moreover, none of the plant species responded differently in the two habitats, when herbivores were removed. Our results suggest that intense and localised selective foraging by small mammals may have a more marked effect on vegetation than transient feeding by reindeer.","WOS:000222424600012",72,0.747076989,0

Conditions climatically optimal for the greatest species diversity are the result of a perfect balance of heat and moisture characteristics of subtaiga/forest-steppe altitudinal belt complexes (ABC). However, changes in phytochorological- and alpha-diversity of individual phyl.ocoenoses are influenced by ecological and phytocoenotic factors combined. The biggest number of species in the reserve occurs along the forest distribution boundaries - in subtaiga and high mountain open woodland whereas species are the fewest in mountain taiga. Conversely, phytomass loading is the greatest in mountain taiga and it decreases gradually towards alpine tundra and steppes.","WOS:000229246400007",109,0.758533888,0
"1192","tundra","Dictyostelid cellular slime molds associated with grasslands of the central and western United States","Dictyostelid cellular slime molds (dictyostelids) associated with grassland ecosystems of the central and western United States were investigated at nine sites that included examples of the three major ecological types of grasslands (tall grass, mixed grass and short grass) generally recognized for the region. Samples of soil/humus collected from each site were examined with the Cavender method of isolating dictyostelids. For each of those six sites with well developed gallery forests present, an additional set of forest soil/humus samples was collected. A more intensive sampling effort was carried out at one site (Konza LTER) to assess the possible effects of burning and grazing on dictyostelid diversity and density. Twelve species of dictyostelids were recovered from grassland sites, whereas gallery forest sites yielded only nine species. Four cosmopolitan species (Dictyostelium giganteum, D. mucoroides, D. sphaerocephalum and Polysphondylium pallidum) were represented by the greatest densities of clones, with D. sphaerocephalum particularly common. The general pattern across all sites was that both species richness and density of dictyostelids decreased with decreasing precipitation. Samples collected from ungrazed grassland plots yielded higher numbers of both species and clones as compared to grazed plots, and the general pattern was for both values to increase as the interval between fires increased. For numbers of clones this correlation was statistically significant.","WOS:000281627500002",119,0.785369572,0
"1321","tundra","Evaluating human-disturbed habitats for recovery planning of endangered plants","The recovery potential of endangered species is limited by the high prevalence of human-modified habitats, while effective in situ conservation strategies to identify and restore disturbed habitat within species ranges are lacking. Our goal was to determine the impact of human disturbance on the endangered endemic Barrens willow (Salix jejuna) to provide science-based protocols for future restoration of disturbed habitats; a key component of conservation and recovery plans for many rare plant species. Our study examined differences in substrate (e.g., % total plant cover, % species cover, substrate type) and vegetation in naturally- (via frost activity) vs human-disturbed limestone barrens (Newfoundland, Canada), across the entire species range of the endangered Barrens willow. There were distinct differences in substrate conditions and vegetation community structure between naturally- and human-disturbed limestone barrens habitat throughout the narrow range of this endemic willow. Human-disturbed sites are more homogeneous and differ significantly from the naturally-disturbed sites having a much coarser substrate (30% more gravel) with less fine grained sands, less exposed bedrock, decreased soil moisture, increased nitrogen content, and reduced phosphorus content. Substrate differences can inhibit return to the natural freeze-thaw disturbance regime of the limestone barrens, negatively affecting long-term persistence of this, and other rare plants. The structure of associated vegetation (specifically woody species presence) negatively affected willow abundance but was not linked to disturbance type. Human-disturbed sites are potential candidates for endangered plant recovery habitat if natural ecosystem processes, vegetation community structure, and habitat heterogeneity are restored, thereby supporting the establishment of long term viable populations.

Groups of beetles showed associations with three distinct habitats: ski trail openings (Agonum cupripenne, Amara spp., Poecilus lucublandus, Hypnoidus bicolor, and H. abbreviatus), edge (Pterostichus coracinus, Agonum retractum, Sphaeroderus canadensis, and Calathus ingratus), and forest (Pterostichus adstrictus, P. punctatissimus, P. brevicornis, Platynus decentis, Trechas apicalis, T. crassiscapus, and Eanus maculipennis). Consequently, carabid and elaterid species composition in the ski trail, edge, and 5 m into the unfragmented forest showed nearly complete turnover. Most beetles within the ski trail were colonizers from lower elevations; however, one species, H. bicolor, was a tundra species that appeared to have colonized lower elevations along the ski trail opening. Of ""forest"" beetles, only 2 of 540 individuals (< 0.5%) were collected in the ski trail opening. Thus, ski trails are strong barriers to dispersal for forest beetles, several of which are flightless or dimorphic and primarily short-winged. Consequently, fragmentation of mountain slopes by ski trails, especially those that run perpendicular to the climatic gradient, may put isolated populations at a greater risk of local extirpation.","WOS:000208370600002",170,0.729286769,1
"2061","tundra","Large scale experimental effects of three levels of sheep densities on an alpine ecosystem","Plant herbivore dynamics is a major topic in ecological research, but empirical knowledge on the ecological effects of different densities of large grazers from fully replicated experiments is rare. Previous studies have focused on grazing vs no grazing, and our understanding of the extent to which different levels of grazing alter vegetation composition, and how quickly such effects can be measured, is therefore limited. We performed a fully replicated, short-term (four-year) experiment using large enclosures (each similar to 0.3 km(2)) with three different sheep densities (no grazing, low grazing and high grazing, respectively) in an alpine environment with summer grazing in southern Norway to address these issues. Sheep grazing mainly affected plant species at high densities of sheep as compared to no sheep after a four-year treatment; few effects of low sheep densities were detectable. Highly selected herbs, herbs suggested vulnerable to trampling, and woody species decreased, while most graminoids, one ruderal, one prostrate species and two bryophyte taxa increased at high sheep densities. We found contrasting responses within main functional groups highlighting that fine details of plant life histories need to be known for responses to grazing to be successfully predicted. Vascular plant cover and bare soil responded to sheep density after two years of treatment, but only for one of the species was frequency change observed at this stage. Overall, plants in low grazing plots were found to be almost unaffected. Changes in abundance were mainly found at the no grazing and high grazing treatments. Plant species that decreased at high grazing generally increased at no grazing and vice versa, suggesting a response to both cessation of grazing and enhanced grazing respectively. Our study demonstrates, beyond a simple comparison of heavily grazed and non-grazed sites, that herbivore effects on plants are typically non-linearly related to herbivore density, and that the speed of plant responses will depend both on the plant property examined and the grazing pressure.","WOS:000256839300004",206,0.723223999,1
"263","tundra","The influence of non-sorted circles on species diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens in Sub-Arctic Tundra","Non-sorted circles (NSCs), also known as frost boils, are common soil frost features that create a small-scale mosaic of vegetation zones in periglacial landscapes. The causes of variation in plant diversity within NSCs are poorly understood. This lack of understanding hampers our ability to predict how arctic plant communities respond to changing soil frost conditions. We hypothesised that plant communities of different ages develop at a micro-site scale within NSCs as soil frost periodically exposes uncolonised soil or fatally offsets plant succession. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the species diversity of plant communities (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens) from the sparsely vegetated centre of the circles to the densely vegetated outer domain in conjunction with estimates of the age of the plant communities (inferred using lichenometry). Our results suggest that the variation in species diversity and density can largely be explained by the occurrence of progressively older plant communities from the centre towards the vegetated rim. Here, the high species diversity was observed to occur in communities having the ages approximately around 150 years. Our findings suggest that soil frost disturbances are important for maintaining successional gradients several centuries long within the arctic landscape at a small spatial scale (< 3 m). The termination of soil frost activity as a result of a warmer future winter climate is therefore most likely to result in a loss of micro-sites having young vegetation communities with high plant diversities and a subsequent establishment of mature shrub-dominated plant communities.","WOS:000310207900005",263,0.717795908,0
"302","tundra","Plant community properties predict vegetation resilience to herbivore disturbance in the Arctic","P>1. Understanding the impact of disturbance on vegetation and the resilience of plant communities to disturbance is imperative to ecological theory and environmental management. In this study predictors of community resilience to a simulated natural disturbance are investigated. Responses to disturbance are examined at the community, plant functional type and species level. 2. Field experiments were set up in seven tundra plant communities, simulating disturbance based on the impact of grubbing by an increasing herbivore population of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus). The short-term resilience of communities was assessed by comparing community dissimilarity between control plots and plots subject to three disturbance intensities based on the foraging impact of these geese. Potential for long-term recovery was evaluated across different disturbance patch sizes. 3. Resilience to disturbance varied between communities; those with higher moss cover and higher soil moisture, such as wetlands and mires, were most resilient to disturbance. 4. The wetter communities demonstrated greater long-term recovery potential following disturbance. In wetland communities, vegetative recovery of vascular plants and moss was greater in smaller disturbed patches and at the edges of patches. 5. The response of vegetation to disturbance varied with intensity of disturbance, plant community and plant species. The use of functional type classifications only partially explained the variation in species responses to disturbance across communities, thus their use in predicting community changes was limited. 6. Synthesis. The impact of disturbance is shown to be plant-community specific and related to the initial abiotic and biotic properties of the community. By showing that resilience is partly predictable, the identification of disturbance-susceptible communities is possible, which is of relevance for ecosystem management.","WOS:000280667200003",302,0.744078032,0
"413","tundra","Unintentional habitats: Value of a city for the wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe)","Humans are rapidly reducing and isolating the habitats of native species such as the wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) through urbanisation and agricultural intensification. The wheatear, a small songbird, has declined dramatically throughout Europe. It is known to live in alpine meadows, in tundra, and rural landscapes as well as in urban areas, but it is unknown if these urban populations reproduce sufficiently. This study aimed to investigate reproductive success and habitat requirements of the wheatear in the city of Berlin, Germany. We analysed occurrence and breeding success in relation to vegetation and surface structure of the settled sites, intensity of direct disturbance by humans and dogs, as well as degree of sealing and residential population density in the surrounding urban matrix. Finally, we compared early-settled to late-settled territories to appraise habitat preferences of wheatears. The proportion of successful nests was high (73%) compared to other regions and habitats. Area size of a site greatly affected the probability of wheatear occurrence; it was much higher on sites larger than five hectare. Factors affecting breeding success differed completely from those explaining variation in occurrence, indicating that breeding success seems not to be related to habitat preferences. There was no influence of the urban matrix at a landscape level (200 m and 2000 m zone) on occurrence or breeding success. To maintain and create habitat for endangered open-land species as the wheatear, we recommend minimum area size of five hectare, sparse vegetation, open soils, short grass, and very few trees and shrubs.
