Repeat counts of photographs had coefficients of variation (CVs) of 6.6% and the main ground count methods had CVs of 3%-5%. Between the 1940s and 1990s there was an apparently continuous 82%-88% decrease (at 1.5%-2.7% p.a.) in nest numbers at three photographed grey-headed mollymawk colonies. Ground counts in 1995-97 recorded 7800 grey-headed mollymawk nests/yr (6200 with eggs during mid-October), representing a population of about 11800 (biennially breeding) pairs. Extrapolating back from these data, there may have been 43 000 grey-headed mollymawk nests/yr in the 1940s. Environmental changes affecting the food supply are the most likely explanation for the long-term decline. One Campbell mollymawk colony showed an increase of 11% in nest numbers between the 1940s and 1966, a decrease of 47% by the 1980s, then a gradual recovery of 3.2% p.a. Extrapolation suggests there were about 31 300 Campbell mollymawk nests in the 1940s. There were 24 600 nests in 1995-97 (21 000 with eggs during mid-October). The large decrease in the late 1960s to early 1980s coincided with the peak in long-line fishing for southern bluefin tuna. Regular monitoring of mollymawk populations (preferably with a suite of species) is recommended; three consecutive years every decade is a minimum requirement. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to test links between environmental change and mollymawk population trends. ¬© July 2004, Department of Conservation.",Article,Scopus,0.885292778,1,1,NA,5,5,1,5,2,NA

They are an inshore, coastal dwelling species and were severely depleted by spearfishing in the 1960s. The population has continued to decline despite protection since 1984. Their life history (long-lived to 25+ years), late maturation (6-8 years), low fecundity (maximum 2 live young biennially), specific habitat requirements, limited inshore distribution, and small population size render them particularly vulnerable to extinction. We estimated the time to quasi-extinction (years elapsed for the population to consist of ‚â§50 females) for the grey nurse shark population off the east coast of Australia based on current estimates of abundance and known anthropogenic rates of mortality. Estimated minimum population size was 300 as of 2002, and minimum anthropogenic mortality assessed from recovered carcasses was 12/year of which 75% were females. We modelled time to quasi-extinction using deterministic age- and stage-classified models for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios. Population size was estimated at 300 (worst), 1000 (likely) and 3000 (best). Anthropogenic mortality was added to the model assuming either all carcasses are being recovered (best), or conservatively, that only 50% are reported (realistic). Depending on model structure, if all carcasses are being reported, quasi-extinction times for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios range from 13 to 16 years, 84-98 years and 289-324 years, respectively. If under-reporting is occurring, time to quasi-extinction ranges from 6 to 8 years, 45-53 years and 173-200 years, respectively. In all scenarios modelled the grey nurse shark population will decline if no further steps are taken to remove anthropogenic sources of mortality. Because estimates of quasi-extinction rate depend on initial population size, and sensitivity analysis revealed that population rate of change was most sensitive to changes in the survival probability of the smallest length classes, obtaining precise estimates of abundance and annual survival of young females is critical. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Central to this is the use of line transect surveys and estimations of the detection rate of geoduck (show-factor) using counts of siphon holes. Studies were restricted to less than 17 m water depth. Geoduck in Kennedy Bay were found from 4-8 m water depth, whereas geoduck in Wellington Harbour occurred in several separate beds from 4-16 m. In Wellington Harbour, there was a pattern of increasing numbers with depth up to ‚àº15 m. Numbers seemed to decrease thereafter. Analysis of sediment samples indicated that P. zelandica was more prevalent in fine sand to fine silty sand substrates. P. abrupta is found in similar habitats. There was no significant difference in the show-factor (the proportion of geoduck detectable by sight or touch vs. the actual number of geoduck present) of geoduck with respect to season (summer and winter), region (Wellington Harbour and Kennedy Bay), or tidal height (low, mid, and high tide). Hence, a mean show-factor of 0.914 was used to adjust density estimates from all surveyed populations. Estimates of the mean population density (¬±SE) of P. zelandica were much lower than those reported for P. abrupta ranging from 0.058 (¬±0.01) geoduck/m2 in Kennedy Bay to 0.489 (¬±0.08) geoduck/m2 in Shelly Bay, Wellington Harbour. Survey densities, abundance, and biomass estimates were reasonably well determined with coefficients of variation (CVs) generally less than 20%. The results suggest that the methods used to provide population estimates for P. abrupta are readily transferable to P. zelandica. However, further research needs to be conducted on the diver variability on counts of geoduck, the role that geoduck occurring in water depths &gt;17 m play in the population dynamics of local populations, and the density dependence of fertilization success of P. zelandica. Given the low estimates of density in this study, fisheries managers will have to carefully consider the feasibility of sustainably harvesting this species.",Article,Scopus,0.84991163,0,0,NA,5,5,0,5,4,NA

The present study involved surveys of the Green and Golden Bell Frog locations that were known in 1995, surveys of new locations or potential areas for new locations of this species, and review of management plans and other documented information concerning particular populations. Over the last 12 years extinctions have continued with the loss of almost 50% of those sub-populations and 23% of populations known in 1995. Obviously the species cannot sustain this rate of loss for much longer and continue to exist within New South Wales. Protection for remaining extant populations is very limited and most are under continuing threat. Management plans have been prepared in relation to a number of sub-populations/populations, but these plans have not focused on populations under current threat, and associated management actions designed to benefit this frog have occurred in only a few cases. Hence, decline of this species within NSW is likely to continue. Habitat change, mostly through destruction and disturbance, has been the major factor in population loss with the likelihood of extinction increasing with increases in the extent of habitat loss as measured by the number of habitat variables that have declined. Invasion by exotic predatory fish Gambusia holbrooki, previously linked with declines in this frog species, shows no apparent association with extinction of populations over the last 12 years and poses no apparent current threat to any population, apparently because any impact of this species has been ameliorated through the presence of submerged/floating aquatic vegetation which may provide some protection against predation for eggs and tadpoles. The steps most likely to improve the conservation status of the Green and Golden Bell Frog within the state are habitat enhancement/development and restoration of movement links between nearby populations.",Review,Scopus,0.848459096,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,28,NA

A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways.

Samples of foods taken by adults (were collected for identification of major prey species. Banding of chicks and observations of adults previously banded as chicks (particularly at Wedge Light) provided information on the source of breeding adults and age of return to colonies. Wedge Light colony, estab¬≠lished in 1966, has reached some 50 pairs: breeding there is now limited by available space. At Pope‚Äôs Eye, where breeding began before 1985, space also limited breeding but the provision of an additional platform in 1989 led to a dou¬≠bling of adults nesting (to c. 120 in 1991-92). Nest building at the study sites began in August-September, and eggs were laid mainly in September; second, or replacement, eggs from November-December. Most hatching took place October-November, with chicks fledging January-Febru- ary; there was some variation in timing between years. Numbers of clutches laid, as a proportion of nest attempts, were consistently higher at Wedge Light; at Pope‚Äôs Eye some nests were lost presumably as a result of bad weather. Hatching success was similar at both sites (64%), some 89% of chicks hatched left the platforms; mean breeding success (chicks fledged/eggs laid) was 57%. Although relatively few chicks died or were lost (9-14%), about 36% of eggs failed to hatch (mainly through loss). Nest success was influenced, to some extent, by exposure, particularly at Pope‚Äôs Eye where seas may wash over breeding sites and drainage is poor. The extended breeding period may reflect local weath¬≠er conditions and less reliable food availability. In this study, individual prey items were mainly Pilchards Sarclinops sagax (58.4%); other taxa (20 fish, four cephalopods and a shrimp species) were generally represented by a few indi¬≠viduals. On average, prey species weighed 45 g, were 141 mm long, 15 mm wide and 26 mm deep; Pilchards were mostly (72%) < 140 mm long. Most regurgitations collected (mean mass 146 g) contained only one fish species (82%). As in other dietary studies of gannets, prey species were pri¬≠marily inshore, schooling and pelagic. Little is known of factors influencing the distribution or abundance of the prey species; food deliveries at breeding colonies were lighter than those reported elsewhere, which may indicate local for¬≠aging. At both sites, colonies have grown as a consequence, in part at least, of the recruitment of chicks fledged at Wedge Light. Expansion at Wedge Light is now impossible, and at Pope‚Äôs Eye there is little additional area for breeding. The provision of more artificial platforms might further in¬≠crease the local population. ¬© 1995 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.",Article,Scopus,0.828257178,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,121,NA

An 18-year dataset obtained for Michaelmas Cay in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, was used to assess population trends for three tern species relative to two potential threatening processes, namely human impacts (as either commercial fishing or tourism) and cyclone activity. We found a positive, 2-year lagged relationship between long-line catch per unit effort in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery in the vicinity of Michaelmas Cay and breeding participation in the two pelagic foraging terns, but not in the inshore foraging tern. The abundance of large pelagic fish may influence recruitment into the breeding populations of the two pelagic terns in the following years through impacts on prey availability. Long-term population trends for all seabirds were not related to localised direct disturbance from cyclones or associated changes in cay size and/or nesting habitat. Current management protocols in place for the tourism industry at the cay appear to be minimising direct human impacts.

Catches were from throughout South Australia's gulf region, but three areas separated by hundreds of kilometres produced the highest catches. These relatively protected areas support extensive beds of intertidal and subtidal seagrasses. Statewide commercial fishery catches demonstrated considerable inter-annual variation of 240-320 t year-1. Catches were dominated by 1+ and 2+ fish, with few individuals from the 3+ to 5+ age classes. Females dominated the sex ratios, were the largest individuals, and the largest from each age class. No running ripe fish were sampled. Seasonal variation in the catch and in the lack of spawning fish suggested that adults might move from fishing areas during the spawning season.

A total of 449 individual tiger sharks was captured; 29 were recaptured. Tiger shark catch rate showed seasonal periodicity, being higher during the warm season (Sep-May) than during the cold season (Jun-Aug), and was marked by inter-annual variability. The most striking feature of the catch data was a consistent pattern of slow, continuous variation within each year from a peak during the height of the warm season (February) to a trough in the cold season (July). Annual growth rates of recaptured individuals were generally consistent with estimates from other regions, but exceeded those for populations elsewhere for sharks &gt;275 cm fork length (FL), perhaps because mature sharks in the study area rely heavily on large prey.

Ages ranged from 0 to 41 years, and males were on average larger at age than females after age 6 for fish sampled in the southern oceans. This sexual dimorphism in growth contributed to the sex ratio being biased toward males for length classes ‚â•170 cm FL. The estimated age composition of catches, derived from age-length keys applied to length frequency data, showed clear differences between fisheries and fishing grounds that are consistent with seasonal and ontogenetic changes in migration patterns. Specific information that can be gained on the distribution and migration of juveniles from their relative abundance in catches is limited because of unknown targeting or discarding practices on some fishing grounds. However, the occurrence of 2-4-year-old SBT on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean during the austral summer confirms that juveniles are not restricted to the southern coastal waters of Australia, and that a divergent migration path must exist possibly near the southern west coast of Australia. During the winter months, SBT aged 2-4 years were caught on all fishing grounds south of the spawning ground, confirming that they are capable of extensive migrations. By age 5, SBT were rarely caught north of about 35¬∞S, except in waters adjacent to Australia's west coast where adults were caught migrating to/from the spawning ground. The commercial catch of SBT in the southern oceans was dominated by juveniles and sub-adults on most fishing grounds examined. Off north-east New Zealand, however, the majority of fish caught were of spawning age (61% were >10-year old) suggesting that the Tasman Sea may form the eastern boundary for juvenile migration. SBT caught on the spawning ground ranged in age from 8 to 34 years with the majority being between 15- and 25-years old. Crown Copyright ¬© 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.7798535,NA,0,NA,NA,10,,,101,NA

The atherinid Leptatherina wallacei and the gobiids Pseudogobius olorum and Afurcagobius suppositus dominated the ichthyofauna, ranking, in terms of abundance, first, second and third, respectively, in each of the upstream, middle and downstream regions. These three species and 11 others, which also complete their life cycles within estuaries, constituted 46.4% of the number of species recorded and contributed 93.5% to the total catch of fish. The characteristics of the ichthyofauna in the upper reaches of this microtidal estuary underwent annual cyclical changes and differed between day and night, regions and years. The number of species and density of fish peaked during summer and typically declined to their minima in winter and then rose markedly in spring. The annual cyclical change undergone by the species composition of each region during both the day and night was due to the densities of certain species peaking at different times of the year. The cyclical changes in composition were less conspicuous in the year when, in the summer, highly atypical heavy rainfall led to a sharp rise in freshwater discharge and thus a pronounced decline in salinity. The number of species and density of fish were far greater at night than during the day and the species composition underwent diel changes. These differences were due, in particular, to relatively greater abundances and frequencies of occurrence at night of the estuarine species A. suppositus, P. olorum, L. wallacei and Acanthopagrus butcheri and of the introduced freshwater species Gambusia holbrooki. Overall, marine species were relatively more abundant in the downstream region, whereas the reverse was true for the freshwater and semi-anadromous species.

We studied 2 marine reserves in northeastern New Zealand, the Leigh Marine Reserve (established 1975) and Tawharanui Marine Park (established 1982) in order to assess whether changes in protected predator populations had resulted in other indirect changes to grazers and consequently to algal abundance. Estimates of abundance of the most common demersal predatory fish Pagrus auratus indicated that adults of this species (i.e. large enough to prey upon urchins) were at least 5.75 and 8.70 times more abundant inside reserves than in adjacent unprotected areas. Overall, P. auratus were also much larger inside reserves with mean total lengths of 316 mm compared with 186 mm in fished areas. The spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii displayed similar trends, and was approximately 1.6 to 3.7 times more abundant inside the reserves than outside. Lobsters within the reserves had a mean carapace length of 109.9 mm, compared with 93.5 mm outside the reserves. In one of the reserves, densities of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus had declined from 4.9 to 1.4 m-2 since 1978 in areas formerly dominated by it. Consequently, kelp forests were more extensive in 1998 than they were at the time of reserve creation. Urchin-dominated barrens occupied only 14% of available reef substratum in reserves as opposed to 40% in unprotected areas. These changes in community structure, which have persisted since at least 1994, demonstrate not only higher trophic complexity than anticipated in Australasian ecosystems but also increased primary and secondary productivity in marine reserves as a consequence of protection.

We used catch data from various sampling methods in northern Australia and elicited anecdotal information from experts to build a size distribution of the true population to compensate for size classes that were unlikely to be represented in the catch because of size selectivity of the gear.

It is widely held that pelagic longline fisheries pose the major risk for Pacific loggerheads but the effects of other risk factors such as human-induced global climate change have rarely been considered. So we used generalised additive regression modelling and autoregressive-prewhitened cross-correlation analysis to explore whether regional ocean temperatures affect the long-term nesting population dynamics for the 2 Pacific loggerhead genetic stocks (Japan, Australia). We found that both Pacific stocks have been exposed to slowly increasing trends in mean annual sea surface temperature in their respective core regional foraging habitats over the past 50¬†years. We show that irrespective of whether a population was decreasing or increasing that there was an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature in the core foraging region during the year prior to the summer nesting season. Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperatures are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity. So warming regional ocean temperatures could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment unless Pacific loggerheads adapt by shifting their foraging habitat to cooler regions. So the gradual warming of the Pacific Ocean over the past 50¬†years is a major risk factor that must be considered in any meaningful diagnosis of the long-term declines apparent for some Pacific loggerhead nesting populations. ¬© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The DUV detected a wide snapper size range (2-70 cm), which from around 5 cm and up appear to represent absolute abundance estimates. For snapper 5 cm and below, density estimates were less than those obtained by fine-mesh beam trawl, which sampled snapper down to 17 mm fork length (recent settlers from the plankton). Total DUV estimates of 0+ snapper abundance (3-9 cm) within this estuarine system were 64,000 ¬± 20,000 (standard error), compared to 105,000 ¬± 17,000 by beam trawl. For snapper 10 cm and larger (1+ and older), the DUV population estimate for the harbour was 166,000 ¬± 28,000. These larger snapper were not vulnerable to the beam trawl, while Danish seine sampling returned estimates of 20,000-80,000 (5000-20,000) fish, depending on the swept area assumptions used. None of the passive methods were able to provide relative or absolute estimates of the overall snapper population size, and each returned strongly skewed snapper length frequencies. The DUV was also able to collect detailed imagery of seafloor habitat features, at the spatial scales of both sampling transects, and individual sleeping fish. This combination of new technologies and specific fish behaviour (sleeping inert on the seafloor) offers a significant new sampling tool for assessing absolute fish abundance and associated population size structures.

In the Southern Hemisphere, most O. ferox were caught by trawl on the continental slope, where its bathic range was extended to at least 880 m. Large specimens (>200 cm TL) were found across the whole depth range, but almost all juveniles were caught between 200 and 600 m. The largest recorded male was 344 cm TL, and female 450 cm TL. The few biological data suggest that size at maturity for males is around 200-250 cm TL, and for females 300-350 cm. No pregnant females were recorded but size at birth is probably about 100 cm TL. Nowhere has the species been found in large numbers. Survey and commercial catch data from south-east Australian trawl grounds suggest that numbers of O. ferox there have declined since the advent of deepwater commercial trawling in the 1970s. In areas of steep untrawlable terrain, increased gill-netting and longlining are likely to impact on local populations, with mature individuals being particularly vulnerable. Although O. ferox is not specifically targeted by commercial fishing activities, its likely very low fecundity make it susceptible to local extirpation, even at seemingly small capture rates. This species is protected off New South Wales and is considered "" vulnerable"" globally, by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.752444772,1,1,corrected ranked class,5,15,1,5,7,NA

Five inshore and two offshore strata around Banks Peninsula, and five strata between the inner fiord and the open coast of Dusky Sound were surveyed. In Banks Peninsula the overall mean catch rate (all fish) was 2.13 kg/pot per h (range 0.04‚Äì4.74) and coefficient of variation (CV) was 10.8%. Blue cod from inshore strata were significantly smaller than those from offshore strata, catch rates were lower, and the sex ratio was skewed towards males (inshore 2.2:1, offshore 0.74:1). In Dusky Sound the overall mean catch rate was 2.69 kg/pot per h (range 1.28‚Äì8.42), CV was 6.3%, highest catch rates were on the open coast, and overall sex ratio was 0.78:1 (male:female). Blue cod in the 1940s from throughout New Zealand were on average larger than blue cod in Banks Peninsula and Dusky Sound during this survey. Low relative abundance and small size of blue cod from the more accessible inshore areas, is consistent with fishing pressure causing a reduction in size and probably abundance, particularly in Banks Peninsula inshore strata. In Banks Peninsula, sex ratios in inshore areas are skewed towards males, possibly a result of fishing pressure. The results support other studies on protogynous fish species in which the removal of the larger final sex fish (males), promotes sex inversion. The plasticity of the sex inversion means that blue cod may be capable of restoring optimal sex ratios in the natural state, but may over-compensate with size specific anthropogenic removal of large numbers of individuals that would otherwise inhibit the sex inversion process. ¬© 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus,0.749331842,0,0,NA,5,15,0,5,3,NA

Although the weedy seadragon Phyllopteryx taeniolatus (Lacepede, 1804), a syngnathid fish endemic to southern Australia, is legally protected in New South Wales, there are no studies on population density, habitat use and behaviour to support this protection. We investigated the abundance, sex ratios and distribution of the weedy seadragon at three sites near Sydney, Australia. The distribution, density and sex ratios of seadragons were temporally stable, suggesting no large-scale seasonal migrations. Estimated population densities varied among sites from 10 individuals per ha to 65 individuals per ha, with sex ratios close to 1:1. Survival rates from one encounter to the next (approximately weekly) were high, being slightly lower for males (0.985 ¬± 0.006, mean ¬± se) and females (0.987 ¬± 0.005) compared with juveniles (1.000 ¬± 0.000). All size classes and both sexes were most common near the border of kelp and sand except when exhibiting hiding behaviour, when they were more often found in kelp beds. Kelp beds were the least-used habitat when feeding. Pregnant males tended to hide more often than other groups and therefore were more frequently found in kelp and kelp patches. Seadragons tended to be solitary, although pairing and grouping behaviour was also observed. Results of the present study show that weedy seadragons are resident in the same area throughout the year and have a strong affinity with heavily weeded rock and/or sand habitat. It is therefore recommended that the current species-based protection laws be used in concert with habitat-protection zones as a necessary measure to ensure the conservation of weedy seadragon populations. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.745827115,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,52,NA

The recovery of the C. porosus population has been accompanied by an increase in the incidence of 'problem crocodiles' that represent a threat to people in freshwater and marine habitats. Despite the implications for human safety, little is known about C. porosus populations in the freshwater reaches of rivers, well upstream of tidal influence. In this study, we examined the density and body-size structure of C. porosus populations in three freshwater rivers using a combination of data from spotlight and helicopter surveys conducted between the 1980s and 2005, and the inland extent of C. porosus using distribution records in the Northern Territory. Since the 1980s, the density of C. porosus in upstream, freshwater reaches of the Daly and Roper rivers has increased, as has the inland extent of C. porosus on the Daly River. Although C. porosus was not detected in spotlight surveys of the Victoria River, helicopter survey and anecdotal records indicate that C. porosus was present after 1989. In all, 52.1% of the crocodiles sighted in spotlight surveys were 2.1-3.4 m long. Distribution records show that C. porosus occurs up to 235 km inland and at elevations of up to 126 m above sea level. The potential distribution of C. porosus is likely to be similar to that of barramundi (Lates calcarifer), a readily identifiable diadromous fish that must spawn in estuarine waters and occurs at elevations of up to 178 m above sea level. Because the density and inland extent of C. porosus in freshwater rivers is likely to increase, it is recommended that: (1) programs communicating crocodile awareness use the linkage between the presence of barramundi and the potential presence of C. porosus; (2) that crocodile warning signs be erected in upstream areas within the potential range of C. porosus; (3) that research be conducted on developing techniques to detect and exclude C. porosus from swimming areas; and (4) that widespread systematic surveys be undertaken to document the inland extent of C. porosus. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.739682384,1,NA,NA,15,NA,1,15,25,NA

All seahorses were recently listed on CITES Appendix II in recognition of threats posed by unsustainable trade. However, the efficacy of this measure and the development of other effective conservation solutions will require an understanding of natural seahorse population dynamics at relevant ecological scales. In this study, we provide quantitative data on seahorse populations over nested spatial and temporal scales up to 10 km and 3.5 years. Unexploited populations of the big-bellied seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) in the Derwent estuary, Tasmania, Australia consisted largely of mature adults with highly female-biased sex ratios at all sites. While big-bellied seahorses had an aggregated distribution at the spatial scale of our transects (200 m2), most individuals were found alone. When they occurred in groups, the distribution of individuals was random with respect to sex in contrast to the pair bonds found in other seahorse species. All three monitored populations showed significant declines in abundance of 79-98% over the period 2001-2004. Estuarine physicochemical conditions did not change markedly during this period. Possible causes of seahorse declines are interactions with invasive species, disease or reproductive limitation through Allee effects. The magnitude of the declines in the absence of direct exploitation demonstrates that seahorses face multiple threats. Robust fisheries-independent monitoring will be required to demonstrate that conservation actions such as CITES listing are effective. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Back-pack and boat-mounted electrofishing were used to measure changes in riverine fish fauna after one particularly large sediment slug which started in an upland stream and then travelled downstream through 200 km of third and fourth order stream. Twelve impact sites and eight control sites were surveyed where there were previous data on fish populations. The sites were surveyed directly after the sediment slug had passed and then 12, 24 and 36 months after. Immediately after the sediment slug, fish abundances fell by between 95-100% at four impact sites in the upper reaches of the study area, primarily due to the effect of low-dissolved oxygen levels. Twelve months later fish numbers were still decreased in the upper catchment but showed signs of recovery after 24 months. Further downstream, where water quality was not as severely affected by the sediment slug, the effects on native fishes were less apparent. The circumstances of these events represented a unique opportunity to obtain baseline data regarding the effects of post-fire disturbances on fish, and their time to recovery. If fire were to occur in catchments where endangered species exist, our results suggest that actions such as translocation may be required to ensure the long-term survival of threatened species. ¬© 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.732145245,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,31,NA

The magnitude and speed of the observed changes were unexpected given the species' longevity (maximum age of over 95 years). The underlying mechanisms for the changes remain unclear but density-dependent responses to changes in population size and age composition, possibly mediated through reduced competition for shelter and intra-specific interactions, may have been contributing factors. Increasing sea surface temperatures over part of the period of change does not appear to have been a major driver and a genetic response to fishing seems unlikely.

Salmonids have established self-maintaining populations in many waters not targeted or managed as fisheries, colonising the entire catchment in cooler upland areas of Australia. These populations usually comprise a high abundance of small fish in small first-to-third-order tributaries. These waters are infrequently targeted by anglers, and populations may not contribute individuals to downstream fisheries. Negative impacts of alien salmonids on native aquatic fauna (including fish, frogs, spiny crayfish), mainly through direct predation and to a lesser degree competition for resources, have been noted for over 140 years. Impacts on some faunal groups have been severe enough to eliminate entire populations and severely fragment species across their range. Despite these impacts, salmonid management is focused largely on providing improved recreational angling opportunities, whereas management of their impacts is almost non-existent.

This study utilised visual surveys of shallow sandy shorelines in the lower reaches of estuaries to estimate the abundance of large piscivores. Flathead (Platycephalus spp., Platycephalidae) were the only large piscivores sighted within transects. A total of 296 flathead between 100 and 600 mm TL were observed in waters between 0.02 and 0.62 m deep. The density of flathead observed during the present study (0.04 ind. m-2) equated to 1 piscivore ‚â•100 mm TL for every 10.5 m of shoreline surveyed, and far exceeds density estimates for large piscivores in shallow estuarine habitats elsewhere in the world. Furthermore, the estimated biomass of flathead (11.56 g m-2) was equivalent to comparable biomass estimates of entire fish assemblages from shallow estuarine habitats in other parts of the world. The densities and depth distribution of these large piscivores suggests that shallow water nurseries may not provide small fishes with the level of refuge from predation previously assumed. ¬© Inter-Research 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.721746234,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,58,NA

The southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) is an important reef predator in temperate Australasia and subject to heavy exploitation. In a Tasmanian MPA, 90% of individuals were recaptured less than 200 m from the point of release over weekly to annual time scales, regardless of size or sex. This lack of movement resulted in a substantial build-up of biomass and of large mature individuals in the MPA relative to adjacent fished locations. Although there was little spillover of individuals to the fishery, a 4-fold increase in female fecundity potentially enhanced larval export. Comparison of fished and unfished biomass of legal-sized animals suggested that exploitation had reduced biomass in the adjacent fishery to <10% of natural values. Overall, the demographic and movement patterns illustrate the extent of depletion of stocks in the absence of historical baseline data and the potential need for spatial management resulting from limited movement. Our data indicate that within MPAs, this predator can potentially recover in abundance to natural levels despite adjacent fishing pressure. ¬© 2009 CSIRO.",Article,Scopus,0.711215054,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,66,NA

The precision and bias of each survey were estimated using a new Monte Carlo simulation method, which combined uncertainties associated with survey timing, sampling error, detectability, species composition, target strength, calibration coefficients, and missing strata. Because hoki have a long spawning season (more than 2 months) with turnover of fish in the survey area, survey timing was the most important source of uncertainty. Uncertainty was reduced by having a number of sub-surveys (snapshots) over a 4-6 week period, centred on the middle date of the spawning season. The other major source of uncertainty was the occurrence of 40-70% of hoki in mixed species: ""hoki fuzz"" marks. The acoustic analysis assumed all acoustic backscatter from hoki marks was hoki, so the presence of other species caused a positive bias in relative-abundance indices. The magnitude of this bias differed between years because the proportion of hoki in the ""fuzz"" marks was variable. There was additional uncertainty from the variability in the species composition of mixed marks that affected survey precision. The abundance indices were corrected for estimated bias, and the estimate of precision, expressed as the coefficient of variation or c.v., was applied to weight the results from each acoustic survey in the assessment model used to set commercial-catch limits. ¬© 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Estimates from the original method suffer from poor precision. Recent work has improved the precision of model estimates; however, the method still includes the strong assumption of constant survey catchability over years and seasons. This assumption is not tenable in many fisheries. This work introduces a new multiyear model, 2qIR, that allows catchability to differ between surveys of the same year. Simulations were performed to examine the effects of variability in (1) the exploitation rate among years, (2) survey catchability, and (3) the number of years of data on model performance. The 2qIR model estimates were always more accurate and precise than those of the other models examined and other model scenarios in which there was moderate contrast in exploitation among years, regardless of the seasonal difference between survey catchability coefficients. The ratios of survey catchability tested ranged from 0.1 to 10, but the model worked best at catchability ratios greater than 0.3. The 2qIR model performance improved slightly when a third year was added to the data set, but performance was similar with 3 or 5 years of data. In all types of simulations, the 2qIR model estimates were usable (i.e., not negative, infinite, or made with a convergence error) a greater proportion of the time than were annual model estimates. The 2qIR model produced reasonable results when applied to data from a population of southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii in Tasmania, whereas the models that assume constant catchability among surveys sometimes predicted exploitation rates exceeding 100%. The results from both the simulations and the lobster data suggest that the 2qIR model can be reliably applied in more situations than models that assume constant survey catchability. ¬© Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.706065543,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,24,NA

However, it is not known if there are similar aggregations farther south in Tasmania or at other times of the year, mainly because the species lives for less than a year. Therefore, this study describes and identifies differences in reproductive ecology of southern calamary on the east and southeast coasts of Tasmania, by sampling adults and surveying egg masses at inshore sites in both regions. Inshore populations on both coasts showed a similar seasonal trend of large gonosomatic index, reproductive output, and body size, and of greatest abundance during spring, and lowest in autumn. The number of egg masses was higher on the east coast, where mature calamary formed large spawning aggregations during spring and summer. However, there were no such aggregations during winter or autumn. Along the southeast coast, spawning activity was sporadic, resulting in isolated, low density, egg patches deposited over broader areas during spring, summer, and winter. There was no evidence of areas of seagrass or macroalgae associated with large depositions of egg masses at any time on the southeast coast. It appears that, by adopting different spawning behaviour in different locations and seasons, southern calamary may spread the risk of mortality in both space and time. The biological significance of this is unclear, particularly with respect to understanding the mechanisms that drive the development of spawning aggregations. Both spatial and seasonal spawning patterns appear to result from specific use of inshore sites at certain times of the year. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The fish faunas of the permanently-open Oyster Harbour, the seasonally-open Broke, Irwin and Wilson inlets and the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary on the south coast of Western Australia were sampled by seine net seasonally for 2 years. Irrespective of the frequency and duration that the estuary mouth was open, the ichthyofauna of each estuary was numerically dominated by three atherinid species and three gobiid species (92.9-99.7%), each of which completes its life cycle within these estuaries. The ichthyofaunal compositions of each estuary differed significantly, however, from that of each other estuary. These differences were largely attributable to the relative abundances of the above six species varying between estuaries, which, in turn, reflected differences in such factors as estuary mouth status, macrophyte cover and salinity. For example, Favonigobius lateralis and Leptatherina presbyteroides, which are also represented by marine populations, were most abundant in the permanently-open estuary (Oyster Harbour), which, in terms of substrate and salinity, most closely resembled the nearshore marine environment. In contrast, Leptatherina wallacei made its greatest contribution in the only estuary to exhibit a protracted period of greatly reduced salinities, which is consistent with its distribution in permanently-open estuaries on the lower west coast of Australia, while Atherinosoma elongata and Pseudogobius olorum were particularly numerous in estuaries containing dense stands of the seagrass Ruppia megacarpa. Marine species made the greatest contribution to species richness in the permanently-open estuary and least in the normally-closed estuary. Species richness was greatest in summer and least in winter in each estuary, but differed markedly between years only in Wilson Inlet. Density of fishes was greatest in the most eutrophic estuary (Wellstead Estuary) and least in the most oligotrophic estuary (Broke Inlet) and only underwent marked seasonal variations in Wilson Inlet and Wellstead Estuary, in which densities fell to their minima in winter. Ichthyofaunal composition varied between years in the Broke and Wilson inlets and Wellstead Estuary, in which there was little or no connection with the ocean in one of those years. Species composition underwent progressive seasonal changes throughout the year in Wellstead Estuary, due to the abundance of certain species peaking at different times of the year. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An initial observer program revealed high rates of encirclement and mortality (1.78 and 0.39 dolphins per net-set, respectively) of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). This equated to an estimate of 1728 encirclements and 377 mortalities across the entire fleet over the same period. The average time taken for fishers to respond to encirclements was 135.93 ¬± 3.72 min and 21.3% of encircled animals subsequently died. During that time, fishers only reported 3.6% of encirclements and 1.9% of mortalities recorded by observers. A code of practice (CoP) was subsequently introduced aimed at mitigating operational interactions. A second observer program revealed a significant reductions in the observed rates of dolphin encirclement (0.22; down 87.3%) and mortality (0.01; down 97.1%) with an estimate of 169 and eight, respectively. The average time taken for fishers to respond to dolphin encirclements also reduced to 16.33 ¬± 4.67 min (down 76.9%) and the proportion of encircled animals that subsequently died reduced to 5.0%. Agreement between industry reports and observer records improved, with the fishery reporting 57.9% and 58.9% of the rate of encirclements and mortalities, respectively, recorded by observers. A number of avoidance and release strategies in the CoP may have been responsible for these improvements. In particular, fishers were required to delay or relocate their activities if dolphins were observed prior to fishing and to release encircled dolphins immediately or abort the fishing event if release procedures were unsuccessful. Future improvements to the CoP include: (i) improved response times when an encircled dolphin is detected; (ii) better use of behavioural cues for deciding when to abort a net-set; (iii) ceasing fishing during rough weather; and (iv) continuing to increase reporting accuracy by fishers. It is also recommended that the abundance, movements and boundaries of the common dolphin population in the region be determined, so that the impact of fishing activities on their status can be established.

Opportunistic sightings of wobbegongs collected by recreational scuba-divers were used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of wobbegongs in NSW. From July 2003 until January 2005, 304 dives were undertaken by recreational divers and 454 wobbegongs were reported. Larger numbers of wobbegongs were sighted in northern compared to southern NSW. Spotted and ornate wobbegongs were sighted in similar numbers, but species composition was highly variable across locations. Only a few juvenile and newborn spotted wobbegongs were sighted, whereas small ornate wobbegongs were mostly sighted north of central NSW. The latter were possibly the third, cryptic species, the dwarf ornate wobbegong. The paucity of sightings of small wobbegongs suggests that juveniles and newborns are inconspicuous to divers or that small wobbegongs are found in areas not visited by divers. Potential species and size segregation suggest that closing areas to fishing may enable populations to sustain current levels of commercial exploitation. The cost-effectiveness of using recreational scuba-divers to opportunistically collect distribution and relative abundance data was apparent from this study.

This study describes some environmental conditions associated with submerged seagrass beds at Slipper and Great Mercury Islands. Field work was carried out in May-June 2004. The seagrass bed in South Bay, Slipper Island, is permanently submerged, grows to 4-5m below chart datum, and covers an area of approximately 0.03 km2. In contrast, seagrass in Huruhi Bay, Great Mercury Island, was estimated to cover an area of approximately 0.07 km2, and the bed was more characteristic of mainland estuaries, with an intertidal component and a sub-tidal fringe to 1 m below chart datum. At Slipper Island, long leaves (up to 47 cm) combined with high percentage cover and biomass (74-229 g dry weight/m2) provided a substantial three-dimensional habitat, supporting a higher macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity than Huruhi Bay or any of the Coromandel Peninsula sites previously reported. The two island locations supported fish assemblages that differed substantially from their mainland, intertidal counterparts. Huruhi Bay supported high abundances of exquisite goby (Favonigobius exquistes) and sand goby (F. lentiginosus), juvenile yellow-eyed mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri) and snapper (Pagrus auratus), with juvenile snapper densities being the highest ever recorded over seagrass in New Zealand. In contrast, South Bay supported a substantial population of an undescribed pipefish (Stigmatopora cf. macropterygia), but only low numbers of other fish species.

Marine farms have the potential to affect dolphin foraging in the coastal environment, yet this issue has been largely omitted from aquaculture management models. Data on the subject are minimal. This study was conducted to examine potential overlap between dusky dolphin habitat use and New Zealand's growing green-lipped mussel farming industry. 2. Data on dusky dolphin occurrence, distribution, abundance, and behaviour were collected from small vessels over five successive winters in the Marlborough Sounds, the centre of New Zealand's mussel farming industry. 3. Locations and movements of dolphin groups were recorded at 2 min intervals with a global positioning system receiver to examine the overlap of dusky dolphin use of coastal areas with existing and proposed marine farms. All cases of dolphins entering the boundaries of mussel farms and total time spent in farms were recorded. Over 8500 dolphin dorsal fin photographs were analysed to develop a catalogue of 421 marked individuals utilizing the area. All instances of dolphin feeding were noted, and focal group behaviour was recorded at 2 min intervals for groups observed ‚â• 1 h. 4. Within the Marlborough Sounds, dusky dolphins were most often encountered during the winter in Admiralty Bay, the area with the greatest density of proposed farming activity in the region. Mark-recapture data indicate that more than 1000 dusky dolphins used Admiralty Bay over the course of the 5 year study, with an average of 220 individuals inhabiting the bay on any given week during the winters of 1998-2002. As many as 55% of individuals returned to Admiralty Bay in consecutive winters. 5. Overlap of dusky dolphin habitat use with proposed marine farms is high, and dolphins rarely used areas within the existing farms. If dusky dolphin distribution with respect to farms were random, an expected 18¬±0.5 of 436 groups would be encountered in existing Inner Admiralty Bay farms; however, no dolphin groups were first encountered in farms. 6. In 5 years, only eight of 621 dusky dolphin groups monitored in Admiralty Bay were observed to enter the boundaries of mussel farms at any point. Dolphins entering mussel farms moved rapidly up the lanes between rows of lines and floats. Dolphins were observed a total of 14.2 min inside farms versus 147.5 h outside of farms in Admiralty Bay. Correcting for area, dolphins were observed spending significantly less time per survey inside than outside of farms. 7. Most dusky dolphin groups in Admiralty Bay were observed feeding on small schooling fish, often associated with seabirds and/or fur seals. Movement and diving patterns indicate much foraging when not actively feeding. 8. Regular seasonal migration of dusky dolphins and frequent feeding associations with other apex predators make management of marine farming a wider socio-economic and ecological issue.

It was hypothesized that both taxa would show strong preferences to different environments and benthic cover and that patterns would be consistent through time. Plectropomus leopardus were abundant on the reef slope and seaward edge of the lagoon, where live coral cover was high, and recruitment was generally low, in all environments. The population was sustained by a trickle of recruits, and total abundance varied little after 10 to 25 yr of protection in a no-take area, suggesting P. leopardus had reached an environment-related carrying capacity. Protogynous P. leopardus recruited to shallow environments at sites with 20% or more hard live coral and age data indicated the abundance of fish on the reef slope was from redistribution. Most recruits of gonochoristic L. carponotatus (<150 mm Standard length, SL) were found in the lagoonal environments, and adults were rare on the reef slope. Abundance of recruit L. carponotatus and P. leopardus did not correlate with percent cover of live and soft coral within environments. Recruits of L. carponotatus were usually rare in all lagoonal environments, but in 2003, many recruits (80 to 120 mm SL) were found in lagoonal environments with low and high hard live coral cover. A substantial proportion of the population (age max 18 yr) was from strong recruitment events. In 2003 and 2004, total abundance of L. carponotatus was supported by 1 year class 51.7 and 41% respectively. The utilization of environments and types of substrata varied among taxa and in some cases among life-history stages. There was also temporal variation in the importance of some environments (e.g. Lagoon Centre). ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.687488875,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,43,0

One approach is to estimate the proportion of animals present during each survey, using a model that estimates the dynamics of the survey proportion of the population. However, this can increase the uncertainty of the estimates if the dynamics parameters are not well estimated. Here we approached this problem by developing methods using hierarchical model structures, which allow us to share information on the dynamics parameters across years. We applied this modeling approach to the estimation of residence time and spawning biomass for New Zealand hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) in Cook Strait spawning grounds. By sharing parameters across years, we obtained better parameter estimates than by the traditional assumption that the dynamics in one year are independent of those of other years. By integrating the estimation of residence time into a dynamic model using simulated maximum likelihood methods, we also were able to calibrate acoustic estimates of spawning biomass for the fact that not all individuals are on the grounds at the time of the acoustic survey. We discuss alternative model formulations for the application of hierarchical methods to stage-structured data and the analysis of data from acoustic surveys of spawning fish.",Review,Scopus,0.684113753,0,NA,?,5,NA,0,5,5,NA

Downstream of the falls, assemblages are characterised by the presence of piscivorous fishes whereas such species are largely absent from upstream reaches. Sleepy cod (Oxyeleotris lineolatus), a large piscivorous gudgeon, was first introduced into the upper reaches of the Burdekin River in 1980 and other releases, both official and unofficial, have occurred subsequently. The population remained small and restricted to the site of introduction for a decade, but expanded in size and distribution after the occurrence of a large flood and entry into a prolonged period of drought. This gudgeon is now present in every tributary system of the Burdekin Basin. Despite the occurrence of substantial temporal variation in fish abundance due to a highly variable flow regime, negative impacts on one species, a small gudgeon (Mogurnda adspersa), are evident. Both deliberate and accidental releases of other species into the upper Burdekin River have also occurred, often to satisfy recreational fishing demand. Such species are typified by large size and piscivorous habit, characteristics alien and inimical to the native fish fauna. It is hypothesised that these piscivorous species may have even greater impact than O. lineolatus in some tributary systems of the upper Burdekin River. ¬© Springer 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.67932935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,113,NA

However, in 1989 and again in 2002, coral spawn 'slicks' off Coral Bay in Western Australia caused many reef organisms to be asphyxiated resulting in catastrophic mortality. A survey in 2002 revealed significant recovery of hard corals within the area disturbed in 1989 (6 to 32%), but little recovery of the fish assemblages with their structure being highly skewed towards herbivorous species. The lack of recovery in the fish assemblages was unexpected for 2 reasons: (1) the existence of healthy fish populations in adjacent areas and (2) the well-known positive association between many species of reef fish and their benthic habitat. We identified a combination of minimal recruitment to the disturbed area of the bay and a significantly changed coral community structure to be likely causes of the prolonged recovery process. Although just as lethal to the reef community, the 2002 disturbance was significantly smaller and patchy in its extent. In contrast to the 1989 event, the overall effects of this smaller disturbance were positive with species richness and abundance of fish increasing during the weeks after the event, primarily via migration from nearby areas of reef. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of scale when defining disturbance outcomes on coral reefs and highlight the significant role that 'local' factors can play in mediating outcomes from disturbance. This type of information is especially pertinent to reef managers trying to formulate effective plans for conservation of their local reef systems. ¬© Inter-Research 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.671088801,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,53,NA

Spring and summer sampling over a 5-year period encompassed large hydrological variation, including 1 year of extended floodplain inundation which was largely driven by an environmental water release, and 2 years of severe regional drought. Recruitment and dispersal of Southern Pygmy Perch significantly increased during the floodplain inundation event compared with the other examined years. This study provides valuable support for an environmental water allocation benefiting a native species, and explores the link between flooding and its advantages to native fish.

Fish abundances were quantified at 6 locations (18 reefs) across ca. 1700 km of coastline, and patterns of distribution were determined by testing the goodness of fit of 3 biogeographical models: (1) 'normal' (i.e. 'abundant centre' distributions), (2) 'ramped' (increase in abundance towards one of the distributional limits), and (3) 'skewed normal' (skewed 'abundant centre' distributions). Two species had their maximum abundances at the centre of their ranges ('normal' patterns), while one species had its highest abundance near its south-eastern range limit ('skewed normal' pattern). Two species increased progressively in abundances towards their south-eastern range limits ('ramped' patterns), and 3 species showed no apparent patterns across their distribution ranges.

There were no short-term changes (within 4 months) in the abundance of butterflyfishes following initial declines in live coral cover. Surveys conducted in 2005, however, revealed significant declines in the abundance of Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon lunulatus, Chaetodon trifascialis, Chaetodon plebeius and Chaetodon rainfordi, all of which are obligate hard-coral feeders. In contrast, there was no significant change in the abundance of Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon aureofasciatus, Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon melannotus or Chaetodon vagabundus, which are much less reliant on scleractinian coral for food. Clearly, extensive coral depletion, such as that caused by severe coral bleaching, can have a major effect on the abundance of butterflyfishes.

Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species (genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by ‚â§100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100-300 km to 500-800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate (the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: (1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances ‚â§100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, (2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales (>800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance (‚â§800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and (3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.661185062,1,NA,NA,10,NA,1,10,15,0

Using two distinct approaches - a standard non-hierarchical model (NH) and a hierarchical Bayesian model (HB) - abundance and catchability coefficients from a fishery depletion process for banana prawns (Penaeus merguiensis) in northern Australia were estimated. Non-hierarchical models treated each stock and year separately and individually, whereas the hierarchical models assumed some form of common underlying population from which the parameters for the individual cases generated by the combination of stock and year were drawn. Two HBs were considered. In HB1 it was assumed that annual abundance and catchability parameters came from separate populations, or distributions, for each stock. In HB2 it was assumed that these stock region distributions were not separate, but had their parameters drawn from a common distribution. Thus in HB2 all stocks shared information at the regional level. The results for both NH and HB methods were similar in most cases, indicating a fair degree of stability irrespective of the particular form of model chosen. However, the NH method suffered because the data were analysed in generally small sections and in many cases these sections were too small to allow precise estimation of both parameters and confidence intervals. The deviations of point estimates between the HB1, HB2 and NH models were more marked in catchability coefficient estimates than in abundance estimates, and large relative deviations typically occurred in stock regions and years with low fishing efforts, low catch or poor depletion trends over time. We conclude that the combined analysis using HB was superior because it could handle limited data, yielded credible interval estimates for all parameters and was computationally more efficient. ¬© CSIRO 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.656915177,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,22,NA

The economic, socio-cultural and environmental factors that influenced hunting activity in 1998 and 1999 by the members of the community of Mabuiag Island were investigated to inform the sustainable management of the fishery. The landed catch during the eight months March to October of 145 dugongs in 1998 and 170 dugongs in 1999 potentially provided the community with an average of 290 g of dugong meat per person per day. Fifty-seven per cent of adult males on the island participated in dugong hunting, but more than half the catch in each year was caught by only two hunters. The probability of at least one person from the community going dugong hunting in 1998 and 1999 was 0.59 ¬± 0.02 per day. This probability was influenced by local environmental factors, including the abundance of dugongs in the traditional hunting grounds (affected by wind speed, year, season and lunar day) and the size of the commercial crayfish catch (which is influenced by the global market price, as well as local conditions). Although dugong hunting remains a very important part of the islanders' contemporary culture and customary economy, the capacity to hunt dugongs is facilitated by the ease with which some hunters move between the state, commercial and customary sectors of their local economy. The complexities of the economic, social and cultural environments need to be considered in planning for the sustainable harvesting of threatened species by remote indigenous communities. ¬© 2006 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",Article,Scopus,0.655954294,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,38,NA

Laboratory feeding trials and field investigations were conducted to evaluate the impact of this species on native frogs in southwestern Australia. The eggs of Crinia georgiana, C. insignifera, Litoria adelaidensis, and L moorei were not consumed by C. holbrooki. In contrast, Crinia georgiana, C. insignifera, C. glauerti, and Litoria moorei hatchlings (Cosner stage 20-23) were consumed by C. holbrooki. Alternative aquatic invertebrate prey (mosquito larvae and Daphnia) were preferred over hatchlings. Gambusia holbrooki were recorded at 20 of 25 wetlands surveyed, and frogs occurred at all 25 sites. From one to six frog species occurred at wetland sites where fish were present. Frog species richness, and the presence of individual species, did not differ between sites with and without C. holbrooki. However, frog species richness was positively correlated with wetland condition (highly ranked sites were relatively undisturbed). In contrast to the situation in eastern Australia, populations of anuran species in southwestern Australia do not appear to be strongly affected by this small invasive fish. This difference is likely related to climatic dissimilarities that affect the population biology of fish and frogs in these regions. Additional factors that may influence the level of impact of G. holbrooki include egg deposition site, timing of anuran breeding, availability of alternative prey, wetland condition, and seasonal variation in fish size and abundance. ¬© 2009 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.",Article,Scopus,0.650923988,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,95,NA

Emphasis is also on how aggregation and effort distribution interact to affect overall catch rate [catch per unit effort (cpue)]. In particular, it is proposed to evaluate three indices, the catchability index, the knowledge parameter, and the aggregation index, to describe the effectiveness of targeting and the effects on overall catchability in the stock area. Analytical expressions are provided so that these indices can easily be calculated. The average of the cpue calculated from small units where fishing is random is a better index for measuring the stock abundance. The overall cpue, the ratio of lumped catch and effort, together with the average cpue, can be used to assess the effectiveness of targeting. The proposed methods are applied to the commercial catch and effort data from the Australian northern prawn fishery. The indices are obtained assuming a power law for the effort distribution as an approximation of targeting during the fishing operation. Targeting increased catchability in some areas by 10%, which may have important implications on management advice. ¬© 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Given that fish persist in these systems under conditions of high environmental variability, dryland rivers represent ideal systems to investigate the processes contributing to and sustaining fish biodiversity and recruitment in variable environments. Hence, spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure was examined in 15 waterholes of the Warrego River between October 2001 and May 2003. Fish assemblages in isolated waterholes were differentiated at the end of the dry 2001 winter but were relatively similar following high summer flows in January 2002 as a consequence of high hydrological connectivity among waterholes. Small, shallow waterholes supported more species and higher abundances than large-deep waterholes. Large, deep waterholes provided important refuge for large-bodied fish species such as adult yellowbelly, Macquaria ambigua, and the eel-tailed catfish, Tandanus tandanus. Recruitment patterns of bony bream (Nematalosa erebi), Hyrtl's tandan (Neosilurus hyrtlii) and yellowbelly were associated with high flow events and backwater inundation; however recruitment of yellowbelly and bony bream was also evident following a zero-flow period. Departures from typical flood-induced seasonal spawning patterns may reflect opportunistic spawning behaviours appropriate to the erratic patterns of flooding and dry spells in dryland rivers. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.647716999,1,NA,NA,10,NA,1,5,11,NA

Variation in population data provided by each method, including relative abundance indices, size structure, and habitat preferences, were examined. Aspects of behaviour and activity patterns were also investigated. Night sampling using all methods consistently yielded larger catches than day sampling. The size structure of catches varied, with electrofishing at night and fyke netting during the day having higher proportions of juveniles, whilst snorkelling at night and electrofishing during the day had higher proportions of adults. Fyke netting at night yielded by far the largest catches (~3-fold more than other methods) and also captured balanced proportions of juveniles and adults. Galaxias auratus had a strong diel activity pattern and were most active at night. The majority of the population migrated into the littoral zone during the night and back into deeper water during the day. A small number of juveniles remained in the littoral zone and some adults sheltered in the dense cover of species-rich littoral vegetation during the day. Shores with shallow depth profiles appeared to be preferred due to higher catches in these areas using all methods. Based on the results of this study, fyke netting at night in littoral habitats is recommended for monitoring populations of G. auratus. Fyke netting is likely to be an effective method for monitoring other lacustrine galaxiid species; however, further work is required to investigate the effects of habitat variables and fish community structure on activity patterns of galaxiids, and hence their catchability with various methods, in more extensive lentic environments. ¬© Springer 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.647142143,0,NA,NA,10,NA,0,10,14,NA

Carp are widely implicated in freshwater aquatic resource degradation and both the resource management and broader communities are currently seeking effective control measures. We developed CARPSIM, a simple age-based model to simulate the effects of a range of management scenarios. The model simulates change in population biomass by age and sex-specific growth and simulates change in population abundance through recruitment and sex-specific mortality. Using empirical stock-recruitment data and stochastic components derived from local hydrological data or the southern oscillation index the model simulated the population dynamics of carp populations over 200 years using biological parameters previously estimated for two Victorian populations within the Murray-Darling basin. Carp management scenarios simulated included the effects of fishing the spawning stock; of fishing the whole stock; of spawning or reruitment sabotage; and of driving the population sex ratio towards male dominance. Model predictions suggests that faster growing, shorter-lived populations may be better controlled by molecular methods inducing male-dominance, or spawning sabotage type methods whereas slower growing, long-lived populations may respond best to removal type approaches. Unselective removal, such as poisoning or trapping all age-classes is more likely to cause pseudo-extinction at levels of instantaneous fishing mortality (F. le size-selective removal at similar F levels may only be useful to reduce the biomass below 60% of virgin biomass. CARPSIM simulations show that the probability is small for any removal-based method achieving <10% of virgin biomass when F<1.4. Crown Copyright ¬© 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results from three separate studies undertaken on the Murray River between Yarrawonga and Tocumwal are presented on the relationship between carp (Cyprinus carpio), native species, and LWD to examine whether native species and carp compete for LWD habitat. The first study reports on the relative abundance of carp and native fish in a river reach. Since 1995 carp abundance has declined, whereas the abundance of native fish populations has remained relatively constant providing little support for the hypothesis that competition for LWD habitat is having effects at the population level effects. The second study reports on the relationship between LWD, river channel position, and its use as habitat by carp and native species. A statistically significant relationship was observed between native fish, LWD, the location within a meander, and curvature of the meander. There was no statistically significant relation between carp and any of these parameters indicating that carp utilise a variety of riverine habitats, whereas native species were strongly associated with LWD. The third study reports on an experiment that tested the response of carp to the placement of new LWD habitat. The response from carp was statistically inconclusive. The combination of these studies suggest that it is unlikely that carp and native species are directly competing for LWD habitat and it is unlikely that carp will inundate restored LWD habitats and preclude native species.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.643220759,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,42,NA

Spawning aggregation sites are spatially rare, and demonstrating differences between a spawning aggregation site and unselected sites nearby is the first step towards understanding the benefits provided by the aggregation site. Chromis hypsilepis (Pomacentridae) is a demersally spawning reef fish, one population of which reproduces in a large, single aggregation at a rocky reef off the central coast of New South Wales, Australia. This study compared the habitat structure (rugosity, reef slope, substratum particle size, and abundance of preferred spawning microhabitat) of the spawning aggregation site and several non-spawning sites, and tested the hypotheses that the spawning aggregation site provided greater off-reef larval transport and prey availability for brooding males. Substratum rugosity was significantly greater and the preferred spawning microhabitat was significantly more abundant at the spawning aggregation site. Reef relief and substratum particle size were not significantly different from non-spawning sites. Passively drifting surface current drogues released at the spawning aggregation site were more rapidly transported off the reef, but did not travel further or faster, than drogues released at a non-spawning site over a 12 h period.

Common dolphins are gregarious animals with high vagility and are expected to display limited genetic differentiation over large spatial scales. Here, we investigate population genetic structure of southern Australian common dolphins using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and seven microsatellite markers. We found unexpected levels of genetic differentiation for short-beaked common dolphins over a distance of ‚àº1500 km. Although no genetic structure was observed in common dolphins along the coast of SA, we detected marked differentiation between dolphins from SA and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting a minimum of two genetic populations in southern Australia. We hypothesize that the ephemeral distribution of small pelagic fish enhances movement and dispersal between dolphin groups at a local level. However, clear differences in water temperature, habitat features and fish abundance between SA and Tasmania may contribute to the contemporary isolation observed between dolphin populations. Our findings have important consequences for developing conservation management strategies, because SA has the largest purse-seine fishery by weight in Australia, and substantial numbers of fatal common dolphin interactions have occurred. In 2004/2005 alone, an estimated 1728 common dolphins were encircled and 377 died over a 7-month period. If these impacts lead to a reduction in population size, it is unlikely that dolphins from the adjacent south-eastern Tasmanian population will replace the lost individuals. Recommendations for assessing the impacts of the fishery are presented. The information herein may also have implications for fisheries-marine mammal interactions in coastal and neritic habitats in other areas of the world. Moreover, we demonstrate that a species commonly thought to be wide ranging can show an unexpected degree of genetic differentiation. ¬© Journal compilation ¬© 2008 The Zoological Society of London.",Article,Scopus,0.63289453,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,47,NA

Maintenance of high fish species diversity and associated functional diversity are thought to represent an 'ecological insurance' against ecosystem degradation. We examined responses of reef fish communities to varied levels of coral decline on 22 individual reefs of the Great Barrier Reef over an 11 yr period. Using 7 measures of species diversity, we found that fish diversity rarely decreased due to coral declines, even on 7 reefs that suffered massive coral losses (cover decreased by >75%). However, maintenance of fish diversity on those 7 reefs belied major changes in fish communities that involved increases in abundance of large herbivores and decreases in abundance of both coral-dependent fishes and species with no obvious dependence on coral. The magnitude of change in species abundances increased linearly with the magnitude of coral decline. While the proportion of species that increased or decreased in abundance varied considerably among reefs, 45 to 71 % of fish species decreased in abundance on some reefs. Ecological function is related to abundance, so such decreases are likely to indicate reduced ecosystem function. Our results suggest that: (1) reef fish diversity may not be a reliable indicator of reef resilience and (2) predicted declines in coral cover due to global warming are likely to cause changes in the structure of reef fish communities, but the nature of these changes and associated capacity of reef fishes to assist ecosystem recovery will vary among reefs. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.629929384,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,44,NA

Diet analyses indicated that crested terns are a generalist predator on surface-schooling clupeids (Australian anchovy Engraulis australis, sardine Sardinops sagax and blue sprat Spratelloides robustus), Degens leatherjacket Thamnaconus degeni, southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir, Australian herring Arripis georgianus, slender bullseye Parapriacanthus elongatus and barracouta Thyrsites atun. Ontogenetic differences in prey size indicated that adults are constrained in their foraging behaviour during the early chick-provisioning period by the need to self feed and select smaller prey that can be ingested by their chicks. Chicks consumed significantly higher proportions of clupeids than adults, which consumed mainly Degens leatherjackets and barracouta, suggesting that adults may select higher quality prey for their chicks compared to what they consume themselves. Spatial differences in prey composition were driven by differing proportions of sardine, Australian anchovy and Degens leatherjacket and could reflect local differences in the abundances of these prey. The size of prey taxa consumed by adults also reflected a North-South gradient in prey size. The large component of juvenile sardine in the diet of crested terns suggests future dietary measures may inform fisheries managers about changes in local juvenile sardine abundance. These data could assist in highlighting any fishery-related decreases in sardine recruitment and help ensure commercial fishing practices address principals of Ecologically Sustainable Development developed for Australian fisheries. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.629538606,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,54,0

This focus is directly relevant to coral reef communities that are characterized by very high species diversity in a spatially heterogeneous environment, display stochastic variability in community structure at small spatial and temporal scales, and are subject to major disturbances. We monitored coral and fish assemblages over 14 years on fixed sites spread over 80 km of the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and found evidence of large-scale resilience and predictable recovery of these assemblages. Sometime between November 1987 and October 1989, live coral cover on the shallow northeast flanks of some reefs in the southern GBR decreased from >80% to <10%, probably as a result of storm damage. We compared the fish and benthic communities present in these areas prior to the disturbance (1983-1984) with those present in 1992 and the subsequent changes through to 1998. Hard coral cover increased slowly from 1992 to 1994, then accelerated to be indistinguishable from pre-impact levels by 1998. The response of the coral assemblages was largely due to the predominance of tabulate Acropora species and their characteristics of rapid growth and competitive dominance. Patterns of species richness of the fish families Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Scaridae, and Pomacentridae mirrored that of hard coral, except the Pomacentridae had not recovered to pre-impact levels by 1998. Of the 26 fish species analyzed for changes in abundance, 88% decreased after the disturbance, then subsequently increased, with all but two recovering to pre-impact levels by 1998. Although processes such as settlement and immigration are ultimately responsible for replenishment of local populations, our data suggested that habitat plays a strong role in modifying fish assemblages. Thus, both coral and fish assemblages demonstrated resilience to large-scale natural disturbance and predictability in the structure of the assemblages, with most taxa approaching the asymptote of abundance and species richness that existed prior to the disturbance.",Article,Scopus,0.62034168,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,107,NA

Turbinid gastropods were found at all locations (up to 2.4 ind. m-2); 82.4% of all individuals were T. torquatus. One location (Marmion, Perth) had considerably higher abundances than all other locations. Populations of T. torquatus at the 2 southern locations had a broad range of sizes (9 to 119 mm total shell length [TSL]), although 1 location was dominated by small, and the other, by large, individuals. In contrast, both northern locations were strongly dominated by 1 size class (40 to 60 mm TSL). T. torquatus consumed Ulva lactuca, Hypnea valentiae, Hennedya crispa and juvenile Ecklonia radiata at rates of 150 to 450 mg blotted fresh weight d-1, depending on density of gastropods and species of algae. There was a positive relationship between the rate of consumption and size of T. torquatus when fed U. lactuca and H. valentiae. The present study has produced 3 main insights: (1) densities of turbinids on offshore, wave-exposed, subtidal reefs are similar to those in other coastal habitats; (2) patterns of abundances and sizes are consistent with broad-scale processes, such as ocean climate, fishing pressure and eutrophication; and (3) T. torquatus can consume a variety of macroalgae at rates that suggest it has the potential to exert top-down control of macroalgae, although low densities of gastropods preclude strong effects. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.618478529,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,15,27,NA

Cooper Creek, an Australian dryland river, is characterised by extreme flow variability, especially in the magnitude, timing and duration of channel flows and floods, which, if they occur, do so mainly in summer. The present study examined the influence of hydrological variability on fish assemblages and abundance in four waterholes in the Windorah reach of Cooper Creek over eight occasions between 2001 and 2004. Antecedent flows had marked influences on fish species richness and assemblage structure. Following high summer flows, all waterholes supported a rich and abundant fish fauna, whereas fewer species and lower numbers were recorded following periods of zero channel flow. Recruitment of three of the four most common and abundant species was enhanced when intermittent flows inundated backwater and floodplain habitats that provide a food-rich environment. Opportunistic responses to rising channel flows and occasional large floods in Cooper Creek help to explain the prominent 'boom' patterns of fish production in this arid-zone river, whereas low-level recruitment during periods of low or no flow maintains populations of some species through the 'bust'. ¬© CSIRO 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.612289588,1,NA,NA,5,NA,1,5,10,NA

This indicated ecosystem resilience to strong fluctuations in reservoir water level, and to other potential agricultural impacts, for example eutrophication and pollution. Although biological stressors such as introduced fish and invertebrate predators are known to affect planktonic communities and reduce biodiversity in lakes, high densities of planktivorous stages of alien European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and the presence of carp (Cyprinus carpio) did not translate into non-stationary time series or declining trends for plankton in Lake Hume. However, the seasonal successions observed in the reservoir in different years did not conform well to the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. Significant deviations of the Lake Hume successional pattern from the PEG model included maxima for phytoplankton abundance being in winter and the presence of a clear water phase without large zooplankton grazers. The instability of the water level in Lake Hume probably causes the dynamics of most planktonic populations to be less predictable, but did not initiate the declining trends that have been observed in some other Australian reservoirs.

A recreational Barramundi fishery enhancement of Lake Kununurra using a fishway has been widely promoted as advancing fishery conservation and the reformation of land and water management practices within the greater Ord River region. Of the fishways considered here, none have been found to admit Barramundi in the numbers and size classes necessary to establish or maintain the recreational fishery. Reasons for this include an inadequate understanding of fish behaviour and/or fishway design faults. The seemingly reluctant use of fishways by Barramundi might also be confounded by some observations being made on rivers where Barramundi populations are either comparatively small or non-existent. The alternative to a fishway is hatchery stocking. This option, like a dedicated Barramundi fishway, represents a single-species approach to fishery enhancement and is the least legitimate attempt to restore the ecological integrity of the fish communities of either Lake Kununurra or the Ord River. We argue that progress toward the restoration of the lake should continue, though a fishery enhancement programme that incorporates the broader fish community and not just a single species, would better rebuild the presently degraded Ord River system. Of the available options, we recommend testing an experimental model that incorporates aspects of the vertical-slot and bypass fishway designs, with the objectives being to learn migratory fish behaviour, abundance, and patterns and cues for fish movement. This approach can incorporate Barramundi as the target species to better understand entrance design constraints, minimum slot widths for larger fish, and operation under low flows during peak irrigation water demands, but still accommodate the movement of tropical fishes during these periods.",Article,Scopus,0.60998219,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,117,NA

If legal-sized lobsters inhibit smaller ones from entering traps, the overall catch-rate may depend on population composition and not just on overall abundance, and recruitment strength can be overestimated as average length decreases in a population. A controlled field experiment was used to examine whether trapping inhibition of Jasus edwardsii occurred during spring (November) or summer (February) in south-eastern Tasmania. Four treatments were applied. Baited traps were seeded with either: one large female, one large male or two sublegal-sized female lobsters. Baited traps with no seed were used as a control. Seeded traps always caught fewer sublegal-sized lobsters than control traps. When catches in both seasons were examined by sex of entrants, seeded traps caught fewer small lobsters than control traps in 11 of 12 comparisons. However, a strong inhibitory effect was observed only for female-seeded traps during summer. The data obtained in the present study suggest that sublegal-sized indices of recruitment are likely to be influenced in summer by the number of large females present. Spring trials suggest that corrections to a sublegal-catch index may be unnecessary during this season, but more work is required in order to better understand the complex, sex-specific and seasonal patterns of interactions of this species. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.609842729,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,77,NA

Temporal variation over 5 yr was also examined in 1 park (Solitary Islands). BRUVS were able to sample the relative abundance and distribution of species from a wide range of trophic groups, and were particularly effective for detecting cryptic predators. Significant variability in the fish assemblages occurred between each park consistent with the latitudinal distribution of the parks. Fish assemblages also varied significantly between sites within each park. Contrary to expectations, total species richness did not follow the expected latitudinal gradient. However, observed geographical patterns in species richness of certain families such as Labridae (greater richness in the most northern park) and Monacanthidae (greater species richness in southern parks) followed expectations. Abundant schooling species, common to all 3 parks, were important contributors to variation between sites. Temporal variation over 5 yr at 1 park was relatively minor compared to the spatial variation among the 3 parks. This suggests large-scale spatial separation is more important for structuring fish assemblages than time. A network of marine parks will therefore be required to represent variation in reef fish assemblages over this latitudinal scale. ¬© Inter-Research 2007.",Article,Scopus,0.609321947,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,55,NA

We investigated foodweb dynamics and trophic linkages to shortfin eels in Lake Ellesmere using a combination of abundance assessments, dietary studies, and stable isotope analyses. Data from our study are compared with historical data sets on benthic invertebrate community composition and shortfin eel diets to trace changes in the trophic linkages to top predators that have occurred since the late 1960s. Stable isotope analyses indicate that the foodweb is predominantly driven by epipelic and phytoplankton derived carbon sources, although it was difficult to discriminate between these two carbon pools because of wind-driven resuspension of lake sediments. Comparison of our survey results with historical data sets indicates a clear shift in benthic biota from being dominated by phytofaunal species such as Potamopyrgus antipodarum (comprising 90% of total invertebrate biomass) during the 1960s, to now being almost entirely comprised of subterranean species such as Chironomus zealandicus and oligochaetes (together comprising 82% of total invertebrate biomass). This shift in benthic communities has resulted in significant changes in the size-specific diet of juvenile shortfin eels (&lt;400 mm) from those reported for Lake Ellesmere during the mid 1970s, with Chironomus larvae now comprising 65% of the diets of juvenile eels, whereas historically P. antipodarum was the dominant food item (&gt;30% of total biomass). This shift towards foraging on smaller sediment-dwelling species could have implications for juvenile eel bioenergetics, and may help explain why juvenile shortfin growth rates have significantly decreased in past decades. Juvenile shortfins now appear to switch to foraging on preyfish (mainly common bullies, Gobiomorphus cotidianus) at a smaller size (‚âà400 mm) than historically recorded (&gt;500 mm). Dietary and stable isotope signatures indicated that small shortfins (100-299 mm) have considerable overlap in trophic position (Œ¥13C = -20.4‚Ä∞, Œ¥15N = 13.6‚Ä∞) with common bullies (Œ¥13C = -20.5‚Ä∞, Œ¥15N = 13.7‚Ä∞), the dominant fish in Lake Ellesmere (92% of total abundance CPUE), potentially indicating that these two species may directly compete for food resources.

Inter-annual variation in growth determined early in the pelagic, offshore larval-stage was highly correlated with post-larval abundance (a predictor of fishery recruitment). Sea surface temperature measured near the presumed spawning area off Western Victoria was significantly correlated with larval growth, and was also significantly correlated with post-larval abundance in Port Phillip Bay. Increased water temperature would have had the direct effect of increasing larval growth and therefore contributing to larval survival, but may also have been indicative of enhanced physical transport and/ or plankton productivity. Overall, larval growth rate of King George whiting is a very strong predictor of post-larval abundance, which in turn will influence fishery recruitment in 3-5 years' time. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.601756096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,91,NA

First, the abundance and composition of the benthic infauna in an area regularly used for the collection of shrimp for bait by recreational anglers was compared with multiple reference areas. Second, a BACI design, with multiple reference areas, was used to examine the short-term effects of harvesting on the benthic assemblages from an intensive commercialised fishing competition. Third, a large-scale, controlled manipulative experiment, where shrimp were harvested from 10,000 m2 plots at intensities commensurate with those from recreational and commercial operators, was done to determine the impacts on different components of the infaunal assemblage. Only a few benthic taxa showed significant declines in abundance in response to the removal of ghost shrimp from the unvegetated sediments. There was evidence, however, of more subtle effects with changes in the degree of spatial variation (patchiness) of several taxa as a result of harvesting. Groups such as capitellid polychaetes, gammarid amphipods and some bivalves were significantly more patchy in their distribution in areas subjected to harvesting than reference areas, at a scale of tens of metres. This scale corresponds to the patterns of movement and activity of recreational harvesters working in these areas. In contrast, patchiness in the abundance of ghost shrimp decreased significantly under harvesting at scales of hundreds of metres, in response to harvesters focussing their efforts on areas with greater numbers of burrow entrances, leading to a more even distribution of the animals. Controlled experimental harvesting caused declines in the abundance of soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), polychaetes and amphipods and an increase in the spatial patchiness of polychaetes. Populations of ghost shrimp were, however, resilient to harvesting over extended periods of time. In conclusion, harvesting of ghost shrimp for bait by recreational and commercial fishers causes significant but localised impacts on a limited range of benthic fauna in unvegetated sediments, including changes in the degree of spatial patchiness in their distribution. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Multiresponse artificial neural network models provided accurate predictions of fish assemblages in the Mary River based on species presence-absence data (mean Bray-Curtis similarity between predicted and observed composition = 84%) but were less accurate when based on species relative abundance or biomass (mean similarity = 62% and 59%, respectively). Landscape- and local-scale habitat variables (e.g., catchment area and riparian canopy cover) and characteristics of the long-term flow regime (e.g., variability and predictability of flows) were more important predictors of fish assemblages than variables describing the short-term history of hydrological events. The relative importance of these variables was broadly similar for predicting species occurrence, relative abundance, or biomass. The transferability of the Mary River predictive models to the nearby Albert River was high for species presence-absence (i.e., closer match between predicted and observed data) compared with species abundances or biomass. This suggests that the same landscape-scale features are important determinants of distribution of individual species in both rivers but that interactions between landscape, hydrology, and local habitat features that collectively determine abundance and biomass may differ. ¬© 2007 NRC.",Article,Scopus,0.596699327,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,48,NA

Environmental assessments of coastal aquaculture are concerned mostly with direct impacts on natural assemblages in the vicinity of shellfish or fin-fish farms. As the size and density of farmed sea space increases, there is greater potential for indirect effects on food webs beyond the immediate culture area. 2. We investigated the potential indirect effects of long-line mussel Perna canaliculus farms on the demography of an important benthic predator, the sea star Coscinasterias muricata. Surveys beneath four active farms, an abandoned farm and three unfarmed areas of seabed in Pelorus Sound, New Zealand, described the direct effects of mussel culture on the distribution and abundance of sea stars and other benthic consumers. These data were used to calibrate a model that simulated the fertilization success of sea star populations in farmed and unfarmed areas of the bays. 3. Deposits of living mussels and mussel shells covered up to 55% of the seafloor beneath farm sites, but were absent from soft sediments at unfarmed sites. Mean densities of sea stars were up to 39 times larger at active farm sites than in unfarmed areas and were correlated with the abundance of living mussels on the seafloor. 4. Within individual farms, the distribution of sea stars was highly aggregated at small spatial scales, with most (63%) individuals occurring within 2 m of their nearest neighbour. In unfarmed areas, sea stars were widely dispersed (&lt; 1 80 m-2). 5. Our simulations indicate that, because of the extremely clumped distributions of sea stars, spawning individuals at farm sites would on average have substantially greater fertilization success (c. 90% of eggs) than those foraging in areas where farms are absent (&lt;&lt; 2% of eggs), and total zygote production could be as much as 1500 times greater than in unfarmed areas. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the potential for significant bottom-up effects of aquaculture on surrounding ecological assemblages. If, as has been suggested, sperm limitation is a major constraint on recruitment of asteroids and other invertebrate predators, supplemental provisioning from increased farm development could result in occasional outbreaks of populations, over a broader area than the farmed location. Without appropriate monitoring such events are likely to be dismissed as rare, natural phenomena rather than a consequence of shellfish culture.",Article,Scopus,0.596361127,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,127,NA

Because fragmentation is a process, it is most accurately studied by actively fragmenting large patches into multiple smaller patches. We fragmented artificial seagrass habitats and evaluated the impacts of fragmentation on fish abundance and species richness over time (1 day, 1 week, 1 month). Fish assemblages were compared among 4 treatments: control (single, continuous 9-m 2 patches); fragmented (single, continuous 9-m 2 patches fragmented to 4 discrete 1-m 2 patches); prefragmented/patchy (4 discrete 1-m 2 patches with the same arrangement as fragmented); and disturbance control (fragmented then immediately restored to continuous 9-m 2 patches). Patchy seagrass had lower species richness than actively fragmented seagrass (up to 39% fewer species after 1 week), but species richness in fragmented treatments was similar to controls. Total fish abundance did not vary among treatments and therefore was unaffected by fragmentation, patchiness, or disturbance caused during fragmentation. Patterns in species richness and abundance were consistent 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after fragmentation. The expected decrease in fish abundance from reduced total seagrass area in fragmented and patchy seagrass appeared to be offset by greater fish density per unit area of seagrass. If fish prefer to live at edges, then the effects of seagrass habitat loss on fish abundance may have been offset by the increase (25%) in seagrass perimeter in fragmented and patchy treatments. Possibly there is some threshold of seagrass patch connectivity below which fish abundances cannot be maintained. The immediate responses of fish to experimental habitat fragmentation provided insights beyond those possible from comparisons of continuous and historically patchy habitat. ¬© 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.591539238,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,49,NA

Larval nets were used monthly from September 2000 to January 2001 to identify common carp spawning and recruitment areas in the regulated Murray River and floodplain around the Barmah-Millewa forest. Five non-native and five native fish species comprising 136 111 individuals were collected, with common carp constituting 88% of the overall catch. Less than 1% of common carp, however, originated from the Murray River upstream of the Barmah-Millewa floodplain. Consequently, this floodplain appears to be a major source of common carp recruitment in the mid-Murray area. Conversely, eggs from large-bodied native fish were only present in the Murray River and not the Barmah floodplain. There are opportunities for common carp control in this area, to potentially reduce populations in a wider river reach. Implementation of common carp control measures in the Barmah-Millewa floodplain should be further investigated, particularly with regard to seasonal irrigation flows, obligatory migration routes and in the timing of future large-scale environmental water allocations. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.589691782,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,76,NA

Sand slugs are widespread in parts of southeastern Australia as well as in many other parts of the world, and there is now considerable interest in restoring such affected streams. The reintroduction of large timber is widely suggested as a strategy for restoring habitat complexity, but this has rarely been tested in sand slug-affected streams. We examined the response of fish populations to wood addition to two streams in southeastern Australia that have been impacted by sand slugs. Manipulated sites (three per treatment) had either one or four timber structures added, and these sites were compared with (three) unmanipulated (control) sites before and after the manipulation occurred. Despite a supraseasonal drought during the study, we observed short-term increases in the abundance of Mountain galaxias (Galaxias olidus) at the four-structure sites, while both the four-structure and the one-structure treatments appeared to buffer against drought-induced declines in two other species, River blackfish (Gadopsis marmoratus) and Southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis), relative to controls. However, drought eventually caused the complete loss of surface water from these streams and the loss of fish from both manipulated and unmanipulated sites. Thus, although the study supports the use of timber structures as a means of increasing local fish abundances, these beneficial effects were, in these streams, contingent upon permanency of flow. Because sedimentation has depleted the number of permanent refuge pools in these creeks, recovery rates of the fauna (i.e., resilience) are likely to be slow. We therefore conclude that in streams subjected to frequent disturbance, restoring refugia may be as, if not more, important as restoring what we term residential habitat. ¬© 2005 Society for Ecological Restoration International.",Article,Scopus,0.575802622,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,115,NA

Data on variability in the occurrence, number and type of fish in the diet of different piscivores was combined with estimates of the abundance of each group. The model predicts that previously overlooked small and occasional or 'minor' piscivores, such as sillaginids, ambassids, sparids and small juvenile carangids, inflict mortality on new recruits to shallow-water nursery habitats that is orders of magnitude greater than that imparted by more conspicuous larger piscivores. Because of their high abundance, a shift in the diet of minor piscivores to prey on new recruits results in a massive increase in the consumption of fish prey by the piscivore assemblage as a whole. Even if the evidence that minor piscivores switch to target new recruits was rejected, the model shows that the highly abundant minor piscivores must still exert a significant proportion of predation mortality experienced by recruiting fishes. As a broad functional group, minor piscivores occur in most aquatic systems around the globe and are likely to play an important but largely overlooked role as predators that shape communities through predation on critical early life stages of other fishes. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.574737072,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,57,NA

Within seagrass, we found strong and consistent patterns at edges. Regardless of site, the total number of fish sampled was greater at the seaward seagrass edge (484 fish) than in the seagrass middle (231), but there was little difference between the seagrass middle and the shoreward seagrass edge (297).

In constructed wetland microcosms, mosquitofish reduced both growth and condition of post-larval mudfish but did not attack or kill mudfish. In laboratory aquaria, mosquitofish rapidly consumed mudfish fry but survival time of the latter was significantly extended by an increase in density of submerged structures and by the presence of an alternative food source for mosquitofish.

Hypoxia affects vast areas around the world and often causes fish kills, reduced abundance, altered distribution, low benthic biomass and declines in fisheries. In Australia, many fisheries are based on sparid fishes and in the southern states black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) is important to both the recreational and commercial sectors. This species completes its entire life cycle in estuaries and annual recruitment is highly variable and very likely influenced by environmental conditions during the spawning season. In a laboratory-based experiment, fertilised black bream eggs (embryos) were exposed to five different levels of dissolved oxygen (DO). The DO levels were maintained in small test wells using nitrogen gas in a novel chamber design. Embryo development was assessed over a 2-day period and hatched larvae were observed until Day 2 post-hatch. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in embryonic development and survival as a function of DO level. In severely hypoxic conditions (30% saturation) survival to 1 day was reduced and no hatching occurred. In moderately hypoxic conditions (45-55%S), both precocious and delayed hatching was observed and hatch rates were reduced, whilst the number of hatched larvae with deformities increased, resulting in reduced larval lengths. No larvae survived to Day 2 post-hatch when held in hypoxic conditions (<55%S). This study demonstrates the detrimental effect that severe hypoxia can have on the early development of black bream which could result in reduced recruitment and lowered abundance. Other species that share similar early life histories may also be at risk. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus,0.566598673,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,30,NA

Seagrass beds close to mangroves had a greater density of fish species than beds far from mangroves (close: mean 16.0 species net-1, SE 1.0; far: 13.2, 1.3; P &lt; 0.05).

In particular, fish that utilise mangrove forests at high tide were found in greater species densities and species richness in seagrass nearer to mangroves.

In northeastern New Zealand, the contrasting populations of previously exploited predators in highly protected marine reserves and fished areas have been used to investigate the effects of predation in soft-sediment habitats. However, these experiments have been unable to separate the role of predator size from that of density. This study provides evidence to support the model that foraging by different sizes of the rock lobster Jasus edwardsii affects soft-sediment bivalve populations in different ways. Feeding trials were conducted to investigate whether rock lobsters of different sizes vary in their choice of taxa and size of their bivalve prey. Trials with two morphologically similar species, Dosinia subrosea and Dosinia anus, indicated that lobsters of all sizes choose D. subrosea more frequently than the heavier shelled D. anus. Further results indicated that both large (>130 mm carapace length (CL)) and small (<100 mm CL) lobsters are capable of preying on a wide size range of D. subrosea (20-60 mm). However, small lobsters more frequently chose smaller shells (<30 mm) and large lobsters more frequently chose larger shells (>40 mm). Patterns in the abundance and size class distributions of these two bivalve species at protected and fished sites supported the feeding choices observed in the laboratory. These results suggest that populations of rock lobsters with large individuals inside reserves are capable of controlling the demography of bivalve populations in adjacent soft-sediment systems. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.56364663,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,116,NA

Using a comparative-experimental approach at local and distant sites we demonstrate that mobile subtidal predators (fish and crabs) can exert strong predation pressure on small mussels in the low tidal zone, but only in sites where the seascape includes subtidal reefs. On intertidal benches with adjacent subtidal reefs (1SR), 60-100% of small (5-15 mm) transplanted mussels were removed within a day from experimental tiles on the low shore when unprotected from predation, compared to fully caged controls that had approximately 100% survival over several months. In partial cages that exclude fish but not crabs, survivorship was intermediate. In contrast, on benches without subtidal reefs (2SR) 40-100% of mussels survived for months, even if unprotected. This difference is expressed in lower cover (0-60%) of mussels on rocks at 1SR benches compared to 2SR benches (70-99%). The central to northern west coast of the South Island is composed mostly of 2SR benches, and predation on small mussels there was low and similar to the 2SR benches on the east coast, whereas the 1SR benches on the east coast had much greater predation. This contrasts to other studies in New Zealand that examined only predation on larger mussels by seastars and concluded that predation is strong on the west coast and weak on the east coast. Excluding large predators from low-shore areas with new recruits for a year in one 1SR site showed longer-term predation effects on their abundance and cover. Short-term sampling at the east coast sites showed that mussel settlement was greater in 2SR compared to 1SR sites, providing some evidence that seascapes may also affect settlement. Overall, predation depended on the local seascape and ultimately affected community structure via suppression of effective recruitment rates. This study emphasizes the importance of predation on early life stages of basal species and the influence of seascapes on top-down interactions between subtidal predators and their intertidal prey. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.554475759,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,86,NA

Locations Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia; Bah√≠a de Loreto, Gulf of California (GoC), Mexico. Methods Cryptobenthic reef fish assemblages from four habitats (coral heads, rubble, and horizontal and vertical surfaces of boulders) were collected using clove oil. Differences in density, species richness and biomass were examined between regions and among habitats. Habitat associations were identified for each habitat/location based on multivariate ordination, and the statistical significance of patterns was tested using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). In addition, the trophic group composition of the assemblages for both regions was examined. Results A total of 91 species in 20 families were recorded (GBR, 66 species; GoC, 25 species). Total and habitat species richness were higher on the GBR, whereas biomass was higher in the GoC. No difference in fish density between regions was found. Habitat division among assemblages was greater in the depauperate GoC. Only coral head associations proved to be distinctive on the GBR, whereas three sample groups were found in the GoC (coral heads, horizontal boulders and vertical boulders/rubble). Trophic composition in the two regions was markedly different, with omnivores dominating the GBR fauna and planktivores the GoC. Main conclusions A positive regional-local relationship in fish diversity was found between regions, but fish abundance in both regions remained similar. Contrary to expectations, habitat partitioning, at a community level, was greater in the depauperate GoC. Differences in trophic composition and patterns of habitat use appear to reflect the disparate history of the regions, whereas patterns of abundance may reflect the influence of fundamental relationships between size and abundance in communities. This study highlights the potential of reef faunas to conform to universal numerical trends while maintaining an ability to respond ecologically to local/evolutionary influences. The GoC fauna appears to be exceptionally vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbance owing to the high numerical dominance of habitat-specific species and to the limited potential for functional redundancy within the system. ¬© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.549198596,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,51,NA

Half of the floodplain lakes were regulated (reservoirs) with stable water levels, while the remainder had unaltered hydrology.

We used stable isotope analysis (Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and Œ¥34S) to resolve differences in the carbon sources to food webs supporting J. edwardsii inhabiting these regions. Furthermore, we examined patterns in the relative concentration and Œ¥13C signature of specific fatty acid biomarkers as an independent test of the carbon sources to each population. We found distinctive patterns in the relative abundance of red rock lobsters, with significantly more animals in the marine reserves at Te Awaatu Channel and Kutu Parera than in the surrounding open fishing areas and within the reserve at Taipari Roa. Taipari Roa Reserve is distinctive in that bivalve abundance is extremely low due to freshwater input from the Manapouri hydroelectric power plant. Analysis of Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and Œ¥34S of red rock lobster muscle tissue as well as Œ¥13C of 16:1œâ7 and 18:1œâ7 indicated that, in those areas where heterotrophic bivalves are rare, red rock lobsters rely more on recycled carbon made available by chemoautotrophs. These findings suggest that efficacy of the new marine reserves is influenced by habitat quality in terms of the availability and abundance of food resources for red rock lobsters.

The first step to elucidating their ecological importance, however, is an understanding of elasmobranch community structure. Such studies are relatively uncommon, especially in communities where human impacts are thought to be low. We used visual surveys and a variety of capture methods to determine spatial and temporal variation in the species composition of a sandflat elasmobranch community in the relatively pristine ecosystem of Shark Bay, Australia. Overall, juvenile batoids dominated the community. Eleven elasmobranch species (10 batoids, 1 shark) were found to inhabit the sandflats during the cold season (June-August) and 21 species (12 batoids, 9 sharks) were recorded during the warm season. The overall density of elasmobranchs occupying the sandflat was also higher during the warm season. Nearshore areas, especially during the warm season, supported the highest densities of elasmobranchs overall as well as the dominant species (giant shovelnose ray, Glaucostegus typus, and reticulate whipray, Himantura uarnak). Such high elasmobranch abundance may be driven by a combination of factors including prey availability, predator avoidance, and behavioral thermoregulation. The high species richness and density of elasmobranchs in such a restricted area suggest that elasmobranch mesopredators could exert strong top-down impacts in nearshore environments in the absence of human impacts, but raises questions of how resources are partitioned among apparently similar species in this system. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.540161601,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,35,NA

Analyses of the wetland biodiversity have resulted in the production of species list for many taxa, and some population and community-level analyses of biomass and abundance, and the mapping of habitats at multiple scales. Wetland habitats include inter-tidal mud-flats, mangroves, hyper-saline flats, freshwater flood plains and streams. The tidal influence on the saline wetlands is pronounced, as is the influence of the annual wet-dry cycle of the monsoonal climate on the flood plains and streams. The vegetation is diverse and highly dynamic with rapid turnover of organic material and nutrients. The fauna is abundant with endemism being high in some habitats. Most fauna analyses have focussed on vertebrates with a large amount of information on waterbirds and fish in particular. However, despite extensive effort over the past two decades much is still unknown about the biota. While the invertebrate fauna in the streams has received some attention, a large taxonomic classification effort is required. The functional inter-relationships between habitats and species have largely not been assessed. Further, the ecology of many species is only cursorily known.

E. chloroticus collected from wild populations with high and low initial GI values were caught and held in either ambient or constant (‚àº 14.7¬†¬∞C) seawater temperatures. The study has shown that, given a suitable roe enhancement diet, it is possible to significantly increase the GI of urchins throughout the year and that a seasonal effect on both the final GI and increase in GI, is primarily caused by seasonal variation in temperature. There are also significant effects from other factors, such as the initial condition of the animals prior to the trial and the reproductive stage of the urchins, but these are not as significant as the effects of temperature. The results indicate that it would be possible to increase the productivity of sea urchins by capturing them in cooler water and enhancing them at a site with relatively warmer water. The initial condition (GI) of the urchins plays an important role in gonad production with animals taken in low initial GI condition producing significantly larger increases in GI throughout each of the four seasons, than those with a high initial GI value. The urchins from the two populations developed through the stages of the reproductive cycle at a similar rate despite different final GI values and rates of increase in GI in both the temperature and population treatments, indicating that the differences in gonad production are related to environmental effects rather than the reproductive stage of the urchins. The exception to this occurred in the autumn samples where lower GI values and increase in GI were found during this season compared to in other seasons for the constant temperature treatment. There is an overabundance of low GI urchins in the coastal waters of New Zealand and these animals are relatively easily found and fished on snorkel compared to high GI animals for which fishing pressure is much higher. It would appear to be more economic to fish and enhance low GI animals in New Zealand due to their relative abundance, ease of access and higher productivity during enhancement. ¬© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Mitigation of CWP through the introduction of selective withdrawal capabilities to access near-surface water is predicted to increase discharge temperatures during the crucial spring-early summer post-spawning period by 4-6¬∞C for normal operating conditions, that is, a full reservoir in early spring. No improvement in discharge temperature was predicted for drought conditions characterized by relatively low storage levels in early spring. The predicted temperature increase using selective withdrawal increased the predicted average minimum female population abundance by 30-300% depending on the assumed spawning behaviour. Increased discharge temperatures appear to be achievable and are expected to reduce the stress currently impacting Murray cod populations due to CWP during crucial post-spawning periods.

Catches on the lagoon floor ranged from 750 to 3330 ind. m-3, with peak abundance in October, while water column catches were lower (25 to 2500 ind. m -3), with peak nocturnal abundance in February. Most species in the hyperbenthic community do not migrate into the water column at night, but instead remain concentrated near the lagoon floor. Only the mysid Anisomysis laticauda, the copepod Acartia australis, and the ostracod Cypridina sp. A were consistently captured on the lagoon floor by day and in surface waters at night. The lagoon hyperbenthic community probably contributes to coral reef ecosystems through the remineralization of organic detritus. Given the high abundance of relatively large individuals, the contribution of the resident, lagoon floor community to coral reef ecosystems must be substantial. ¬© Inter-Research 2007.",Article,Scopus,0.530038417,0,NA,NA,10,NA,0,10,12,NA

The identification of which habitat(s) to attempt to restore is a critical step in the restoration process, but one for which there is often a paucity of useful information. Here we examine the distribution of fish in three lowland streams in Victoria, Australia, that have been degraded by severe sedimentation. We aim to identify habitats that are associated with high abundances of native fish, and that thus might be appropriate to target in habitat restoration. Associations between native fish abundances and physical habitat characteristics were examined at three spatial scales (among streams, among sites and within sites) to determine the types of habitat to which fish respond, and the scales over which these responses occur. Of the four species of native fish found in the streams, three (Galaxias olidus G√ºnther, Gadopsis marmoratus (Richardson) and Nanoperca australis G√ºnther) showed significant habitat associations at small spatial scales (i.e. within sites). In particular, these species were generally found in deeper water, and in close proximity to cover (typically either coarse or fine woody debris or vegetation). Differences in habitat availability among sites and streams were less influential, except in the case of G. marmoratus, which was completely absent from both the ephemeral streams. Although our results suggest that these species collectively respond to habitat at several spatial scales, fish distributions were allied to the presence of habitat structure at the scale of metres, the smallest spatial scale examined. We hypothesize that fish abundances are currently limited by the low availability of habitat at these small spatial scales. It may therefore be possible to increase fish abundances in these creeks by augmenting the amount of available habitat via stream restoration.",Article,Scopus,0.523146289,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,105,NA

A decade ago we reviewed this ecological question in a paper that focused on phyllosomal development of the western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus. The main region of occurrence of its metamorphosis was found to be in the slope region beyond the shelf break. Because the puerulus of P. cygnus is a non-feeding stage, it was hypothesised that metamorphosis will not occur until the final phyllosoma has reached some critical, and specific, level of stored energy reserves. For late larval development and successful metamorphosis of P. cygnus, the richest food resources seem to be located in the slope waters adjoining the shelf break off Western Australia. This, like most shelf break areas, is a region of higher zooplankton and micronekton biomass than is usually found further offshore, and is dominated (in winter-spring months) by the warm south-flowing Leeuwin Current. In this new review, distribution and abundance data of final phyllosomas and pueruli are examined from, Panulirus argus, Panulirus cygnus, Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus ornatus and Jasus edwardsii, and where possible, related to features of the satellite imagery of the areas in which they occur. We hypothesise that metamorphosis will occur where the final stages have partaken of sufficient, appropriate nutrition to provide them with a reserve of bioenergetic resources, and this can occur where oceanographic fronts effect greater planktonic productivity and concentrations of food organisms. This may be near the shelf-break, or out to large distances offshore, because of large-scale oceanographic events such as the prevailing current system, its off-shoots, mesoscale eddy fronts, counter-currents, etc. However, we contend that, in terms of population recruitment, metamorphosis in most shallow-water palinurid species occurs mainly in the slope waters adjoining the shelf break of the region to which the species is endemic. Although some final phyllosomas may metamorphose much further offshore, it is unlikely that these pueruli will reach the shore, let alone settle and successfully moult to the juvenile stage. All of the data indicate that successful metamorphosis from the final-stage phyllosoma to the puerulus stage in all species occurs offshore but close to the continental shelf. ¬© The Author(s) 2008.",Review,Scopus,0.507740287,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,132,NA

This present study compared the distribution and abundance of black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) eggs and yolk-sac larvae between two microtidal estuaries of different flow regimes, where the riverine flow into the Glenelg estuary was around eight times the flow volume into the Hopkins estuary. Samples were collected monthly from September to November at sites along each estuary where vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured, and vertically stratified sampling of black bream eggs and yolk-sac larvae was conducted using a Schindler sampler. Salt wedge formation was apparent in both estuaries, with significant de-oxygenation of deeper, saline waters. Eggs occurred in a wide range of DO levels but yolk-sac larvae were less common at the lowest levels. Most eggs and yolk-sac larvae were collected in salinities greater than 10. Results suggested that egg mortality was higher in the Hopkins than the Glenelg estuary, which may be associated with the hypoxic conditions characteristic of low-flow conditions.

Prawns were modelled as individuals moving to and from patches or cells according to pre-set decision rules. The landscape was simulated as a matrix of cells with each cell having a spatially explicit survival index for each species. Mixed species prawn assemblages moved over this simplified spatially explicit landscape. A low level of chronic random environmental disturbance was assumed (cyclone and tropical storm damage) with additional acute spatially confined disturbance due to commercial trawling, modelled as an increase in mortality affecting inter-specific competition. The general form of the results was for increased disturbance to favour good-colonising ""generalist"" species at the expense of good-competitor ""specialists"". Increasing fishing mortality (local patch extinctions) combined with poor colonising ability resulted in low equilibrium abundance for even the best competitor, while in the same circumstances the poorest competitor but best coloniser could have the highest equilibrium abundance. This mimics the switch from high-value prawn species to lower-value prawn species as trawl effort increases, reflected in historic catch and effort logbook data and reported anecdotaly from the north Queensland trawl fleet. To match the observed distribution and behaviour of prawn assemblages, a combination inter-species competition, a spatially explicit landscape, and a defined pattern of disturbance (trawling) was required. Modelling this combination could simulate not only general trends in spatial distribution of each of prawn species but also localised concentrations observed in the survey data. ¬© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The results demonstrate that multiple-pass electrofishing plus seine netting provide more accurate and precise estimates of fish species richness, assemblage composition and species relative abundances in comparison to single-pass electrofishing alone, and that intensive sampling of three mesohabitat units (equivalent to a riffle-run-pool sequence) is a more efficient sampling strategy to estimate reach-scale assemblage attributes than less intensive sampling over larger spatial scales.

D. aquaticus predominantly eat aquatic prey as they hunt from the water surface. However, D. aquaticus biomass peaked at rivers with intermediate flood disturbance, rather than at less flood-prone rivers where the biomass of aquatic insect prey was markedly higher. Flooding positively influenced spider habitat quality, and an experimental manipulation at stable rivers indicated that unembedded cobbles, preferred D. aquaticus habitat, were a limiting factor, preventing response to the increased prey resource at stable sites. Potential terrestrial prey abundance was low, did not vary across the disturbance gradient, and is likely to have been a much smaller component of the fishing spiders' diet than aquatic insect prey.

This study investigated the effects of invasion and management of the woody shrub Lantana camara (lantana) in wet sclerophyll forest on the south-east coast of Australia. The effects of L. camara invasion and management on resident vegetation diversity and recruitment were determined as well as if invader management initiated community recovery. Vascular plant species richness, abundance and composition were surveyed and compared across L. camara invaded, non-invaded and managed sites following L. camara removal during a previous control event by land managers. Native tree juvenile and adult densities were compared between sites to investigate the potential effects of L. camara on species recruitment. Invasion of L. camara led to a reduction in species richness and compositions that diverged from non-invaded vegetation. Species richness was lower for fern, herb, tree and vine species, highlighting the pervasive threat of L. camara. For many common tree species, juvenile densities were lower within invaded sites than non-invaded sites, yet adult densities were similar across all invasion categories. This indicates that reduced species diversity is driven in part by recruitment limitation mechanisms, which may include allelopathy and resource competition, rather than displacement of adult vegetation. Management of L. camara initiated community recovery by increasing species richness, abundance and recruitment. While community composition following L. camara management diverged from non-invaded vegetation, vigorous tree and shrub recruitment signals that long-term community reinstatement will occur. However, secondary weed invasion occurred following L. camara control. Follow-up weed control may be necessary to prevent secondary plant invasion following invader management and facilitate long-term community recovery.

It was hypothesised that wild fish populations in the area consumed particulate wastes emanating from the cage, thus reducing the benthic impacts. An experiment was designed to quantify the accumulation of organic material on the seabed occurring in the presence and absence of wild fauna. Three treatments were arranged in duplicate, cages without exclusion nets (normal situation) (CAGE-FISH); cages surrounded by a 35-mm mesh exclusion net (preventing wild fish access to the sea bed and water column near the cage) (CAGE-FISH-EXCL); and empty cages surrounded by exclusion nets (to control for effects from the exclusion net) (CAGE-EXCL). In addition, four reference sites without cages (REF) were sampled. Following baseline sampling, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were stocked into the CAGE-FISH and the CAGE-FISH-EXCL treatments at an initial stocking density of 2.4 kg m-3. The experiment was terminated after 62 days, at a final stock density of 5.6 kg m-3. Sampling found significantly greater accumulation of nutrients and fine sediments under the cages enclosed in the exclusion net than in other treatments and sites. Levels of organic carbon deposition at cages with exclusion nets was found to be 4.5¬±1.0 g C m-2 day-1 (mean¬±S.E.) compared to 0.7 to 1.1 g C m-2 day-1 at control and reference sites. The accumulation of nutrients at the CAGE-FISH-EXCL sites was correlated to distinct changes in macrofaunal community composition, with a sharp increase in overall macrofaunal abundance and a growing dominance of capitellid polychaetes. Based on a comparison between sedimentation rates within and outside excluded areas, the proportions of the total sedimenting nutrients consumed by wild fish were calculated to be 40% to 60%. It was concluded that in the natural coastal system of Western Australia or comparable environments, wild fish are potential important consumers of cage aquaculture waste materials. The fact that sediment C, N and P did not increase below cages with fish and no exclusion nets suggests that the benthic fauna, including surface grazing fish, at these sites were able to assimilate much of the remaining total sedimentary nutrients. ¬© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Brown and rainbow trout have been introduced to many inland waters in New Zealand, but research on the impacts on native communities has focused mainly on streams. The purpose of this study was to compare the benthic communities of trout and troutless lakes. Based on previous studies in North America and Europe, we predicted that the benthic biomass, and especially the abundance of large invertebrates, would be lower in lakes with trout as compared to those without. We surveyed the invertebrate fauna of 43 shallow, high-elevation lakes (26 with and 17 without trout) in four geographic clusters on the central South Island and then conducted a detailed quantitative study of invertebrate biomass and community structure in 12 of these lakes. 2. Benthic community composition and diversity of lakes with and without trout were nearly identical and biomass was as high or higher in the lakes with as without trout. There was no evidence that trout have caused local extinctions of benthic invertebrates. Although the proportional abundance of large-bodied aquatic was slightly lower in lakes with than without trout, the abundance of several groups of large-bodied benthic taxa (dragonflies, caddisflies and water bugs) did not differ. 3. Our findings are in contrast to those in North American and Europe where trout introductions into previously troutless lakes have led to declines in the abundance of benthic invertebrates, especially large-bodied taxa. We propose that the modest effects of trout in New Zealand could be explained by (i) the high areal extent of submergent vegetation that acts as a benthic refuge, (ii) low intensity of trout predation on benthic communities and/or (iii) characteristics of the benthic invertebrates that make them relatively invulnerable to fish predation. 4. Regardless of the relative importance of these hypotheses, our results emphasise that the same invertebrates occurred in all of the lakes, regardless of size, elevation and presence of trout, suggesting habitat generalists dominate the benthic fauna in shallow New Zealand lakes. ¬© 2006 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.45520988,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,93,NA

Gut contents of trout, crayfish and eels were also examined to evaluate whether competition or predation could be linked to the patterns found. Abundances of crayfish and galaxiids were significantly lower in streams with trout, but in streams without trout, substrate size was one of the most important factors determining crayfish abundance. In contrast to crayfish, other macroinvertebrates were more abundant in trout streams than streams without trout and significantly more taxa were found in streams with trout. Macroinvertebrate abundance was related to environmental factors, such as pH, substrate, depth and total nitrogen. Gut content analysis showed an overlap in diet (mostly invertebrates) between trout and eels. Crayfish, however, had a more omnivorous diet where detritus was the most frequently occurring food material. Differences in chemical characteristics marked the streams with and without trout. Thus, trout were not present in streams with pH < 6.0. Crayfish and galaxiids were present in streams with pH ranging from 4.1 to 7.9, and those with pH < 6.0 may function as trout-free refuges where larger populations of these species may persist. However, other macroinvertebrate taxa may be more negatively affected by acidification than by trout. By protecting naturally acidic, brown water streams, New Zealand crayfish and galaxiid fish populations can be conserved within geographic areas where trout are present. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Neochanna species are wetland specialists and it is likely that they were abundant in the extensive wetlands that once covered much of New Zealand. Large tracts of these lowland areas have been drained and are now productive agricultural land. Remaining fragmented Neochanna populations face increasing challenges as their habitat continues to change. Neochanna species are adaptable, however, and are tolerant of disturbance and adverse conditions, to an extent. With increased public awareness and understanding, and habitat protection, there is every chance that these unique fish will persist. Overall, the taxonomic distinctiveness, general biogeography, and genetic structure of the genus Neochanna is fairly well known, but many aspects of the species' physiology, biology and ecological situation require further study. ¬© Copyright August 2007, Department of Conservation.",Review,Scopus,0.452250149,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,62,NA

Compensatory responses of yield to pest damage, and pest populations to fertility control are described as part of the modelling. The focal relationship is that between yield and the proportion of a pest population permanently sterilised, which is shown to be generally positive though the form of the relationship varies with differing assumptions. Compensatory responses to pest damage of production systems, such as crops, livestock, trees or fish, generate non-linear responses between yield and pest damage, and yield and pest abundance. Compensatory responses by a pest population generate linear or curved relationships between abundance and the proportion of females sterilised. The model is illustrated using data from empirical studies, especially of European rabbits in Australia and New Zealand. It is recommended that the framework be evaluated on wild populations of vertebrate pests.",Article,Scopus,0.43820813,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,104,NA

Light traps collected premetamorphic individuals from the water column (""settlers"") to establish a baseline for each cohort. Subsequently, divers collected benthic juveniles (""recruits"") at 1-3-month intervals to determine the relative impacts of post-settlement mortality during the first three months. Growth trajectories for individual fish were back-calculated from otolith records and compared with nonlinear mixed-effects models. Size-selective mortality was detected in all cohorts with the loss of smaller, slower growing individuals. Three months after settlement, recruits showed significantly faster growth as juveniles, faster growth as larvae, and larger sizes as hatchlings. The timing and intensity of post-settlement selection differed among cohorts and was correlated with density at settlement. The cohort with the greatest initial abundance experienced the strongest selective mortality, with most of this mortality occurring between one and two months after settlement when juveniles began foraging at higher positions in the water column. Significant genetic structure was found between settlers and three-month-old recruits in this cohort as a result of natural selection that changed the frequency of mtDNA haplotypes measured at the control region. The extent of this genetic difference was enlarged or reduced by artificially manipulating the intensity of size-based selection, thus establishing a link between phenotype and haplotype. Sequence variation in the control region of the mitochondrial genome has been linked to mitochondrial efficiency and weight gain in other studies, which provides a plausible explanation for the patterns observed here. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.43692756,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,70,NA

Marine cleaning mutualisms generally involve small fish or shrimps removing ectoparasites and other material from cooperating 'client' fish. We evaluate the role of fish abundance, body size and behaviour as determinants of interactions with cleaning mutualists. 2. Data come from eight reef locations in Brazil, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and Australia. 3. We conducted a meta-analysis of client-cleaner interactions involving 11 cleaner and 221 client species. 4. There was a strong, positive effect of client abundance on cleaning frequency, but only a weak, negative effect of client body size. These effects were modulated by client trophic group and social behaviour. 5. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting a central role of species abundance in structuring species interactions. ¬© 2006 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.426216746,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,50,NA

However, for coral reef fishes, such information is almost nonexistent. In this study, we analyzed the structure of the parasite communities based on composition, richness, abundance, and biovolume of ecto- and endoparasites of 14 wrasse species (Labridae) from Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We determine whether the structure of the parasite communities from these fishes was related to ecological characteristics (body size, abundance, swimming ability, and diet) and/or the phylogenetic relatedness of the hosts. We examined 264 fishes from which almost 37,000 individual parasites and 98 parasite categories (types and species) were recorded. Gnathiid and cestode larvae were the most prevalent and abundant parasites in most fishes. Mean richness, abundance, and biovolume of ectoparasites per fish species were positively correlated with host body size only after controlling for the host phylogeny, whereas no such correlation was found for endoparasites with any host variable. Because most ectoparasites have direct transmission, one possible explanation for this pattern is that increased space (host body size) may increase the colonization and recruitment of ectoparasites. However, endoparasites generally have indirect transmission that can be affected by many other variables, such as number of prey infected and rate of parasite transmission. ¬© American Society of Parasitologists 2007.",Article,Scopus,0.421652881,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,29,NA

The CARD-FISH technique was modified relative to previous described procedures and performed directly on gelatine cover slips in order to allow simultaneous combination with microautoradiography. Almost twofold higher numbers of microorganisms could be identified as either Bacteria or Actinobacteria using the CARD-FISH technique as compared with the traditional FISH technique. A combination of FISH or CARD-FISH with microautoradiography showed generally higher activity among the Actinobacteria than among all Bacteria. Another important observation was that many cells within the FISH-negative populations of both Actinobacteria and Bacteria were actively assimilating thymidine. Thus, great care should be taken when extrapolating the active fraction of a prokaryotic community to be equivalent to the FISH-detectable population in such environments. Bacterial groups within Actinobacteria produce the odours geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol, which lower the quality of surface water when used for drinking. The results indicate that combined microautoradiography and CARD-FISH may serve as an effective tool when studying identity and activity of microorganisms within freshwater environments. ¬© 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
