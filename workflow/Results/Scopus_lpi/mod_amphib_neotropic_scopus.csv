Bd). The genus Atelopus is of high conservation concern, but relatively little is known about the population dynamics and life history of the majority of species. We examined the demography of one population of Atelopus zeteki and two populations of A. varius in central Panama using three to six years of mark-recapture data collected prior to and during an outbreak of Bd. We estimated male survival probabilities prior to the arrival of Bd and sex-specific population sizes for these three populations using state-space Bayesian population models. Prior to the arrival of Bd, monthly apparent survival probabilities were higher for A. varius males than for A. zeteki males, and recaptures among years were low in both species. Abundance of both species varied over time and declined rapidly after the arrival of Bd. Male densities were generally greater than female densities, though female densities were higher or equivalent to males after the arrival of Bd. Estimates of survival and abundance over time may be explained by differences in the use of stream habitat by the two sexes and three populations, both during and between breeding seasons. These estimates provide key baseline population information that can be used to inform reintroductions from captive assurance colonies and studies of extant Atelopus populations as part of conservation and management programs. ¬© 2015 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.846857644,1,1,NA,5,5,1,5,1,5,4,NA

Amphibian population decline over the last century is a notable case of species loss because amphibians survived the last four major extinction events in global history, their current rate of extinction is unprecedented, and their rate of extinction is greater than that for most other taxonomic groups. Despite the severity of this conservation problem and its relevance to the study of global biodiversity loss, major knowledge gaps remain for many of the most threatened species and regions in the world. Rigorous estimates of population parameters are lacking for many amphibian species in the Neotropics. The goal of our study was to determine how the demography of seven species of the genus Pristimantis varied over time and space in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes. We completed a long term capture-mark-recapture study to estimate abundance, survival, and population growth rates in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes; from 2002 to 2009 at Yanayacu in the Eastern Cordillera and from 2002 to 2003 at Cashca Totoras in the Western Cordillera. Our results showed seasonal and annual variation in population parameters by species and sex. P. bicantus experienced significant reductions in abundance over the course of our study. Abundance, apparent survival, and population growth rates were lower in disturbed than in primary or mature secondary forest. The results of our study raise concerns for the population status of understudied amphibian groups and provide insights into the population dynamics of Neotropical amphibians. ¬© 2014 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.833651963,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,1,5,26,NA

Captive breeding has been suggested as a way to conserve harlequin frogs threatened by the amphibian chytrid fungus and global warming. A major problem is that little is known with regard to the natural history of Atelopus species. We studied male A. hoogmoedi site fidelity, home range and habitat utilization during the long rainy season (April to August) at Brownsberg Nature Park, Suriname. During this period, males and females occupy different habitats (i.e. streams versus forest). We studied male toads along a stream site. In total, 19 males were observed; relative abundance was 0.475 individuals per meter. Fourteen males were recaptured at the same site or its vicinity at least once and 12 maintained home ranges (38.1 ¬± 17.7 m 2 in size) for up to four months. However, male-male interaction was not observed. In the vicinity of streams, male A. hoogmoedi were perched 51.95 ¬± 36.7 cm above ground in dense understory. In conservation breeding efforts, we recommend to keep sexes separately prior to mating and to simulate the rainy season. Because males occupy home ranges at the breeding site, reproductive success in captivity may be higher when females are moved to male containers (which should have some running water imitating a stream habitat). Low male density and home range size should be considered when populating tanks with males. Tanks for males and breeding should address that wild specimens were mostly found on low vegetation. ¬© 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Herpetologie und Terrarienkundee. V.

Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors",Article,Scopus,0.779302536,NA,1,May contain information on prey population trend,NA,5,,,1,5,36,NA

We conducted fieldwork every month from August 2007 to July 2008 within an ecotone connecting semideciduous Atlantic Forest and Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) in S√£o Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. Over the course of the prolonged breeding season, we recorded the maximum number of calling males and measured their snout-vent lengths; we then compared our data from the beginning and the end of the breeding season. We found that the breeding pattern of H. albopunctatus is correlated with climatic, physical, and biological factors. Male competition and aggression varied according to the population density, most likely as a function of resource availability. There appears to be a social hierarchy among males of H. albopunctatus according to body size. Large calling males dominated the chorus in the beginning of the breeding season, but smaller males contributed more to the assemblage as the breeding season progressed. The average size of calling males at the end of the breeding season was significantly smaller. Smaller males occurred most in January and February, marking the H. albopunctatus breeding recruitment, when an abundance of adequate breeding microhabitats exist. Our full-season study serves as a cautionary tale: hypotheses based on body size, particularly for prolonged anuran breeder species, may be affected by seasonality.

Within the Neotropics, the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon; however, recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in Central America are waning as well. Unfortunately, very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical America. Here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the Central Amazon, sampled first in 1984-1985 and again in 2007. We find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of 22 years at this site. This conclusion differs markedly from the decline of 75% in amphibian populations over 35 years at a lowland site in Costa Rica. To explore potential declines in lowland Neotropical amphibian populations in detail, we suggest that existing baseline data be comprehensively compiled and analyzed for previously sampled sites and that these sites be re-sampled using comparable methodologies. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.745543703,1,1,NA,10,5,,,,,9,1

Many temperate locations have adopted citizen science programs to monitor local anuran populations using call surveys and road transects. These surveys, however, are not commonly conducted in the tropics. I tested use of call surveys for estimating population density of a small terrestrial poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in six different populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama. By conducting three-minute call surveys, and searching for all individual frogs in a 10 m radius of the survey point, I directly compared the number of calling males to the observed number of frogs in a given area. I found call density to be a poor predictor of population density. Despite there being differences in population densities, the lack of a relationship between the number of calls and population density highlights the limited use for call surveys for terrestrial, territorial species. Although call surveys may be useful in some taxa for general abundance estimates, this study clearly demonstrates a startling deficiency of call surveys for anuran monitoring and highlights the need for species-specific analysis to further explore the utility of this method. ¬© Copyright 2017 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.",Review,Scopus,0.739937118,NA,0,NA,NA,5,,,0,5,28,NA

The study was carried out for five years, but taking samples of adults in January 1995, 1997, 1998 (except March), and 1999. We also studied tadpoles during four days in 1997. In total, 443 males and 7 females were marked, with 315 males recaptured and no females. Females are bigger (91.1 mm) than males (61.3 mm). Most recaptured individuals occurred in the same or adjacent sectors, with a maximum movement of 28 sectors. One individual was recaptured repeatedly in all the samples. This indicates that they survived at least five reproductive cycles. The reproductive cycle takes place during the dry season, between December and April. We found more individuals during the reproductive cycle of 1997 and less during 1995. Sector 6 had the most number of males and sector number 4 had the least. Sectors with semi-open vegetation had more males compared to sectors with more forest cover. February is the month with the highest abundance of males. There are intermediate values in December and January, and fewer individuals in March and April. In every month, except February, the abundance of individuals was greater where there were beaches. Tadpoles were found both during the day and night in the 31 river sectors, but it was less likely to find tadpoles in the river section during the night. During the day all tadpoles were found scattered around the river, at night they congregated near river margins. The reproductive cycle of this toad occurs during the dry season and females are present only in the reproductive season, resulting in an almost only male sex ratio (only seven females were found).

We surveyed frogs in the Peruvian Andes in montane forests along a steep elevational gradient (1200-3700 m). We used visual encounter surveys to sample stream-dwelling and arboreal species and leaf-litter plots to sample terrestrial-breeding species. We compared species richness and abundance among the wet seasons of 1999, 2008, and 2009. Despite similar sampling effort among years, the number of species (46 in 1999) declined by 47% between 1999 and 2008 and by 38% between 1999 and 2009. When we combined the number of species we found in 2008 and 2009, the decline from 1999 was 36%. Declines of stream-dwelling and arboreal species (a reduction in species richness of 55%) were much greater than declines of terrestrial-breeding species (reduction of 20% in 2008 and 24% in 2009). Similarly, abundances of stream-dwelling and arboreal frogs were lower in the combined 2008-2009 period than in 1999, whereas densities of frogs in leaf-litter plots did not differ among survey years. These declines may be associated with the infection of frogs with Bd. B. dendrobatidis prevalence correlated significantly with the proportion of species that were absent from the 2008 and 2009 surveys along the elevational gradient. Our results suggest Bd may have arrived at the site between 1999 and 2007, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this pathogen is spreading in epidemic waves along the Andean cordilleras. Our results also indicate a rapid decline of frog species richness and abundance in our study area, a national park that contains many endemic amphibian species and is high in amphibian species richness. ¬©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.728088498,1,1,NA,5,5,1,5,1,5,1,NA

One of these is the glassfrog Cochranella mache, endemic to seasonal evergreen forests of the West Ecuadorian region and restricted to highly fragmented forest of &lt; 100 km2 in the Cordillera Mache-Chindul, north-western coastal Ecuador, at 100-640 m. We surveyed this region to elucidate the distribution and conservation status of C. mache. We located it in three new localities and also found a museum specimen from a further new locality. We recommend that the species should be categorized as Critically Endangered because of the continuous and progressive destruction of its increasingly fragmented habitat. Recent surveys of glassfrog species sympatric with C. mache showed low relative abundances compared to surveys in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the relationship between forest and local climate we suggest that gradual declines of lowland glassfrog populations may be caused by local climate changes produced by forest destruction. In situ conservation is required to halt and mitigate these impacts.

However, cases showing explicit links between species decline and climate are scarce, mostly because of a lack of baseline data. Tropical ectotherms with narrow altitudinal ranges are particularly sensitive to climate change; for example the frog Pristimantis espedeus may be at risk, with only nine populations known to date in French Guiana, all on isolated massifs. Ecological niche modelling indicated that these populations could disappear by 2070. To facilitate testing of this prediction we conducted a study to design an efficient, cost-effective monitoring protocol, combining occupancy rate estimations using passive acoustic recorders, and abundance estimations using acoustic repeated counts and capture-mark-recapture. We found the passive recorders to be effective, with a detection probability of 0.8. Two recording sessions were sufficient to estimate occupancy rates reliably. A minimum of 57 surveyed sites were required to detect a decline of 15% in occupancy between two consecutive monitoring events. Acoustic repeated counts and capture-mark-recapture yielded similar density estimates (1.6 and 1.8 calling males per 100 m2, respectively).

In the past 20 years, amphibian populations have declined dramatically around the world; numbers have decreased catastrophically in protected upland sites throughout the neotropics, usually resulting in the disappearance of over 75% of amphibians at a given site, particularly those species that breed in streams. Most studies of amphibian declines have focused on identifying causes and documenting changes in adult abundance, rather than on their ecological consequences. Here, we review evidence for the potential ecological effects of catastrophic amphibian declines, focusing on neotropical highland streams, where impacts will likely be greatest. Evidence to date suggests that amphibian declines will have large-scale and lasting ecosystem-level effects, including changes in algal community structure and primary production, altered organic matter dynamics, changes in other consumers such as aquatic insects and riparian predators, and reduced energy transfers between streams and riparian habitats. Furthermore, because of habitat and functional differences between larvae and adults in most amphibians, the loss of a single species is akin to losing two species. ¬© The Ecological Society of America.",Review,Scopus,0.675905069,0,0,NA,15,10,0,15,0,5,22,NA

Of the amphibians, salamanders have the highest portion of their species in one of the risk categories, even higher than the frogs. To date there have been few studies that have used recent field data to examine the status of populations of endangered salamanders. In this study we evaluate the current situation of two tiny salamanders, Parvimolge townsendi and Thorius pennatulus, both of which are distributed at intermediate elevations in the mountains of the northern Neotropics and are considered to be critically endangered; the first has been proposed as possibly extinct. By carrying out exhaustive surveys in both historical and potentially suitable sites for these two species, we evaluated their abundance and the characteristics of their habitats, and we estimated their potential geographic distribution. We visited 22 sites, investing 672 person-hours of sampling effort in the surveys, and found 201 P. townsendi salamanders in 11 sites and only 13 T. pennatulus salamanders in 5 sites. Both species were preferentially found in cloud forest fragments that were well conserved or only moderately transformed, and some of the salamanders were found in shade coffee plantations. The potential distribution area of both species is markedly fragmented and we estimate that it has decreased by more than 48%. The results of this study highlight the importance of carrying out exhaustive, systematic field surveys to obtain accurate information about the current situation of critically endangered species, and help us better understand the crisis that amphibians are facing worldwide. ¬© 2012 Sandoval-Comte et al.",Article,Scopus,0.665617123,0,0,NA,10,10,0,10,0,10,15,NA

Quantifying the amount of habitats needed to sustain local animals' populations is a crucial criterion when setting protective buffers to water bodies, especially for amphibians, which depend on these upland habitats for breeding and development. Differences in upland habitat use can emerge among amphibian species with distinct life-history traits, including reproductive-strategy (pond-breeding vs. non-pond breeding anurans), life-stage (adults vs. juveniles), and sex (males vs. females). To date there has been no quantitative study of upland habitat use in the Neotropics, which can provide a baseline for quantifying the amount of upland forested habitats needed to sustain local amphibian populations. We monitored three ponds for over two sampling year using drift fences with pitfall traps to investigate how reproductive-strategy, life-stage, and sex affect anuran upland habitat use in a forest remnant in the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We found no differences in upland habitat use between adult and juvenile anurans. However, we found that although the species richness of pond-breeding and non-pond breeding anurans was similar near wetlands, there was greater abundance of pond-breeding compared to non-pond breeding anurans. We also found a strong difference between the sexes in pond-breeding anurans, with males remaining closer to wetlands than females. Thus, the sex ratio of amphibian populations can be strongly skewed toward males if only small protective terrestrial buffers (50-m) are enforced during land development. Our findings also point to the inadequacy of current Brazilian policies to protect small wetlands and the fauna that depend on them. We recommend that policymakers adjust regulatory criteria to set hierarchical protective buffers around wetlands allowing different levels of land-use intervention. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Article,Scopus,0.652108897,1,1,NA,15,10,1,15,1,10,23,NA

The mountainous region of central Veracruz, Mexico, is considered a priority area for amphibian conservation because of its high level of endemism and the number of threatened species. The original tropical montane cloud forest in the region has been dramatically reduced and fragmented and is now mainly confined to ravines and hillsides. We evaluated the current situation of amphibian diversity in the cloud forest fragments of this region by analyzing species richness and abundance, comparing assemblage structure and species composition, examining the distribution and abundance of threatened species, and identifying the local and landscape variables associated with the observed amphibian diversity. From June to October 2012 we sampled ten forest fragments, investing 944 person-hours of sampling effort. A total of 895 amphibians belonging to 16 species were recorded. Notable differences in species richness, abundance, and assemblage structure between forest fragments were observed. Species composition between pairs of fragments differed by an average of 53%, with the majority (58%) resulting from species replacement and the rest (42%) explained by differences in species richness. Half of the species detected are under threat of extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and although their distribution and abundance varied markedly, there were also ubiquitous and abundant species, along with rare species of restricted distribution. The evident heterogeneity of the ten study sites indicates that to conserve amphibians in a mountainous region such as this one it is necessary to protect groups of fragments which represent the variability of the system. Both individually and together cloud forest fragments are very important to conservation because each remnant is inhabited by several threatened species, some of them at imminent risk of extinction. ¬© 2015 Meza-Parral, Pineda.",Article,Scopus,0.649278088,0,0,NA,5,10,0,5,0,10,6,NA

However, their populations are declining catastrophically in many regions, in part because of a chytrid fungal pathogen. These declines are occurring along a moving disease front in Central America and offer the rare opportunity to quantify the consequences of a sudden, dramatic decline in consumer diversity in a natural system. As part of the Tropical Amphibian Declines in Streams (TADS) project, we examined stream macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and production for 2 y in 4 stream reaches at 2 sites in Panama. One site initially had healthy amphibians but declined during our study (El Cop), and 1 site already had experienced a decline in 1996 (Fortuna). During the 1st y, total macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and production were generally similar among sites and showed no consistent patterns between pre- and post-decline streams. However, during the 2nd y, tadpole densities declined precipitously at El Cop, and total macroinvertebrate production was significantly lower in the El Cop streams than in Fortuna streams. Functional structure differed between sites. Abundance, biomass, and production of filterers generally were higher at Fortuna, and shredders generally were higher at El Cop. However, shredder production declined significantly in both El Cop reaches in the 2nd y as tadpoles declined. Nonmetric dimensional scaling (NMDS) based on abundance and production indicated that assemblages differed between sites, and patterns were linked to variations in relative availability of basal resources. Our results indicate that responses of remaining consumers to amphibian declines might not be evident in coarse metrics (e.g., total abundance and biomass), but functional and assemblage structure responses did occur.

The frog was introduced to a number of South American mainland localities, including French Guiana. Other species of the genus have become invasive on oceanic islands such as Hawaii where they pose serious biological and economical problems. No data are available on the invasion status of E. johnstonei populations from coastal South America. Here we present the first assessment of the status of a mainland population from French Guiana 10 years after the introduction of the species. We found that the species has not spread significantly within the last ten years and so far does not exhibit a high invasion potential. Frogs were restricted to urban garden habitats showing significantly higher abundance in gardens containing ornamental potted plants. Distribution patterns were best explained by two dispersal-related factors operating at different scales: (1) distance of occupied sites to nearest population indicating short-distance active dispersal using stepping stone habitats, and (2) distance of occupied sites to shore with a distinct bimodal pattern indicating long-distance passive or jump-dispersal, most likely due to the exchange or transfer of ornamental plants. Even though past and current invasion potential can be considered low, we advocate the implementation of a regional monitoring scheme and detailed studies on biotic interactions with native fauna. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.627957048,NA,0,NA,NA,10,,,0,10,37,NA

Mammals,' mostly sigmodontine rodents, were the main prey items (91.9%), followed by amphibians (6.5%) and birds (1.6%). Arthropods were also a common prey item (found in 45% of the samples). The consumption of arthropods and amphibians was higher in summer than in winter, indicating that seasonal changes in prey abundances are reflected in the Barn Owl diet. We found no differences in food-niche breadth among the four study districts, but food-niche breadth varied between seasons, being higher during summer. Six rodent species were common to all districts: Calomys spp., Akodon azarae, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Mus musculus, Rattus spp., and Holochilus brasiliensis. Calomys spp. was numerically dominant in 46 of the 49 samples, and together with A. azarae and O. flavescens comprised the bulk of the diet (> 80%).

However, few studies focus on forest edges, created during the fragmentation process, as proximate drivers of the local demographic structure of populations. Here, we use abundance data of amphibians and reptiles to study their responses to forest edges in nine fragmented forested landscapes of the Neotropics. Species-specific abundance data were collected in plots established at varying distances from their respective nearest forest edge. We tested for edge effects on the abundance of species, and used curve clustering techniques to group species with similar edge responses, i.e. species with either increasing or decreasing abundance from the matrix towards the forest interior. We also grouped species that showed no change in abundance with respect to the nearest forest edge and those whose abundance response was unimodal, peaking in either forest habitat or the surrounding matrix habitat. We found that 96% of all amphibians and 90% of all reptiles showed an edge response, with the abundance of 74.5% of amphibians and 57.3% of reptiles decreasing with increasing proximity to forest edges. However, species-specific edge effects were not always consistent, with some species having opposite edge responses when measured in different landscapes. The depth of edge effects exhibited by forest species, i.e. species that increased in abundance in the forest interior, extended up to one kilometre away from forest edges. We show that the median edge effect on forest species extends to 250¬†m within the forest interior, indicating that tropical forest patches with a mean diameter¬†<¬†500¬†m (minimum area¬†‚âà¬†78¬†ha) are unsuitable for half of forest-dependent species considered in this study. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.614293309,0,0,NA,5,15,0,5,0,15,3,NA

Few studies have assessed the role of tadpoles in tropical streams, although they are often abundant and conspicuous components of these systems. Moreover, amphibian populations are declining around the globe, particularly stream-dwelling species in tropical uplands, and the ecological consequences of these losses are not understood. 2. We chose a stream in the central Panamanian highlands, which has an intact fauna of stream-breeding anurans, to examine the ecological consequences of amphibian losses. This site differs dramatically from sites in nearby western Panama and Costa Rica where anuran diversity and abundance have declined greatly in the last two decades. 3. We used an underwater electric field to create tadpole exclosures in runs, so that we could evaluate their influence on sediment dynamics and the abundance and community structure of algae and aquatic insects. Tadpoles reduced total sediments and both organic and inorganic fractions on substrata. Tadpoles also reduced algal abundance on substrata by approximately 50% and decreased algal biovolume. Gut content analyses showed that tadpoles consumed algae and sediments and we could see that algae and sediments were also displaced through bioturbation. 4. Atelopus zeteki, Rana warszewitschii, and Hyla spp. were the dominant larval anurans responsible for the effects observed. Visual surveys indicated that the densities of these taxa ranged from 23 (R. warszewitschii and Hyla spp. combined) to 43 m-2 (A. zeteki) in runs. 5. The abundance of baetid mayflies was lower in tadpole exclosures compared with controls, and this was attributed to tadpoles facilitating mayfly feeding by removing sediments and exposing underlying periphyton. 6. Tadpoles affect the abundance and diversity of basal resources and other primary consumers, and thus influence food web dynamics and energy flow in these tropical streams.

Anuran larvae are important prey in freshwater communities and spatiotemporal variation in risk can arise from changes in the number and identity of predators; however, our understanding of variation in abundance, identity, and foraging rates for natural predator assemblages in tropical pond communities is limited. We surveyed ponds near Gamboa, Panama in 2004 and 2010 to estimate variation in predator communities of tadpoles over space and time.We also conducted short-term predation trials with the 10 most common predators using hatchling tadpoles of two widespread Neotropical frog species, Red-Eyed Treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and Pantless Treefrogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Predator abundance varied nearly threefold across ponds within a single year and as much as 19-fold within a pond across years. Dominant taxa also varied, with backswimmers (Notonectidae), poeciliid fish, or libellulid dragonfly naiads being the most common depending upon pond and year. Predation trials revealed that prey-specific predation rates differed among predator taxa. Some presumed predators did not consume hatchlings, whereas others consumed >90% of prey. The smaller D. ebraccatus hatchlings generally experienced higher predation rates; however, large invertebrate predators like aeshnid dragonfly naiads, giant water bugs, and fishing spiders consumed more A. callidryas.

The road has been closed to vehicle traffic since its construction in 2010. Thus, effects from vehicle mortality, vehicle-related pollution, and road noise were not confounding factors. Herpetofauna were surveyed using both visual encounter surveys and drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps at varying distances from the road. Structural and microclimate features of the forest were measured at each sampling distance. Several habitat variables were found to differ at intermediate and interior sampling distances from the road compared to forest edge conditions, suggesting the road-edge effect began to attenuate by the intermediate sampling distance. However, the edge effect on amphibians and reptiles appeared to extend 100 m from the road edge, as abundance and diversity were significantly greater at the interior forest compared to the forest edge.

Habitat predictor models indicate that amphibian abundance was best predicted by vine abundance, while both vine and mature tree abundance were the best predictors for species richness and diversity. Overall, and contrary to what might otherwise be expected, our results demonstrate that small, little-used road disturbances can nonetheless have profound impacts on wildlife. ¬© Ross J.

Optimal conservation actions ideally rely on basic ecological and natural history data, such as population size, habitat requirements and availability, or biotic interactions. Unfortunately, we lack basic natural history information for most frogs, making it difficult to determine species vulnerability in nature. Our goal in this study was to apply a 'rarity' index to assess whether rarity and other endangerment assessment criteria can serve complementary roles in conservation prioritization. We applied Rabinowitz' ""eight forms of rarity"" classification, which is based on geographic range, habitat specificity, and local population size, to evaluate its value as an indicator of species vulnerability in the anuran assemblage endemic to the Atlantic Coastal Forest of Brazil. We compared patterns of rarity in anurans to IUCN endangerment status, and investigated possible relationships between spatial traits (topographic complexity, elevation, and latitudinal variation) and groups of species with different forms of rarity. We found similar patterns of rarity across taxonomic groups and among local anuran communities, indicating that these patterns are consistent across taxa and geographic scales. We provide evidence that rarity rankings increase in areas of higher elevation and topographic complexity. Our results also indicate that the majority of rare species are classified as threatened according to IUCN; however, 32 species ranked as rare are still considered 'least concern' or 'data deficient' by the current Brazilian red list of threatened species. We propose that including rarity categories in endangerment assessment for anurans can improve our ability to prioritize conservation efforts for threatened amphibian taxa. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.524512799,0,0,NA,15,15,0,15,0,15,17,NA

Several factors contribute separately or jointly to these declines. However, the reduction of an available habitat due to human expansion is still the main cause, and roads are a major mean for this expansion. Both the construction phase and the subsequent use of roads have negative consequences for amphibians. We reviewed the literature on the subject within the Neotropical context. To this end, the paper begins with a summary of recent reviews and proceeds through an analysis of sampling methods used in roadkill studies, mitigation measures and the Neotropical scenario and concludes with several suggestions to guide future studies. More attention will be given to roadkills, which is one of the primary impacts on wildlife that is caused by roads. Even in the Neotropical zone most studies are foot-based, the richness and abundance of amphibians affected are higher in regions outside the Neotropics. One possible explanation is that in the other regions, the proportion of studies exclusively on amphibians is bigger. Regarding mitigation measures, most studies only indicates what should be used, but do not implement or evaluate their effectiveness. ¬© Firenze University Press.",Article,Scopus,0.513020895,NA,0,NA,NA,15,,,0,15,34,NA

Because peccaries are also important agents of disturbance and microhabitat variation in the litter, peccary loss could have important consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles that depend entirely upon the litter for shelter, foraging and reproduction sites, and thermoregulation. However, very little is known about the effects of peccaries or their loss on litter amphibians and reptiles. We experimentally reduced peccary density in 20. √ó. 50. m fenced exclusion plots (. n=. 5). We compared standing litter structure and amphibian and reptile abundance where peccaries were excluded to paired, open-forest control plots that had natural peccary densities. We encountered 16% more amphibian and reptile individuals in open control plots, and we encountered more juveniles of the most common anuran species in control plots than on peccary exclusions. Control plots had more compacted litter than peccary exclusion plots, indicating that peccaries alter the physical structure of the standing leaf litter in a way that promotes greater recruitment of juvenile anurans. Our results demonstrate that peccaries should be viewed not just as seed predators or ecosystem engineers for palms and pond-breeding amphibians, but also as important agents that affect leaf litter structure and abundance of terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. Peccary extirpation from overhunting or habitat degradation could have unexpected negative consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles, a diverse group already severely threatened by habitat loss, climate change, disease, and other anthropogenic effects worldwide. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.508829758,NA,0,NA,NA,15,,,0,15,30,NA

Because environmental contaminants, endocrine disruption, and pathogens often figure prominently in amphibian declines it is imperative that we understand how these factors are potentially interrelated to affect montane populations. One possibility is that increased precipitation associated with global warming promotes the deposition of contaminants in montane regions. Increased exposure to contaminants, in turn, potentially elicits chronic elevations in circulating stress hormones that could contribute to montane population declines by compromising resistance to pathogens and/or production of sex steroids regulating reproduction. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining contaminant levels, stress and sex steroid levels, and nematode abundances in male drab treefrogs, Smilisca sordida, from lowland and montane populations in Costa Rica. We found no evidence that montane populations were more likely to possess contaminants (i.e., organochlorine, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides or benzidine and chlorophenoxy herbicides) than lowland populations. We also found no evidence of elevational differences in circulating levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, estradiol or progesterone. However, montane populations possessed lower androgen levels, hosted more nematode species, and had higher nematode abundances than lowland populations. Although these results suggested that nematodes contributed to lower androgens in montane populations, we were unable to detect a significant inverse relationship between nematode abundance and androgen level. Our results suggest that montane populations of this species are not at greater risk of exposure to contaminants or chronic stress, but implicate nematodes and compromised sex steroid levels as potential threats to montane populations. ¬© 2018 Leary et al.

The abundance and species richness of Neotropical amphibian communities suggest that losses of this magnitude are likely to have strong effects at the ecosystem level. To improve understanding of the implications of their loss we used stable isotope analysis to examine trophic relationships in an ecosystem in which amphibians are dominant in a second-order forest stream at 750 m asl in Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama. We analysed Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and C:N ratios of major biotic components (basal resources, invertebrates, amphibians, fish and reptiles) in the stream and of the adjacent riparian food web. Tadpoles (mean Œ¥15N = 4.49‚Ä∞) and adult amphibians (mean Œ¥15N = 5.45‚Ä∞) were intermediate links in the aquatic and terrestrial food web respectively. High Œ¥15N signatures identified fish as top predators in the aquatic food web and snakes and the toad Bufo as top predators in the terrestrial food web. Isotopic signatures clearly distinguished between trophic groups of tadpoles: microbial feeders (Centrolenidae, Œ¥15N range = 0.91-3.05‚Ä∞), herbivores (Rana and Hyla, Œ¥15N range = 4.74-5.15‚Ä∞) and neuston feeders (Colostethus, Œ¥15N range = 5.31-6.40‚Ä∞). Dependence on autotrophic production was indicated by enriched signatures of carbon isotopes in pool dwellers versus those that reside in faster-flowing sections of the stream. High nitrogen concentrations in detrital matter (average 0.8%, C:N = 10.3) suggested that grazing tadpoles enhanced nitrogen fluxes and improved the quality of organic matter available to detritivores.

Amphibians are also increasingly endangered, due in part to disease-driven threats of extinctions. As an emergency response, conservationists have begun ex situ assurance colonies for priority species. The abundance of cryptic amphibian diversity, however, may cause problems for ex situ conservation. In this study we used a DNA barcoding approach to survey mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in captive populations of 10 species of Neotropical amphibians maintained in an ex situ assurance programme at El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center (EVACC) in the Republic of Panama. We combined these mtDNA sequences with genetic data from presumably conspecific wild populations sampled from across Panama, and applied genetic distance-based and character-based analyses to identify cryptic lineages. We found that three of ten species harboured substantial cryptic genetic diversity within EVACC, and an additional three species harboured cryptic diversity among wild populations, but not in captivity. Ex situ conservation efforts focused on amphibians are therefore vulnerable to an incomplete taxonomy leading to misidentification among cryptic species. DNA barcoding may therefore provide a simple, standardized protocol to identify cryptic diversity readily applicable to any amphibian community. ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.473714088,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,27,NA

Although Bd is present in the Midwestern United States, its history and impact in the region is not known. We used a qPCR assay to determine historic Bd prevalence in Illinois, testing 1028 specimens representing 10 anuran species, collected 1888-1989. We used two complementary sets of samples to first assess historic prevalence with the primary set, and used a secondary set to confirm Bd presence and examine older samples with a more sensitive technique. Prevalence varied among species; in the primary dataset of 1008 samples extracted with PrepMan Ultra collected 1892-1989, Bd was found in four species (11.1%, CI: 9.3-13.2%). Rana (.

It also is unclear by what mechanism(s) B. dendrobatidis has emerged as a pathogenic organism. To test whether B. dendrobatidis is limited by elevation in Panam√°, we sought to determine the prevalence and intensity of B. dendrobatidis in relation to anuran abundance and diversity using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses. Sites were situated at varying elevations, from 45 to 1215 m, and were at varying stages of epizootic amphibian decline, including pre-epizootic, mid-epizootic, 2 years post-epizootic, and 10 years post-epizootic. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was found in all sites regardless of elevation or stage of epizootic decline. Levels of prevalence and infection intensity were comparable across all sites except at the mid-epizootic site, where both prevalence and intensity were significantly higher than at other sites. Symptoms of chytridiomycosis and corresponding declines in amphibian populations were variably seen at all elevations along a post-epizootic gradient. Because it is inherently difficult to prove a negative proposition, it can neither be proven that B. dendrobatidis is truly not present where it is not detected nor proven that it is only recently arrived where it is detected. Thus, there will always be doubts about whether B. dendrobatidis is enzootic or invasive. In any case, our results, coupled with current knowledge, suggest most clearly that the disease, chytridiomycosis, may be novel and invasive, and that the pathogen, B. dendrobatidis either is, or is becoming, globally ubiquitous. ¬© 2011 International Association for Ecology and Health.",Article,Scopus,0.435140334,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,43,NA

We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation. ¬© 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.435009053,1,NA,NA,15,NA,1,10,,,16,NA

Species rarity, in terms of tadpole occupancy and adult relative abundance, did not predict the odds of tadpole occupancy declines. But species losses were taxonomically selective, with glassfrogs (Family: Centrolenidae) disappearing the fastest and tree frogs (Family: Hylidae) and dart-poison frogs (Family: Dendrobatidae) remaining the longest. We detected biotic homogenization of tadpole communities, with post-decline communities resembling one another more strongly than pre-decline communities. The entire tadpole community was extirpated within 22 months following Bd arrival, and we found limited signs of recovery within 10 years post-outbreak. Because of imperfect species detection inherent to sampling species-rich tropical communities and the difficulty of devising a single study design protocol to sample physically complex tropical habitats, we used simulations to provide recommendations for future surveys to adequately sample diverse Neotropical communities. Our unique data set on tadpole community composition before and after Bd arrival is a valuable baseline for assessing amphibian recovery. Our results are of direct relevance to conservation managers and community ecologists interested in understanding the timing, magnitude, and consequences of disease outbreaks as emerging infectious diseases spread globally. ¬© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.40426895,0,NA,"Data on tadpole communities, changed unranked class to 0.",5,NA,0,5,,,8,NA

However, not all regions and species are equally affected. Here, we show that association with amphibian aquatic habitat types (bromeliad phytotelmata versus stream) across Central America results in the odds of being threatened by Bd being five times higher in stream microhabitats. This differential threat of Bd was supported in our study by a significantly lower prevalence of Bd in bromeliad-associated amphibian species compared to riparian species in Honduran cloud forests. Evidence that the bromeliad environment is less favorable for Bd transmission is exemplified by significantly less suitable physicochemical conditions and higher abundance of Bd-ingesting micro-eukaryotes present in bromeliad water. These factors may inhibit aquatic Bd zoospore survival and the development of an environmental reservoir of the pathogen. Bromeliad phytotelmata thus may act as environmental refuges from Bd, which contribute to protecting associated amphibian communities against chytridiomycosis-driven amphibian declines that threaten the nearby riparian communities. ¬© 2017 Blooi et al.

However, some amphibians avoid UV-B radiation when given the opportunity. The strawberry poison dart frog, Oophaga pumilio, is diurnal and males vocalize throughout the day in light gaps under forest canopies that expose them to solar radiation. Previous studies have demonstrated that males calling from high perches are more successful at mating than those at lower perches. We investigated whether frogs at higher perches receive more ultraviolet-B than those calling from lower perches. We also investigated whether frogs on perches receiving relatively low ultraviolet-B levels maintained their positions for longer compared to individuals calling from perches receiving higher levels of ultraviolet-B. Finally, since it has been hypothesized that some animals utilize levels of UV-A as a visual cue to avoid UV-B damage, we artificially elevated ultraviolet-A levels to examine whether males exposed to artificially elevated ultraviolet-A abandoned their perches sooner compared to males exposed to visible light. We found that frogs called from perches receiving low ultraviolet-B regardless of perch height, and that frogs maintain their positions longer on perches receiving low ultraviolet-B compared to perches receiving even slightly higher ultraviolet-B levels. Exposing the frogs to artificially elevated levels of ultraviolet-A radiation caused males to move off of their perches faster than when they were exposed to a control light source. These experiments suggest that ultraviolet radiation plays an important role in frog behavior related to perch selection, even in rainforests where much of the solar radiation is shielded by the forest canopy. ¬© 2012 Kats et al.",Article,Scopus,0.36832605,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,,,19,NA

It remains unclear how the amphibians' skin microbiota is influenced by environmental bacterial reservoirs, host-associated factors such as susceptibility to pathogens, and pathogen presence in tropical amphibians. We sampled skin bacteria from five co-occurring frog species that differ in Bd susceptibility at one Bd-naive site, and sampled one of the non-susceptible species from Bd-endemic and Bd-naive sites in Panama. We hypothesized that skin bacterial communities (1) would be distinct from the surrounding environment regardless of the host habitat, (2) would differ between Bd susceptible and non-susceptible species and (3) would differ on hosts in Bd-naive and Bd-endemic sites. We found that skin bacterial communities were enriched in bacterial taxa that had low relative abundances in the environment. Non-susceptible species had very similar skin bacterial communities that were enriched in particular taxa such as the genera Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Bacterial communities of Craugastor fitzingeri in Bd-endemic sites were less diverse than in the naive site, and differences in community structure across sites were explained by changes in relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa. Our results indicate that skin microbial structure was associated with host susceptibility to Bd and might be associated to the history of Bd presence at different sites. ¬© 2016 International Society for Microbial Ecology.",Article,Scopus,0.346121607,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,25,NA

Here, we measured the species richness, abundance, and community composition of amphibians and reptiles in reference primary forest and mono-dominant plantations of three native tree species (Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, Vochysia guatemalensis) at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northern Costa Rica. Because these plantation species generate markedly different forest-floor habitats, we hypothesized that tree species would support different assemblages of leaf-litter herpetofauna. Primary forest, Virola, and Vochysia supported greater richness of frogs than Pentaclethra. Frog densities were significantly lower in Pentaclethra and Vochysia than in nearby primary forest. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we found Pentaclethra to support significantly different assemblages of frogs and lizards than primary forest reference sites, while Vochysia supported a unique assemblage of frogs. Our results suggest that some tree species plantations can support herpetofaunal assemblages comparable to primary forest in richness, community assembly, and abundance. While herpetofaunal community ecology varies among plantation species, our study provides a compelling example of how plantation landscapes can facilitate the restoration of native fauna on degraded landscapes. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus,0.343379076,0,NA,NA,5,NA,0,5,,,2,NA

Chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd, has caused dramatic population declines and extinctions of amphibians worldwide. Anti-Bd bacteria from amphibian skin have been cultured, and skin bacterial communities have been described through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Here, we present a shotgun metagenomic analysis of skin bacterial communities from a Neotropical frog, Craugastor fitzingeri. We sequenced the metagenome of six frogs from two different sites in Panam√°: three frogs from Soberan√≠a (Sob), a Bd-endemic site, and three frogs from Serran√≠a del Sapo (Sapo), a Bd-na√Øve site. We described the taxonomic composition of skin microbiomes and found that Pseudomonas was a major component of these communities. We also identified that Sob communities were enriched in Actinobacteria while Sapo communities were enriched in Gammaproteobacteria. We described gene abundances within the main functional classes and found genes enriched either in Sapo or Sob. We then focused our study on five functional classes of genes: biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, membrane transport, cellular communication and antimicrobial drug resistance. These gene classes are potentially involved in bacterial communication, bacterial-host and bacterial-pathogen interactions among other functions. We found that C. fitzingeri metagenomes have a wide array of genes that code for secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and bacterial toxins, which may be involved in bacterial communication, but could also have a defensive role against pathogens. Several genes involved in bacterial communication and bacterial-host interactions, such as biofilm formation and bacterial secretion systems were found. We identified specific genes and pathways enriched at the different sites and determined that gene co-occurrence networks differed between sites. Our results suggest that skin microbiomes are composed of distinct bacterial taxa with a wide range of metabolic capabilities involved in bacterial defense and communication. Differences in taxonomic composition and pathway enrichments suggest that skin microbiomes from different sites have unique functional properties. This study strongly supports the need for shotgun metagenomic analyses to describe the functional capacities of skin microbiomes and to tease apart their role in host defense against pathogens. ¬© 2018 Rebollar, Guti√©rrez-Preciado, Noecker, Eng, Hughey, Medina, Walke, Borenstein, Jensen, Belden and Harris.",Article,Scopus,0.173273603,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,41,NA
