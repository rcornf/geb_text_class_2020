We report on a 20-year mark-recapture investigation (1991‚Äì2010) of the distribution and density of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change (Œª) of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern Arizona, USA. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding territories, representing approximately 87% of an estimated 144 total territories based on a mean distance of 3.8 km between territory centers in a 1,728-km2 study area. The salient demographic feature of the population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs, brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a current year ranged from 8% to 86% (x = 37%, SE = 4.51), annual mean nest failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12% to 48% (overall (x) = 23%, SE = 2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful nests (fledged ‚â•1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall x = 2.0 young, SE = 0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey abundance. The best breeding years (1992‚Äì1993, 77‚Äì87% of pairs laid eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8% of pairs laid eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success was 83% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling sex ratio did not differ from unity (53% M; n = 410 M, 366 F) but was significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year. Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations, suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex. Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population averaged 43% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years of study (1999‚Äì2010), an estimated 46% of breeding recruits were locally born and 54% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes. Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged ‚â•4 years based on plumage at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of Œª for breeding adults (M, 0.94, SE = 0.037; F, 0.98, SE = 0.038) provided only weak evidence for a population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top survival model, models including age + sex were competitive, evidencing lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the occurrence of sex effects in the top Œª model. Lower male survival may result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more frequent production (53%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770 ha (equal to 3 goshawk territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires burned another 30,945 ha during our study and killed most (&gt;64%) of the forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult Œª estimates overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the 20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists, especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire. ¬© 2017 The Wildlife Society. ¬© The Wildlife Society, 2017",Article,Scopus,0.929213176,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,43,NA

In this study, long-term data are presented on the occurrence of shorebirds at one such site on the coast of the state of Sergipe in northeastem Brazil. A 5-km long stretch of Atalaia Beach was surveyed each month between July 2003 and May 2006 (1-6 surveys per month, total = 101). The surveys resulted in records of three resident shorebird species (Vanellus chilensis, Charadrius collaris and Charadrius wilsonia) and ten Nearctic migrants (Charadriidae and Scolopacidae). The local abundance of these migrants followed a predictable pattern, with the main influx starting at the end of September, during the boreal autumn (with Charadrius semipalmatus arriving slightly earlier). The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and the Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) were the most abundant species throughout the study period, peaking at 1200 and 700 birds, respectively, in November-February. Some sanderlings (Calidris alba). Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), and Semipalmated plovers (C. semipalmatus) almost certainly overwinter at the site, and remained in the study area throughout the year, whereas the bimodal distribution of the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) indicates the use of the beach as a stopover during migration to wintering sites further south. Whilst more species were recorded during the first year, counts were lower than in subsequent years, possibly reflecting natural fluctuations in abundance or migration patterns. Overall, the data indicate that the site may be an important stopover or wintering site for populations of at least five species of Nearctic migrants, while it may be visited periodically by a number of other species. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.857401897,1,1,NA,10,5,1,5,11,NA

Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ¬± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ¬± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ¬± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ¬± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ¬± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ¬± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ¬± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ¬± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6. Additional data from multiple species, especially measures of habitat-specific demography and dispersal, will improve our understanding of the relative impacts of the breeding, migratory, and winter periods on population dynamics of migratory birds and thus enhance future conservation efforts.",Article,Scopus,0.84251267,NA,?,Survival?,NA,5,?,5,30,NA

In 1975 and 1976, ground surveys of breeding birds were undertaken in the Rasmussen Lowlands, Northwest Territories. We carried out similar censuses in the same area during the summers of 1994 and 1995. Weather conditions and methods were very similar during the two sets of surveys. For all years, we compared densities in different habitat types, as well as estimates for the entire region of total numbers of breeding Red Phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicaria), Pectoral Sandpipers, (Calidris melanotos), White-rumped Sandpipers (C. fuscicollis), Semipalmated Sandpipers (C. pusilla), Black-bellied Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), American Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica), Dunlin (C. alpina), Baird's Sandpipers (C. bairdii), and King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis). We found that breeding populations of Red Phalaropes, Black-bellied Plovers, American Golden-Plovers, and King Eiders in the 1990s had decreased substantially (7687%) from their numbers in the 1970s. Numbers of other shorebird species did not decrease significantly (1748%). Numbers of Black-bellied Plovers have apparently decreased at staging sites on the east coast of the United States and Canada. However, for American Golden-Plovers, there is no evidence of a decline on the east coast or in at least one other area in the eastern Nearctic. No other population information exists for Red Phalaropes breeding in the eastern Nearctic. Eider numbers appear to be decreasing throughout the Arctic. Possible reasons for declines are habitat changes in migratory staging sites and southern wintering areas. We need more consistent monitoring of arctic shorebirds in order to identify species with continual population declines. Further studies should emphasize Nearctic populations of species showing substantial declines in this study, examining consistency of decreases throughout the Nearctic, and reasons for such changes.",Article,Scopus,0.830093591,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,32,1

This information is lacking for many species of conservation concern because of the inherent difficulties associated with implementing mark-recapture studies at large spatial scales. The golden-winged warbler Vermivora chrysoptera is a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird experiencing a long-term population decline; yet no information about non-breeding season habitat quality or habitat selection exists to inform conservation efforts. We used a novel hierarchical model that requires only spatially and temporally replicated count data to estimate habitat-specific abundance, apparent survival, recruitment and detection probability of golden-winged warblers wintering in Costa Rica. We quantified habitat selection at the home-range level using radiotelemetry. Golden-winged warblers were absent from tropical dry forest and were most abundant in premontane evergreen forest. Within their home ranges, golden-winged warblers selected microhabitat features associated with intermediate disturbance that reflected their preference for foraging in hanging dead leaves. Consistent with other evidence of a declining population, local population size decreased over the duration of the study. The rate of decrease was higher during the non-breeding season than among seasons. We found no differences in apparent survival or recruitment among habitat types; however, our estimates of these parameters were imprecise. Synthesis and applications. Golden-winged warblers are forest-dependent species during the non-breeding season and have specialized microhabitat requirements that make them vulnerable to ongoing tropical deforestation. However, advanced secondary forests can provide the requisite microhabitat features, and because we found no evidence of reduced survival in this habitat type, regenerating forest on degraded lands may be an effective component of a conservation strategy for this species. Our study also demonstrates that information on population dynamics and habitat quality can be obtained using repeated counts instead of mark-recapture methods. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

Compared to other sites within the region, this area showed high species richness, reflected by a total of 22 species recorded within a relatively short time frame. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by the use of estuarine mudflats and oceanic sandy beaches as feeding habitats. During low tide, more species used estuarine environments, achieving the highest total densities. Abundance patterns and assemblage composition also changed seasonally. Maximum total abundance occurred during the austral summer, and minimum total abundance during the austral winter. During the austral summer, the assemblage was dominated by Nearctic migrants such as American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica) and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). In addition, Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus) and American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) were abundant during the austral autumn.

We analyzed stable hydrogen isotopic compositions in tail feathers (Œ¥Dw) collected from 26 sites in 11 countries throughout the wintering range of the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), a Nearctic- Neotropical migratory passerine bird. Feathers were assumed to have molted on the breeding grounds, and Œ¥Dw was used to estimate breeding origin. Values of Œ¥Dw were highly correlated with longitude of sampling location, indicating that breeding populations were generally distributed along the east-west axis of the wintering grounds. Within the Caribbean region, Florida, and Bahamas, Œ¥Dw values were negatively correlated with winter latitude, which suggests that American Redstarts exhibit a pattern of chain migration in which individuals wintering at northern latitudes are also the most northern breeders. To identify the most probable breeding regions, we used a likelihood-assignment test incorporated with a prior probability of breeding abundance using Bayes's rule. Expected Œ¥D values of feathers from five breeding regions were based on interpolated Œ¥D values from a model of continent-wide growing-season Œ¥D values in precipitation (Œ¥Dp) and were adjusted to account for a discrimination factor between precipitation and feathers. At most wintering locations, breeding assignments were significantly different from expected frequencies based on relative breeding abundance. Birds wintering in eastern and western Mexico had a high probability of breeding in northwest and midwest North America, whereas birds in the Greater and Lesser Antilles were likely to have originated from breeding regions in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Migratory connectivity, such as we report here, implies that the dynamics of breeding and nonbreeding populations may be linked at a regional scale. These results provide a key opportunity for studying the year-round ecology and evolution of spatially connected populations in a migratory species. ¬© The American Ornithologists' Union 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.735613152,0,0,NA,10,5,0,5,14,NA

This issue is especially urgent in tropical coastal wetlands that support large concentrations of migratory shorebird populations and are under pressure from development. Here we evaluated the species composition, abundance, and habitat use of Nearctic migratory shorebirds using recently harvested aquaculture ponds during two non-breeding seasons at shrimp farms surrounding Bah√≠a Santa Mar√≠a (BSM), northwestern Mexico. We also estimated shorebird densities at intertidal units in BSM during and after the harvesting season to explore the connectivity with shrimp farms. Over 25,000 individuals of 25 shorebird species used the surveyed farms (1/413% of shrimp-farm development in BSM; 2014-2015: 10 farms, 994 ha; 2015-2016: 8 farms, 924 ha) during the harvest season. The most abundant species were: Western Sandpiper Calidris mauri, Willet Tringa semipalmata, Marbled Godwit Limosa fedoa, dowitchers Limnodromus spp., Black-necked Stilt Himantopus mexicanus and American Avocet Recurvirostra americana. Numbers of birds decreased as the harvest cycle progressed. Most birds (> 70%) were foraging on the ponds, regardless of tidal stage, while numbers increased during high tide for the most abundant species. At surveyed intertidal areas, shorebird densities were overall similar within and between non-breeding seasons. These results indicate that shrimp farms offer ephemeral but consistent foraging habitats used by non-breeding shorebirds, even in vast coastal wetlands offering a high availability of natural intertidal mudflats. Assuming a similar shorebird use in other shrimp ponds not surveyed within BSM, a significant proportion (> 1% of the biogeographic population) of Willet, Marbled Godwit, and Western Sandpiper, as well as imperilled Red Knot Calidris canutus, might use shrimp farms throughout the harvesting season. Before including current semi-intensive shrimp farms within management plans of BSM, further research is mandatory to assess their utility as alternative foraging habitats for shorebird conservation at tropical areas.

However, the mechanisms that produce density-dependent feedbacks on demographic rates and thus regulate these populations are poorly understood, particularly for migratory species. We conducted a three-year density-reduction experiment to investigate the behavioral mechanisms that regulate the abundance of a Nearctic-Neotropical migrant passerine, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), during the breeding season. We found that the number of young fledged per territory, territory size, and the proportion of time males spent foraging were significantly greater on territories around which neighbor density was experimentally reduced compared to control territories. Territory quality, proportion of nests depredated per territory, and male countersinging rates were not statistically different between treatments. These results indicate that individuals with more neighbors (i.e., in neighborhoods with greater conspecific density) have reduced breeding productivity. The results also suggest that a crowding mechanism that mediates interactions among territory-holders could generate the density dependence needed to regulate local abundance, at least in areas of homogeneous, high-quality habitat. The effect of the neighbor-density reduction on warbler fecundity and behavior varied with annual fluctuations in weather and food availability, and was strongest in 1997, an El Ni√±o year, when conditions for breeding were least favorable. This variation in our experimental results among years implies that density dependence due to crowding may have its strongest impact on local abundance when environmental conditions are relatively poor.",Article,Scopus,0.723639417,?,?,Control?,5,10,?,5,9,NA

Nearctic brant, in contrast to most geese, rely on marine habitats and native intertidal plants during the non-breeding season, particularly the seagrass, Zostera, and the macroalgae, Ulva. Atlantic and Eastern High Arctic brant have experienced the greatest degradation of their winter habitats (northeastern United States and Ireland, respectively) and have also shown the most plasticity in feeding behavior. Black and Western High Arctic brant of the Pacific Flyway are the most dependent on Zostera, and are undergoing a shift in winter distribution that is likely related to climate change and its associated effects on Zostera dynamics. Variation in breeding propensity of Black Brant associated with winter location and climate strongly suggests that food abundance on the wintering grounds directly affects reproductive performance in these geese. In summer, salt marshes, especially those containing Carex and Puccinellia, are key habitats for raising young, while lake shorelines with fine freshwater grasses and sedges are important for molting birds. Availability and abundance of salt marshes has a direct effect on growth and recruitment of goslings and ultimately, plays an important role in regulating size of local brant populations. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.693381625,0,0,NA,5,10,0,10,10,NA

The fate of migratory birds has been a concern stimulating research over the past 40 years in response to population declines documented in long-term studies including those of the IITF and collaborators in Puerto Rico's Gu√°nica dry forest. Various studies indicate that in addition to forest loss or fragmentation, some migrant declines may be due to rainfall variation, the consequences of which may carry over from one stage of a migrant's annual cycle to another. For example, the Gu√°nica studies indicate that rainfall extremes on either the temperate breeding or tropical wintering grounds affect migrant abundance and survival differently depending on the species. In contrast, IITF's collaborative studies of the migrant Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) in the Bahamas found that late winter droughts affect its annual survival and breeding success in Michigan. We review these IITF migrant studies and relate them to other studies, which have improved our understanding of migrant ecology of relevance to conservation. Particularly important is the advent of the full annual cycle (FAC) approach. The FAC will facilitate future identification and mitigation of limiting factors contributing to migrant population declines, which for some species, may be exacerbated by global climate change. ¬© 2017 by the authors.",Article,Scopus,0.684734863,NA,1,NA,NA,10,1,10,24,NA

Surveys were conducted in December 2000, and January and February 2001, using line-transect methods. The data were classified based on five previously defined coastal landscapes. Fifty four localities were surveyed covering 93 kilometers of coastline. A total of 44 waterbird species corresponding to 13 families were recorded.

The analyses of weekly counts resulted in a detailed phenology of use of the area by shorebirds. Five species were resident and ten were Nearctic migrants. Several of the latter had clear peaks in numbers in March and October, revealing the use of the bay as a stopover during both the north-bound and south-bound migration flows. A canonical correspondence analysis of the relationship between environmental parameters and bird numbers indicated that the foraging bird assemblage could be divided into five main groups, occupying distinct ecological gradients in the study area.

Here, we present species richness and densities of migratory landbirds obtained through standardized census and captures along an elevation gradient (100-2,100 m) covering two habitats, forest and shade coffee, during two consecutive spring migrations. The migrant community (~39 species) showed a peak in species richness and abundance at mid elevations (700-1,700 m), mirroring the pattern often observed in communities of resident Neotropical birds.

We also found within-species differences in density between shade-coffee and forest at the same elevation, possibly reflecting differences in habitat quality for some species. Factors such as food availability and predation risk are expected to be critical in shaping the distribution of migrants during stopover, and further research is required to identify the drivers of the observed elevational patterns.

Migratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea-regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range. Conclusions/Significance. We demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms. ¬© 2007 Martin et al.",Article,Scopus,0.631360257,NA,0,NA,NA,15,0,15,28,NA

To evaluate how this single-species management focus might fit within an ecologically based management approach for multiple forest birds, we performed a manipulative experiment using four treatments (three intensities of timber harvests and an unharvested control) at each of seven study areas within the core Cerulean Warbler breeding range. We collected pre-harvest (one year) and post-harvest (four years) data on the territory density of Cerulean Warblers and six additional focal species, avian community relative abundance, and several key habitat variables. We evaluated the avian and habitat responses across the 3-32m2ha-1 residual basal area (RBA) range of the treatments. Cerulean Warbler territory density peaked with medium RBA (~16m2ha-1). In contrast, territory densities of the other focal species were negatively related to RBA (e.g., Hooded Warbler [Setophaga citrina]), were positively related to RBA (e.g., Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]), or were not sensitive to this measure (Scarlet Tanager [Piranga olivacea]). Some species (e.g., Hooded Warbler) increased with time post-treatment and were likely tied to a developing understory, whereas declines (e.g., Ovenbird) were immediate. Relative abundance responses of additional species were consistent with the territory density responses of the focal species. Across the RBA gradient, greatest separation in the avian community was between early successional forest species (e.g., Yellow-breasted Chat [Icteria virens]) and closed-canopy mature forest species (e.g., Ovenbird), with the Cerulean Warbler and other species located intermediate to these two extremes. Overall, our results suggest that harvests within 10-20m2ha-1 RBA yield the largest increases in Cerulean Warblers, benefit additional disturbance-dependent species, and may retain closed-canopy species but at reduced levels. Harvests outside the optimum RBA range for Cerulean Warblers can support bird assemblages specifically associated with early or late (closed-canopy) successional stages. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.620047639,1,1,experimental management but control also present,5,15,1,15,7,NA

Using three canopy towers located in primary terra firme forests, I conducted 117 censuses over a 13 month period, recording 160 bird species. The three study sites had similar species richness (between 126 and 128 species), sharing 95 species in common, which accounted for >90% of all individual records. Most species recorded in the canopy (110) belonged to the core canopy avifauna. The other 50 species included migrants (13), species that feed overhead (8), species from lower strata (15), night birds (3), and vagrants or visitors from open areas and second-growth forests (11). Most of those species, however, appeared in very low numbers in the forest canopy, except understory frugivores, which regularly fed on canopy fruits. Among the migratory species were some Nearctic (6), Austral (3), and species probably holding both migratory and resident populations in the area (4). Additionally, I found evidence that two species of parrots perform seasonal movements, leaving the forest canopy around Manaus during the dry season. Frugivores dominated the canopy avifauna in abundance, but contradicting results reported from other Neotropical forest canopies, insectivores and frugivores had equal species richness. The canopy avifauna was highly homogeneous among sites in terms of species richness, distribution among abundance classes, and number of species in each feeding guild, habitat, and microhabitat. As in Costa Rica, the canopy avifauna of Manaus was mostly composed by typical canopy bird species, and not by edge-living species as reported from Panama.

Temperate zone species showed reduced nucleotide diversity in comparison to tropical mainland species, suggesting that the latter have long-term effective population sizes due to population bottleneck effects during the most recent glaciation. This hypothesis was further supported by evidence of an unusually high estimated rate of population growth in species breeding in North America and wintering in the New World tropics (Nearctic migrants), consistent with population expansion after a bottleneck. Nearctic migrants also showed evidence of an abundance of rare nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) polymorphisms, a pattern suggesting that slightly deleterious polymorphisms drifted to high frequencies during a bottleneck and are now being eliminated by selection. Because the shape of the North American land mass limited the area available for refugia during glaciation, the bottleneck effects are predicted to have been particularly strong in Nearctic migrants, and this prediction was supported. The reduced genetic diversity of Nearctic migrants provides an additional basis for concern for the survival of these species, which are threatened by loss of habitat in the winter range and by introduced disease. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.615138295,0,0,NA,5,15,0,15,8,NA

The purpose of this study was to assess the geographic pattern in the abundance, species richness, and importance of different migration patterns of the boreal forest avifauna of Eurasia from Europe to East Asia as well as their relationship to climate and forest productivity. We further examine data from two widely separated sites in the New World to see how these conform to the patterns found in the Eurasian system. Location: Boreal forest sites in Russia and Canada. Methods: Point counts were conducted in two to four boreal forest habitats at each of 14 sites in the Russian boreal forest from near to the Finnish border to the Far East, as well as at two sites in boreal Canada. We examined the abundance and species richness of all birds, and specific migratory classes, against four gradients (climate, primary productivity, latitude, and longitude). We tested for spatial autocorrelation in both dependent and independent variables using Moran's I to develop spatial correlograms. For each migratory class we used maximum likelihood to fit models, first assuming uncorrelated residuals and then assuming spatially autocorrelated residuals. For models assuming unstructured residuals we again generated correlograms on model residuals to determine whether model fitting removed spatial autocorrelation. Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion, adjusted for small sample size. Results: Overall abundance was highest at the eastern and western extremes of the survey region and lowest at the continent centre, whereas the abundance of tropical and short-distance migrants displayed an east-west gradient, with tropical migrants increasing in abundance in the east (and south), and short-distance migrants in the west. Although overall species richness showed no geographic pattern, richness within migratory classes showed patterns weaker than, but similar to, their abundance patterns described above. Overall abundance was correlated with climate variables that relate to continentality. The abundances of birds within different migration strategies were correlated with a second climatic gradient - increasing precipitation from west to east. Models using descriptors of location generally had greater explanatory value for the abundance and species-richness response variables than did those based on climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Main conclusions: The distribution patterns for migrant types were related to both climatic and locational variables, and thus the patterns could be explained by either climatic regime or the accessibility of winter habitats, both historically and currently. Non-boreal wintering habitat is more accessible from both the western and eastern ends than from the centre of the boreal forest belt, but the tropics are most accessible from the eastern end of the Palaearctic boreal zone, in terms of distance and the absence of geographical barriers. Based on comparisons with Canadian sites, we recommend that future comparative studies between Palaearctic and Nearctic faunas be focused more on Siberia and the Russian Far East, as well as on central and western Canada.",Article,Scopus,0.598347449,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,19,NA

We believe that a multi-scale approach is essential to assess the influence of factors that control en route habitat use. We determined the relative importance of eight variables, each operating at a habitat-patch, landscape, or regional spatial scale, in explaining the differential use of hardwood forests by Nearctic-Neotropical land birds during migration. We estimated bird densities through transect surveys at sites near the Mississippi coast during spring and autumn migration within landscapes with variable amounts of hardwood forest cover. At a regional scale, migrant density increased with proximity to the coast, which was of moderate importance in explaining bird densities, probably due to constraints imposed on migrants when negotiating the Gulf of Mexico. The amount of hardwood forest cover at a landscape scale was positively correlated with arthropod abundance and had the greatest importance in explaining densities of all migrants, as a group, during spring, and of insectivorous migrants during autumn. Among landscape scales ranging from 500 m to 10 km radius, the densities of migrants were, on average, most strongly and positively related to the amount of hardwood forest cover within a 5 km radius. We suggest that hardwood forest cover at this scale may be an indicator of habitat quality that migrants use as a cue when landing at the end of a migratory flight. At the patch scale, direct measures of arthropod abundance and plant community composition were also important in explaining migrant densities, whereas habitat structure was of little importance. The relative amount of fleshy-fruited trees was positively related and was the most important variable explaining frugivorous migrant density during autumn. Although constraints extrinsic to habitat had a moderate role in explaining migrant distributions, our results are consistent with the view that food availability is the ultimate factor shaping the distributions of birds during stopover. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.589053452,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,29,NA

Consensually, 14 owl species have been registered for the country, with representatives of both Nearctic and Neotropical avifauna. In addition to the incomplete knowledge of their distribution, nothing is known about the biology and ecology of the species in the country. Most owls in Nicaragua are typical of the forested areas that cover more than 40% of the total land area. This is the most threatened habitat due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier and pressure from human displacement into forested areas. In order to conserve biodiversity in general, Nicaragua has a system of protected areas (SINAP), including three important biosphere reserves. No species of owl found in Nicaragua is endemic or classified as globally at risk. However, we feel that an assessment of the conservation status of each species at a local level is needed. This requires a more detailed study of their distribution, but also an estimation of their abundance and the status of their populations, and habitat requirements and other aspects of their biology. ¬© Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Book Chapter,Scopus,0.588915221,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,36,NA

In 1993-94, we studied the short-term effects of uneven-aged forest management on bird communities in oak-hickory forests of north western Arkansas. We estimated bird abundance in mature forests and on managed plots receiving either a heavy cutting of understory vegetation (understory treatment) or a combination of both understory cutting and selective cutting in the forest overstory (full treatment). Two nesting guilds and 7 of 14 species with adequate sample size showed significant treatment effects. Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), and the understory-nesting guild were most abundant in mature forest.

Our results suggest that if removal of understory vegetation was practiced widely in the Arkansas Ozarks as part of uneven-aged management, populations of some ground- and shrub-nesting forest interior species of birds could be negatively affected, whereas a few forest canopy and edge species may respond positively. Future research on this type of uneven-aged management should examine effects of removing varying amounts of understory vegetation on both forest interior bird populations and forest regeneration.",Article,Scopus,0.581565446,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,35,NA

Outcomes of this intersexual competition can vary by species and habitat, but information has been collected for only a small subset of migrant species. We investigated the available food resources, sex ratios, and body condition of territorial Bicknell's Thrushes (Catharus bicknelli) wintering in the Dominican Republic between 1999 and 2008 at two ecologically distinct wet-forest sites, one in high-elevation cloud forest and the other in mid-elevation rainforest. Arthropod abundance was greater in cloud forest habitat, which was occupied by proportionally more males, the larger-bodied sex (74% male). By contrast, both sexes occurred at parity in rainforest habitat (53% male), where soft-bodied fruit was the predominant dietary resource. Body condition of cloud forest males was comparable to that of rainforest males, but cloud forest females were in poorer body condition than rainforest females. Females at the cloud forest site may face a greater likelihood of agonistic interactions with larger-bodied males and the thermoregulatory demands of roosting in colder night temperatures (0-12¬∞C). We suggest that there are sex-specific advantages of wintering in these two habitats and that both are critical to supporting the full demographic structure of Bicknell's Thrush populations. Rainforest habitats, which are highly vulnerable to agricultural development in the Dominican Republic, may be particularly important to female survival during the winter period. ¬© The American Ornithologists' Union, 2012.",Article,Scopus,0.574590996,1,NA,NA,15,NA,,,22,NA

We asked whether migrants and residents affect each other's ability to forage at army ant raids. We quantified variation in raid attendance by three guilds of birds: wintering migrants, regular and obligate raid attending residents (ant-following residents), and facultative raid attending residents. To test whether wintering migrants and residents were negatively associated at raids, we collected data on raid attendance in four adjacent life zones in the Tilar√°n Mountains of Costa Rica and in different seasons (when migrants were present and absent). We first compared the guilds' raid attendance among life zones. There was little geographic overlap of migrants and ant-following residents at raids, and raid attendance frequencies were strongly correlated with the estimated local abundances of these bird guilds in each life zone. We then analyzed resident bird flock size and species makeup in the life zones where migrants attended raids most often (Premontane and Lower Montane Wet forests). If migrants affected raid attendance by facultative resident birds, we expected resident numbers or species richness at raids to decrease with migrant presence. Resident flock size and species richness did not differ between times of year with and without migrants, and species identities differed little between seasons. Furthermore, resident flock composition in migrant presence season was similar at raids with and without migrants. We conclude migrants had no measurable effect on resident bird army ant exploitation. Migrants were smaller on average and less likely than residents to capture prey from the ground at raids.

The main purpose of this paper was to advance into the knowledge of the ecological features that allow those species to survive in urban environments and to identify which sets of characters enhance the risk of local extinction. Location: Puebla-Cholula Conurbation (PCC), in M√©xico, a developing country between the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions. Methods: First, 355 qualitative point counts (Echantillonnage Frecuentiels Progressifs) were performed in 21 green areas of the PCC to determine the regional distribution and local abundance of 51 species. Then, groups of species were formed through multivariate cluster analysis as a function of their similarity in distribution and abundance. Finally, bird species were characterized (body length, body mass, type of diet and migration status) and multivariate clusters were analyzed to look for differences between groups (through Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA), and also with the avifauna from evergreen oak forest communities described in the literature. Results: Regional distribution of great-tailed grackle, house finch and house sparrow were maximal, since they were found in all the 21 study areas; local abundances of these species, plus those of inca dove and rock dove, were also high (incidence > 50 %). Regional distribution of seven species (like acorn woodpecker, townsend's warbler or rose-breasted grosbeak) was minimal, since they were located in just one site; and six species exhibited very low local abundances (incidence < 5 %). Cluster analysis formed 3 groups. The abovementioned 5 species with the largest distribution and abundance were included in Group #1, typically urban: thus, the most common species, urban exploiters, were mainly granivorous, resident and had a body size larger than all the remaining species. Urban avoiders (Group #3: ""rare"" species, with a small regional distribution and local abundance) were mainly insectivorous, included resident, wintering and transient species, and had the smallest body size. Conclusions: Classification analysis formed three groups of species, similar to those described in the literature of developed countries in temperate latitudes. Ecological features of urban exploiters are not the same than those of ""rare"" species, neither than those of the bird fauna from natural forest communities. If urban growth keeps provoking the conversion of natural forest habitats into urban environments, green urban areas most likely could not maintain viable populations of many of these bird species.",Article,Scopus,0.544789559,0,NA,NA,10,NA,,,16,NA

(3) Co-occurrence of migrant species is facilitated by geographic and habitat allopatry, varying levels of ecological distinctness, sparse dispersal, and, sometimes, intraspecific spatial separation of sexes and age-groups. (4) Migrant-resident co-occurrence is facilitated by high proportions of the two belonging to different taxonomic and ecological groups and, within families, partial feeding zone and habitat segregation. All, however, draw on a common food pool. Too little is known about the winter food support base, differential habitat utilizations, species abundances, and biological needs, either to gauge whether interspecific competition has been a major evolutionary factor, or to differentially predict the efforts of future deleterious habitat change. In two appendixes, the Nearctic-Neotropical, Palearctic-African, and Asian migration systems are compared, and data pertaining to current population trends in Neotropical migrants are compiled. ¬© 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus,0.535370733,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,40,NA

We attempt to determine how these migrants integrate into the resident bird community based on local food abundance and diet comparison between resident and migrant species. At our study site, migrants are most numerous during migration periods, especially in October when abundance of arthropods is low and fruits are plentiful. Migrants feed equally on fruits during both migrations, but overall depend more on an invertebrate diet. Actually, migrants feed extensively on a few invertebrate taxa that are mostly of two types: (1) small hard-bodied foliage-dwelling insects such as beetles and ants, which are of low nutritional value; and (2) invertebrates well known for producing distasteful or toxic chemicals, such as nonflying termites, millipedes, and centipedes. In contrast, the resident species feed more extensively on invertebrates of higher nutritional value (spiders, insect pupae, alate ants) and on large prey that are plentiful at tropical latitudes (orthopterans, lizards). Dietary relationships among species show that diet of migrants overlap little with that of resident species, even those with which they share a similar foraging substrate. However, unlike residents, migrants belonging to the same foraging guild have a highly similar diet. These results suggest that past competitive interactions between migrants and residents were more important than the ones among migratory species in determining food - selection by migrants. Whether the resulting high potential for competition among migrants is related to the short stay of most species at our study site or is a characteristic of several migrant populations at tropical latitudes needs further investigation.",Article,Scopus,0.526792037,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,34,NA

In this study we used linear models to examine the habitat use of 11 migrant species in northeastern Costa Rica to better understand the influence of food and structural resources on the presence of birds during stopover periods. Our models indicated that frugivorous migrants primarily used food abundance, while insectivorous migrants chiefly used vegetation structure as cues for habitat use during stopover. In addition to habitat use models, we documented fruiting plant phenology and found a general relationship between migrant arrival and the timing of ripe fruit availability. Our results suggest that insectivorous migrants probably rely on structural features when using habitat because it may be inherently difficult to assess cryptic-arthropod availability during a short period of time in a novel habitat, such as stopover periods.",Article,Scopus,0.520383093,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,37,NA

The richest and most diverse helminth communities were found in the native carnivorous goodeid Alloophorus robustus. In general, the helminth communities in the different fish species were not particularly species rich and the parasite assemblages were numerically dominated by larvae of the bird trematode, Posthodiplostomum minimum. Patterns of helminth community richness and diversity were similar to those previously observed in north-temperate freshwater fishes. Most enteric helminths occurred with low abundance and only a small proportion of the gut helminth communities was numerically dominated by any one species. Helminths dominating their enteric communities showed some level of host specificity. Helminth communities in carnivorous fish species were generally richer than those in herbivores and detritivores, with the exception of the predominantly herbivorous Goodea atripinnis. The helminth fauna of introduced fishes, Cyprinus carpio, Micropterus salmoides and Oreochromis niloticus, consisted of either few or no host-specific adult helminth(s) translocated from their original geographical areas and by larval stages of helminths of piscivorous birds. Based on the geological history of the area and the biogeography of the endemic fish fauna, it is hypothesized that host-switching and relationships with the nearctic fauna have been fundamental in determining the helminth fauna of the endemic fish hosts.

Using discriminant function analysis on paired sites we were able to distinguish foliage-gleaning species from the Nearctic and Palaearctic with few misclassifications. The two variables that most consistently distinguished species of the two avifaunas were the percentage use of conifer foliage and the percentage use of all foliage. Nearctic foliage-gleaner assemblages had more species that foraged predominantly from coniferous foliage and displayed a greater tendency to forage from foliage, both coniferous and broad-leafed, rather than twigs, branches, or other substrates. The greater specialization on foliage and, in particular, conifer foliage by New World canopy foliage insectivores is consistent with previously proposed hypotheses regarding the role of Pleistocene vegetation history on ecological generalization of Eurasian species. Boreal forest, composed primarily of spruce and pine, was widespread in eastern North America, whereas pockets of forest were scattered in Eurasia (mostly the mountains of southern Europe and Asia). This may have affected the populations of birds directly or indirectly through reduction in the diversity and abundance of defoliating outbreak insects. Loss of habitat and resources may have selected against ecological specialization on these habitats and resources.",Article,Scopus,0.460861398,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,38,NA

In this region coffee is grown under either the canopy of natural forest or under a planted canopy dominated by Inga spp. Despite the large differences in diversity of dominant plant species, both planted and rustic shade coffee plantations support a high overall diversity of bird species; we recorded approximately 105 species in each plantation type on fixed radius point counts. We accumulated a combined species list of 180 species on repeatedly surveyed transects through both coffee plantation types. These values are exceeded regionally only by moist tropical forest. Of the habitats surveyed, shade coffee was second only to acacia groves in the abundance and diversity of Nearctic migrants. The two plantation types have similar bird species lists and both are similar in composition to the dominant woodland - mixed pine-oak. Both types of shade coffee plantation habitats differ from other local habitats in supporting highly seasonal bird populations. Survey numbers almost double during the dry season - an increase that is found in omnivorous migrants and omnivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous resident species.

The aim of the present paper is to describe a new species of Maritrema parasitizing the Nearctic Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii in its wintering areas in Patagonia, Argentina. We also analyze and compare the microphallid diversity in two host species. We collected 44 C. bairdii and 50 Calidris fuscicollis in search of helminths. Trematodes were found only in C. bairdii. A total of 694 trematodes belonging to 4 microphallid species were found parasitizing the intestine and caeca. Four microphallid species were found: Maritrema formicae, Odhneria odhneri, Levinseniella cruzi and Maritrema pichi n. sp. M. formicae showed the highest prevalence, while M. pichi n. sp. was the species with the highest mean intensity and mean abundance. The new species M. pichi n. sp. differs from congeners by the position of the acetabulum that is included within the vitellarium ring, the ovary is anterior to the acetabulum, and the testes are lateral to it.
