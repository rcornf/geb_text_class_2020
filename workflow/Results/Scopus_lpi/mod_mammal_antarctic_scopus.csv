The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Pups are born at only five sites, four of which are at the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, which lie to the south of New Zealand. The remaining breeding site is at Campbell Island in the same region. Pup production was estimated during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons from mark-recapture studies at the two largest sea lion rookeries, at the Auckland Islands (Sandy Bay and Dundas Island), which account for almost 90% of total pup production for the species. Pup production for the other sites was estimated from direct counts or, in the case of Campbell Island, from recent tagging data. Total pup production estimates for all sites during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons are 2640 and 2807 respectively. During the four-week pupping season, pup mortality at most sites was estimated to be about 10%. The estimates of absolute abundance based on pup production for the two breeding seasons were 11 700 (95% confidence interval (CI): 10500-13100) and 12500 (95% CI: 11100-14000) respectively. This population abundance is among the smallest reported for a species within the Otariidae. The highly localised, and historically reduced distribution make this species vulnerable to impact and warrants particular attention from conservation managers.

The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals. These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf. 2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the east to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle. 3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species. 4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered. 5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators. ¬© 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.801142872,NA,0,NA,NA,5,,,49,NA

Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Ad√©lie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Ad√©lie penguin population change. Our approach is applicable to abundance data for a wide range of colonial, land-breeding marine species including other penguin species, flying seabirds and marine mammals. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al.",Article,Scopus,0.800014998,1,1,NA,5,5,1,5,2,NA

Little is known about humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) dispersal and migration in the western Indian Ocean. In October 2011 and 2012, eleven satellite transmitters were deployed on wintering humpback whales from the south-western Indian Ocean breeding stock at the Comoros islands (Moh√©li, n = 6 and Mayotte, n = 5). Eight individuals were successfully tracked for 24.3 ¬± 12.4. days (range = 8-49. days) and travelled between 146. km and 5804. km in total. Whales either remained at their wintering site for several weeks (n = 3) or dispersed along the west coast (n = 4) or east (n = 1) coast of Madagascar where two main stop-over sites were identified. In addition, two individuals travelled along straight paths to distant, potential, foraging areas. One whale reached the French sub-Antarctic islands while the other travelled to one of the supposed Antarctic foraging areas for humpback whales of this breeding stock. This is the first time movements of humpback whales from this area are being described and their potential foraging areas in the Southern Ocean identified. Identification of these dispersal patterns is important for delineation of breeding regions and for allocating abundance estimates to stocks. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.792272905,NA,0,NA,NA,5,,,34,NA

This, in turn, might be affected by climatically driven change in the abundance of the species main prey, krill (Euphausia superba), on the feeding grounds. Annual data on southern right whale number of calves were obtained from aerial surveys carried out between 1997 and 2013 in southern Brazil, where the species concentrate during their breeding season. The number of calves recorded each year varied from 7 to 43 (= 21.11 ¬± 11.88). Using cross-correlation analysis we examined the response of the species to climate anomalies and krill densities. Significant correlations were found with krill densities (r = 0.69, p = 0.002, lag 0 years), Oceanic Ni√±o Index (r = '0.65, p = 0.03, lag 6 years), Antarctic Oscillation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01, lag 7 years) and Antarctic sea ice area (r = '0.68, p = 0.002, lag 0 years). Our results suggest that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success in southern Brazil by determining variation in food (krill) availability for the species. Therefore, increased frequency of years with reduced krill abundance, due to global warming, is likely to reduce the current rate of recovery of southern right whales from historical overexploitation.",Article,Scopus,0.775146741,NA,?,Question over using calf numbers as a metric of abundance,NA,5,,,43,NA

Mark-recapture analyses and model selection trials using Akaike's Information Criterion indicate that sex, cohort, and year affect juvenile (ages 1 and 2) survival. In contrast, year and perhaps sex and cohort are less important factors for adult survival. Average annual survival is higher among adults (0.93) than juveniles (0.55-0.59) and there is little evidence for senescence to at least age 17. The oldest known-aged female and male in the study were 27 and 24 years old, respectively. Data suggest that the abundance of a resident population of Weddell seals remains relatively stable over time despite annual fluctuations in Jolly-Seber abundance estimates for the entire population.

Sea ice extent appears to affect immigration where, during times of reduced fast-ice, immigrants are forced, or allowed easier access, into the ice-covered areas of Erebus Bay from surrounding locations.

However, unless time-series abundance data demonstrate rapid and reliable fluctuations, objective appraisal of directionality of trends is problematic. We adopted a multiple-working hypotheses approach based on information-theoretic and Bayesian multi-model inference to examine the population trends and form of intrinsic regulation demonstrated by a long-lived species, the southern elephant seal. We also determined the evidence for density dependence in 11 other well-studied marine mammal species. (1) We tested the type of population regulation for elephant seals from Marion Island (1986-2004) and from 11 other marine mammal species, and (2) we described the trends and behavior of the 19-year population time series at Marion Island to identify changes in population trends. We contrasted five plausible trend models using information-theoretic and Bayesian-inference estimates of model parsimony. Our analyses identified two distinct phases of population growth for this population with the inflexion occurring in 1998. Thus, the population decreased between 1986 and 1997 (-3.7% per annum) and increased between 1997 and 2004 (1.9% per annum). An index of environmental stochasticity, the Southern Oscillation Index, explained some of the variance in r and N. We determined analytically that there was good evidence for density dependence in the Marion Island population and that density dependence was widespread among marine mammal species (67% of species showed evidence for population regulation). This approach demonstrates the potential functionality of a relatively simple technique that can be applied to short time series to identify the type of regulation, and the uncertainty associated with the phenomenon, operating in populations of large mammals. ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.765170487,NA,1,NA,NA,10,,,30,NA

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.761818988,NA,0,NA,NA,10,,,47,NA

Logistic regression and an information-theoretic approach related the occurrence of Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis (the most abundant species) to whether we were in open- or pack-ice-covered pelagic or neritic waters, in or out of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and north or south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current southern boundary. Other variables included date and distance to the MIZ and shelfbreak front. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of sighting a minke, as well as killer whale - but not the case for an index to whale density - was related to the proximity of coastal polynyas in early autumn, switching offshore to the MIZ once waters within the pack began to freeze persistently later in the season. Probability of detection was higher with distance into the MIZ. Supporting these findings, the density index was strongly related to ice concentration in an inverse relationship. The strong relationship to polynyas and the MIZ indicate that sea-ice divergence altered by decadal or longer-term climate change, as described in the recent literature, could well affect any apparent, long-term trends evident in this species' abundance if surveyed only in open or near-to-ice waters. We speculate on how the minke whale's pagophilic nature (1) could have been encouraged by large-scale industrial whaling and by competition with species more characteristic of open waters and the outer MIZ, and (2) may have protected the population somewhat during industrial whaling resulting in the much greater abundance of this species now compared to other targeted species. ¬© 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.",Article,Scopus,0.758929523,NA,0,NA,NA,10,,,29,NA

Blue whale locations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean were obtained from catches (303239), sightings (4383 records of ‚â•8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries (95), and acoustic recordings. 2. Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14676 days with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales (65.2%) or pairs (24.6%); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest in the waters of Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar. 3. Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering. 4. Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic ('true') subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic. 5. Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales. 6. South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and highsighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics, acoustics and length frequencies. 7. Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95% Bayesian interval 860-2900) in 1996 (less than 1% of original levels), but are increasing at 7.3% per annum (95% Bayesian interval 1.4-11.6%). The status of other populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue whales. ¬© 2007 The Authors.

Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km2) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with the autumn-winter krill fishery. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.745451224,0,0,NA,10,15,0,10,14,NA

This requires modelling the uncertainty in such processes as predator life history, seasonal abundance and movement, size-based predation, energetic requirements, and prey vulnerability. We combined these uncertainties to evaluate the predatory impact of transient leopard seals on a community of mesopredators (seals and penguins) and their prey at South Georgia, and assess the implications for an ecosystem-based management. The mesopredators are highly dependent on Antarctic krill and icefish, which are targeted by regional fisheries. We used a state-space formulation to combine (1) a mark-recapture open-population model and individual identification data to assess seasonally variable leopard seal arrival and departure dates, numbers, and residency times; (2) a size-based bioenergetic model; and (3) a size-based prey choice model from a diet analysis. Our models indicated that prey choice and consumption reflected seasonal changes in leopard seal population size and structure, size-selective predation and prey vulnerability. A population of 104 (90-125) leopard seals, of which 64% were juveniles, consumed less than 2% of the Antarctic fur seal pup production of the area (50% of total ingested energy, IE), but ca. 12-16% of the local gentoo penguin population (20% IE). Antarctic krill (28% IE) were the only observed food of leopard seal pups and supplemented the diet of older individuals. Direct impacts on krill and fish were negligible, but the ""escapement"" due to leopard seal predation on fur seal pups and penguins could be significant for the mackerel icefish fishery at South Georgia. These results suggest that: (1) rare apex predators like leopard seals may control, and may depend on, populations of mesopredators dependent on prey species targeted by fisheries; and (2) predatory impacts and community control may vary throughout the predator's geographic range, and differ across ecosystems and management areas, depending on the seasonal abundance of the prey and the predator's dispersal movements. This understanding is important to integrate the predator needs as natural mortality of its prey in models to set prey catch limits for fisheries. Reliable estimates of the variability of these needs are essential for a precautionary interpretation in the context of an ecosystem-based management. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.736209327,NA,0,NA,NA,15,0,15,24,NA

Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Vald√©s, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. ¬© 2005 Mammal Society.",Review,Scopus,0.726245649,1,1,NA,10,15,1,10,15,NA

This study focused on adult males interacting with the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery operating off the Kerguelen and Crozet Archipelagos. Demographic parameters were estimated using a 10-yr-long photo-identification data set paired with multistate closed robust design capture-mark-recapture models. The examination of a set of 29,078 photographs taken from fishing vessels during sperm whale depredation events resulted in identification of 295 individuals with nine visiting both study areas. Dispersal between both study regions was estimated to be 1% per year. The mean annual number of interacting sperm whales was estimated to n = 82 (95% CI 58‚Äì141) in Crozet and n = 106 (95% CI 76‚Äì174) in Kerguelen. Transient proportions were 13% in Crozet and 26% in Kerguelen.

Published data on field metabolic rate, population size, diet, prey energy content, and metabolic efficiency were used to estimate prey requirements of these breeding, adult, land-based predators and their dependent offspring. Due to their large population size, chinstrap penguins were the most significant krill predators during the period examined, consuming an estimated 7.8 x 108 kg krill, followed by Adelie penguins (3.1 x 107 kg), gentoo penguins (1.2 x 107 kg), and Antarctic fur seals (3.6 x 106 kg).

To quantify diet, we analysed prey remains in scat samples from Antarctic (661 scats) and Subantarctic (750 scats) fur seals collected at Marion Island (2006‚Äì2010). We assessed diet composition over time and calculated dietary overlap. The diet of both species was dominated by fish prey (98.2% and 99.4% of prey items), mainly myctophids. Antarctic fur seals consumed small numbers of penguins, cephalopods and crustaceans. In Subantarctic fur seal scats, crustaceans and cephalopods were rare and penguin remains were absent.

Four survey methods were employed as part of a multi-species research programme to develop methods for surveying marine mammals and seabird populations in aquaculture management areas. Two of the techniques, involving continuous timelapse photography of mussel farms and boat-based surveys through coastal farms were developed for this study. Timelapse cameras showed that mussel farms buoys were used by king shags as temporary resting sites only. King shags were recorded on 36% of the farms (n = 44) from 13 surveys within inner Admiralty Bay. The low number of sightings within mussel farms suggests that farms are not important foraging or resting areas for king shags, at least in Admiralty Bay. The foraging range and density of king shags was not known before farms were developed, so no direct comparison or impact assessment can be made. Boat-based surveys were used to estimate the density of foraging shags, which showed that daily locations of foraging birds at sea can vary considerably on consecutive days and over the season. Previous environmental surveys to assess impacts of mussel farms on foraging areas are therefore unlikely to adequately represent the entire foraging range or most important feeding areas. The number of breeding pairs, chicks and nests was also found to vary considerably at colonies, dependent on when counts were undertaken during their protracted breeding season. Open water mid-bay aquaculture (shellfish and finfish) potentially poses a greater threat to king shags than 'coastal ribbon development', in terms of loss of open water habitat from farm structures, and loss of foraging habitat through modification to the water column (e.g., turbidity) and seabed. Given the lack of knowledge about the king shag population dynamics, diet and prey availability, there is an urgent requirement for more research to fill these gaps and also understand how we can conserve important shag feeding areas and associated marine environment through sustainable management of aquaculture. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.696126615,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,18,NA

Previous studies have provided evidence that krill utilize zooplankton through austral winter when the primary production is negligible. Though they are different, all survival strategies produce the same result, a decrease in total zooplankton biomass. It is difficult to examine the total zooplankton biomass balance and process rates from traditional net tow samples because of the spatial variation in zooplankton distribution and the lack of applicable mathematical methods to estimate population process rates. This study focuses on short-term (overnight) loss rates of mesozooplankton associated with adult krill grazing in austral fall and the long-term (winter) body growth and removal rates of mesozooplankton in austral winter based on measurements of zooplankton size structures obtained using an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). In order to target an adult Euphausia superba aggregation for a short period, a 153 kHz Vessel-Mounted (VM) Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used for the acoustic backscattering. The in situ process rates of growth and mortality are estimated based on the biomass balance and biomass spectrum theory. The overnight in situ grazing by adult E. superba on mesozooplankton is examined based on the in situ measurements of mesozooplankton biovolume within the water where an adult E. superba aggregation remained during a short study period in late April. The measurements show that approximately 16% of the existing mesozooplankton biovolume was removed in 4 h, which leads to an average specific daily grazing rate of 0.96day -1 assuming a daily feeding period of 16 h from dusk to dawn. From the amount of biovolume removed and the abundance of adult euphausiids of approximately 3 individuals m -3 estimated from the volume backscattering strength and the size of adult euphausiids, the daily ration for an adult euphausiid is approximately equal to 7% body biovolume or biomass day -1. The total mesozooplankton biovolume decreased at a specific rate of 0.017day -1 over the austral winter 2002, while the specific individual body growth was approximately 0.045day -1. The sum of these two rates leads to the specific mortality rate equal to approximately 0.07day -1 for the winter. These rates lead to a system efficiency of 67% for recycling the biomass during the winter. The measurements indicate that approximately 90% of biovolume (biomass) was removed in the period between the fall cruise in April-May and the winter cruise in August-September 2002. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Interannual differences were observed in zooplankton species composition, developmental stages, and abundances, which were linked to unusually high chlorophyll concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay during spring-summer 2000/2001. Copepod abundance was significantly higher in 2001 than in 2002 (46.3 and 28.3indm-3 in 2001 and 2002, respectively). During 2001, the copepod community was dominated by two species. Calanoides acutus, a herbivore, and Metridia gerlachei, an omnivore, accounted for 46% and 45% of the community, respectively. During 2002, however, several species were relatively abundant, including M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. acutus, Oithona spp., and Paraeuchaeta spp. Euphausiids also showed a rapid population response to high chlorophyll levels in 2001. Even though average total euphausiid (juvenile/adult) abundances were similar during both years (0.20 and 0.15indm-3 for 2001 and 2002, respectively), species composition showed marked interannual differences due to varying life history strategies among species. Thysanoessa macrura, which has a relatively rapid development from larval to juvenile stages between spring and fall of the same year, was the most abundant euphausiid in 2001. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba juvenile/adult populations increased in 2002, owing to a slower development in which larval stages overwinter and recruit to juveniles during the following spring/summer. Other zooplankton groups those were abundant in Marguerite Bay, but showed little variability between years, included ostracods, pteropods, chaetognaths, medusae, amphipods, and mysids. Summer phytoplankton concentrations strongly influenced copepods and euphausiids; however, there were no clear associations between zooplankton distributions and fall environmental conditions (i.e., pigment concentrations and surface salinity) or bottom depth. It is notable that ostracods and pteropods had the highest abundances of non-copepod zooplankton. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.67721474,0,NA,NA,5,NA,0,5,1,NA

The Southern Ocean supports large populations of seabirds and marine mammals and is undergoing rapid environmental change. The management and conservation of these predators and their environment relies on understanding their distribution and its link with the biophysical environment, as the latter determines the distribution and abundance of prey. We addressed this issue using tracking data from 14 species of marine predators to identify important habitat. Location: Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean. Methods: We used tracking data from 538 tag deployments made over a decade at the Subantarctic Prince Edward Islands. For each real track, we simulated a set of pseudo-tracks that allowed a presence-availability habitat modelling approach that estimates an animal's habitat preference. Using model ensembles of boosted regression trees and random forests, we modelled these tracks as a response to a set of 17 environmental variables. We combined the resulting species-specific models to evaluate areas of mean importance. Results: Real tracking locations covered 39.75 million km2, up to 7,813¬†km from the Prince Edward Islands. Areas of high mean importance were located broadly from the Subtropical Zone to the Polar Frontal Zone in summer and from the Subantarctic to Antarctic Zones in winter. Areas of high mean importance were best predicted by factors including wind speed, sea surface temperature, depth and current speed. Main conclusions: The models and predictions developed here identify important habitat of marine predators around the Prince Edward Islands and can support the large-scale conservation and management of Subantarctic ecosystems and the marine predators they sustain. The results also form the basis of future efforts to predict the consequences of environmental change. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.64637025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,33,NA

Echinorhynchids were more numerous in 2007/08 (mean abundance 46.54 versus 35.35 in 1978/79), whereas polymorphids more numerous in 1978/79 (mean abundance 74.35 versus 36.40 in 2007/08). The overall results therefore demonstrated that echinorhynchids were more numerous than polymorphids in 2007/08 and the reverse was true in 1978/79. This situation is dependent mainly upon the decreased infections with C. hamanni, C. pseudohamanni and C. bullosum, and to a lesser degree upon the increasing of infections with M. johnstoni.

Here, we compare the long-term, historical responses of Southern Ocean predators to climate change. We examine palaeoecological evidence for changes in the abundance and distribution of seabirds and marine mammals, and place these into context with palaeoclimate records in order to identify key environmental drivers associated with population changes. Our synthesis revealed two key factors underlying Southern Ocean predator population changes; (i) the availability of ice-free ground for breeding and (ii) access to productive foraging grounds. The processes of glaciation and sea ice fluctuation were key; the distributions and abundances of elephant seals, snow petrels, gentoo, chinstrap and Ad√©lie penguins all responded strongly to the emergence of new breeding habitat coincident with deglaciation and reductions in sea ice. Access to productive foraging grounds was another limiting factor, with snow petrels, king and emperor penguins all affected by reduced prey availability in the past. Several species were isolated in glacial refugia and there is evidence that refuge populations were supported by polynyas. While the underlying drivers of population change were similar across most Southern Ocean predators, the individual responses of species to environmental change varied because of species specific factors such as dispersal ability and environmental sensitivity. Such interspecific differences are likely to affect the future climate change responses of Southern Ocean marine predators and should be considered in conservation plans. Comparative palaeoecological studies are a valuable source of long-term data on species' responses to environmental change that can provide important insights into future climate change responses. This synthesis highlights the importance of protecting productive foraging grounds proximate to breeding locations, as well as the potential role of polynyas as future Southern Ocean refugia. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Review,Scopus,0.632568719,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,27,NA

Depredation can also create additional unrecorded fishing mortality of a stock and has the potential to introduce bias to stock assessments. Here we aim to characterise depredation in the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery around South Georgia focusing on the spatio-temporal component of these interactions. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and orcas (Orcinus orca ) frequently feed on fish hooked on longlines around South Georgia. A third of longlines encounter sperm whales, but loss of catch due to sperm whales is insignificant when compared to that due to orcas, which interact with only 5% of longlines but can take more than half of the catch in some cases. Orca depredation around South Georgia is spatially limited and focused in areas of putative migration routes, and the impact is compounded as a result of the fishery also concentrating in those areas at those times. Understanding the seasonal behaviour of orcas and the spatial and temporal distribution of ""depredation hot spots"" can reduce marine mammal interactions, will improve assessment and management of the stock and contribute to increased operational efficiency of the fishery. Such information is valuable in the effort to resolve the human-mammal conflict for resources. ¬© 2015 S√∂ffker et al.",Article,Scopus,0.628680309,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,20,NA

The glacially sculpted coastline along the peninsula is highly convoluted and characterized by deep embayments that are often interconnected by channels that facilitate transport of heat and nutrients into the shelf domain. The ecosystem is divided into three subregions, the continental slope, shelf and coastal regions, each with unique ocean dynamics, water mass and biological distributions. The WAP shelf lies within the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) and like other SIZs, the WAP system is very productive, supporting large stocks of marine mammals, birds and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Ecosystem dynamics is dominated by the seasonal and interannual variation in sea ice extent and retreat. The Antarctic Peninsula is one among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, having experienced a 2¬∞C increase in the annual mean temperature and a 6¬∞C rise in the mean winter temperature since 1950. Delivery of heat from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has increased significantly in the past decade, sufficient to drive to a 0.6¬∞C warming of the upper 300 m of shelf water. In the past 50 years and continuing in the twenty-first century, the warm, moist maritime climate of the northern WAP has been migrating south, displacing the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate and causing multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. Ecosystem responses to the regional warming include increased heat transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines in ice-dependent Ad√©lie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins, alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition and changes in krill recruitment, abundance and availability to predators. The climate/ecological gradients extending along the WAP and the presence of monitoring systems, field stations and long-term research programmes make the region an invaluable observatory of climate change and marine ecosystem response. ¬© 2006 The Royal Society.",Review,Scopus,0.625764136,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,41,NA

We hypothesized that spatial organization of species richness and abundance hotspots reflect persistent habitat use and are regionalized according to distance from land and oceanographic boundaries. To test this, we used a new hotspot variance metric based on the percentage of time that the species richness or abundance estimate at any one location is greater than 1 standard deviation above the long term means for the entire survey grid. Species richness hotspots were based on all species sighted, while abundance hotspots were based on concentrations of 16 species: 13 seabirds (penguins, petrels and albatrosses), 1 pinniped and 2 baleen whales. Species abundance hotspots reflected 2 major groupings-those with oceanic and coastal origins.

In contrast, the other 2% contains an extraordinary array of aquatic environments including ice-covered freshwater and saline lakes and ephemeral streams. Lakes are found mostly in coastal, ice marginal regions in the Antarctic (Doran et al. 1994). Because of the great differences in mean-annual temperature related to the locations of these aquatic systems (Fig. 1), the temporal extent of ice covers on the lakes varies greatly. There are lakes that are ice-covered for part of each year, while there are perennially ice-covered systems in the dry valleys region of Southern Victoria Land where only 'moats' (ie ice-free littoral zones) form during the warmest summers. Because ice cover greatly influences both the physical and biological processes occurring within lakes, the extent and thickness of ice cover is an extremely important parameter in the biogeochemistry of Antarctic lakes (Wharton et al. 1993, Fritsen and Priscu 1999). Paleolimnological investigations demonstrate that climate variations have greatly impacted the extent of ice cover, in addition to the overall hydrology of Antarctic lakes throughout the Holocene back into the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Wilson 1964, Bird et al. 1991, Bjorck et al. 1996, Fulford-Smith and Sikes 1996, Gore et al. 1996, Lyons et al. 1998b, Hendy 2000). Much of the paleolimnological work from Antarctic lakes has recently been summarized by Hodgson et al. (2004) and Doran et al. (2004) and will not be repeated here. Some of the earlier work on Antarctic lakes illustrated its value in delineating changes in the hydrologic response to climate (Wilson 1964). The integration of paleolimnological data with more recent observations has provided important insights into how these lakes respond to climate change (eg Gibson and Burton 1996, allied with the work of Roberts et al. 2001 in the Vestfold Hills and Poreda et al. 2004, allied with Hendy 2000 in Taylor Valley, Victoria Land). Understanding the impact of climate on the hydrologic balance of Antarctic lakes, and in turn, the influence of hydrologic changes on the overall ecology of these systems is a major challenge to Antarctic limnologists. This will be especially true in the future period of anthropogenically-induced climate change. Kejna (2003) has recently reviewed the air temperature records from 34 stations around the Antarctic continent. The data span from 1958-2000 for 21 stations and for 1981-2000 for all the stations. In general, warming has occurred on the Antarctic Peninsula and in interior West Antarctica, with Faraday Station, on the west coast of the Peninsula having increased at a rate of 0.67¬∞C per decade over the period 1958- 2000. Many of the coastal stations in East Antarctica also demonstrated an increase in temperature over the longer time interval. However, since 1981, many regions of the continent, especially in East Antarctica, have shown a cooling. For example, Casey shows a 0.82¬∞C per decade decrease (Kejna 2003). There has also been a weakening of the warming rate on the Peninsula during the last 20 years. Because Antarctic lakes are so sensitive to both increases and decreases in temperature (ie Wilson 1964, Gibson and Barton 1996, Foreman et al. 2004), the direct monitoring of Antarctic lakes provides an excellent sentinel of climate change, especially as climate impacts the local hydrologic cycle. Climate variation and change are not the only factors affecting Antarctic lakes. The activities of mammal and bird populations also exert considerable influence on the physical, chemical and biological evolution of many Antarctic limnetic systems. Human activities can also be important in certain situations. For example, Heywood Lake, on Signy Island, has undergone eutrophication in the last 30 years because of input of nutrients from an expanding fur seal population within the catchment (Butler 1999). This has led to increased microbial abundance and changes in the structure of the ecosystem, with phytoplankton taxa more typical of polluted waters, as opposed to the more oligotrophic waters that existed in the 1970s and early 1980s (Butler 1999) before the fur seal population explosion. Eutrophication has led to longer periods of lake anoxia during winter thermal stratification and changes in seasonal biological patterns within the lake. Recent work in the Larsemann Hills has demonstrated that lakes impacted by human activities such as grey water and human waste discharge and even rock crushing by tracked vehicles have enhanced nutrient and total dissolved solid loads (Kaup and Burgess 2002). A comparison of human impacted catchments with catchments with little direct human activity indicates that the levels of dissolved nitrogen compounds were generally much higher in the human-influenced catchments. Salinities were also up to an order of magnitude higher in the human impacted catchments (Kaup and Burgess 2002). Monitoring the response of lake dynamics to changing climate has long been recognized as an important task (Wilson 1981). The linkage between changing climate and lake dynamics becomes even more complicated in lakes that are influenced by direct human impacts. Most investigations of Antarctic lakes have been conducted over limited time periods (1-3 years). Although these short-term studies have been extremely important in establishing base-line conditions, determining the taxa that are present, and understanding biogeochemical processes in the lakes, they are not conducive to establishing long-term limnological trends. Our paper focuses on studies resulting in long-term data comparisons that have produced information about biological and/or physical and chemical trends thought to be driven by changing climatic parameters. This focus greatly limits the resources available to compare long-term trends that do exist and historic information on Antarctic limnology because it eliminates numerous one-time studies of specific limnetic systems in various parts of the continent. (We differentiate between longterm and historic data by defining 'long-term' as relatively continuous records through time and 'historic' as data collected with time gaps between collections). In addition, this paper will not address trends in the epishelf lakes that exist on the continent especially in the Bunger Hills and Schirmacher Oasis regions (Bormann and Fritzsche 1995, Doran et al. 2000, Gibson and Andersen 2002). For information on epishelf lakes, see Gibson et al. this volume. Because of the important differences in the climate regimes within the Antarctic, we have separated our discussion into geographic regimes that have been used previously (Convey 2001). ¬© 2006 Springer.",Book Chapter,Scopus,0.583347875,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,50,NA

Small individuals of soft- bodied infauna are rare in this dense infaunal assemblage (over 100000/m2) from Antarctica. The evidence for the regulatory role of the peracarid crustaceans comes from gut contents; from laboratory experiments where the crustaceans consume spionid larvae or juveniles and small polychaete species; from field experiments where the abundances of crustaceans and small polychaetes are negatively correlated after the colonization of defaunated sediments; from exploring the role of depth refuges in the sediment; and from community patterns along a gradient in water depth where crustacean abundance is negatively correlated with the abundance of small species and small individuals of large polychaete species. Because most of the soft-bodied species have a size refuge from crustaceans, the dense assemblage is dominated by large and relatively long-lived forms.

Crabeater seals showed little movement in response to the approaching ship. Movement away from the ship by seals close to the ship's track was partially responsible for a relative lack of sightings close to the transect-line, but otherwise had little effect on the sighting histogram. Minor deviations from the transect direction to avoid running over seals violated the assumption of uniform distribution of groups, and contributed to a relative lack in sightings close to (<40 m) the transect-line.

Here, we show that over a 30-year period in the Ross Sea, average weaning masses of Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, varied strongly among years and were correlated to large-scale climatic and oceanographic variations. Foraging success of pregnant seals (reflected by weaning mass the following pupping season) increased during summers characterized by reduced sea-ice cover and positive phases of the southern oscillation. These results demonstrate a correlation between environmental variation and an important life history characteristic (weaning mass) of an Antarctic marine mammal. Understanding the mechanisms that link climatic variation and animal life history characteristics will contribute to understanding both population dynamics and global climatic processes. For the world's most southerly distributed mammal species, the projected trend of increasing global climate change raises concern because increasing sea-ice trends in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica will likely reduce populations due to reduced access to prey as expressed through declines in body condition and reproductive performance. ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,Scopus,0.576027583,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,37,NA

Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of 1¬∞C over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century. ¬© 2007 The Royal Society.",Article,Scopus,0.568473559,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,21,NA

We investigated the distribution, abundance and feeding behaviour of seabirds in the Mozambique Channel in relation to physical and biological environmental variables, with a specific interest in mesoscale features. Seabird censuses were conducted in summer and winter during 7 cruises in the southern and northern Mozambique Channel. Tropical species accounted for 49% of the 37 species identified and 97% of the individuals, and species from the sub-Antarctic region constituted 30% of the identifications. The typically tropical sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscata) was the dominant species during all cruises, and overall accounted for 74% of the species observations and 85% of counted birds. Outputs of Generalised Linear Models at the scale of the Mozambique Channel suggested that higher densities of flying and feeding birds occurred in areas with lower sea surface temperatures and lower surface chlorophyll a concentrations. Most of the flocks of feeding birds did not associate with surface schools of fish or marine mammals, but when they did, these flocks were larger, especially when associated with tuna. While tropical species seemed to favour cyclonic eddies, frontal and divergence zones, non-tropical species were more frequently recorded over shelf waters. Sooty terns foraged preferentially in cyclonic eddies where zooplankton, micronekton and tuna schools were abundant. Among other major tropical species, frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) predominated in frontal zones between eddies, where tuna schools also frequently occurred and where geostrophic currents were the strongest. Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) concentrated in divergence zones characterised by low sea level anomalies, low geostrophic currents, and high zooplankton biomass close to the surface. Our results highlight the importance of mescoscale features in structuring the tropical seabird community in the Mozambique Channel, in addition to segregating tropical and non-tropical species. The mechanisms underlying the segregation of tropical seabirds seem to partially differ from that of other tropical regions, and this may be a consequence of the strong local mesoscale activity, affecting prey size and availability schemes. Beyond characterising the foraging habitats of the seabird community of the Mozambique Channel, this study highlights the importance of this region as a hot spot for seabirds; especially the southern part, where several endangered sub-Antarctic species over-winter. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.566237441,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,19,NA

Using data from a shipboard survey during August 2012, I test the hypothesis that relative abundance of seabird and marine mammals reflects environmental variability associated with the dynamic pack ice zone. Using environmental data and observations of sea ice concentration, I quantified an environmental gradient that describes the spatial organization of the dynamic pack ice zone. The relationship of top predators to this environmental gradient revealed three important aspects: (1) an open water and pack ice community is present with some top predator species exhibiting higher abundance associated with moderate sea ice concentration (40‚Äì60¬†%) as opposed to the pack ice edge (10¬†%), (2) Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were the most abundant pinniped and they were observed resting on ice floes and foraging within leads and polynyas, and (3) for the most abundant species, spatial regression models indicate that latitude and sea ice concentration (a principal north/south gradient) are the most important environmental determinants. Winter ocean conditions may strongly influence population dynamics of top predators; therefore, information regarding their habitat use during winter is needed for understanding ecosystem dynamics. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.550685256,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,23,NA

Three shipboard surveys were conducted (February 2005-2007), and an echosounder was used to measure the distribution and abundance of krill while simultaneously conducting visual surveys to map seabird and marine mammals. Using a multispecies approach, we test the hypothesis that spatial organization of krill and top predators co-vary according to fine-scale changes in bathymetry in the nearshore marine environment. GAMs are used to examine the effect of sea depth, slope and distance to isobaths on the spatial distribution and abundance of krill and predators. Spatial distribution patterns of krill and predators relate to fine-scale (1-10 km) changes in bathymetry and exhibit cross-shelf gradients in abundance. Krill were concentrated along the shelf-break and abundant within both submarine canyons. Predators exhibited different preferences for locations within the submarine canyon system that relates to their foraging behavior. Penguins concentrated closer to shore and within the head of the east submarine canyon immediately adjacent to a breeding colony. Whales were also concentrated over the head of the east canyon (overlapping with penguins), whereas albatrosses and fur seals were concentrated in the west canyon. Fur seals also showed preference for steep slopes and were concentrated along the shelf-break. Petrels exhibited peaks in abundance throughout both submarine canyons. Owing to their orientation, size and proximity to the coastline, submarine canyons provide important habitat heterogeneity for krill and a variety of predators. This study highlights the multispecies approach for studying spatial ecology of top predators and krill and has implications for marine spatial management of the Scotia Sea. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.540603843,1,NA,NA,15,NA,1,10,17,NA

Vertical distributions of zooplankton usually were similar to those reported for other Antarctic regions. Maximum abundances of the copepods Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus, the euphausiids Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, and appendicularians primarily occurred in shallow Antarctic Surface Water (<100. m) or the upper pycnocline. The copepod, Oncaea spp., mysids, and ostracods had the deepest distributions (>250. m), in warmer modified Circumpolar Deep Water. Other dominant copepods (. Calanoides acutus, Metridia gerlachei, Oithona spp., Paraeuchaeta spp., and Rhincalanus gigas), pteropods, and chaetognaths had depths of maximum abundance within the pycnocline or in deeper warmer waters. Overlapping depth distributions suggest that E. superba would have the highest prey encounter rates with M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. propinquus, and Oithona spp. during fall, although most of the copepod community was deeper than the euphausiid community. Even though the three euphausiid species occupied similar depth ranges on average, at any given location E. superba, E. crystallorophias, and T. macrura depths of maximum abundance often did not overlap, suggesting vertical habitat partitioning behavior. The vertical patterns of copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, and mysids did not have a consistent association with the distributions of pigments, temperature, salinity, or density. Instead, the observed vertical distributions are mainly attributed to different behaviors, including seasonal vertical migration to deeper water for overwintering (i.e., C. acutus, R. gigas, ostracods, chaetognaths, pteropods) and vertical habitat partitioning to reduce competition (i.e., euphausiids). Migration into deep water and aggregation behavior (i.e., euphausiids) also reduce the risk of predation. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.476441228,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,25,NA

To support local phytoplankton blooms, these highly productive ecosystems require a large input of iron (Fe), the sources of which are poorly known. Here we assess the relative importance of six different environmental factors in controlling the amount of phytoplankton biomass and rates of net primary production (NPP) in 46 coastal polynyas around Antarctica. Data presented here suggest that melting ice shelves are a primary supplier of Fe to coastal polynyas, with basal melt rates explaining 59% of the between-polynya variance in mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration. In a multiple regression analysis, which explained 78% of the variance in chlorophyll a (Chl a) between polynyas, basal melt rate explained twice as much of the variance as the next most important variable. Fe upwelled from sediments, which is partly controlled by continental shelf width, was also important in some polynyas. Of secondary importance to phytoplankton abundance and NPP were sea surface temperature and polynya size. Surprisingly, differences in light availability and the length of the open water season explained little or none of the variance in either Chl a or NPP between polynyas. If the productivity of coastal polynyas is indeed sensitive to the release of Fe from melting ice shelves, future changes in ice shelf melt rates could dramatically influence Antarctic coastal ecosystems and the ability of continental shelf waters to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. ¬© 2015.

Rabies virus is the representative member of the group. Warm-blooded vertebrates are susceptible to experimental infection, but major primary hosts for disease perpetuation encompass bats and mammalian carnivores. The dog is the global reservoir, and important wild carnivores include foxes, raccoons, skunks, and mongoose, among others. Traditionally, reliance upon long-term, widespread, government-supported programmes aimed at population reduction of animals at risk has been unsuccessful as the sole means of rabies control, based in part upon economical, ecological and ethical grounds. In contrast, immunization of domestic dogs with traditional veterinary vaccines by the parenteral route led to the virtual extinction of canine-transmitted rabies in developed countries. Taken from this basic concept of applied herd immunity, the idea of wildlife vaccination was conceived during the 1960s, and modified-live rabies viruses were used for the experimental oral vaccination of carnivores by the 1970s. The development of safe and effective rabies virus vaccines applied in attractive baits resulted in the first field trials in Switzerland in 1978. Thereafter, technical improvements occurred in vaccine quality and production, including the design of recombinant viruses, as well as in the ease of mass distribution of millions of edible baits over large geographical areas. Over the past few decades, extensive oral vaccination programmes focusing upon the red fox, using hand and aerial distribution of vaccine-laden baits, have resulted in the virtual disappearance of rabies in Western Europe. The same dramatic observation held true for southern Ontario. During the 1990s in the United States, oral vaccination programmes concentrated upon raccoons, grey foxes, and coyotes, with similar success. For example, raccoon rabies has not spread west of the current focus in the eastern states, grey fox rabies is contained in west central Texas, and no recent cases of rabies have been reported from coyotes away from the Mexican border for several years. Despite the progress observed and the absence of substantive adverse environmental or health effects, oral vaccination is not a panacea, and should be viewed as an important adjunct to traditional prevention and control techniques in human and veterinary medicine. Local outbreak suppression of rabies among free-ranging wildlife is documented, and regional elimination of particular virus variants among specific, targeted carnivore hosts is demonstrable, but true disease eradication is not achievable at the present time by current techniques. For example, no practical vaccination methods have been designed for bats. Although lyssaviruses appear in relative compartmentalization between the Chiroptera and Carnivora, major spillover events have been detected from bats to carnivores, and phylogenetic analyses suggest a historical basis for extant viral origins due to interactions between these taxa. Thus, bio-political considerations aside, the possibility for pathogen emergence resulting from transmission by rabid bats with subsequent perpetuation among other animals cannot be discounted easily on any continent, with the possible exception of Antarctica. Clearly, given their biodiversity, distribution, and abundance, novel methods would be necessary to consider meaningful control of rabies in these unique volant mammals. Newer approaches in biotechnology may be envisaged some day for eventual extension to bats, as well as more widespread application to global canine rabies remediation in developing countries.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.387906995,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,51,NA
