The total population was estimated at ‚âà260 adults. Most birds were resident on Rangatira Island in spring, summer and autumn but moved to Pitt Island during the winter. In spring birds commuted between the two islands but became resident on Rangatira when breeding commenced. Radio transmitters were attached to adult tui to monitor breeding. No radio-tagged female bred (n = 13) but at least two of three radio-tagged males raised young. Adult tui were intolerant of disturbance during nesting so estimation of productivity was made by mapping the number of fledgling groups. Flax (Phormium tenax) nectar appeared to be the most important food for breeding tui and birds travelled long distances to visit flowering plants. Fruits of ngaio (Myoporum laetum), matipo (Myrsine chathamica), karamu (Coprosma chathamica), mahoe (Melicytus chathamicus) and muehlenbeckia (Muehlenbeekia australis) were also important foods. Invertebrates were most important when females were feeding their young. The amount of breeding that occurred each season was directly related to the abundance of flax flowers in spring, and in good flax flowering years tui were able to rear two broods. In poor flax flowering years many birds did not breed. Control of feral cats on Pitt Island would most likely result in a significant increase in this breeding population; however planting of flax adjacent to the the forest areas on Chatham Island along with predator control may be necessary before tui can re-establish there. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc. 2004.",Article,Scopus,0.865944672,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,83,NA

The Pied Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus was the most abundant New Zealand breeding wader; the estimated winter total of over 112 000 birds showed that the population had increased by about 128% since 1970-71. Counts of Pied Stilt Himantopus bimantopus (estimated winter total c. 28 000 birds) and Banded Dotterel Charadrius bicinctus (c. 11 000 birds) provided the first population estimates for these species during winter in New Zealand. However, both are significantly underestimated because many overwinter inland in sites not counted. Also, most of the Banded Dotterel population migrates to Australia following the breeding season. Wrybill Anarhychus frontalis (c. 3900 birds) was next most abundant native species counted in winter, with most birds recorded in the North Island. Counts of Spur-winged Plover Vanellus miles, Variable Oystercatcher Haematopus unicolor, New Zealand Dotterel Charadrius obscurus, Black-fronted Dotterel Charadrius melanops, and Black Stilt H. novaezelandiae also substantially underestimated population sizes because most birds of these species do not use estuarine sites during winter. During summer, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Lesser Knot Calidris canutus, and Turnstone Arenaria interpres were the most abundant of the Northern Hemisphere migrants with estimated populations of c. 102 000, 59 000 and 5100 birds, respectively, representing significant proportions of the East Asian-Australasian flyway populations of these species. Less than 700 birds were recorded during summer for each of the other Northern Hemisphere migrants, including (in decreasing order of abundance) Pacific Golden Plover Pluvialis fulva, Red-necked Stint Calidris rufcollis, Whimbrel Numentus phaeopus, Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea, Sharp-tailed Sandpiper C. acuminata, and Eastern Curlew N. madagascariensis.

A total of 178 transects was conducted in six major vegetation zones, with 777 individuals of 16 species of birds recorded. The six most common species, in order of their abundance, were Spinifexbird (Eremiornis carteri), White-winged Fairy-wren (Malurus leucopterus), Singing Honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), White-breasted Woodswallow (Artamus leucorynchus), Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and Welcome Swallow (Hirundo neoxena). Our total population estimates for these species were generally comparable to those of a survey of Barrow Island in 1976 (Sedgwick 1978), but some differences existed for these and other species. In an analysis of habitat preferences, more complex vegetation zones supported more species. The density of both Spinifexbirds and Singing Honeyeaters was significantly correlated with the number of emergent shrubs. Also, across vegetation zones, the number of different bird species was correlated with the maximum height of vegetation in a habitat. Species richness and numbers of individuals were compared between natural areas, areas surrounding oil pads, and along roadsides. There was no significant difference in species richness across these three areas, but there was a significant increase in number of individuals along road sides. This latter result occurred because disturbed areas along roadsides were colonized by a large species of spinifex, Triodia angusta, which supported greater numbers of birds than other species of spinifex away from roads. The oil-field development on Barrow Island occupies approximately 4% of the land area on the island and appears, at present, to have had a relatively minor impact on the populations of land birds. This conclusion is qualified in that several species of insectivorous birds have declined in numbers over the last 25 years, and the reasons for these declines are not yet known. ¬© Royal Society of Western Australia 2004.",Article,Scopus,0.839548995,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,84,NA

In contrast, numbers recorded at two sites in the Darwin region appear to have increased in the same period. Since 1980 numbers at Lee Point have increased by 9% per year (SE = 2%); at East Arm Wharf in Darwin Harbour, the annual population increase was 17% per year (SE = 9%) for the period of 2009-2015. This local increase over time may reflect changes in bird roosting behaviour and an increase in suitable high tide roosting habitat.

We also measured flowering in eucalypts, which support large numbers of nectarivores characteristic of the region. Location A 30,000-km2 region of northern Victoria, Australia, consisting of limited amounts of remnant native woodlands embedded in largely agricultural landscapes. Methods There were three sets of monitoring studies, pitched at regional (survey programmes in 1995-97, 2004-05 and 2006-08), landscape (2002-03 and 2006-07) and site (1997-2008 continuously) scales. Bird survey techniques used a standard 2-ha, 20-min count method. We used Bayesian analyses of reporting rates to document statistically changes in the avifauna through time at each spatial scale. Results Bird populations in the largest remnants of native vegetation (up to 40,000 ha), some of which have been declared as national parks in the past decade, experienced similar declines to those in heavily cleared landscapes. All categories of birds (guilds based on foraging substrate, diet, nest site; relative mobility; geographical distributions) were affected similarly. We detected virtually no bird breeding in the latest survey periods. Eucalypt flowering has declined significantly over the past 12 years of drought. Main conclusions Declines in the largest woodland remnants commensurate with those in cleared landscapes suggest that reserve systems may not be relied upon to sustain species under climate change. We attribute population declines to low breeding success due to reduced food. Resilience of bird populations in this woodland system might be increased by active management to enhance habitat quality in existing vegetation and restoration of woodland in the more fertile parts of landscapes. ¬© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.81841238,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,53,NA

An 18-year dataset obtained for Michaelmas Cay in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, was used to assess population trends for three tern species relative to two potential threatening processes, namely human impacts (as either commercial fishing or tourism) and cyclone activity. We found a positive, 2-year lagged relationship between long-line catch per unit effort in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery in the vicinity of Michaelmas Cay and breeding participation in the two pelagic foraging terns, but not in the inshore foraging tern. The abundance of large pelagic fish may influence recruitment into the breeding populations of the two pelagic terns in the following years through impacts on prey availability. Long-term population trends for all seabirds were not related to localised direct disturbance from cyclones or associated changes in cay size and/or nesting habitat. Current management protocols in place for the tourism industry at the cay appear to be minimising direct human impacts. Other evidence from this breeding location suggesting that climate variation may be driving foraging success and breeding-population dynamics in the two pelagic terns implies that a precautionary approach is warranted to the management of any potential stressors to birds in this system. ¬© CSIRO 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.812048741,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,32,NA

The estimated number of Brant, corrected for birds not seen by observers, was 2756 ¬± 413 (standard error) (0.56 ¬± 0.08 birds/km2 on 4930 km2) at the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula - Mackenzie Delta and 3176 ¬± 588 (37.81 ¬± 7.00 birds/km2 on 84 km2) at Campbell Island - Smoke-Moose Delta in Liverpool Bay.

Several hundred Black Brant also nest at the Anderson River delta (just east of our survey area), where numbers appear to have declined substantially since the 1970s or earlier.

Using 41 years of data, we examined annual variations in the reproductive performance of the red-billed gull at the Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand and related these to changes in climate, oceanography and the availability of the planktonic euphausiid Nyctiphanes australis, the bird's principal food. 2. In 1994 the population began to decline, and between 1983 and 2003 it was reduced by 51%. Adult non-breeders comprised an average of 32% of the population between 1983 and 1994, but following the decline they averaged only 18%. The age at recruitment changed markedly following the population decline: 27% of 2-year-old males bred for the first time prior to the decline, whereas the corresponding figure after the decline was 38%. The proportion of females commencing to breed as a 3-year-old was not significantly different before or after the decline. 3. An increase in the availability of euphausiids increased the likelihood of breeding and the recruitment of young individuals, caused earlier laying and resulted in an increase in the condition of adults, egg volume of gulls laying two egg clutches, clutch size and fledging success. 4. The relationship between food availability and the number of pairs that bred, laying date, clutch size and fledging success was significantly different prior to and after the population decline. The underlying cause appears to be a compensatory density-dependent mechanism that reduced interspecific competition for food. 5. The relative abundance of N. australis was correlated positively with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the frequency of occurrence of NE winds. The proportion of non-breeders and mean laying date were correlated negatively with the SOI, and mean egg volume of two egg clutches correlated positively with the SOI. 6. These results emphasize that availability of adult euphausiids is critical for red-billed gulls. We hypothesize that high primary productivity of inshore water near Kaikoura in winter, linked to a stable water column of coastal water and upwelling of additional dissolved inorganic nutrients, increases the availability of adult euphausiids to the red-billed gull as long as the coastal water is not replaced by offshore subtropical water intrusions of warmer, low-nutrient water. ¬© 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.804172289,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,90,1

Here we redress this situation by describing the breeding activities of brown songlarks over three years (1998-2000) in the semi-arid grasslands of south-western New South Wales. Study populations of this nomadic species were selected in late August of each year on the basis of high adult abundance. Adult males at these sites were, on average, 2.3 times heavier than females. Over the three seasons, nesting activities started in early to late August and continued until early November or December. Males were highly polygynous and, on average, occupied territories of about 4.0 ha. Nests were well concealed at the base of small shrubs and grass tussocks or in thick herbage. Clutches ranged in size from 2 to 5 eggs (mean 3.2) and were incubated exclusively by the female for 11-13 days (mean 12.1). Nestlings received a range of invertebrate prey, mainly from the female, for 10-14 days (mean 11.5) before leaving the nest. Only 17% of nesting attempts were estimated to be successful, and each of these nests produced an average of 2.7 fledglings. Predators, including foxes, Vulpes vulpes, and brown snakes, Pseudonaja textilis, were the main cause of nest failure. Some females produced replacement clutches following nest failure, while others laid second clutches after the success of an earlier brood. We speculate that extreme size dimorphism has evolved in this species because (i) males compete physically for breeding territories, and (ii) habitat heterogeneity and excellent visibility of their surroundings allow some males to defend territories of sufficient size to support nesting by multiple females.",Article,Scopus,0.79665272,NA,?,NA,NA,5,?,5,80,NA

We document the abundance and distribution of the main species of shorebirds occurring in the region during the non-breeding season, and present the first population estimates for this period, discuss the accuracy of published population estimates of the Flyway, and describe extensions of range of some species. The total shorebird population in eastern China during the non-breeding season is likely to exceed 1million birds. There were sufficient data for satisfactory population estimates to be made for six of the 27 different species encountered during the surveys (Pied Avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta; Grey Plover, Pluvialis squatarola; Kentish Plover, Charadrius alexandrinus; Eurasian Curlew, Numenius arquata; Spotted Redshank, Tringa erythropus; and Dunlin, Calidris alpina), and suggestions are made for reviews of the population estimates in the Flyway of four of these species and of the Eurasian Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), one of the less common species encountered. The new distributional data obtained extend the non-breeding ranges for nine species and it is believed that the Common Redshank (Tringa totanus) is not as widely distributed in eastern China as previously suggested. ¬© 2009 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.",Article,Scopus,0.790099593,1,1,NA,10,10,1,5,15,NA

This region is an important stopover site for shorebirds along the East Asian-Australasian flyway and is extensively used by waterfowl. A net loss of 11% of the wetland area was estimated during study periods at Chongming Dongtan. The change was dependent on wetland types: while the area of artificial habitats such as paddy fields and aquacultural ponds more than doubled, more than 65% of natural habitats including sea bulrush (Scirpus mariqueter) and common reed (Phragmites australis) marshes were lost over the two decades. An exotic plant species introduced from North America, smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), occupied 30% of the vegetated intertidal zone by the 2000s. Although waterbird species richness did not change between the 1980s (110) and the 2000s (111), 13 species found in 1980s were replaced by 14 newly recorded species. Moreover, there were more species with declining trends (58) than with increasing trends (19). The population trends of species were affected by residential status and habitat types. Transients, wintering migrants, and habitat specialists were more likely to show declining trends compared to those breeding at Dongtan (including year-round and summer residents) and habitat generalists. Furthermore, species associated mainly with natural wetlands were more likely to decline than those associated mainly with artificial wetlands. These patterns suggest that the loss and change of wetland habitats at Chongming Dongtan adversely affected local population dynamics and might have contributed to the global decline of some waterbird species. Because Chongming Dongtan provides stopover and wintering habitats for many migratory waterbirds, protection and restoration of natural wetlands at Chongming Dongtan are urgently needed. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,Scopus,0.786291044,NA,1,NA,NA,10,1,10,111,NA

A significant trend towards more frequent, and stronger, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation events, warmer summer sea surface temperatures in Bass Strait, increased annual catches and catch per unit effort in the Victorian pilchard (Sardinops sagax) fishery and potential increased discarding of fisheries by catch may account for at least some of the observed increase in the Australasian gannet population.

The speckled warbler, Chthonicola sagittata is one species from the highly fragmented temperate woodlands of eastern Australia that has declined across its range and populations that remain appear to be patchily distributed in habitat remnants. Specific causes of decline are unknown but several aspects of its biology make the species particularly vulnerable to decline in fragmented landscapes. Here, we analyse survey data (presence/absence) of speckled warblers in a large sample of habitat remnants from three regions to identify patterns of occupancy. We explore the effects of patch size on extinction risk using population viability analyses (PVA) and detailed demographic data from a behavioural study of individuals in the Australian Capital Territory, south-eastern Australia. Patch size was a strong predictor of the persistence of speckled warblers in habitat remnants. High density populations had higher probabilities of persisting, and inclusion of an Allee effect during drought decreased the probability of persistence. In the absence of an Allee effect, only high density populations in patches greater than 300 ha and low density populations in patches greater than700 ha had more than an 80% probability of persisting over 100 years. The accelerating decrease in population persistence below approximately 200-400 ha suggests that small populations were particularly vulnerable to stochastic demographic and environmental events. Adult female mortality was the single most important factor in driving population extinction. Our PVA model predictions matched the survey data for the Australian Capital Territory region remarkably well, but failed to predict occupancy rates in remnants in other regions. Differences in occupancy patterns between regions may, however, have resulted from inbreeding depression. This study demonstrates both the strengths and limitations of PVA analysis. PVA can predict occupancy patterns with reasonable accuracy, given good demographic data, but data for one region cannot be used universally for all regions. We highlight the need for studies of demography in different regions to interpret regional patterns of occupancy and to identify mechanisms of decline in remnant habitat. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To gain a better understanding of the impacts that this reclamation has had on the long-distance migratory shorebirds that use the EAA Flyway, we examined the number of shorebirds visiting Saemangeum and three adjacent sites in the Geum Estuary (Yubu Island, the Janghang coastline, and the Geum River Channel) during the spring and fall prior to, and after, completion of the reclamation (2004-2013). A total of 48 shorebird species, including one Critically Endangered, three Endangered, and nine Near Threatened species, were observed over this period. Peak numbers of shorebirds recorded at sites in Saemangeum and the Geum Estuary following completion of the project were 74% below those recorded in 2004 and 2005, the years prior to reclamation activity. In Saemangeum, shorebird abundance declined by approximately 95% and 97.3% during the northward and southward migrations, respectively, as a result of reclamation. Although shorebird populations in the Geum Estuary increased by 5% and 20% during the northwards and southward migrations, respectively, these increases failed to offset the reduction in shorebird abundance in Saemangeum; overall, shorebird abundance at Saemangeum and the three adjacent sites in the Geum Estuary markedly declined over the reclamation period. Given the more favourable conditions of adjacent areas, sites in Saemangeum and the Geum Estuary no longer provide the habitat conditions necessary for long-distance migratory shorebirds. In order to improve habitat for staging migratory birds, we suggest that measures such as the conversion of an abandoned salt farm for use as roosting sites, the construction of artificial barriers to prevent human disturbance, and re-opening of the river-banks to facilitate water flow be implemented. ¬© 2017 BirdLife International.",Article,Scopus,0.759114952,NA,1,human development consequences,NA,10,1,10,43,NA

Multi-scale investigatory approaches are increasingly encouraged, as the patchy distribution of suitable habitats in fragmented landscapes often determines species presence and survival. Habitat models applied to a threatened New Zealand forest passerine, the South Island saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus carunculatus), reintroduced to Ulva Island (Stewart Island) found that at landscape scale breeding pairs' preferences for sites near the coast were driven by micro-scale vegetation structure. We tested these results by examining models of breeding site selection by a reintroduced saddleback population on Motuara Island (Marlborough Sounds) at two scales: (1) micro-scale, for habitat characteristics that may drive breeding site selection, and (2) landscape scale, for variations in micro-scale habitat characteristics that may influence site colonisation in breeding pairs. Results indicated that birds on Motuara Island responded similarly to those on Ulva Island, i.e. birds primarily settled at the margins of coastal scrub and forest and later cohorts moved into larger stands of coastal forest where they established breeding territories. Plant species composition was also important in providing breeding saddleback pairs with adequate food supply and nesting support. However, Motuara Island birds differed in their partitioning of habitat use: preferred habitats were used for nesting while birds were foraging outside territorial boundaries or in shared sites. These differences may be explained because Motuara has a more homogeneous distribution of microscale habitats throughout the landscape and a highly bird-populated environment. These results show that resource distribution and abundance across the landscape needs to be accounted for in the modelling of density-bird-habitat relationships. In the search for future release sites, food (invertebrates and fruiting tree species) should be abundant close to available nesting sites, or evenly spread and available throughout the landscape. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.750988787,NA,0,NA,NA,10,0,10,91,NA

A particular focus of the study was the population in the Sydney region, which is now restricted to two locations in which we measured the response of birds to human disturbance. A significant decline of 65% in the reporting rate of White-fronted Chats was observed over the 25 years, with a decline of 44% over the last 10 years in New South Wales. Historical analysis of the White-fronted Chat in the Sydney region revealed a change in geographical distribution, with the current population now confined to only two of 56 former locations. Surveys of these locations concluded that in 2008, nine White-fronted Chats remained at Newington Nature Reserve and ‚àº20 at Towra Point Nature Reserve.

These migrant terns arrived at Caloundra sandbanks at around late-October and a vast majority had departed by mid-April. Numbers were generally highest from late-December through to early-April. An additional three Australian-breeding terns of smaller population sizes frequented the sandbanks. Density of terns using the habitats could reach a peak of 600 ha-1 during the warmer months of the year, coinciding with peak human recreational activities. In light of the results, Caloundra sandbanks should be regarded as an Area of International Importance based on criteria contained in the Ramsar Convention. The situation at Caloundra sandbanks presents challenges to recreational and tourism issues, requiring review of traditional government priorities in the conservation of wetlands based primarily on waders. ¬© 2006 Springer.",Article,Scopus,0.746256318,NA,1,NA,NA,10,1,10,42,NA

We showed that the slope angle of a wetland and the variation thereof best explain the differences in densities of four species. We also found that the population abundances of the Anatidae species generally declined in wetlands along the Yangtze River floodplain over time, with a steeper decline in wetlands with a lower protection status, indicating that current conservation policies might deliver benefits for wintering Anatidae species in China, as population sizes of the species were buffered to some extent against decline in numbers in wetlands with a higher level protection status.

We censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots, monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south-western Australia. Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000. Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown. Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years.

Recently developed state-space models address this variability issue by directly modeling both environmental and measurement error, although their efficacy in detecting declines is relatively untested for empirical data. We applied state-space modeling, generalized least squares (with autoregression error structure), and standard linear regression to data on abundance of wetland birds (shorebirds and terns) at Moreton Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia. There are internationally significant numbers of 8 species of waterbirds in the bay, and it is a major terminus of the large East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In our analyses, we considered 22 migrant and 8 resident species. State-space models identified abundances of 7 species of migrants as significantly declining and abundance of one species as significantly increasing. Declines in migrant abundance over 15 years were 43-79%. Generalized least squares with an autoregressive error structure showed abundance changes in 11 species, and standard linear regression showed abundance changes in 15 species. The higher power of the regression models meant they detected more declines, but they also were associated with a higher rate of false detections.

Although rabbit hemorrhagic disease was introduced to New Zealand in 1997,rabbit road-kill increased 59% between 1994 and 2005. The relationship between road-kill and traffic volume indicates that roads carrying more than 3000 vehicles per day act as barriers to larger mammals, while vehicles on less busy roads are more dangerous for crossing animals. We suggest that regular counts taken at annual intervals over the same roads is a useful method for gathering information about the changing distribution and relative abundance of certain animals on a provincial or national scale and over long periods of time. Regular counts at seasonal, monthly or weekly intervals are also a rich source of information. ¬© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.740304997,NA,?,"Potential methodological issue, use of road-kills, set to ?

Ship rats and possums were targeted by trapping and poisoning throughout Motatau Forest (350 ha) from 1997 to 1999; only possums were targeted in 2000. All 13 kukupa nests located before pest control started in late 1997 failed at the egg stage, but all seven nests located in 1998-99 successfully fledged young when trapping and tracking indices of possums and ship rats were less than 4%. After pest control, counts of kukupa and some other bird species increased at Motatau compared with counts in a nearby non-treatment block, suggesting numbers of adult kukupa can be increased in small forest areas by intensive pest control. This increase is due at least partly to increased nest success. Evidence from time-lapse video cameras, sign remaining at nests, and nest success rates under different pest control regimes suggest both ship rats and possums are important predators at kukupa nests. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.736122311,NA,?,Conservation intervention?,NA,15,?,15,70,NA

These birds have declined in the last 60 years, so understanding factors shaping waterbird distribution and abundance patterns is critical for their conservation. We applied linear mixed models to investigate the effects of climate, winter water area and inundation area (the difference between maximum flooded and winter dry season water area) on waterbird abundance and diversity at 72 lakes in 2005 and 2016. Neither winter water area nor climate featured in the best models, rather inundation area was the key determinant of waterbird abundance and diversity. Future water abstraction and land claim will therefore have greater impacts on waterbird abundance and diversity than likely climate change effects. Significant declines in waterbird abundance and diversity between 2005 and 2016 were not explained by modelled variables and there was no reduction in wetland inundation areas to explain these declines, confirming other factors were responsible. These potentially include declining wetland quality affecting carrying capacity (e.g. flooding phenology, disturbance, habitat loss and degradation, declining water quality caused by eutrophication and pollution) and/or factors limiting migratory waterbird populations at other stages in their life cycle elsewhere. The studied Yangtze lakes are amongst the best for wintering waterbirds and many are protected for their biodiversity, suggesting such protection cannot fully safeguard these internationally shared populations when threatened by other, currently unknown factors. This confirms the urgent need for more research to safeguard these ephemeral lake systems for their global biodiversity significance. ¬© 2017",Article,Scopus,0.735013117,1,1,NA,10,15,1,15,13,NA

Ornithologists have reported on wintering waterbirds in the floodplain since the 1950s. However, an integrated analysis of the long-term changes in waterbird diversity is not available. Here, we synthesise existing information on changes in wintering waterbird abundance and distribution in the floodplain, summarise possible influencing factors and propose some priorities for further research. Waterbird richness and abundance have declined over the past 60 years. Declining trends have been observed in a number of areas and species. Nevertheless, a few areas and species showed different trends. In addition, waterbirds have become more concentrated in a few suitable areas such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. Land reclamation, hunting, dam operation and extensive aquaculture are probably the four major threats to wintering waterbirds, while establishment of nature reserves is beneficial to waterbird conservation. Our study suggests that waterbirds in the floodplain are vulnerable, and that effective conservation measures are needed to protect and restore the waterbird diversity of this area.

This is the 1st comprehensive study of the responses of both the kite and introduced carnivores to a rodent outbreak. The 3.5-year study period included a population outbreak of about 24 months duration involving 3 native rodent species. Mammalian predators and kites exhibited similar population responses. Kites immigrated into the area within 6 months of the outbreak commencing, and remained while rodent abundance was high; however, all birds left the area after rodent populations crashed within a 6-week period. Dingoes and foxes were more abundant than cats and both species increased during the outbreak. All carnivores were resident. The letter-winged kite fed almost entirely on rodents. Rodents were the main prey of the 3 mammalian predators during the outbreak; however, all species had intermediate niche breadths. Dietary overlap between the kite and each carnivore was high during the rodent outbreak. During a nonoutbreak period, predation on rodents by the red fox remained high, whereas that by the dingo declined. We estimated the number of average-sized rodents (body mass 32.65 g) eaten daily by a nonreproducing individual to range from 1 (letter-winged kite) to 6 (red fox). We also estimated that the 3 mammalian predators (combined) captured 11 times as many rodents per day as letter-winged kites. There is considerable potential for food-based competition between the kite and introduced mammalian predators, particularly the red fox and house cat, in arid Australia. ¬© 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.",Article,Scopus,0.723016122,NA,1,NA,NA,15,1,15,54,NA

The effects of distance from road, understorey structure, topography and nest-microsite concealment on nest predation rates were examined. Artificial-nest predation rates were greater at 150 m from roads than <1 m from the roadside. Predation rates did not vary with understorey structure, topography, or level of nest concealment. There was marked variation between sites, with predation levels at Kakadu more than double those recorded for Berry Springs.

In recent years, these habitats have suffered severe shrinkage as a result of wetland loss and degradation. Identifying critical areas for waterbirds and assessing conservation status has become an urgent priority for biological conservation. Based on the criteria used to designate Ramsar sites and East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) Flyway Network sites, a general framework is proposed and applied to identify priority sites in China's coastal wetlands using a comprehensive waterbird survey dataset. Sites priority were evaluated by using appearance of globally threatened bird species, and bid species exceeding 1% of their global or flyway population, and population abundance. Sites priorities were ranked using an ‚Äúirreplaceability index‚Äù. Totally, 110 sites are proposed as priority sites. Considering the strategic importance of China's coastal wetlands for migratory waterbirds, the conservation status of China's coastal wetlands is inadequate to protect these waterbirds. Currently, 67 of the 110 priority sites lie outside protected areas. Some critical habitats for waterbirds are not included in individual protected areas, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces. Improved protection of these areas is urgently needed. However, conservation efforts in China's coastal wetlands face numerous challenges. Many important intertidal areas are increasingly threatened by ongoing and future reclamation plans. There is an urgent need to re-consider and limit the reclamation, particularly at critical sites, and put in place conservation measures to protect migratory waterbirds and their habitats. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.70424514,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,?,15,68,NA

Whio, Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos, are a threatened New Zealand waterfowl that has been declining in both distribution and abundance. We conducted a six-year study using a paired-catchment experiment in New Zealand Nothofagus forest as part of an adaptive management programme to assess whether whio populations responded positively to stoat (Mustela erminea) control. Video monitoring identified stoats as the primary nest predator. Year-round low-intensity stoat control (10 traps per linear km) significantly reduced the stoat abundance index in trapped sites compared with untrapped sites. As a result, whio nesting success and productivity, the number of fledglings produced per pair, increased significantly in the trapped compared to the untrapped area. However, survival rates and the number of pairs did not change significantly between the treatments. These findings indicate stoats are the primary agent of decline for whio in this Nothofagus forest system, and show that low-intensity stoat control is sufficient to improve the productivity of whio populations. Overall, the study demonstrates the value of an adaptive management approach whereby management techniques can be evaluated to ensure that the primary agent of decline is clearly identified and that predator densities are kept sufficiently low. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a manipulative food addition experiment on the demography of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) across sites that varied in predator abundance, near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, over three consecutive breeding seasons. We previously showed that food and predators had interactive effects on annual reproductive success (young fledged per female). Here, we report the effects on egg production. Our results show that food limits the total number of eggs laid over the breeding season (""total egg production"") and that interactive food and predator effects, including food effects on nest predation, determine how those eggs are ""parceled out"" into different nests. Food addition alone significantly affected total egg production, and there was no significant interannual variability in this result. At the same time, both food and predators affected the two determinants of total egg production: ""clutch number"" (total number of clutches laid) and average clutch size. Both clutch number and size were affected by a food X predator X year interaction. Clutch number was lower at low-predator locations because there was less nest predation and thus less renesting. Food addition also significantly reduced nest predation, but there was significant interannual variation in this effect. This interannual variation was responsible for the food X predator X year interactions because the larger the effect of food on nest predation in a given year, the smaller was the effect of food on clutch number; and the smaller the effect of food on clutch number, the larger was the effect of food on clutch size. Potential predator and year effects on total egg production were thus cancelled out by an inverse relationship between clutch number and clutch size. We suggest that combined food and predator effects on demography could be the norm in both birds and mammals. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.687827811,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,93,NA

According to our most conservative model scenario, 74% of rainforest birds of north-eastern Australia are predicted to become threatened (including 26 critically endangered species) as a result of projected mid-range warming expected within the next 100 years. Extinction risk varies according to where along the altitudinal gradient a species is currently most abundant. Upland birds are most affected and are likely to be immediately threatened by even small increases in temperature. In contrast, there is a capacity for the population size of lowland species to increase, at least in the short term.

However, a synthesis of the motivations, techniques, costs, and outcomes of such rat-control projects is lacking. We reviewed the literature, searched relevant websites, and conducted a survey via a questionnaire to synthesize the available information on rat-control projects in island natural areas worldwide to improve rat management and native species conservation. Data were collected from 136 projects conducted over the last 40 years; most were located in Australasia (46%) and the tropical Pacific (25%) in forest ecosystems (65%) and coastal strands (22%). Most of the projects targeted Rattus rattus and most (82%) were aimed at protecting birds and endangered ecosystems. Poisoning (35%) and a combination of trapping and poisoning (42%) were the most common methods. Poisoning allows for treatment of larger areas, and poison projects generally last longer than trapping projects. Second-generation anticoagulants (mainly brodifacoum and bromadiolone) were used most often. The median annual cost for rat-control projects was US$17,262 or US$227/ha. Median project duration was 4 years. For 58% of the projects, rat population reduction was reported, and 51% of projects showed evidence of positive effects on biodiversity. Our data were from few countries, revealing the need to expand rat-control distribution especially in some biodiversity hotspots. Improvement in control methods is needed as is regular monitoring to assess short- and long-term effectiveness of rat-control. ¬© 2016 Society for Conservation Biology",Review,Scopus,0.677899549,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,81,NA

They confirm previous, simpler correlations showing that the summer capture rate of stoats increases with spring mouse density index up to about 20-25 mouse captures per 100 trap-nights (C/100TN). However, at much higher mouse densities (60-80 C/100TN), observed in the Grebe and Borland Valleys in southern Fiordland in 1979/80 and again in 1999/2000, fewer stoats were caught than expected. These models quantify a serious decline in capture rate of stoats during periods of high mouse abundance over the range 25-80 C/100TN. At such times, management strategies aiming to protect threatened birds by intensive lethal trapping of stoats during the nesting seasons may be least effective just when they are most needed. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.676695769,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,40,NA

The reference population abundance in each habitat was calculated through an intensive capture, colour-banding, and resighting effort. Line transects consistently produced unbiased estimates of density for both sites at two time periods (morning and afternoon), and proved to be the most efficient of the distance sampling methods tested. Point-transect methods proved to be biased in this instance, consistently producing overestimates of density for this species, and were unreliable as indices of the small differences in density between habitats. Transect counts conducted from established walking tracks underestimated both density and the variance of estimated density. We conclude that in situations requiring estimates of absolute density for North Island saddleback, a series of randomly positioned line transects will accurately represent the density of individuals. Furthermore, this study highlights the need to pilot distance survey techniques on the species of interest to detect possible violation of the assumptions underlying these methods. We question the widespread use of point-transect counts for censusing avian species without such preliminary investigation, and recommend finther comparisons of distance sampling methods in New Zealand with reference populations where opportunity provides. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.672873812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,50,NA

The mean abundance per site was highest in 2005 (92.1 ¬± 12.0 individuals ha -1) and lowest in 2008 (46.6¬±3.3), whereas species richness per site was highest in 2004 (19.6 ¬± 0.9 species ha -1) and lowest again in 2008 (14.7¬±0.8).

Species diversity and the abundance of individual species declined as the rice crops developed so that most species used rice fields for only one to two months after flooding. An increase in water depths associated with the timing of panicle initiation of the rice plants was probably the main cause, but declines in most waterbird prey species also occurred as the crops developed.

Swift Parrots used a diversity of winter foraging habitats in regions of the coast and western slopes of New South Wales each year, including several habitats that occur in endangered ecological communities.

To arrest these declines, it is important to understand the scale of both the problem and the solutions. We analysed an expansive Australian citizen-science dataset, spanning the period 1973 to 2014, to explore factors related to differences in trends among shorebird populations in wetlands throughout Australia. Of seven resident Australian shorebird species, the four inland species exhibited continental decreases, whereas the three coastal species did not. Decreases in inland resident shorebirds were related to changes in availability of water at non-tidal wetlands, suggesting that degradation of wetlands in Australia's interior is playing a role in these declines. For migratory shorebirds, the analyses revealed continental decreases in abundance in 12 of 19 species, and decreases in 17 of 19 in the southern half of Australia over the past 15 years. Many trends were strongly associated with continental gradients in latitude or longitude, suggesting some large-scale patterns in the decreases, with steeper declines often evident in southern Australia. After accounting for this effect, local variables did not explain variation in migratory shorebird trends between sites. Our results are consistent with other studies indicating that decreases in migratory shorebird populations in the EAAF are most likely being driven primarily by factors outside Australia. This reinforces the need for urgent overseas conservation actions. However, substantially heterogeneous trends within Australia, combined with declines of inland resident shorebirds indicate effective management of Australian shorebird habitat remains important. ¬© BirdLife Australia 2016.",Article,Scopus,0.662991762,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,103,NA

The likely mechanism causing this pattern is a resource bottleneck (insects, nectar, and fruit) during the dry season that limits the population size of many species. The patterns support both the diversity-climatic-stability hypothesis and the species-energy hypothesis but clearly show that seasonality in energy availability may be a more significant factor than annual totals or means. An index of dry season severity is proposed that quantifies the combined effect of the degree of dryness and the duration of the dry season. We suggest that the predicted increases in seasonality due to global climate change could produce significant declines in bird abundance, further exacerbating the impacts of decreased range size, increased fragmentation, and decreased population size likely to occur as a result of increasing temperature. We suggest that increasing climatic seasonality due to global climate change has the potential to have significant negative impacts on tropical biodiversity. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.659869649,0,NA,NA,10,NA,,,10,NA

Foxes were removed from two areas around the perimeter of Lake Burrendong, and data were collected from these areas and a nearby untreated area before, during, and after the period of fox control. The arrival of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1996 provided an opportunity to examine the interactive effects of controlling foxes and rabbits. In this landscape, typical of central NSW, (a) the fox population was not affected by a large reduction in the abundance of rabbits, or vice versa; (b) the cat population declined in areas where foxes were removed after the large RHD-induced reduction in rabbit numbers, but there was no consistent response to the removal of foxes; (c) the abundance of some macropod species increased in response only to the combined removal of rabbits and foxes; (d) there were no consistent changes in the abundances of bird species in response to the removal of either foxes or rabbits, but there were clear habitat differences in bird species richness; and (e) there was likely to be an increase in woody plant species after the large reduction in rabbit populations by RHD.

In this study, we quantified the relative population density of bell miners in forests, and investigated the relationship between bell miner population density, the relative population density of other birds and species richness. A study site of 900 ha was selected in Olney State Forest on the Central Coast of New South Wales (33¬∞7‚Ä≤ S, 150¬∞22‚Ä≤ E), an area that has been managed for timber production since the 1920s. Monthly census counts were carried out over a 16-month period to include diurnal and seasonal variation.

Experiments elsewhere in which bell miners were removed from eucalypt woodland plots have shown a return of avian biodiversity and enhanced tree growth, and this study provides an empirical relationship describing the impact on avian diversity for a given forest. We recommend a test of the hypothesis that manipulation of the understorey during burning and logging, could be used to reduce bell miner population levels in wet eucalypt forests, with corresponding benefits to avian biodiversity and tree growth.

Four main types of woodland were surveyed (white cypress-pine, black box, grey box and river red gum) and, in total, 89 bird species were detected. All four woodland types differed in habitat structure and, in turn, supported significantly different avifaunal assemblages. Forty of the 89 species (45%) foraged, at least in part, on the ground. Species richness and abundance of ground-foragers differed significantly between woodland types, being highest in white cypress-pine and black box. There was a greater richness of ground-foragers during the breeding than non-breeding season, but abundance did not vary seasonally. Overall, ground-foraging birds comprised a greater proportion of species (>55%) and individuals (>60%) in white cypress-pine and black box woodland than in grey box and river red gum (42-48% of species, <50% individuals). Those ground-foragers regarded as declining also occurred in greatest richness in white cypress-pine woodlands, one of the most depleted habitats in the region. The lowest richness of 'declining' ground-foraging species was in river red gum woodland, the most widespread woodland type. Throughout Australia, the proportion of ground-foraging species in bird assemblages tends to be greater in temperate, semi-arid or arid woodlands than in moist forests and rainforests. However, in many regions woodland habitats are severely depleted and their open ground layer is particularly vulnerable to degradation. The extent of suitable habitat for ground-foraging birds in temperate woodlands may be much less than is apparent from current measures of tree cover. Sustainable management of drier (non-riverine) temperate woodlands is required to conserve this important element of the Australian avifauna. ¬© CSIRO 2005.",Article,Scopus,0.6536125,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,89,NA

Each year, more than 500,000 migratory shorebirds stop here to rest and forage, especially wading birds on the East Asia-Australian flyway. Long-distance migratory waders need to accumulate energy rapidly at stopover sites to ensure successful migration and reproduction. They mainly rely on polychaetes, bivalves, gastropods and crustaceans on the intertidal zone as a food source to renew their energy reserves. Human activities directly impact intertidal biological communities. Hydropower, human-caused changes to the physicochemical environment, sediments and other ecological factors influence the stability of ecological systems like estuaries and the energy supply available to birds at stopover sites. From March 2010 to June 2011, an ecological investigation was conducted on the Yalu River estuary wetland. The results show that the structure of biological community is relatively simple, dominated by bivalves, gastropods and polychaetes, and these dominant species have obviously undergone ecological succession. The estuary has low species diversity, and the species have low density populations. The wading birds forage on relatively poor sources of energy, while the biomass of the forage species renews slowly and provides a comparatively low level of energy. Moerella jedoensis, Cyclina sinensis (larva) and Glycera chirori are the main food species. The food organisms in the low tidal areas are significantly impacted by the migratory birds, especially M. jedoensis, because the foraging activities of wading birds are mainly concentrated on the low tidal areas during the peak of the northward migration. Bullacta exarata, thought to be the dominant species with the widest ecological distribution and distributed across the entire study area and tidal zone, is excluded by the waders as a food source since they excrete toxic mucus on their body surface. The food organisms are capable of recovering their former abundance and biomass after the peak period of the wading bird migration. The intertidal biological community structure has obviously undergone succession in the past 30 years as a result of human-caused changes. The dominant species with the widest niche breadth, B. exarata, is distributed throughout the area of investigation and its cross-sections and tidal zone, but its surface secretes toxic mucus making it inedible to the wading birds. This succession has reduced the food sources and energy available to wading birds as the non-food organisms gradually replaced food organisms. If the wading birds do not obtain enough energy during migration, the success rate of their spring migration will gradually decline, creating a threat to the continued survival of some populations. The disappearance of specific food organisms may also accelerate the rate of extinction for some endangered waders. Large-scale reclamation and coastal engineering from the 1960s to the 1990s resulted in a serious loss of habitat and in structural damage to tidal communities in the high and middle tide belts. This caused some species to disappear or to be forced to move to the subtidal zone. Also, ponds and beach farming have long been using drugs to eliminate organisms harmful to shellfish, which has inadvertently significantly reduced the number of beach species. Frequent disturbance of the substrate in the estuary and the deposition of fine sandy sediments are additional factors in the decline of zoobenthos populations. Finally, while humans were not observed to cause direct significant threats to wading birds, all components of the ecological system, including human, must be considered to harmoniously preserve the integrity of Yalu River estuary wetland ecosystem while maintaining sustainable development for society and human economic concerns.",Article,Scopus,0.653478306,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,100,NA

Little is known about whether the investments in ecological restoration have resulted in biodiversity benefits. We evaluated the potential of restored sites to support populations by assessing bird breeding activity. We surveyed 21 revegetated sites of various ages (9-111 years) in the box-ironbark region of Victoria, Australia. Sites differed in landscape context, patch features and in-site characteristics. The latter, including whether sites were grazed, amounts of fallen timber and numbers of remnant trees, were most important in affecting overall bird breeding activity. Patch-configuration (e.g., shape, area) was of secondary importance. Landscape context appeared to have little effect on bird breeding except for one species. While these results suggest that in-site habitat structure is the predominant driver, we caution against dismissing the importance of patch characteristics and landscape context for two reasons. First, the available sites covered a relatively small range of areas (<54 ha), and we could not provide a broad range of landscape-contextual contrasts given that we could only use existing plantings. Second, much of the breeding activity was by bird species known to be tolerant of smaller woodland areas or of the open countryside. We show that there is very little breeding activity in replantings by species that have declined dramatically in rank abundance between large 'reference' areas and fragmented landscapes. It seems likely that most replantings provide habitat configurations unsuited for dealing with declines of species most vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation.",Article,Scopus,0.653077295,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,48,NA

Despite recent improvements in tracking animal movements, migratory connectivity remains poorly resolved at a population level for the vast majority of species, thus conservation prioritization is hampered. To address this data limitation, we developed a novel approach to spatial prioritization based on a model of potential connectivity derived from empirical data on species abundance and distance traveled between sites during migration. We applied the approach to migratory shorebirds of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Conservation strategies that prioritized sites based on connectivity and abundance metrics together maintained larger populations of birds than strategies that prioritized sites based only on abundance metrics. The conservation value of a site therefore depended on both its capacity to support migratory animals and its position within the migratory pathway; the loss of crucial sites led to partial or total population collapse. We suggest that conservation approaches that prioritize sites supporting large populations of migrants should, where possible, also include data on the spatial arrangement of sites. ¬© 2016 Society for Conservation Biology",Article,Scopus,0.644726207,0,NA,NA,5,NA,,,2,NA

The current work identifies the importance of conserving habitat for migratory birds especially in the studied Nakdong River estuary. This estuarine system has been recognized as one of the most important stopover sites on the East Asia-Australasian Flyway, and supports a high level of biodiversity. The installation of an estuarine barrage in 1987 resulted in the habitat being partitioned into freshwater and brackish areas; however, there has been no systematic monitoring throughout the estuary. In the original survey program, the entire system (ca. 100 km2) was divided into eight sites and monthly or biweekly monitoring was implemented for the 3 years from April 2003 to March 2006. 227 species of birds were observed, with the dominant species being mallard (Anas platyrhynchos Linnaeus) (relative abundance, RA, 17.2%). Assemblage parameters showed avifauna biodiversity possessed a strong seasonality with some species groups dominating the estuary. A non-linear patterning self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm was applied to the avifaunal data set to identify patterns in avifaunal distribution. The trained SOM model (quantization error, 3.375; topographic error, 0.000) clearly classified the bird data set into two clusters. These clusters could be characterized by two factors: i.e., seasonal distribution of avifaunal assemblage and/or habitat properties. High dissimilarity between clusters was due to seasonality, while the brackish area (i.e., the cluster 1) was mostly occupied by cold season data while the reverse was true for cluster 2. By comparing bird data from the sub-zones, it was found that the center of the brackish area had a mixed pattern of bird distribution, which implied this area could be more important in terms of habitat preference with respect to migratory bird distribution. From the results, it is strongly suggested that a strict management strategy for the estuarine area to conserve the avifauna throughout the migratory flyway be prepared. The strategy could be seasonally and species specific. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus,0.643930057,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,86,NA

Large reserves have potential to provide important refugia for fragmentation-sensitive species as they lack many aspects of habitat degradation associated with fragmented regions. However, large reserves often have a history of deleterious management practices that may affect the restoration of biological diversity. One significant symptom of habitat fragmentation and disturbance in Australia is the increased occurrence of the aggressive noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In Queensland, however, even large continuous areas of woodland appear to be dominated by the noisy miner. Aims.We examined the severity of this phenomenon by identifying the interactions between habitat structure, noisy miner abundance and avian assemblages in a private and a public conservation reserve in central Queensland. We investigated potential constraints on restoration of avian diversity including: (1) how changes in habitat structure as a result of grazing by feral animals and burning regimes affect bird assemblages; and (2) how the noisy miner impacts on avian assemblages in these unfragmented woodlands. Methods. Bird surveys and habitat assessments were conducted in 49 sites on three separate occasions. Fire history and intensity of grazing pressure were determined for each site with direct and indirect observations. Sampling for lerp from insects of the family Psyllidae was also undertaken during the survey periods. A Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach was used to model avian response to each of the habitat variables. Key results. The noisy miner dominated most of the study area, reducing small passerine abundance and species richness. Noisy miners were advantaged where shrub cover was low and feral grazing impacts were evident. Disturbance factors including recent wildfire and heavy grazing strongly reduced small passerine bird richness and abundance. Conclusions. Reducing the abundance of this 'reverse keystone' species requires control of feral herbivore populations and modification of fire regimes to achieve a mosaic including patches with a dense shrub layer. Implications. Deleterious interactions with competitive native species, such as noisy miners, are obstacles to bird conservation not only in fragmented landscapes but also in large, continuous woodland areas. Land mangers of protected areas need to be aware of shifts in interactions among native species driven by habitat disturbance, which may ultimately affect conservation outcomes. ¬© CSIRO 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.638711335,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,56,NA

The rock wren was common once on mountain ranges along or close to the Southern Alps, South Island, New Zealand, but has been recorded less frequently in many areas after 1980. More numerous records from some areas and during some decades could have resulted from differences in search effort and from inconsistency in record keeping. Nevertheless, there were consistent anecdotal accounts of decline, evidence of predation by stoats and mice, unsuccessful searches in previous strongholds and the recent extinction of 5 confamilial species which indicate that the rock wren should be regarded as a threatened species. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.63646515,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,25,NA

To examine the potential impacts of the Spartina invasion on bird diversity, we compared the abundance and species richness of birds in habitats created by Spartina, Phragmites, Spartina mixed with Phragmites, Scirpus, and the bare intertidal zone at Chongming Dongtan in spring 2008. Most birds were recorded in the native habitats, with songbirds and breeding birds being most abundant in the Phragmites habitats, and waterbirds and migrants being most abundant in the Scirpus habitats and bare intertidal zone. Both species number and population densities of birds were lower in the exotic Spartina habitats than in the other four habitats. Although some songbirds and breeding birds used the Spartina-invaded habitats, and even preferred Spartina-invaded habitats to Scirpus habitats and bare intertidal zone, their densities were lower in the Spartina-invaded habitats than in the native Phragmites habitats. This might have resulted from the dense Spartina stands restricting bird movement and providing insufficient useable food for most birds. We conclude that the spread of exotic Spartina has negative impacts on local bird communities. Because Chongming Dongtan is an important stopover site for energy replenishment of shorebirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, urgent measures are needed to control further spread of Spartina and to restore the native habitats for birds. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Location: South-eastern Australia (27¬∞-37¬∞S latitude and 141¬∞-151¬∞E longitude). Methods: We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to model time-specific bird atlas occurrence data against time-specific plant productivity data, plus a range of environmental predictor variables. We then examined the effects of environmental variables on the temporal and spatial patterns of predicted abundance and distribution of the superb parrot using a correlative mapping approach. Results: Key findings from GAM analysis were: (1) there was a strong positive relationship between abundance and plant productivity in all regions, but (2) the response of abundance to other predictor variables often differed between regions. Correlative mapping predictions of the abundance and distribution of the superb parrot also indicated that: (1) predicted abundance varied through time and space, (2) predicted abundance sometimes decreased in all regions, but at other times some regions had high abundance when others had low, and (3) changes in plant productivity (and therefore climate) were associated with this variation. Main conclusion: The superb parrot favours productive landscapes that are also favoured for agriculture. Movements appear to be associated with seasonal and year to year climate variability. Thus, variation in the recorded abundance of the superb parrot may mask population trends, suggesting that existing population estimates are unreliable. Also, high abundances in some areas, and at some times, may reflect deteriorating habitat conditions elsewhere rather than species recovery. Temporal variability in the distribution of the superb parrot makes it difficult to identify specific drought refugia. Consequently, through time, as key habitat continues to deteriorate, the species will become increasingly vulnerable and threatened. Whole-landscape habitat conservation and restoration strategies are therefore needed to sustain superb parrot populations in the long-term. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.632853398,1,NA,NA,15,NA,,,16,NA

Although agriculture is a major factor in these land use changes, development of peri-urban areas is also driving the simplification of habitat structure through removal of both native and weedy understorey species and the subdivision of remnant habitat. This study investigated the influence of habitat modification and fragmentation on birds in an urbanizing area of south east Queensland, Australia. The influence of spatial factors, such as surrounding vegetation cover, was considered alongside that of site-level habitat factors (vegetation structure) including interspecific competition from the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). Spatial factors did not influence the abundance and species richness of small passerines, a group of conservation concern. However, site-level factors, specifically shrub density and interspecific competition from the noisy miner, had a substantial influence on small passerine species richness and abundance. The density of shrubs (which consisted mainly of the introduced weed Lantana camara) had a strong positive relationship with small passerines while the abundance of noisy miners had a strong negative influence. Consequently, protection of vegetation with an intact shrub layer in this developing area is essential for many small birds of conservation significance. Removal of weedy understorey plants should be accompanied by replacement with native shrubs. The results of the study emphasize that factors other than the spatial distribution of vegetation in the landscape need to be considered in order to develop appropriate conservation strategies. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we consider the interactions between Stoats Mustela erminea, feral House Mice Mus musculus and native birds in New Zealand beech Nothofagus spp. forests. We conclude that buffering to protect birds from Stoat predation normally fails in these systems, because peak populations of mice in these forests are low by Holarctic standards, and mice usually do not become sufficiently abundant to distract increased numbers of Stoats from preying on birds.

Sites were located across three levels of livestock grazing intensity and three levels of selective logging intensity within the most extensive habitat type, Corymbia citriodora-dominant forest. We recorded a high rate of incidence and large numbers of the hyper-aggressive noisy miner Manorina melanocephala (Passeriformes: Meliphagidae) at the majority of our survey sites, a phenomenon rarely reported in non-cleared landscapes. As shown by numerous studies in fragmented landscapes, the distribution of this species in our study had a substantial negative effect upon the distribution of small passerine species. Noisy miners exerted the strongest influence upon small passerine abundance, and masked any forest management effects. However, key habitat features important for small passerines were identified, including a relatively high density of large trees and stems in the midstorey. Selective logging appeared to exert a minimal effect upon noisy miner abundance, whereas grazing intensity had a profound, positive influence. Noisy miners were most abundant in intensively grazed forest with minimal midstorey and a low volume of coarse woody debris. Higher road density in the forest landscape also corresponded with increased numbers of noisy miners. Reduction in grazing pressure in Brigalow Belt forests has the potential to benefit small passerine assemblages across large areas through moderating noisy miner abundance. The strong relationship between noisy miners and small passerines suggests that noisy miner abundance could act as an easily measured indicator of forest condition, potentially contributing to monitoring of forest management outcomes. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.",Article,Scopus,0.629720442,0,NA,NA,15,NA,,,18,NA

Increasingly, these eradications are contested by activists claiming moral, legal, cultural, historic or scientific reasons and poorly documented evidence of effects. We reviewed the global literature on the effects of rats on island flora and fauna. We then used New Zealand as a case study because of its four-decade history of rat eradications and many detailed and innovative studies of how rats affect native species. These include use of exclosures, local manipulations of rat populations, video surveillance, and measurements of responses following eradications. The most intensive studies have been on the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans), a small South-East Asian species spread by Polynesians throughout the Pacific. These and the more recently introduced Norway rat (R. norvegicus) and ship (roof) rat (R. rattus) suppress some forest plants, and are associated with extinctions or declines of flightless invertebrates, ground-dwelling reptiles, land birds, and burrowing seabirds. On islands off France, Norway rats are also implicated in declines of shrews. Globally, ship rats were associated with declines or extinctions of the largest number of indigenous vertebrate species (60), including small mammals such as deer mice and bats. Effects of rats on forest trees and seabird populations are sufficiently pervasive to affect ecosystem structure and function. However, the data are patchy. Deficiencies in our knowledge would be reduced by documenting distribution and abundance of indigenous species before and after eradications. Comprehensive measurements of the responses of indigenous species to rat eradications would enable the development of testable models of rat invasion effects. ¬© Springer 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.629058535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,65,NA

It is generally believed that their abundance and their capacity to store water is an important feature for habitat fragmentation in the canopy. We investigated the microclimate of A. nidus and the effects of severe drought periods on the A. nidus population over a 20-year period, hypothesizing that water availability is the most important factor controlling the population under drought conditions. One of two neighbouring A. nidus plants of the same size and age was irrigated artificially before, during and after a significant dry period in 2000. By monitoring the microclimate within and around both ferns we were able to estimate that four continuous weeks of rainless weather completely dried out the accumulated humus of the non-irrigated A. nidus fern. Prolonged dry periods were shown to kill the roots of A. nidus, which attach the fern to the bark and eventually the affected A. nidus on verticals stems fell to the ground. Periods longer than 8 weeks may even kill adult plants sitting in more protected branch forks. Analysis of the whole A. nidus population within the 1-ha Canopy Crane plot and the determination of the morphological age of all plants enabled an evaluation of the historical development of the population. The oldest plant originated in 1985, just 1 year after the longest recorded drought for the site. We suspect that the 1984 drought killed every A. nidus plant within the study plot.

These operations create considerable lengths of forestry edge (edges between logged and unlogged forest) each year, but their impact on the avifauna of the jarrah forest is unknown. Changes in bird density were examined along edges created by forestry operations in jarrah forests using a BACI design experiment. Bird densities were estimated on 1-ha plots that were surveyed three times per season, in three seasons both before and after logging. There was no evidence of edge effects at the community level; overall bird density and species richness did not changes along forestry edges. Scarlet robin (Petroica multicolor) abundance increased significantly along both gap and shelterwood edges, relative to controls. Apart from a probably spurious increase in density along gap edges by red-winged fairy-wrens (Malurus elegans), no other species showed a significant change in density along edges. There was also no difference in responses to gap and shelterwood edges, despite gaps removing more basal area than shelterwoods, suggesting that response to forestry edges in the jarrah forest may be threshold dependent, rather than increasing with increasing intensity of logging operations. Comparisons with other studies examining density changes along forestry edges in south-western Australia suggest that density changes observed in this study are short-term in nature. The limited density change in avifauna along forestry edges is probably because selective logging practices were examined instead of clear-felling. Studies in the literature indicate that this pattern is likely to be true for many forest ecosystems. ¬© 2007 Ecological Society of Australia.",Article,Scopus,0.620589744,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,88,NA

Pertinent data for 37 conspicuous vertebrate species (10 bird, 26 mammal and 1 snake species) were collated, analysed, and integrated with more recent scientific information. Much of the information discovered in colonial records and obtained from interviews with oldtimers has been neglected by zoologists and ecologists. The original distributional limits of many of the species studied were thus clarified and redetermined. Detailed information is also provided on the history of the introduction of 14 mammal species into south-west WA, in order to assess their potential contribution to the extinction of native vertebrate species. The introduction, spread and density in bushland of commensal and livestock species does not correlate with the chronology of declines of native species. Changes in geographical distrbution of species were assessed against an interpretive framework of 29 factors, and based on this analysis, a conceptual model (termed the 'fusion' model) of mammal declines and extinctions in south-west and adjacent parts of WA since European settlement is proposed. The reconstructed sequence of events commenced in the 1880s, with declines being caused by disease (10 species estimated to have become totally extinct in WA and 8 species abruptly reduced in abundance and distribution). Another 12 species subsequently reached near-extinction status, following establishment of the fox in the 1920s. Trapping of some species for their fur and accidental poisoning by rabbit baits contributed to local extinctions but were not finally decisive factors. The conceptual framework adopted, based on detailed examination of the information discovered, recognizes three tiers of relevant factors. Only one or two main factors operate at one time, with some of the remaining factors acting in a subsidiary way, and sometimes concurrently or sequentially. Dominant factors are not necessarily the same for each species. Factors usually affected species adversely. South-west WA, despite being settled by Europeans earlier than most other parts of Australia, experienced a stagnant economy, slow population growth and hence minimal clearance of the original vegetation until the 1890s. The anthropogenic factors identified as significant in the decline and depletion of the native fauna, together with an understanding of their correct sequence of operation, provide a historically appropriate conceptual model that may be applicable elsewhere in Australia. The baseline data and historical accounts provide a resource for specialists working on particular species, and include much new material relating to the pelt industry and pest control activities. ¬© The Government of Western Australia, 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.617665422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,98,NA

Evidence was collected which showed that the two westerly islands of Java and Bali share a relatively similar bird fauna, but this differs noticeably from the bird life found more to the east. The conspicuous faunal break which occurs between Bali and Lombok appears to represent a transition from a rich fauna associated with the large continental island of Java, to a somewhat impoverished fauna of the outlying oceanic islands. Marked differences in habitat on the four islands were considered to be primarily important in dictating this change. Using frequency and abundance estimates for the different bird families it was shown that Java and Bali have a preponderance of Oriental (Asian) birds while Lombok and Sumbawa have more conspicuous Australian elements. However, when the presence or absence of species or families alone are considered all four islands have more Oriental types. It seems that a small range of Australian species including honey eaters, wood swallows, zebra finches and parrots are relatively abundant on Lombok and Sumbawa, and are a sufficiently conspicuous feature of the fauna east of Wallace's Line to impress the visitor that he has entered Australasia. The bird counts illustrate some of the changes originally described by A. R. Wallace (1860). Copyright ¬© 1975, Wiley Blackwell.

Biodiversity recovery efforts in such landscapes can be hamstrung by a paucity of information on factors affecting species' distributions, particularly for threatened and/or declining species. The temperate woodlands of south-eastern Australia have been extensively modified for agriculture and numerous bird taxa are declining. We have explicitly identified habitat and landscape attributes of woodland remnants affecting site occupancy by 13 woodland bird species of conservation concern. Using case-control data and linear logistic regression, we found that site occupancy for each species was related to both habitat and landscape variables. Habitat variables of particular importance included those in the ground layer (an abundance of leaf litter, an intact surface crust of mosses and lichens and a scarcity of annual grasses) and overstorey (a scarcity of eucalypt dieback and an abundance of mistletoe). Landscape variables strongly affecting site occupancy included the number of paddock trees and the area of native grass within 500 m of a site. Many of our study species were found most often in regrowth remnants. Our findings indicate a gap between current conservation practices and the actual habitat requirements of woodland bird species of conservation concern. Successful management will require protection and/or rehabilitation of the ground layer and overstorey of woodland remnants and sympathetic management of the surrounding landscape. It also will require managers to go beyond current practices of conserving old growth remnants and establishing replantings to maintaining and creating stands of woodland regrowth.

Medium-sized mammals (500-6999 g) formed the bulk of the faecal content, in terms of both volume and frequency of occurrence. The most frequently consumed vertebrates were the greater glider Petauroides volans, rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, bandicoots Perameles nasuta and/or Isoodon macrourus, red-necked pademelon Thylogale thetis, ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus, and brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula and/or T. caninus. Insects were also eaten frequently, but birds and reptiles occurred relatively infrequently in the diet. The seasonal variation in diet was marked, with insects and reptiles being consumed more frequently, and mammals less frequently, in summer than in winter. This seasonal pattern was also mirrored by the relative volumes of mammals and insects consumed. The results obtained here indicate that the spotted-tailed quoll is an opportunistic predator, consuming a wide variety of taxa and apparently varying its diet to take advantage of short-term fluctuations in prey abundance. The extremely high proportion of mammals in the diet identifies D. maculatus as a hypercarnivore, or meat specialist. The importance of tree hollow-nesting mammals in the diet indicates that the preservation of hollow-bearing trees should aid the conservation of D. maculatus. Future dietary studies of the species should sample over extensive time periods and involve concurrent monitoring of prey populations. ¬© 2006 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.611018528,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,75,NA

Trials were conducted over 2 booming seasons (2011 and 2012) at Hatuma Lake, Hawkes Bay. The 2 methods gave similar estimates of the number of biterns using Hatuma Lake (2011:8-9 biterns by triangulation and 9-10 biterns by close approaches; 2012:8-9 biterns using triangulation and 7-8 biterns by close approaches). We recommend using close approaches because there appeared to be less count-error or a combination of the 2 methods to estimate numbers of Australasian biterns on small wetlands (< 250 ha). However, neither method appears suitable for larger wetlands if the calls of distant biterns overlap those of close biterns, if observers get saturated by too many calling birds, or if there is insufficient time between calls to estimate distance of calls reliably and reduce the ability to distinguish individuals consistently. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.611009081,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,105,NA

Location: Australia (including Tasmania). Methods: Mean abundance data were collated from site surveys of bird abundance (the Australian Bird Count); range size and latitudinal position data from published distribution maps; and body mass and diet breadth information from published accounts. A diversity index of habitats used (habitat breadth) was calculated from the bird census data. We used bivariate correlation and multiple regression techniques, employing two phylogenetic comparative methods: phylogenetic generalized least squares and independent contrasts. Results: Body mass and latitude were the only strong predictors of abundance, with larger-bodied and lower-latitude species existing at lower densities. Together, however, body mass and latitude explained only 11.1% of the variation in mean abundance. Range size and habitat breadth were positively correlated, as were diet breadth and body mass. However, neither range size, nor habitat breadth and diet breadth, explained patterns in abundance either directly or indirectly. Main conclusions: Levels of abundance (population density) in meliphagoid birds are most closely linked to body mass and latitudinal position, but not range size. As with many other macroecological analyses, we find little evidence for aspects of niche breadth having an effect on patterns of abundance. We hypothesize that evolutionary age may also have a determining effect on why species tend to be rarer (less abundant) in the tropics. ¬© 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.610155132,0,NA,NA,5,NA,,,3,NA

Roosts may be occupied all the year round, non‚Äêbreeding birds continuing to roost communally throughout the summer. In New Zealand the habit is neither connected with migration nor is it an anti‚Äêpredator device. It is considered that the abundance of food caused by the spread of introduced mammals and the large increase of habitat created by European settlement has built the harrier population up to such a size that the number required to elicit the response of communal roosting occurs at all times of year in most districts. Numbers within individual roosts fluctuate throughout the year and it is suggested that communal displays before roosting may provide the necessary feed‚Äêback for the initiation of population adjustments.

Aim: To determine the influence of crop composition and structure, and seed food resources on the distribution of introduced bird species on New Zealand farmland in winter. Methods: Birds were counted on 90 ha of mixed cropping farmland during mid- and late-winter periods, 2004. The presence or absence of six introduced species (Blackbird Turdus merula, Skylark Alauda arvensis, House Sparrow Passer domesticus, Goldfinch Carduelis carduelis, Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and Starling Sturnus vulgaris) in fields was investigated in relation to crop composition and structure and seed abundance. Results: Species-habitat associations varied over time and between species. Blackbird, House Sparrow, Yellowhammer and Starling were associated more frequently with grassland than arable crops during at least one survey. Seed abundance was a significant predictor of the occurrence of all species except House Sparrow, while crop structure was a predictor of only Goldfinch, Yellowhammer and Starling occurrence. Conclusion: During the winter, the distribution of six introduced bird species in the lowland cropping area was related to habitat composition, vegetation structure, and seed food resources. The preference for grassland habitats was probably determined by the vegetation structure and seed resources in these areas. The trend for increased use of supplementary animal feed in livestock farming in New Zealand may help sustain introduced bird populations. A larger-scale study is needed to investigate the generality of the species-habitat associations detected in this study at the landscape scale. ¬© 2007 British Trust for Ornithology.",Article,Scopus,0.591671908,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,64,NA

The causes of this relationship remain poorly studied, in contrast to the relative wealth of literature examining the relationship to latitude of other variables such as range size and body mass. We used a cross-species phylogenetic comparative approach and a spatial approach to examine three potential determining factors (distribution, reproductive output and climate) that might explain why abundance correlates with latitude, using data from 54 species of honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) in woodland environments in eastern Australia. There is a strong positive correlation between mean abundance and latitude in these birds. Reproductive output (clutch size) was positively linked to both abundance and latitude, but partial correlation analysis revealed that clutch size is not related to abundance once the effects of latitude are removed. A subsequent multiple regression model that also considered range size, clutch size and body mass showed that latitude is the only strong predictor of abundance in honeyeaters. In the separate spatial analysis, the climatic variables that we considered (temperature, rainfall and seasonality) were all strongly linked to latitude, but none served as a better predictor of abundance than latitude per se, either individually or collectively. The most intriguing result of our analyses was that the cross-species latitudinal pattern in abundance was not evident within species.

From 1976 to 1997, three of 12 species (25%) significantly altered the timing of their arrival, four of 11 species (36%) altered the timing of their departure, and two of 13 (15%) altered the time of their peak abundance. For many species (68%) timing of seasonal movements was significantly correlated with climate, in particular the timing of arrival, peak abundance and for movement in autumn. Minimum temperature appeared to have a greater influence on timing of avian movements than maximum temperature, rainfall or the number of rain-days, and where rainfall or the number of rain-days appeared important it was generally in the season before movement. Although based on a period and location where little warming or drying was observed, the complexity of responses seen by these species indicates that it may not be straightforward to predict the timing of movements of individuals or populations in response to climatic shifts. Given climatic projections of more pronounced warming and drying of this region, this study highlights the need to monitor bird populations continually to determine if species respond predominantly to interannual variability in climate or to, as yet unknown, climatic thresholds. ¬© 2010 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.",Article,Scopus,0.58961288,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,36,NA

In inland Queensland, however, Noisy Miners dominate avian assemblages throughout extensive forest areas as well as fragmented landscapes, and our understanding of the factors influencing their behaviour and habitat selection in such relatively intact landscapes is limited. I investigated how road edges influenced Noisy Miners by comparing the species' aggressive and foraging behaviour, and location of nests, between road-edge and interior transects in a southern Queensland forest. I also investigated Noisy Miner foraging microhabitat preferences and targets of aggression. Noisy Miner nests were more likely to be located near to road edges, but foraging and aggressive interactions occurred with similar frequency near and far from road edges. Such interactions selectively targeted close competitors and a nest predator. Most foraging activity was in the canopy, and selectively within ironbarks (Eucalyptus spp.), suggesting that higher densities of Noisy Miners in more open areas of the forest are unlikely to be related to facilitation of ground-foraging activity. Despite some evidence of a preference for nesting near road openings, road edges do not appear to influence Noisy Miners as strongly as edges between forest and agricultural land do elsewhere in eastern Australia. ¬© Royal Australasian Orinthologists Union 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.581960162,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,62,NA

A total of 40 species appeared to be significantly disadvantaged by logging, another 40 species appeared to be significantly favoured by logging, while the remainder (147 species) appeared to be relatively unaffected. Most species were widely distributed throughout both logged and unlogged landscapes, albeit at possibly quite different abundances. This may be due to the fine-scale complexity of the habitat mosaic for many species, resulting in the continued availability of essential resources within or near logged areas, or the lack of sufficient sensitivity in the analysis due to the need to use presence-absence data. A further 121 species were recorded so rarely in the study (based on 619 sites) that it was not possible to make any assessments of their sensitivity to logging. The study produced several unexpected results, including the failure to identify some species as sensitive to logging that had previously been identified as sensitive in experimental and other retrospective studies. Species disadvantaged by logging were often either dependent on large old trees and/or tree hollows for nesting, roosting and foraging, such as the Common Brushtail Possum, Red-browed Treecreeper, Satin Flycatcher and Crimson Rosella, or they were species that inhabit open forests and woodland, such as the Rufous Bettong, Buff-rumped Thornbill, White-throated Gerygone, White's Skink and Nobbi, that were probably disadvantaged by the increase in stem density and understorey and mid-canopy cover that usually follows logging. In contrast, species favoured by logging, such as the Eastern Whipbird, Brown Gerygone, Lewin's Honeyeater, Wonga Pigeon and Land Mullet, were often those species preferring wetter forest environments, particularly those with multi-layered foliage and a forest structure that includes fallen logs and a dense ground cover. No species displayed consistently strong preferences for selectively logged forest. Mammals were more likely to be disadvantaged by logging than birds, but reptiles contained the largest proportion of species sensitive to logging (39%). Frogs were inadequately sampled in this study; only nine species were recorded. While each taxonomic group had some species that were apparently sensitive to logging, the time frame to population recovery following logging disturbance may differ widely between groups depending on their habitat requirements. Fire history was also strongly correlated with the occurrences of many species, indicating the need to quantify species sensitivity to regular fuel-reduction burning. Three main assemblages of species were identified. One group consisted of rainforest or wet forest specialists, another group comprised open-forest generalists, including a number of open-country and woodland species, and a third group was made up of tall, eucalypt forest generalists, including all of the large forest owls and marsupial gliders. Each broad assemblage, and most of their sub-groups, were found to have at least one species that was apparently sensitive to logging. The study was unable to test whether these sensitive species can function effectively as indicators of the changing status of other species within each assemblage because sampling was undertaken only once at each site. This study has provided one of the few opportunities to date to critically evaluate some aspects of the indicator species concept and its potential as a management shortcut for assessing changes in biodiversity in managed forest landscapes. Qualified support for the concept has been shown, based on the identification of a set of species apparently sensitive to logging and their representation across a range of species assemblages. The choice of candidate species for monitoring will depend on the integration of results from other experimental and retrospective studies, and will be specific to each region depending on the composition of species assemblages and the goals of management. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Concurrently (and before and after), baits containing brodifacoum, bromadiolone, flocoumafen, coumatetralyl, or warfarin were also used in St Arnaud village and on farms immediately adjacent to the project area. Brodifacoum residues were detected in the livers of 234 mammals from eight species, and two birds from two species captured alive, and a further seven birds from five species found dead in the project area (cause of death unknown). The highest concentration of brodifacoum residues in mammalian livers was recorded during the period brodifacoum was used in the project area. However, residues were present in the livers of some individuals at least 24 months after brodifacoum use in the project area stopped.

Auckland Is snipe laid between Sep and Jan (peak late Nov), whereas Antipodes Is snipe laid from Aug to early Nov, with a 2nd pulse of breeding from late Jan to Mar. The 5 breeding events recorded for Campbell Is snipe were from clutches estimated to have been commenced between 11 Nov and 8 Jan. All 3 taxa laid 2 large eggs (each 19-22% of female body weight) in nests that were well concealed amid dense vegetation. Chicks left the nest soon after hatching, with each chick cared for by a single adult. Exceptions to this were adult Auckland Is snipe seen with 2 or 3 young chicks on 3 occasions. Chicks remained with adults until down-free and capable of flight. The only notable differences from the more thoroughly-studied Snares Is snipe (C.aucklandica huegeli) and Chatham Is snipe (C. pusilla) were the earlier breeding by Antipodes Is snipe, and its bimodal breeding season. Snipe were encountered more frequently on the Auckland Is (0.6 person-h1 of walking on Adams I) than on Antipodes I (0.2 person-h-1) and this was also reflected in the frequency with which breeding events were recorded.

The diets of both species were dominated by nectar or pollen (the two were not distinguished in this study) from 5-6 species of eucalypts. Feeding on native plants not indigenous to the Melbourne region accounted for 61% and 74% of feeding records of Rainbow and Musk Lorikeets respectively. Both lorikeets foraged mainly in the tree canopy (99% of records), mostly perching upright or hanging to reach their food. Nectar and pollen were readily available through spring and summer because five important eucalypt food-plant species flowered constantly and several other food-plant species flowered for a substantial proportion of the time. There was little use of lorikeet food resources by other species of bird, and lorikeets were only involved in 3.5 interspecific aggressive encounters at feeding sites per observation week. The feeding ecology of the lorikeets in spring-summer was broadly similar to that reported for Melbourne in winter and for non-urban habitats in northern and eastern Australia. Abundant nectar and pollen from ornamental eucalypts planted in the twentieth century and the apparently low level of competitive interactions with other bird species for these resources have probably been important in facilitating the recent increase in abundance and distribution of both lorikeets in Melbourne. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.57038188,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,44,NA

In this paper, we use generalised linear models to investigate interrelationships among an index of decline in 1¬∞ by 1¬∞ cells and measures of grazing intensity and contemporary patterns of burning, together with the environmental variables of rainfall, vegetation and topographic patterning in the landscape. Grazing intensity was the single strongest human effect but strong correlations between grazing intensity and other human influences suggest that these may have been subsumed within the grazing intensity measure. Impacts of grazing may be worse where pastoral settlement occurred earlier. Topographic variation appeared to be a mitigating effect, suggesting a role for 'topographic refuges' from human activities. Relationships among granivore declines, grazing and rainfall are difficult to disentangle using inferential statistics, but a consistent effect is that declines are more severe in areas with greater year-to-year variation in rainfall. We do not suggest that our analyses are conclusive. However, they do support the proposition that better understanding of the causes of decline at finer spatial scales will emerge most strongly in studies that link habitat quality with granivore demography at inland sites of highly variable year-to-year rainfall and with strongly contrasting grazing histories. ¬© CSIRO 2005.",Article,Scopus,0.56355358,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,49,NA

Native prey are currently in decline due to predation; GIS techniques therefore have the potential to augment conventional ecological techniques and management practices. Predation risk to nests of ground-nesting birds was interpolated across an area using inverse distance weighting.

The Brigalow Belt forests include some of the largest contiguous areas of native forest in the temperate and sub-humid zones of eastern Australia. Over 1 million ha of these forests are proposed to be converted from forestry to conservation tenure, yet the impacts on the avifauna of current and potential future forest management practices are not known. We investigated the influence of road edges and habitat type and structure on the avifauna of a 356 000 ha forest. Survey sites were either <50 m or >300 m from a road, and in either cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forest, spotted gum Corymbia citriodora forest with a regenerating cypress pine/buloke Allocasuarina luehmannii understorey or spotted gum forest with an open understorey due to fuel-reduction burning. The avifauna differed significantly among vegetation types but not with proximity to a road, with the greatest differences between cypress pine and both types of spotted gum forest. The noisy miner Manorina melanocephala, an aggressive avian competitor, appears to be the factor mediating these assemblage-level differences. Noisy miners were rare in cypress pine forest but were three times more numerous than any other species in spotted gum forest. Spotted gum forest with a regenerating understorey had fewer noisy miners. Although total bird abundance was highest in open spotted gum forest, the species richness and abundance of passerines smaller than noisy miners was significantly lower in this forest type. Abundance of small passerines was eight times higher in sites where <3 noisy miners were recorded. Only one species, the eastern yellow robin, was influenced by proximity to a road edge. Cypress pine forest is potentially an important refuge for smaller birds. The results suggest that burning regimes that reduce regeneration of the cypress pine and buloke subcanopy in spotted gum forest potentially are exacerbating the problem of noisy miner domination of the avifauna. ¬© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse the Mount Lofty Ranges Woodland Bird Long-Term Monitoring Dataset for 1999-2007, to look for changes in abundance of 59 species. We use logistic regression of prevalence on lists in a Bayesian framework, and List Length Analysis to control for variation in detectability.

Although historical landscape transformation ultimately underlies these declines, effective conservation action requires knowledge of the relative importance of current threats to woodland birds. Through a literature review and analysis of empirical data from seven woodland regions, we investigated the relative importance of habitat structure, site context and aggressive avian competitors (miners, Manorina spp.) for woodland birds in eastern Australia. The literature review revealed that the factor which most consistently influenced the richness, abundance and assemblage composition of woodland birds was the density or presence of Manorina honeyeaters. A positive effect of site structural complexity was also often reported, but the effects of area, isolation and grazing varied among the reviewed studies. Across the seven empirical datasets, density of Manorina honeyeaters was responsible for the great majority of the independently explained variance in all but one region. We conclude that interspecific competition with Manorina honeyeaters is one of the most important and widespread processes threatening woodland birds in eastern Australia. In regions where this threatening process is prevalent, the greatest conservation gains for woodland birds may therefore be achieved by focussing on reducing habitat suitability for aggressive Manorina honeyeaters. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2011.",Review,Scopus,0.55329088,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,69,NA

Semistructured interviews and workshops conducted with Maori elders from the Tuhoe tribe in the Te Urewera region of New Zealand provided knowledge about traditional management strategies for New Zealand pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae), known locally as kereru, as well as signals of changes in local climate patterns and how these influence kereru. We used a population simulation exercise to demonstrate the feasibility of a harvest management strategy used by the Tuhoe to sustain kereru. Our models also indicated how potential changes in climate and subsequent decisions about harvest timing might affect a theoretical kereru population. Elders identified mana (authority), mauri (essence or life force), tikanga (traditional custom), and ture (societal guidelines), and the use of tohu (signals or markings), tapu (sacredness), muru (social deterrent), and rahui (temporary harvest bans) as key elements and ideologies in the traditional management of kereru. They linked an increased climatic warming trend to delays of three to four months in the fruiting of some trees, such as toromiro (Podocarpus ferrugineus), deemed important for kereru nutrition and body condition. The Tuhoe have traditionally harvested both adult and newly fledged kereru when they are feeding on toromiro fruit, so a three- to four-month delay in fruiting could potentially defer the harvest until the prebreeding period. Our simulation models demonstrated that harvesting kereru adults and fledglings in the postbreeding stage had less impact on population abundance than only harvesting adults only during the prebreeding phase. The model indicated that the Tuhoe would need to re-evaluate their harvest strategy if climate-induced delays in toromiro fruiting were to become more frequent. This study emphasizes how using both science and the full matrix of traditional knowledge can offer wildlife management the better of two world views. ¬© 2009 by the author(s).",Article,Scopus,0.548910468,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,116,NA

Reducing hydrological variability should reduce biodiversity and affect ecological processes. Many of Australia's rivers have reduced variability with river regulation, but some remain free flowing. We tested the variability hypothesis using waterbird communities on 12 floodplain lakes, paired into six systems distributed across half of the continent, over the period from 1983 to 2001. Half of the floodplain lakes were regulated (reservoirs) with stable water levels, while the remainder had unaltered hydrology. We analyzed in more detail the waterbird community within the Menindee system, using eight floodplain lakes, paired into four groups of flow regimes. Similar but less marked patterns occurred within the Menindee system. Overall, mean density (¬±1 SE) on unregulated floodplain lakes was significantly higher (6.04 ¬± 1.64 waterbirds/ha), compared with regulated floodplain lakes (0.66 ¬± 0.22 waterbirds/ha).

High diversity was observed in three of the five functional feeding groups that feed on invertebrate populations and aquatic vegetation. The other two feeding groups (piscivores and large wading species) were similar in number and density between regulated and unregulated lakes, possibly because exotic fish species thrived in regulated lakes. Ordination analyses supported these observations, clearly separating unregulated lakes and flow-regulated lakes. Reduction of hydrological variability, particularly removal of natural drying periods, affected the ecology of regulated floodplain lakes.

Perturbation pathways affecting interactions between feeding habitat, food supplies and diet of a lotic avian predator, blue duck (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos Gemlin), were tracked in a New Zealand river following substantial inputs of sediment from a volcanic eruption. Sediment impacts were separated temporally into two distinct phases: (i) deposition of fine ash from volcanic fall-out, and (ii) pulsed releases of volcanic sand and gravel retained by an upstream dam. 2. Levels of interstitial suspendable inorganic sediments increased by several orders of magnitude following ash inputs to the river, but returned to low levels within 3 months. Flushing of volcanic sand and gravel retained by the dam resulted in sediment deposition upstream of a large island where coarse material lodged firmly between larger benthic substratum elements in blue duck feeding habitat. 3. Changes in algal biomass appeared to largely reflect seasonal and hydrological influences, but the percentage inorganic content of periphyton increased significantly during both posteruption phases. 4. Diversity and abundance of blue duck food supplies on boulders and on the riverbed declined following the eruption, whereas significant impacts on biomass were only detected in benthic habitats which were more susceptible to sediment deposition. However, percent composition of the benthic and boulder invertebrate food resources appeared largely unaffected by the eruption. 5. There was no apparent association between the eruption and the composition or electivity (E*) of blue duck diet, but there was a significant increase in the percent inorganic content of faeces, suggesting a reduction in the quality of food rations. 6. Changes in food quantity and quality associated with deposition of volcanic sediments were linked to an observed decline in blue duck population density and fecundity following the eruption. An interacting continuum of adaptive responses to perturbation intensity and impact duration is proposed for blue duck, and potentially other long-lived, riverine birds, that enable them to cope with disturbances in highly variable and heterogenous lotic environments.",Article,Scopus,0.539807376,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,95,NA

A total of 32 study sites (boundaries between eucalypt and pine forests) were surveyed. Birds were counted by the area search method within 0.5-ha quadrats. Data were analysed using generalised linear models. Wide patches of eucalypt forest supported higher species richness and greater numbers of birds, such as foliage searchers and nectarivores, than narrow patches. Matrix age also influenced the occurrence of some species in native patches. The abundance of species in wide and narrow patches of native forest was related to their use of the matrix. This was true for native forests surrounded by old but not by young pine forests. We suggest that management in wood production landscapes take into account both characteristics of native patches and the surrounding matrix. Negative impacts of fragmentation in managed landscapes might be reduced by promoting matrix types that are suitable for bird species. ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.538826516,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,63,NA

These factors act by influencing the distribution and abundance of the prey, or the shorebirds ability to exploit it. The aims of this study were to investigate the low tide foraging distribution of shorebirds at four sites within the Robbins Passage wetlands, and the environmental and invertebrate factors that may influence their distribution. The greatest densities and number of shorebirds were found at Shipwreck Point and East Inlet. The shorebirds within-site distribution was also non-random, with the shorebirds present in greatest densities at the water's edge and low intertidal stratum, although this varied among species. Generally, on a small spatial scale, invertebrate diversity was positively correlated, and seagrass leaf mass was negatively correlated, with shorebird feeding density. On a large spatial scale, invertebrate biomass and seagrass root mass were positively correlated with shorebird feeding density. Invertebrate biomass and seagrass root mass explained 71% of the variance in total shorebird feeding density on the tidal flats. The variation in shorebird feeding density and diversity was therefore partly explained by invertebrate diversity and biomass, as well as the environmental factors seagrass roots and leaf mass and tidal flat area, although the strength of these relationships was influenced by the two different spatial scales of the study. The strength of the relationships between shorebird feeding density and the invertebrate and environmental variables was stronger on a large spatial scale. The presence of seagrass may have influenced shorebird-feeding density by affecting the invertebrate abundance and composition or the shorebirds ability to detect and capture their prey. The area of the tidal flat had opposing effects on the shorebird species. These results can be used to assist in the development of management plans for the Robbins Passage wetlands and the conservation of important shorebird areas. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although bioeconomic analysis has been used to contrast the relative efficiency of control strategies where pests affect economic resources, the same approaches have been adopted rarely in conservation settings. The Mohua ( Mohoua ochrocephala) is an insectivorous passerine indigenous to beech ( Nothofagus spp.) forests in New Zealand's south island. Mohua have undergone a 75% range contraction since stoats ( Mustela erminea) (which prey on nests and nesting females) were introduced to the south island in the late 1800s. Mohua nests are particularly vulnerable when stoat abundance increases in response to eruptions in the density of introduced house mice ( Mus musculus), which in turn respond to semiperiodic (4-6 year) mass seeding (masting) of beech trees. Controlling stoats only when their abundance poses a threat to Mohua fledging success would theoretically maximize the efficiency with which Mohua are protected. To better synchronize stoat control with periods of high stoat density, control could be initiated according to (1) time since last control, (2) beech seedfall, (3) mouse abundance, or (4) stoat abundance. Monitoring the three environmental cues, however, incurs costs that should be taken into account when considering their relative efficiency. I derived an empirically based stochastic model that links sequential change in beech seedfall, mouse, and stoat abundance to a simple demographic model for Mohua. I used the model to contrast the relative cost-efficiency of achieving conservation outcomes for Mohua (specified in a quasi-extinction framework), initiating stoat control according to these cues. The use of environmental cues reduced the frequency with which stoat control had to be undertaken to achieve Mohua conservation outcomes by more than 50%. For some cues, however, the costs of monitoring outweighed the savings that could be achieved through reduced frequency of stoat control. The interplay between costs of monitoring environmental cues and the frequency with which stoat control had to be undertaken meant that the most efficient strategy was dependent on the conservation outcome specified for Mohua. My results demonstrate the utility of bioeconomic analysis in formulation of pest management strategies to achieve conservation outcomes. ¬© 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.518165325,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,57,NA

We sought to establish the distribution of malleefowl within the Western Australian wheatbelt (210 000 km2) and their choice of habitat within this broad region. We supplemented a large presence-only dataset of malleefowl sightings with absence data derived from a bird atlas scheme and used these data to effectively predict the distribution of the species for the wheatbelt using a combined GAM/GLM approach. Both datasets were derived largely from community sightings. The distribution of malleefowl within the Western Australian wheatbelt was associated with landscapes that had lower rainfall, greater amounts of mallee and shrubland that occur as large remnants, and, lighter soil surface textures.

We recorded changes in bird species composition, density, and relative abundance across two woodland habitat types (riparian and nonriparian) and two levels of clearing (wooded and nonwooded) and three levels of livestock grazing (low, moderate, and high) replicated over space (1000 km2) and time (2001-2002). We predicted that species that depend on understory vegetation would be most negatively affected by livestock grazing. A Bayesian generalized linear model showed that the level of grazing had the greatest effect when trees were present. When trees were absent, the impact of grazing was overshadowed by the effects of a lack of trees. Over 65% of species responded to different levels of grazing, and the abundance of 42% of species varied markedly with habitat and grazing. The most common response to grazing was high species relative abundance under low levels of grazing (28% of species), species absence at high levels of grazing (20%), and an increase in abundance with increasing grazing (18%). Despite having similar bird assemblages, the effect of grazing was stronger in riparian habitat than in adjacent woodland habitat. Our results suggest that any level of commercial livestock grazing is detrimental to some woodland birds, particularly the understory-dependant species, as predicted. Nevertheless, provided trees are not cleared, a rich and abundant bird fauna can coexist with moderate levels of grazing. Habitats with high levels of grazing, on the other hand, resulted in a species-poor bird assemblage dominated by birds that are increasing in abundance nationally. ¬© 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.510653993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,37,NA

Gardner & A. S. George staminosa (Myrtaceae) is a rare granite endemic shrub that grows in discrete subpopulations on one isolated rock outcrop in a remnant of native vegetation in the Western Australian wheat belt. Key considerations in assessing the risk of extinction for rare plant species in fragmented landscapes are the reproductive dependence on a pollinator, breeding system, importance of seeds in demography, and regeneration niche. The present study determined the extent to which these factors constrain population growth in V. staminosa ssp. staminosa. Measurements across nine subpopulations on the breeding system, pollinator activity, rates of flowering, pollination and seed production, seedling demography, mature plant mortality and size-class structure were undertaken over three consecutive years. The study species has a mixed mating system with similar rates of pollen tube development and fertilization observed in self-, cross- and open-pollinated flowers. Floral morphology, orientation and the concentration and volume of nectar produced suggest some degree of specialization associated with pollination by birds, which were occasionally seen visiting flowers. However, feral honey bees were the most commonly observed flower visitor and they seem to have replaced honeyeaters as the primary pollinator. Honey-bee abundance increased with subpopulation size. However, rates of pollination and the subsequent proportion of flowers that produced viable seeds were independent of subpopulation size. Germination and seedling emergence occurred each winter but were greatest in the wettest winter. Recruitment was heavily biased towards individuals growing in or over cracks/fissures in the rock. Over the 3-year study, recruitment exceeded mortality. A relatively unspecialized flower and mixed mating system have buffered the taxon against the effects of pollinator disruption. Seed production does not constrain population growth. The environmental variables of climate and suitable establishment crevices appear to be the major constraints to population growth.",Article,Scopus,0.505808387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,85,NA

Not only do feral cats prey on native fauna and have the potential to spread diseases, but they have proven to be an obstacle to fauna reintroduction programs. Western Shield fox baiting strategies have been ineffective against feral cats largely because the standard fox/dog baits are not attractive to feral cats. Until the commencement of the research described in this review paper, there was no broad area control technique available for feral cats. Feral cat control research objectives and broad strategies The principal objective of the feral cat control research program, commenced by scientists of the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) in December 1993, is to design and develop an operationally feasible bait, and baiting regimes to provide effective and cost-efficient broadscale control of feral cats. Essentially, three strategies are being employed to achieve this. First, a comprehensive and carefully designed series of both cafeteria pen trials with stray cats and subsequent field trials with feral cats were conducted in an endeavour to develop a bait medium that was attractive to feral cats. The medium also had to have operational utility including a capacity to carry a toxin, be relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture, be easily and safely handled and transported and applicable to aerial deployment over large areas. Initially, a number of bait media, representing a broad range in physical form and type, were examined for acceptability by cats. A variety of flavour enhancers was then added to the most preferred bait medium to assess whether acceptability could be further improved. Second, field-based research and operational trials focussed on field testing and further development of effective broadscale aerial baiting strategies for feral cats. This initially involved examination of bait uptake in relation to the time of year (season) to enable baiting programs to be conducted when bait uptake is at its peak and therefore maximise efficiency. A key factor affecting bait uptake is the availability of live prey, the nature and abundance of which varies geographically and temporally. While a number of trials have been undertaken in a range of ecosystems, current and future investigations aim to examine the effects of season, baiting intensity (number of baits laid km-2) and baiting frequency (interval between baiting operations) needed to optimise sustained control. These baiting research and development programs are ahead of schedules outlined in the Western Shield Proposal and the Western Shield Strategic Plan 1999-2004. Finally, in addition to optimising the various parameters of baiting strategies, it will be essential that a comprehensive risk assessment of the potential impact of feral cat baiting programs on populations of non-target species be undertaken, and where necessary, methods devised to reduce this risk. This risk assessment is in part required to gain National Registration Authority registration of the new bait as well as assuring the protection of native fauna. While reliable techniques have been developed to assess the relative abundance of feral cats, it is also necessary to further develop techniques to efficiently and reliably census feral cat populations. This, together with an effective baiting strategy, will enable experimental determination of the level of feral cat control necessary to protect either extant fauna or reintroduced fauna across the State's semi-arid and arid bioregions. Achievements Investigations thus far have culminated in the development and patenting of a novel feral cat bait that is proving highly effective in experimental and operational baiting programs in arid and semi-arid regions of WA, as described in detail in this review. For example, the most recent large scale aerial baiting trial implemented under dry winter conditions in the Gibson Desert resulted in about a 95% reduction in the relative abundance of feral cats. The feral cat bait, which is also effective against foxes, has been used successfully in the eradication of feral cats from two islands off the Western Australian coast. Research into the relationships between season, live prey abundance and bait uptake are well advanced in a number of bioregions. Results to hand show temporal (seasonal) variability in live prey abundance and bait consumption. In areas that experience a Mediterranean-type climate and particularly where rabbits are abundant, the optimum baiting period occurs in the drier autumn/early winter months when young, predator-vulnerable prey are not present but before the onset of winter rains. As predator-vulnerable young prey become more abundant, which is a function of long-term weather conditions (season/rainfall), bait uptake is likely to decline. In the arid zone, where rainfall is unreliable, the time and intensity of rainfall events and season determines the overall abundance of prey. Research in the interior arid zone has suggested that the optimum time to conduct baiting programs and maximise their effectiveness is under cool dry conditions in winter. At this time, the abundance and activity of all prey types, in particular small mammals, reptiles and birds, is at its lowest and bait degradation due to ants and to hot, dry weather, is significantly reduced. The current series of trials is designed to investigate baiting efficacy at differing bait distribution rates (number of baits per unit area) to provide a cost-efficient control strategy. To-date, this series has demonstrated that a baiting density half that used in island eradications is equally efficacious in the control of feral cats in the arid interior. A highly effective toxic baiting of feral cats on the Gibson Desert Nature Reserve and Peron Peninsula this year has supported this evidence. The high level of bio-marking and good control of feral cats during these exercises suggests that further reductions in bait distribution may not reduce baiting efficacy. Difficulties There have been no extraordinary difficulties with a research project of this complexity and magnitude. Scientists commenced the project with little or no available background scientific information. There were commercial-in-confidence issues in accessing literature on cat food and the ramifications of patenting various aspects of the research. Other difficulties are associated with the temporal and spatial practical aspects of working on feral cats at an operational or large scale, and in remote areas. However, the main difficulty in such a project, and one which is universal to most research, that is gaining sufficient funding to enable the research to be carried out to a high standard and be completed within an acceptable time frame. To a large extent, this problem has been overcome with sponsorship being provided over a five-year period. The only other significant difficulty has arisen during the course of the collaborative research into the felid-specific toxin where development of the encapsulation system for the toxicant is taking a longer period of time than originally anticipated. Potential economies The step-wise approach to developing an optimal broadscale, aerial feral cat control strategy is being pursued to provide for effective and cost-efficient wildlife recovery. The focus is on optimising feral cat predation control through aerial baiting and providing a comprehensive evaluation of any impact on non-target species populations. The program is structured to enable analysis of the cost-benefit of various baiting regimes on both feral cats and non-target species and provide information essential to gaining registration of the feral cat bait. The development of a readily manufactured sausage-type bait will result in considerable savings in production, handling and delivery of the bait. The cost of feral cat baits is currently about 30¬∞ per bait at today's level of production. One third of this cost is for materials, and the remainder is associated with labour and production equipment. The future costs of baits will depend on economies of scale (level of production), degree of automation and the cost and depreciation rate of the manufacturing equipment, but it is anticipated that costs can be reduced when manufacture extends to an operational scale. Potential improvements Future research will focus on refinements to the bait medium, the development of a felid specific toxin, refinements to bait production and handling and designing bioregionally appropriate baiting regimes with respect to season, intensity and frequency of baiting. Further research on non-target issues is a high priority.",Review,Scopus,0.498024229,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,102,NA

Integrated management strategies could incorporate manipulation of dispersal or establishment processes. To improve our understanding of these processes, we quantified seed rain, recruit and seed bank density, and species richness for bird-dispersed invasive and native species in three early successional subtropical habitats in eastern Australia: tree regrowth, shrub regrowth and native restoration plantings. We investigated the effects of environmental factors (leaf area index (LAI), distance to edge, herbaceous ground cover and distance to nearest neighbour) on seed rain, seed bank and recruit abundance. Propagule availability was not always a good predictor of recruitment. For instance, although native tree seed rain density was similar, and species richness was higher, in native plantings, compared with tree regrowth, recruit density and species richness were lower. Native plantings also received lower densities of invasive tree seed rain than did tree regrowth habitats, but supported a similar density of invasive tree recruits. Invasive shrub seed rain was recorded in highest densities in shrub regrowth sites, but recruit density was similar between habitats. We discuss the role of microsite characteristics in influencing post-dispersal processes and recruit composition, and suggest ways of manipulating these processes as part of an integrated management strategy for bird-dispersed weeds in natural areas. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.474361812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,74,NA

To evaluate the role of native predators (birds) within an Australian foodweb (lerp psyllids and eucalyptus trees) reassembled in California. Location. Eucalyptus groves within Santa Cruz, California. Methods. We compared bird diversity and abundance between a eucalyptus grove infested with lerp psyllids and a grove that was uninfested, using point counts. We documented shifts in the foraging behaviour of birds between the groves using structured behavioural observations. Additionally, we judged the effect of bird foraging on lerp psyllid abundance using exclosure experiments. Results. We found a greater richness and abundance of Californian birds within a psyllid infested eucalyptus grove compared to a matched non-infested grove, and that Californian birds modify their foraging behaviour within the infested grove in order to concentrate on ingesting psyllids. This suggests that Californian birds could provide indirect top-down benefits to eucalyptus trees similar to those observed in Australia. However, using bird exclosure experiments, we found no evidence of top-down control of lerp psyllids by Californian birds. Main conclusions. We suggest that physiological and foraging differences between Californian and Australian pysllid-eating birds account for the failure to observe top-down control of psyllid populations in California. The increasing rate of non-indigenous species invasions has produced local biotas that are almost entirely composed of non-indigenous species. This example illustrates the complex nature of cosmopolitan native-exotic food webs, and the ecological insights obtainable through their study. ¬© 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.467443477,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,35,NA

The theory of ecological speciation predicts that natural selection shapes adaptive divergence. In this observational study, we examined the first phase of ecological speciation, namely adaptive divergence in foraging behaviour and morphology across populations (island and mainland sites) of the sexually dimorphic Superb Fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) that have been separated for approximately 9000 years. Current island theory predicts larger body-size in island species, as well as more generalist foraging and occupation of a wider ecological niche that is favoured by large body-size. We examined the vegetation structure across replicate study areas on Kangaroo Island and the mainland Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia and found significant differences in vegetation structure important for Superb Fairy-wrens (percentage bare earth, shrub size and shrub abundance). Compared with mainland birds, island birds of both sexes: (1) occupied a wider niche breadth; (2) were significantly larger in body-size; and (3) varied less in morphology. Between the sexes: (1) there were few inter-sexual foraging differences; (2) males had a larger body-size and bill-length at both island and mainland locations; and (3) females had larger bill-width and bill-depth at both locations. These findings support the hypothesis of adaptive divergence in this species, with evidence that vegetation structure is important in their foraging behaviour and affects their morphology across locations (niche breadth was potentially favoured by a different interspecific community). The lack of consistent sexual differences in foraging ecology suggests that the patterns of sexual dimorphism may be shaped by reproductive roles rather than vegetation structure in this species. The categorisation of the Kangaroo Island population as a separate subspecies (M. c. ashbyi) is supported by these findings. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.46266336,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,92,NA

The species often occur in sympatry in natural habitats but in suburban habitats Superb Fairy-wrens are much more common than Variegated Fairy-wrens. We compared the characteristics of the habitat of both species in natural and suburban areas to investigate whether habitat requirements differed between the species, and which may explain observed patterns of abundance.

To predict whether or not a plant will be dispersed in fragmented forests, it is necessary to have information about frugivorous bird distribution and dietary composition. However, specific dietary information for frugivorous birds is often limited. In such cases, information on the seed-crushing behaviour, gape width and relative dietary dominance by fruit may be used to describe functional groups of bird species with respect to their potential to disperse similar seeds. We used this information to assess differences in the seed dispersal potential of frugivorous bird assemblages in a fragmented rainforest landscape of southeast Queensland, Australia. The relative abundance of frugivorous birds was surveyed in extensive, remnant and regrowth rainforest sites (16 replicates of each). Large-gaped birds with mixed diets and medium-gaped birds with fruit-dominated diets were usually less abundant in remnants and regrowth than in continuous forest. Small-gaped birds with mixed diets and birds with fruit as a minor dietary component were most abundant in regrowth. We recorded a similar number of seed-crushing birds and large-gaped birds with fruit-dominated diets across site types. Bird species that may have the greatest potential to disperse a large volume and wide variety of plants, including large-seeded plants, tended to be less abundant outside of extensive forests, although one species, the figbird Sphecotheres viridis, was much more abundant in these areas. The results suggest that the dispersal of certain plant taxa would be limited in this fragmented landscape, although the potential for the dispersal of large-seeded plants may remain, despite the loss of several large-gaped disperser species. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2004.",Article,Scopus,0.448925903,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,94,NA

Yet despite their ecological importance for many of New Zealand's endangered species, few studies have investigated the abundance or distribution of tree-holes in native forests. We used complementary ground and climbed tree surveys to determine the abundance, distribution and characteristics of tree-holes in undisturbed Nothofagus forest in the Lewis Pass, New Zealand. We found that hole-bearing trees were surprisingly abundant compared with many other studies, including Australian Eucalyptus species and American beech. In fact, we estimated as many as 3906 tree-holes per hectare, of which 963 holes per hectare were potentially large enough to provide roost sites for hole-nesting bats in New Zealand, while only eight holes per hectare were potentially suitable for specialist hole-nesting birds. This was of great interest as primary cavity-excavating animals are absent from New Zealand forests, compared with North America and Australia. Moreover, tree-hole formation in New Zealand is likely to be dominated by abiotic processes, such as branch breakage from windstorms and snow damage. As has been found in many other studies, tree-holes were not uniformly distributed throughout the forest. Tree-holes were significantly more abundant on the least abundant tree species, Nothofagus fusca, than on either N. menziesii or N. solandri. In addition to tree species, tree size was also an important factor influencing the structural characteristics of tree-holes and their abundance in this forest. Moreover, these trends were not fully evident without climbed tree surveys. Our results revealed that ground-based surveys consistently underestimated the number of tree-holes present on Nothofagus trees, and illustrate the importance of using climbed inspections where possible in tree-hole surveys. We compare our results with other studies overseas and discuss how these are linked to the biotic and abiotic processes involved in tree-hole formation. We consider the potential implications of our findings for New Zealand's hole-dwelling fauna and how stand dynamics and past and future forest management practices will influence the structural characteristics of tree-holes and their abundance in remnant forest throughout New Zealand. ¬© 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.442836679,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,45,NA

Modeling of survey data in relation to environmental variables can be a powerful method for extrapolating abundances across a species' distribution and, consequently, calculating total abundances and ultimately trends. Research in this area has demonstrated that models of abundance are often unstable and produce spurious estimates, and until recently our ability to remove detection error limited the development of accurate models. The N-mixture model accounts for detection and abundance simultaneously and has been a significant advance in abundance modeling. Case studies that have tested these new models have demonstrated success for some species, but doubt remains over the appropriateness of standard N-mixture models for many species. Here we develop the Nmixture model to accommodate zero-inflated data, a common occurrence in ecology, by employing zero-inflated count models. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this method to modeling count data. We use four variants of the N-mixture model (Poisson, zeroinflated Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial) to model abundance, occupancy (zero-inflated models only) and detection probability of six birds in South Australia. We assess models by their statistical fit and the ecological realism of the parameter estimates. Specifically, we assess the statistical fit with AIC and assess the ecological realism by comparing the parameter estimates with expected values derived from literature, ecological theory, and expert opinion. We demonstrate that, despite being frequently ranked the ''best model'' according to AIC, the negative binomial variants of the N-mixture often produce ecologically unrealistic parameter estimates. The zero-inflated Poisson variant is preferable to the negative binomial variants of the N-mixture, as it models an ecological mechanism rather than a statistical phenomenon and generates reasonable parameter estimates. Our results emphasize the need to include ecological reasoning when choosing appropriate models and highlight the dangers of modeling statistical properties of the data. We demonstrate that, to obtain ecologically realistic estimates of abundance, occupancy and detection probability, it is essential to understand the sources of variation in the data and then use this information to choose appropriate error distributions. ¬© 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.413168206,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,22,NA

Although several advances have been made in our understanding of how this soil-borne pathogen interacts with plants and of how we may tackle it in natural systems, our ability to control the disease is limited. The pathogen occurs widely across Australia but the severity of its impact is most evident within ecological communities of the south-west and south-east of the country. A regional impact summary for all states and territories shows the pathogen to be the cause of serious disease in numerous species, a significant number of which are rare and threatened. Many genera of endemic taxa have a high proportion of susceptible species including the iconic genera Banksia, Epacris and Xanthorrhoea. Long-term studies in Victoria have shown limited but probably unsustainable recovery of susceptible vegetation, given current management practices. Management of the disease in conservation reserves is reliant on hygiene, the use of chemicals and restriction of access, and has had only limited effectiveness and not provided complete control. The deleterious impacts of the disease on faunal habitat are reasonably well documented and demonstrate loss of individual animal species and changes in population structure and species abundance. Few plant species are known to be resistant to P. cinnamomi; however, investigations over several years have discovered the mechanisms by which some plants are able to survive infection, including the activation of defence-related genes and signalling pathways, the reinforcement of cell walls and accumulation of toxic metabolites. Manipulation of resistance and resistance-related mechanisms may provide avenues for protection against disease in otherwise susceptible species. Despite the advances made in Phytophthora research in Australia during the past 40 years, there is still much to be done to give land managers the resources to combat this disease. Recent State and Federal initiatives offer the prospect of a growing and broader awareness of the disease and its associated impacts. However, awareness must be translated into action as time is running out for the large number of susceptible, and potentially susceptible, species within vulnerable Australian ecological communities. ¬© CSIRO 2008.",Review,Scopus,0.409428923,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,104,NA

In general, the highest densities and diversity of waterbirds, and of zooplankton, were found in the ponds towards the end of a treatment series. Filter-feeding waterfowl (Anatidae) probably used these ponds because of the availability of zooplankton as a food-source. Dissolved oxygen concentration generally increased along the treatment gradient and un-ionised sulphide concentration decreased, and it is possible that either one, or both, of these played a key role in determining the distribution of zooplankton. ¬© 2005 Springer.",Article,Scopus,0.359566502,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,110,NA

We compared species richness, abundance, and life history attributes for soil and canopy seed banks in relation to extant vegetation among four sites with different substrate conditions and high species turnover (50-80%) to identify whether this unusual community-level organization of seed storage might contribute to maintenance of high species richness. Soil seed bank (SSB) densities were low to moderate (233-1435 seeds/m2) compared with densities for other Mediterranean-type vegetation and were lowest for sites with highest canopy seed bank (CSB) species richness and lowest nutrient availability, but not richness or abundance of resprouters. Annuals were infrequent in the lowest nutrient sites, but there was no evidence that small SSB size was due to low seed inputs or a trade-off between seed production/storage and seed size in response to low nutrient availability. Sorensen's similarity between SSB and extant vegetation was 26-43% but increased to 54-57% when the CSB was included, representing levels higher than reported for most other ecosystems. Resprouting species were well represented in both the SSB and CSB, and there was no evidence for lower seed production in resprouters than in non-sprouters overall. The SSB and CSB held no species in common and were characterized by markedly different seed dispersal attributes, with winged or small seeds in the CSB and seeds dispersed by ants, birds, and wind (though none with wings) in the SSB. There was no evidence of spatial differentiation in the distribution of seeds of SSB species between vegetated and open microsites that might facilitate species coexistence, but most woody non-sprouters showed aggregation at scales of 1-2 m, implying limited seed dispersal. High similarity between overall seed bank (SSB+CSB) and extant species composition, high number of resprouting species, and seed dispersal processes before (SSB) and after fire (CSB) leading to differential spatial aggregation of post-fire recruits from the two seed bank types may buffer species composition against rapid change and provide a mechanism for maintaining species coexistence at the local scale. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.358010376,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,72,NA

However, our understanding of the process and our ability to predict its outcomes at a community scale are limited by the frequently large number of interactions associated with it. Here, we outline an approach to dealing with this complexity that reduces the number of unique interactions considered by classifying the participants according to their functional similarity. We derived a classification of dispersers based on the nature of the dispersal service they provide to plants. We described the quantities of fruit handled, the quality of handling and the diversity of plants to which the service is provided. We used ten broad disperser traits to group 26 detailed measures for each disperser. We then applied this approach to vertebrate dispersers in Australia's tropical forests. Using this we also develop a classification that may be more generally applicable. For each disperser, data relating to each trait was obtained either from the field or published literature. First, we identified dispersers whose service outcomes were so distinct that statistical analysis was not required and assigned them to functional groups. The remaining dispersers were assigned to functional groups using cluster analysis. The combined processes created 15 functional groups from 65 vertebrate dispersers in Australian tropical forests. Our approach-grouping dispersers on the basis of the type of dispersal service provided and the fruit types it is provided to-represents a means of reducing the complexity encountered in tropical seed dispersal systems and could be effectively applied in community level studies. It also represents a useful tool for exploring changes in dispersal services when the distribution and abundance of animal populations change due to human impacts. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.234589495,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,118,NA
