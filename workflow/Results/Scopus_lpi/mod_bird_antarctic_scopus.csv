The historical stronghold of the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome filholi) was New Zealand‚Äôs sub-Antarctic Campbell Island, but the population declined by 94¬†% between 1942 and 1984. The apparent mechanism of collapse was warm ocean temperatures causing an inadequate food supply. Eudyptes penguin population declines are ongoing at some breeding sites, highlighting the need to investigate the population trend on Campbell Island since 1984. We estimated the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin breeding population size through physical and photo-counts of birds and nests in 2012, and changes in colony area relative to 1984 and 1996 photographs. We estimated the 2012 population size at 33,239 breeding pairs, a 21.8¬†% decrease from an (adjusted) estimate of 42,528 pairs in 1984. Although substantial, the recent 1984‚Äì2012 decline occurred at a much slower rate (Œª¬†=¬†0.991) than the 1942‚Äì1984 decline (Œª¬†=¬†0.940). Despite great variation in trends between colonies ostensibly linked to differences in predation rates, the recent decline occurred primarily between 1984 and 1996, and thereafter the overall population grew. A 100-year time series of extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures (ERSST) confirmed that the population declined during warm periods and increased during cool periods, but that the initial decline began before increases in regional ERSST. Population growth after 1996 appears related to the current global warming hiatus, lower ERSST, and increased abundance of a key prey species. We predict a continuation of the long-term population decline after warming resumes. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.937334547,1,1,NA,15,5,1,5,19,NA

During an intensive survey between 1993 and 1995, breeding success was similar to that reported from other sites, although the first egg (A-egg) loss rate was lower on Amsterdam Island than at other localities. The mean age of first return to the breeding site and of first reproduction were respectively X = 4.2 ¬± SD of 2.1 years and X = 4.7 ¬± SD of 1.7 years. The adult survival rate, calculated between 1988 and 1993, was significantly lower one year after banding [X = 72.2 ¬± SD of 1.6%] than in subsequent years [X = 84.0 ¬± SD of 1.1%] due to the effect of banding. Immature survival rate was estimated at 39% during the first year after banding. Two birds banded as chicks have been found in Australia, suggesting that immatures winter off Southern Australia. The population on Amsterdam Island decreased at a rate of 2.7% per year between 1971 and 1993. Using the demographic parameters measured, we calculated a modelled rate of increase of 0.940 between 1988 and 1993, a value close to the observed rate of 0.943. Between 1982 to 1993, mean sea surface temperature near Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands decreased significantly, and this change was significantly related to the decline of Amsterdam Island population during the same period. Mean sea surface temperature decline could affect the Rockhopper Penguin population through changes of distribution and abundance of prey. Other factors such as the large increase of the Sub-Antarctic Fur Seal population at Amsterdam Island between 1971 and 1993 could have reduced the penguin population. Between 1971 and 1993, the Saint Paul population of penguins increased by 5.5% per year, but this is not significantly related to the mean sea surface temperature decrease.

Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from ""Vulnerable"" to ""Endangered."" Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years.

After adjusting for seasonal variation in numbers of breeding pairs based on studies at Ardery Island, East Antarctica, the total global population is estimated to be at least one million breeding pairs. Of this, 72% nest on islands of the Scotia Sea arc and the South Atlantic Ocean. The precision of the estimate on the total number of breeding pairs is low, as several colony estimates were only available as orders of magnitude. Furthermore, different timing of the surveys and the difficulties of censusing colonial cliff-nesting birds reduced the count accuracy.

The breeding aggregation on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia is believed to be larger than all others combined. We estimated the size of this population by calculating the area of suitable habitat and the density of occupied burrows within it. Some 670,000 occupied nests were estimated for the island at mid-incubation, representing 0.9 million pairs of breeding-age birds associated with South Georgia in the survey seasons (2005/06 and 06/07). This is 40-45% of the previous estimate, but still represents well over half of the global population.

It addresses correspondence between long-term population trends of inshore demersal fish and inshore-feeding Antarctic shags of this area, where an intensive commercial fishery for shag prey once operated. The analysis also includes comparable information on diet (by examination of regurgitated pellets), foraging patterns, and breeding output of shags from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, an area where no commercial finfish fishery has ever existed. Integral study of these parameters there showed that, in Antarctic shags, low breeding success and high foraging effort might imply low recruitment and high adult mortality, respectively, with both factors adversely affecting the population trends of this bird. In line with these premises, the declining trend observed in shag colonies on the South Shetland Islands appears to have been influenced by the concomitant decrease in abundance of two of their main prey, the nototheniids Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons, due to intensive industrial fishing in the area in the late 1970s. In comparison, no such pattern occurred for the Danco Coast colonies. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.847924953,1,1,NA,15,5,1,5,21,NA

The mean laying date of M. halli was in early October, five to six weeks ahead of M. giganteus. In both species males take the larger share (c. 54%) of incubation. The eggs of the two species are of the same size but in M. halli the egg formed a significantly higher proportion of the female body weight. On hatching M. giganteus chicks are 5% heavier than M. halli chicks but there are no sexual differences in weight. Brooding and guarding in M. halli is 11 days longer than in M giganteus and males undertake 60‚Äì68% of the duties during this time. Males of both species take five to six days longer to fledge than females and M. halli chicks have a seven to nine day shorter fledging period. The sex ratio amongst chicks is 1: 1. Chick growth (weight, culmen length and wing length) is summarized. Males reach higher peak and fledging weights than females in both species and have significantly larger bills through most of the fledging period. The increase in wing length was similar in both sexes until near the end of the fledging period. Adult M. halli tend to be shorter‚Äêwinged, larger‚Äêbilled and lighter in weight than M. giganteus at Bird Island. Chick mortality was on average c. 10% higher in M. giganteus than in M. halli leading to a lower overall breeding success in the former. Whilst the breeding population of M. giganteus seems to have stayed relatively stable M. halli has increased in numbers over the last 20 years. However 26‚Äê9‚Äê57‚Äì5% of birds colour‚Äêringed in 1978 did not breed in the subsequent two breeding seasons. Mean annual survival of breeding adults was c. 0‚Äì90. Breeding commenced between age 6 and 9 years with males possibly starting earlier than females. The increased population of M. halli and the better survival of their chicks is attributed to the considerable increase in breeding Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella which provide an abundance of carrion for M. halli nestlings during the first 30 days after hatching.

Decreases in seabird populations from the Antarctic Peninsula are widely recognized as a response to environmental change and anthropogenic influences such as tourism and building activities, thus highlighting the importance of monitoring to support mitigation measures. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.812143136,1,1,NA,15,10,1,10,23,NA

Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Ad√©lie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Ad√©lie penguin population change. Our approach is applicable to abundance data for a wide range of colonial, land-breeding marine species including other penguin species, flying seabirds and marine mammals. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al.",Article,Scopus,0.800014998,1,1,NA,5,10,1,10,2,NA

In addition, the rapid spread of tourism and the activities of researchers since the early 1960s have raised questions related to their real and potential impact on bird populations. Our data sets start in 1952 for several species of Antarctic seabirds and this study documents the trends over a 14-year period (1985-1999) in seven species breeding on Pointe G√©ologie archipelago (Terre Ad√©lie, Antarctica). This is the first study where the direct impact of destruction of breeding sites (for building of an airstrip) is examined and where such long-term populations trends have been assessed in such a number of Antarctic species at one site. Trends from 1985 show that for the whole archipelago and when excluding islands destroyed, Ad√©lie penguins and south polar skuas were the only species to show a significant increase (> 3.5% annual change). The others species showed opposite trends, three increasing slightly (southern fulmars + 0.4%, cape petrels + 2.3%, snow petrels + 0.9%) and two decreasing (emperor penguin - 0.9%, southern giant petrel - 3.9%). Three species particularly affected by the destruction of their breeding habitat (Ad√©lie penguin, cape petrel, snow petrel) showed the capability to restore their populations. The availability of food and nesting sites is discussed in relation to environmental change. Species feeding on krill (Ad√©lie penguins and cape petrels) increased more than other species; however, decrease of ice cover can increase availability of nesting sites.

Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early cr√®che stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years.

Their population centre has long been held to be South Georgia where populations were thought to comprise many million animals. Here we report the results of a recent census of the macaroni population at South Georgia undertaken using aerial survey methods. We report dramatic declines in numbers (~1.0 million breeding pairs) compared to numbers observed in the late 1970s (~5.4 million pairs), but show that these reductions have occurred principally at sites where numbers had previously been very large. During the breeding season, the main foraging grounds of birds from these sites overlap with the foraging grounds of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, a major competitor for their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We suggest that the redistribution of the macaroni penguin population at South Georgia reflects the recent recovery of fur seal populations and thus the ongoing consequences of human intervention at South Georgia, a process which started more than 2 centuries previously. The implied resource competition and the observed population changes may also be exacerbated by recent reductions in Antarctic krill abundance which have been linked with reductions in seasonal sea ice following recent, rapid, regional warming in the Antarctic; however, the recovery of fur seal populations, and the ongoing recovery of krill-eating whale populations argues that tropho-dynamic interactions may be sufficient to explain the observed changes. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators.

We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.761818988,NA,0,NA,NA,15,0,15,48,NA

We found that species-area curves, nestedness, and individual species' occurrences differed between island assemblages with and without rats. Rat-free islands had, on average, 2.1 more land bird species than rat-infested islands of similar size. Passerine bird communities on islands with and without rats were significantly nested, but nestedness was significantly higher on rat-free islands than on rat-infested islands. The presence of rats was associated with differences in the incidence of many, but not all bird species. On rat free islands the occurrence of all species increased with island area.

Current knowledge on the impact of climate changes on penguins is primarily based on Antarctic birds identified by using flipper bands. Although flipper bands have helped to answer many questions about penguin biology, they were shown in some penguin species to have a detrimental effect. Here, we present for a Subantarctic species, king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), reliable results on the effect of climate on survival and breeding based on unbanded birds but instead marked by subcutaneous electronic tags. We show that warm events negatively affect both breeding success and adult survival of this seabird. However, the observed effect is complex because it affects penguins at several spatio/temporal levels. Breeding reveals an immediate response to forcing during warm phases of El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation affecting food availability close to the colony. Conversely, adult survival decreases with a remote sea-surface temperature forcing (i.e., a 2-year lag warming taking place at the northern boundary of pack ice, their winter foraging place). We suggest that this time lag may be explained by the delay between the recruitment and abundance of their prey, adjusted to the particular 1-year breeding cycle of the king penguin. The derived population dynamic model suggests a 9% decline in adult survival for a 0.26¬∞C warming. Our findings suggest that king penguin populations are at heavy extinction risk under the current global warming predictions. ¬© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Article,Scopus,0.74427518,NA,0,survival rates,NA,15,0,15,33,NA

Five breeding colonies of Pygoscelis penguins from King George Island and Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were examined to (1) compare the responses of sympatric congeners to recent changes in their Antarctic ecosystem and (2) assess underlying causes for such responses. We used linear regression and correlation analyses to compare indices of abundance, recruitment, and summer breeding performance of the Ad√©lie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica). Breeding colonies of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins have declined by roughly 50% since the mid-1970s, and recruitment indices of Ad√©lie penguins have declined by roughly 80%, but no such patterns are evident for gentoo penguins. Fledging success, however, has remained stable at all breeding colonies. The different trends in abundance and recruitment indices for each species, despite generally similar indices of summer performance, suggest that winter conditions contribute to the divergent responses among the penguins.

One view ascribes it to an increase in availability of their prey brought on by the decrease in baleen whale stocks. The contrary opinion, attributes it to environmental warming. This causes a gradual decrease in the frequency of cold years with extensive winter sea ice cover. A number of penguin monitoring programs are in progress and are expected to provide some answers to these questions. Unfortunately, it is not easy to distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic change since penguins are easily accessible predators of krill and the feeding range of the penguins has almost overlapped with the krill fishery in time and space in the last four decades. Therefore it is important to reconstruct the change of ancient penguin abundance and distribution in the absence of human activity. Many efforts have focused on surveying the abandoned penguin rookeries, but this method has not been able to give a continuous historical record of penguin populations. In several recent studies, ancient penguin excreta was scooped from the penguin relics in the sediments of the lake on penguin rookery, Ardley Island, maritime Antarctica. In these studies, penguin droppings or guano soil deposited in the lake and changes in sediment geochemistry have been used to calculate penguin population changes based upon the geochemical composition of the sediment core. The results suggest that climate change has a significant impact on penguin populations.",Article,Scopus,0.728037947,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,?,15,74,NA

We analyzed a total of 144 stomach contents during three consecutive breeding seasons (2006‚Äì2007, 2007‚Äì2008 and 2008‚Äì2009) and stages (incubation, early and late chick-rearing). MP fed mainly on fuegian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), which represented 75¬†% of the biomass consumed by birds during the entire study. The next important prey was squat lobster (Munida gregaria), followed by Patagonian squid (Loligo gahi). Both sexes consumed similar prey items. We observed variation in diet relative composition among breeding years and stages. Fuegian sprat consumption decreased throughout the years whereas squat lobster increased. Penguins consumed a higher proportion of squat lobster and Patagonian squid during the incubation stage than in the chick-rearing stages, whereas fuegian sprat was almost the only prey item consumed during the late chick-rearing stage. MPs show certain flexibility in the use of resources probably as a response to changes in prey populations. Variability in the diet among different reproductive stages could be related to changes in the distribution and abundance of their main prey near the colony during the breeding season together with changes in the energy requirements of seabirds. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.722508585,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,77,NA

Penguins have exhibited dramatic declines in population size, and many studies have linked this to bottom-up processes altering the abundance of prey species. The effects of individual traits have been considered to a lesser extent, and top-down regulation through predation has been largely overlooked due to the difficulties in empirically measuring this at sea where it usually occurs. For 10¬†years (2003-2012), macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) were marked with subcutaneous electronic transponder tags and re-encountered using an automated gateway system fitted at the entrance to the colony. We used multistate mark-recapture modelling to identify the different drivers influencing survival rates and a sensitivity analysis to assess their relative importance across different life stages. Survival rates were low and variable during the fledging year (mean¬†=¬†0¬∑33), increasing to much higher levels from age 1 onwards (mean¬†=¬†0¬∑89). We show that survival of macaroni penguins is driven by a combination of individual quality, top-down predation pressure and bottom-up environmental forces. The relative importance of these covariates was age specific. During the fledging year, survival rates were most sensitive to top-down predation pressure, followed by individual fledging mass, and finally bottom-up environmental effects. In contrast, birds older than 1¬†year showed a similar response to bottom-up environmental effects and top-down predation pressure. We infer from our results that macaroni penguins will most likely be negatively impacted by an increase in the local population size of giant petrels. Furthermore, this population is, at least in the short term, likely to be positively influenced by local warming. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple causal effects across different life stages when examining the survival rates of seabirds. ¬© 2014 The Authors.

Opposite movements are very rare. In the Southern Ocean, the abundance of 13C declines markedly with more southern latitude, providing a characteristic 13C isoscape. This can be used as a tracer for the movement of seabirds between breeding and inter-breeding areas, by comparing stable isotope ratios of feathers grown at different times of the year.Results: We studied seasonal movements of Thin-billed prions (Aves, Procellariiformes), breeding at the Subantarctic Falkland/Malvinas Islands, compared with those of Wilson's storm-petrels breeding in the Antarctic South Shetland Islands. The two species showed opposite migratory movements. While Wilson's storm-petrels moved to warmer waters north of the Drake Passage in winter, Thin-billed prions showed a reversed movement towards more polar waters. Carbon stable isotope ratios in recent and historical feathers indicated that poleward winter movements of Thin-billed prions were less common historically (45% in 1913-1915), and have only recently become dominant (92% in 2003-2005), apparently in response to warming sea temperatures.Conclusions: This study shows that pelagic seabirds can rapidly change migration strategies within populations, including migration towards more poleward waters in winter. ¬© 2010 Quillfeldt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.702034278,0,NA,NA,10,NA,,,13,NA

Four survey methods were employed as part of a multi-species research programme to develop methods for surveying marine mammals and seabird populations in aquaculture management areas. Two of the techniques, involving continuous timelapse photography of mussel farms and boat-based surveys through coastal farms were developed for this study. Timelapse cameras showed that mussel farms buoys were used by king shags as temporary resting sites only. King shags were recorded on 36% of the farms (n = 44) from 13 surveys within inner Admiralty Bay. The low number of sightings within mussel farms suggests that farms are not important foraging or resting areas for king shags, at least in Admiralty Bay. The foraging range and density of king shags was not known before farms were developed, so no direct comparison or impact assessment can be made. Boat-based surveys were used to estimate the density of foraging shags, which showed that daily locations of foraging birds at sea can vary considerably on consecutive days and over the season. Previous environmental surveys to assess impacts of mussel farms on foraging areas are therefore unlikely to adequately represent the entire foraging range or most important feeding areas. The number of breeding pairs, chicks and nests was also found to vary considerably at colonies, dependent on when counts were undertaken during their protracted breeding season. Open water mid-bay aquaculture (shellfish and finfish) potentially poses a greater threat to king shags than 'coastal ribbon development', in terms of loss of open water habitat from farm structures, and loss of foraging habitat through modification to the water column (e.g., turbidity) and seabed. Given the lack of knowledge about the king shag population dynamics, diet and prey availability, there is an urgent requirement for more research to fill these gaps and also understand how we can conserve important shag feeding areas and associated marine environment through sustainable management of aquaculture. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.696126615,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,56,NA

The seasonal structure of the assemblages presented differences between summer and winter. In terms of abundance, Black-browed albatrosses presented the highest contribution to the assemblage in summer (87.5%).

Previous studies have provided evidence that krill utilize zooplankton through austral winter when the primary production is negligible. Though they are different, all survival strategies produce the same result, a decrease in total zooplankton biomass. It is difficult to examine the total zooplankton biomass balance and process rates from traditional net tow samples because of the spatial variation in zooplankton distribution and the lack of applicable mathematical methods to estimate population process rates. This study focuses on short-term (overnight) loss rates of mesozooplankton associated with adult krill grazing in austral fall and the long-term (winter) body growth and removal rates of mesozooplankton in austral winter based on measurements of zooplankton size structures obtained using an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). In order to target an adult Euphausia superba aggregation for a short period, a 153 kHz Vessel-Mounted (VM) Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used for the acoustic backscattering. The in situ process rates of growth and mortality are estimated based on the biomass balance and biomass spectrum theory. The overnight in situ grazing by adult E. superba on mesozooplankton is examined based on the in situ measurements of mesozooplankton biovolume within the water where an adult E. superba aggregation remained during a short study period in late April. The measurements show that approximately 16% of the existing mesozooplankton biovolume was removed in 4 h, which leads to an average specific daily grazing rate of 0.96day -1 assuming a daily feeding period of 16 h from dusk to dawn. From the amount of biovolume removed and the abundance of adult euphausiids of approximately 3 individuals m -3 estimated from the volume backscattering strength and the size of adult euphausiids, the daily ration for an adult euphausiid is approximately equal to 7% body biovolume or biomass day -1. The total mesozooplankton biovolume decreased at a specific rate of 0.017day -1 over the austral winter 2002, while the specific individual body growth was approximately 0.045day -1. The sum of these two rates leads to the specific mortality rate equal to approximately 0.07day -1 for the winter. These rates lead to a system efficiency of 67% for recycling the biomass during the winter. The measurements indicate that approximately 90% of biovolume (biomass) was removed in the period between the fall cruise in April-May and the winter cruise in August-September 2002. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to appraise the stability of the emperor penguin populations at six colonies in the western Ross Sea, we used linear regression analysis to evaluate chick abundance trends (1983-2005) and Pearson's r correlation to assess their relation to two local and two large-scale climate variables. We detected only one significant abundance trend; the Cape Roget colony increased from 1983 to 1996 (n = 6). Higher coefficients of variation in chick abundances at smaller colonies (Cape Crozier, Beaufort Island, Franklin Island) suggest that such colonies occupy marginal habitat, and are more susceptible to environmental change. We determined chick abundance to be most often correlated with local Ross Sea climate variables (sea ice extent and sea surface temperature), but not in consistent patterns across the colonies. We propose that chick abundance is most impacted by fine scale sea ice extent and local weather events, which are best evaluated by on-site assessments.

In this paper we developed simple conceptual models to decipher the role of climate and krill fluctuations on the population dynamics of these three Pygoscelis penguin species inhabiting the Antarctic Peninsula region. Our results suggest that the relevant processes underlying the population dynamics of these penguin species at King George Island (South Shetland Islands) are intra-specific competition and the combined effects of krill abundance and sea-ice cover. Our results using population theoretical models appear to support that climate change, specifically regional warming on the western Antarctic Peninsula, represents a major driver. At our study site, penguins showed species-specific responses to climate change. While Chinstrap penguins were only influenced by krill abundance, the contrasting population trends of Ad√©lie and Gentoo penguins appear to be better explained by the ""sea-ice hypothesis"".

Inshore, the ecological role of demersal fish is more important than that of krill. There, demersal fish are major consumers of benthos and also feed on zooplankton (mainly krill in summer). They are links between lower and upper levels of the food web and are common prey of other fish, birds and seals. Offshore, demersal fish depend less on benthos and feed more on zooplankton (mainly krill) and nekton, and are less accessible as prey of birds and seals. There, pelagic fish (especially lantern fish) are more abundant than inshore and play an important role in the energy flow from macrozooplankton to higher trophic levels (seabirds and seals). Through the higher fish predators, energy is transferred to land in the form of fish remains, pellets (birds), regurgitation and faeces (birds and seals). However, in the general context of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, krill (Euphausia superba) plays the central role in the food web because it is the main food source in terms of biomass for most of the high level predators from demersal fish up to whales. This has no obvious equivalent in other marine ecosystems. In Antarctic offshore coastal and oceanic waters the greatest proportion of energy from the ecosystem is transferred to land directly through krill consumers, such as flying birds, penguins, and seals. Beside krill, the populations of fish in the Antarctic Ocean are the second most important element for higher predators, in particular the energy-rich pelagic Myctophidae in open waters and the pelagic Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the high Antarctic zone. Although the occurrence of these pelagic fish inshore has been poorly documented, their abundance in neritic waters could be higher than previously believed.",Review,Scopus,0.67079463,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,58,NA

Breeding colonies of the Antarctic petrel are often found on isolated nunataks far from inhabited stations, some up to hundreds of kilometers from the shoreline. It is difficult therefore to monitor and census known colonies, and it is believed that undiscovered breeding locations remain to be found. We developed an algorithm that can detect Antarctic petrel colonies and used it to complete a continent-wide survey using Landsat-8 Operational Line Imager (OLI) imagery in Antarctica up to the southernmost extent of Landsat's orbital view at 82.68¬∞S. Our survey successfully identified 8 known Antarctic petrel colonies containing 86% of the known population of Antarctic petrels.

The algorithm represents a first-ever attempt to apply satellite remote sensing to assess the distribution and abundance of the Antarctic petrel on a continent-wide basis. As such, we note several algorithm shortcomings and identify research topics for algorithm improvement. Even with these caveats, our algorithm for identifying Antarctic petrel colonies with Landsat imagery demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring their populations using satellite remote sensing and identifies breeding locations, including Mt. Biscoe, that should be considered high priorities for validation with directed field surveys. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.664508796,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,32,NA

A ship-based multiple-frequency acoustic-backscatter survey was used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Net tows, hydrographic profiles, and meteorological data were collected to measure biological and physical processes that might affect the krill population. During the survey, the distribution and behavior of several krill predators [chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica), cape petrels (Daption capense), and Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)] were measured from the vessel by visual observations.

Several aspects of the nearshore ecosystem changed after the near gale including: hydrography of the upper 100 m of the water column, phytoplankton biomass, the abundance and distribution of krill, and the distribution of some krill predators. Differences in these parameters were also measured between the two canyons.

Evidence for such migrations arises from seasonality of historic whaling catches by latitude, Discovery and natural mark returns, and results of satellite tagging studies. Feeding is generally believed to be limited to the southern polar region, where Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been identified as the primary prey item. Non-migrations and / or suspended migrations to the polar feeding grounds have previously been reported from a summer presence of whales in the Benguela System, where feeding on euphausiids (E. lucens), hyperiid amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii), mantis shrimp (Pterygosquilla armata capensis) and clupeid fish has been described. Three recent research cruises (in October/November 2011, October/November 2014 and October/November 2015) identified large tightly-spaced groups (20 to 200 individuals) of feeding humpback whales aggregated over at least a one-month period across a 220 nautical mile region of the southern Benguela System. Feeding behaviour was identified by lunges, strong milling and repetitive and consecutive diving behaviours, associated bird and seal feeding, defecations and the pungent ""fishy"" smell of whale blows. Although no dedicated prey sampling could be carried out within the tightly spaced feeding aggregations, observations of E. lucens in the region of groups and the full stomach contents of mantis shrimp from both a co-occurring predatory fish species (Thyrsites atun) and one entangled humpback whale mortality suggest these may be the primary prey items of at least some of the feeding aggregations. Reasons for this recent novel behaviour pattern remain speculative, but may relate to increasing summer humpback whale abundance in the region. These novel, predictable, inter-annual, low latitude feeding events provide considerable potential for further investigation of Southern Hemisphere humpback feeding behaviours in these relatively accessible low-latitude waters.",Article,Scopus,0.652854673,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,84,NA

Pygoscelis adeliae), is constrained by oceanographic features related to the physiography of the region. This hypothesis grew from the supposition that breeding colonies in the WAP during summer are located adjacent to areas of complex bathymetry where circulation and upwelling processes appear to ensure predictable food resources. Therefore, we tested the additional hypothesis that these areas continue to contribute to the foraging strategy of this species throughout the non-breeding winter season. We used satellite telemetry data collected as part of the SO GLOBEC program during the austral winters of 2001 and 2002 to characterize individual penguin foraging locations in relation to bathymetry, sea ice variability within the pack ice, and wind velocity and divergence (as a proxy for potential areas with cracks and leads). We also explored differences between males and females in core foraging area overlap. Ocean depth was the most influential variable in the determination of foraging location, with most birds focusing their effort on shallow (<200. m) waters near land and on mixed-layer (200-500. m) waters near the edge of deep troughs. Within-ice variability and wind (as a proxy for potential areas with cracks and leads) were not found to be influential variables, which is likely because of the low resolution satellite imagery and model outputs that were available. Throughout the study period, all individuals maintained a core foraging area separated from other individuals with very little overlap. However, from a year with light sea ice to one with heavy ice cover (2001-2002), we observed an increase in the overlap of individual female foraging areas with those of other birds, likely due to restricted access to the water column, reduced prey abundance, or higher prey concentration. Male birds maintained separate core foraging areas with the same small amount of overlap, showing no difference in overlap between the years. While complex bathymetry was an important physical variable influencing the Ad√©lie penguin's foraging, the analysis of sea ice data of a higher resolution than was available for this study may help elucidate the role of sea ice in affecting Ad√©lie penguin winter foraging behavior within the pack ice. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.648328452,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,63,NA

Most seabirds off the west coast were concentrated near to the coast or over the edge of the continental shelf. These are sites where forms of upwelling bring water rich in nutrients to the surface of the sea. The most birds were seen in March, April and May, the least in November. Most common over the shelf-edge were, in order of abundance, Blackbrowed Albatross, Cape Hens, Shy Albatross, Yellownosed Albatross, Wilson‚Äôs Storm Petrels, Cape Gannets, Common/Arctic Terns, and Antarctic Skuas.

Traditionally, population estimates have involved direct counts, but remote sensing and digital mapping methodologies can provide us with alternative techniques for assessing the size and distribution of penguin populations. Here, we demonstrate the use of a field-based digital mapping system (DMS), combining a handheld geographic information system with integrated geographical positioning system as a method for: (a) assessing penguin colony area and (b) ground-truthing colony area as derived from satellite imagery. Work took place at Signy Island, South Orkneys, where colonies of the three congeneric pygoscelid penguins: Ad√©lie Pygoscelis adeliae, chinstrap P. antarctica and gentoo P. papua were surveyed. Colony areas were derived by mapping colony boundaries using the DMS with visual counts of the number of nesting birds made concurrently. Area was found to be a good predictor for number of nests for all three species of penguin. Using a maximum likelihood multivariate classification of remotely sensed satellite imagery (QuickBird2, 18 January 2010; Digital Globe ID: 01001000B90AD00), we were able to identify penguin colonies from the spectral signature of guano and differentiate between colonies of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins. The area classified (all species combined) from satellite imagery versus area from DMS data was closely related (R2¬†=¬†0.88). Combining these techniques gives a simple and transferrable methodology for examining penguin distribution and abundance at local and regional scales. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.644180111,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,69,NA

The glacially sculpted coastline along the peninsula is highly convoluted and characterized by deep embayments that are often interconnected by channels that facilitate transport of heat and nutrients into the shelf domain. The ecosystem is divided into three subregions, the continental slope, shelf and coastal regions, each with unique ocean dynamics, water mass and biological distributions. The WAP shelf lies within the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) and like other SIZs, the WAP system is very productive, supporting large stocks of marine mammals, birds and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Ecosystem dynamics is dominated by the seasonal and interannual variation in sea ice extent and retreat. The Antarctic Peninsula is one among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, having experienced a 2¬∞C increase in the annual mean temperature and a 6¬∞C rise in the mean winter temperature since 1950. Delivery of heat from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has increased significantly in the past decade, sufficient to drive to a 0.6¬∞C warming of the upper 300 m of shelf water. In the past 50 years and continuing in the twenty-first century, the warm, moist maritime climate of the northern WAP has been migrating south, displacing the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate and causing multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. Ecosystem responses to the regional warming include increased heat transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines in ice-dependent Ad√©lie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins, alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition and changes in krill recruitment, abundance and availability to predators.

As the seabird with the largest population in Antarctica, penguin is a unique indicator of Antarctic environment and climate changes. In this study, we collected an ornithogenic sediment core from Gardner Island in Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica, reconstructed an 8,500 years variation history of penguin population and vegetation abundance on this island, and examined the evolution of the penguin colony. We used the levels of two molecular markers cholesterol and cholestanol as the proxy indicators of penguin population size. Other molecular markers, including C24:0 alkenoic acid, C18n-alkanol and phytol were used as the proxy indicators of aquatic moss, algae, and general vegetation, respectively. It is shown that the growth of algae was mainly affected by the nutritional supply from penguin droppings, so their abundance was positively linked with penguin population. The growth of aquatic moss, however, was controlled more by the degree of water body transparency than by nutrient availability. Because the pollution of water body increased as penguin population grew, aquatic moss abundance showed a seesaw-like relationship with penguin population. These results suggested that penguins played a dominant role in this simple ecosystem in the Antarctic environment. The reconstructed relationship between penguin population and vegetation abundance may offer new insights to understand ancient Antarctic environment and ecology. ¬© 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.625332024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,52,NA

A single species yield model is currently being used by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to recommend an annual krill catch limit which is expressed as a proportion (Œ≥ = 0.116) of a survey biomass estimate. This approach takes the needs of predators into account in only a crude way by assuming that a median krill escapement of 75% of its unexploited biomass would be sufficient to meet the needs of predators. A krill-predator modeling procedure is presented that could be used to directly assess the impact of krill harvesting on krill predator populations and therefore to revise this recommended harvesting level (Œ≥) for Antarctic krill. Application of a deterministic form of this model to an Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) data set from Bird Island South Georgia Antarctica indicates that the level of krill fishing intensity (Œ≥) that would reduce this population to half the equilibrium size in the absence of krill fishing (Œ≥(half)) lies between 0.03 and 0.18, which includes the level recommended by CCAMLR. This large range results primarily from the sensitivity of the model to the maximum growth rate parameter, for which a range of 5-15%/yr is investigated. A plausible range of values for this parameter (5-15%/yr) results in estimated Œ≥(half) values from 0.04 to 0.23. Stochastic calculations (which take account of interannual fluctuations in the abundance of the krill population due to recruitment variability) yield higher estimated Œ≥(half) values than the less realistic deterministic calculations. However, simulation tests indicate that the estimated Œ≥(half) values are biased upward; this modeling approach is therefore likely to yield Œ≥(half) values that would lead to a depletion of the Antarctic fur seal population to more than half its pristine size.",Article,Scopus,0.601585081,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,50,NA

This gives them the potential to act as sentinels of environmental change. The rafting kelp-associated Gaimardia trapesina is one such species, widely distributed in the Southern Ocean. In 2015 and 2016, the size structure, diet, and distribution of G. trapesina were examined around the Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEI) to establish benchmark data and explore their potential use for monitoring long-term change. Gaimardia trapesina and its potential food sources were collected and analysed for size structure, attachment strength, and diet, using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. The populations examined were dominated by relatively small individuals. The strength of attachment to kelp blades was low and the byssal threads showed high elasticity. The PEI lie in the path of the west‚Äìeast flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the highest abundances of G. trapesina were found on the downstream sides of both islands, while the species was absent from the western, upstream coasts. Both diet analyses and SIAR mixing models indicated that G. trapesina feeds on suspended particulate matter, while kelp particles contribute minimally to the diet.

Phenological constraints are particularly demanding in avian species because of the necessity of matching chick provisioning with high food abundance, while allocating time for migration. Within avian species, seabird phenology is of particular interest because many seabird species exhibit colonial breeding behaviour. Penguins, representing roughly 90¬†% of the biomass in the Southern Ocean, are well studied in the context of population dynamics, prey abundance, and phenology. Here I review the annual cycles of Pygoscelis penguins, a genus including gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and Ad√©lie (Pygoscelis adeliae) penguins, to better understand what is known about their phenology, what causes known changes, and how their phenology influences fitness. Major differences exist between species, particularly in relation to winter migration, incubation shifts, and the timing of breeding. Even with the numerous studies examining phenology in Pygoscelis penguins, large gaps in our understanding of plasticity in the annual cycle remain. In particular, certain phases are neglected because they are logistically difficult to record or have erroneously been ignored. In addition, temporally, large gaps exist in our understanding of phenology, where studies have not been updated in over 20¬†years at a particular field site. Because phenology does vary greatly between years, depending on the colony, when possible, researchers should strive to update phenological records by recording the dates of phases each year. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Review,Scopus,0.592446888,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,38,NA

Although foraging behavior of this species has been extensively studied throughout the broad continental shelf region of the Ross Sea, this is the first study to report foraging behaviors and habitat affiliations among birds occupying continental slope waters. Continental slope habitat supports the greatest abundances of this species throughout its range, but we lack information about how intra-specific competition for prey might affect foraging and at-sea distribution and how these attributes compare with previous Ross Sea studies. Foraging trips increased in both distance and duration as breeding advanced from guard to cr√®che stage, but foraging dive depth, dive rates, and vertical dive distances travelled per hour decreased. Consistent with previous studies within slope habitats elsewhere in Antarctic waters, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated chick meal composition, but fish increased four-fold from guard to cr√®che stages. Foraging-, focal-, and core areas all doubled during the cr√®che stage as individuals shifted distribution in a southeasterly direction away from the coast while simultaneously becoming more widely dispersed (i. e., less spatial overlap among individuals). Intra-specific competition for prey among Ad√©lie penguins appears to influence foraging behavior of this species, even in food webs dominated by Antarctic krill. ¬© 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.585153847,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,35,NA

In contrast, the other 2% contains an extraordinary array of aquatic environments including ice-covered freshwater and saline lakes and ephemeral streams. Lakes are found mostly in coastal, ice marginal regions in the Antarctic (Doran et al. 1994). Because of the great differences in mean-annual temperature related to the locations of these aquatic systems (Fig. 1), the temporal extent of ice covers on the lakes varies greatly. There are lakes that are ice-covered for part of each year, while there are perennially ice-covered systems in the dry valleys region of Southern Victoria Land where only 'moats' (ie ice-free littoral zones) form during the warmest summers. Because ice cover greatly influences both the physical and biological processes occurring within lakes, the extent and thickness of ice cover is an extremely important parameter in the biogeochemistry of Antarctic lakes (Wharton et al. 1993, Fritsen and Priscu 1999). Paleolimnological investigations demonstrate that climate variations have greatly impacted the extent of ice cover, in addition to the overall hydrology of Antarctic lakes throughout the Holocene back into the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Wilson 1964, Bird et al. 1991, Bjorck et al. 1996, Fulford-Smith and Sikes 1996, Gore et al. 1996, Lyons et al. 1998b, Hendy 2000). Much of the paleolimnological work from Antarctic lakes has recently been summarized by Hodgson et al. (2004) and Doran et al. (2004) and will not be repeated here. Some of the earlier work on Antarctic lakes illustrated its value in delineating changes in the hydrologic response to climate (Wilson 1964). The integration of paleolimnological data with more recent observations has provided important insights into how these lakes respond to climate change (eg Gibson and Burton 1996, allied with the work of Roberts et al. 2001 in the Vestfold Hills and Poreda et al. 2004, allied with Hendy 2000 in Taylor Valley, Victoria Land). Understanding the impact of climate on the hydrologic balance of Antarctic lakes, and in turn, the influence of hydrologic changes on the overall ecology of these systems is a major challenge to Antarctic limnologists. This will be especially true in the future period of anthropogenically-induced climate change. Kejna (2003) has recently reviewed the air temperature records from 34 stations around the Antarctic continent. The data span from 1958-2000 for 21 stations and for 1981-2000 for all the stations. In general, warming has occurred on the Antarctic Peninsula and in interior West Antarctica, with Faraday Station, on the west coast of the Peninsula having increased at a rate of 0.67¬∞C per decade over the period 1958- 2000. Many of the coastal stations in East Antarctica also demonstrated an increase in temperature over the longer time interval. However, since 1981, many regions of the continent, especially in East Antarctica, have shown a cooling. For example, Casey shows a 0.82¬∞C per decade decrease (Kejna 2003). There has also been a weakening of the warming rate on the Peninsula during the last 20 years. Because Antarctic lakes are so sensitive to both increases and decreases in temperature (ie Wilson 1964, Gibson and Barton 1996, Foreman et al. 2004), the direct monitoring of Antarctic lakes provides an excellent sentinel of climate change, especially as climate impacts the local hydrologic cycle. Climate variation and change are not the only factors affecting Antarctic lakes. The activities of mammal and bird populations also exert considerable influence on the physical, chemical and biological evolution of many Antarctic limnetic systems. Human activities can also be important in certain situations. For example, Heywood Lake, on Signy Island, has undergone eutrophication in the last 30 years because of input of nutrients from an expanding fur seal population within the catchment (Butler 1999). This has led to increased microbial abundance and changes in the structure of the ecosystem, with phytoplankton taxa more typical of polluted waters, as opposed to the more oligotrophic waters that existed in the 1970s and early 1980s (Butler 1999) before the fur seal population explosion. Eutrophication has led to longer periods of lake anoxia during winter thermal stratification and changes in seasonal biological patterns within the lake. Recent work in the Larsemann Hills has demonstrated that lakes impacted by human activities such as grey water and human waste discharge and even rock crushing by tracked vehicles have enhanced nutrient and total dissolved solid loads (Kaup and Burgess 2002). A comparison of human impacted catchments with catchments with little direct human activity indicates that the levels of dissolved nitrogen compounds were generally much higher in the human-influenced catchments. Salinities were also up to an order of magnitude higher in the human impacted catchments (Kaup and Burgess 2002). Monitoring the response of lake dynamics to changing climate has long been recognized as an important task (Wilson 1981). The linkage between changing climate and lake dynamics becomes even more complicated in lakes that are influenced by direct human impacts. Most investigations of Antarctic lakes have been conducted over limited time periods (1-3 years). Although these short-term studies have been extremely important in establishing base-line conditions, determining the taxa that are present, and understanding biogeochemical processes in the lakes, they are not conducive to establishing long-term limnological trends. Our paper focuses on studies resulting in long-term data comparisons that have produced information about biological and/or physical and chemical trends thought to be driven by changing climatic parameters. This focus greatly limits the resources available to compare long-term trends that do exist and historic information on Antarctic limnology because it eliminates numerous one-time studies of specific limnetic systems in various parts of the continent. (We differentiate between longterm and historic data by defining 'long-term' as relatively continuous records through time and 'historic' as data collected with time gaps between collections). In addition, this paper will not address trends in the epishelf lakes that exist on the continent especially in the Bunger Hills and Schirmacher Oasis regions (Bormann and Fritzsche 1995, Doran et al. 2000, Gibson and Andersen 2002). For information on epishelf lakes, see Gibson et al. this volume. Because of the important differences in the climate regimes within the Antarctic, we have separated our discussion into geographic regimes that have been used previously (Convey 2001). ¬© 2006 Springer.",Book Chapter,Scopus,0.583347875,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,86,NA

As a result, wildlife exposure to POPs across the Southern Ocean is poorly understood. In this study, we report the differential exposure of the major southern ocean scavengers, the giant petrels, to POPs across a wide latitudinal gradient. Selected POPs (PCBs, HCB, DDTs, PBDEs) and related compounds, such as Dechlorane Plus (DP), were analyzed in plasma of southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) breeding on Livingston (62¬∞S 61¬∞W, Antarctica), Marion (46¬∞S 37¬∞E, sub-Antarctic), and Gough (40¬∞S 10¬∞W, cool temperate) islands. Northern giant petrels (Macronectes halli) from Marion Island were also studied. Stable isotope ratios of C and N (Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N) were used as dietary tracers of the marine habitat and trophic level, respectively. Breeding locality was a major factor explaining petrel exposure to POPs compared with species and sex. Significant relationships between Œ¥13C values and POP burdens, at both inter- and intra-population levels, support latitudinal variations in feeding grounds as a key factor in explaining petrel pollutant burdens. Overall, pollutant levels in giant petrels decreased significantly with latitude, but the relative abundance (%) of the more volatile POPs increased towards Antarctica. DP was found at negligible levels compared with legacy POPs in Antarctic seabirds. Spatial POP patterns found in giant petrels match those predicted by global distribution models, and reinforce the hypothesis of atmospheric long-range transport as the main source of POPs in Antarctica. Our results confirm that wildlife movements out of the polar region markedly increase their exposure to POPs. Therefore, strategies for Antarctic wildlife conservation should consider spatial heterogeneity in exposure to marine pollution. Of particular relevance is the need to clarify the exposure of Antarctic predators to emerging contaminants that are not yet globally regulated. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.57959608,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,85,NA

During the last glacial period, Antarctic terrestrial and marine life was challenged by even more extreme environmental conditions. During the present interglacial period, polar life in the Southern Ocean is sustained mainly by large-scale primary production. We argue that during the last glacial period, faunal populations in the Antarctic were limited to very few areas of local marine productivity (polynyas), because complete, multiannual sea-ice and ice shelf coverage shut down most of the Southern Ocean productivity within today's seasonal sea-ice zone. Both marine sediments containing significant numbers of planktonic and benthic foraminifera and fossil bird stomach oil deposits in the adjacent Antarctic hinterland provide indirect evidence for the existence of polynyas during the last glacial period. We advocate that the existence of productive oases in the form of polynyas during glacial periods was essential for the survival of marine and most higher-trophic terrestrial fauna. Reduced to such refuges, much of today's life in the high Antarctic realm might have hung by a thread during the last glacial period, because limited resources available to the food web restricted the abundance and productivity of both Antarctic terrestrial and marine life. ¬© 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.576152921,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,40,NA

Understanding the foraging ecology of these species in the Southern Ocean is important for monitoring and ecosystem conservation and management. Methodology/Principal Findings: Tracking data from sooty and short-tailed shearwaters from three regions of New Zealand and Australia were combined with at-sea observations of shearwaters in the Southern Ocean, physical oceanography, nearsurface copepod distributions, pelagic trawl data, and synoptic near-surface winds. Shearwaters from all three regions foraged in the Polar Front zone, and showed particular overlap in the region around 140¬∞E. Short-tailed shearwaters from South Australia also foraged in Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front. The spatial distribution of shearwater foraging effort in the Polar Front zone was matched by patterns in large-scale upwelling, primary production, and abundances of copepods and myctophid fish. Oceanic winds were found to be broad determinants of foraging distribution, and of the flight paths taken by the birds on long foraging trips to Antarctic waters. Conclusions/Significance: The shearwaters displayed foraging site fidelity and overlap of foraging habitat between species and populations that may enhance their utility as indicators of Southern Ocean ecosystems. The results highlight the importance of upwellings due to interactions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with large-scale bottom topography, and the corresponding localised increases in the productivity of the Polar Front ecosystem. ¬© 2010 Raymond et al.",Article,Scopus,0.569686661,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,47,NA

Studying habitat selection through modeling may provide useful information on the relationships between this species and its environment, especially relevant in a climate change context, where habitat availability may change. Validating the predictive capability of habitat selection models with independent data is a vital step in assessing the performance of such models and their potential for predicting species' distribution in poorly documented areas. From the results of ground surveys conducted in the Casey region (2002-2003, Wilkes Land, East Antarctica), habitat selection models based on a dataset of 4000 nests were created to predict the nesting distribution of snow petrels as a function of topography and substrate. In this study, the Casey models were tested at Mawson, 3800 km away from Casey. The location and characteristics of approximately 7700 snow petrel nests were collected during ground surveys (Summer 2004-2005). Using GIS, predictive maps of nest distribution were produced for the Mawson region with the models derived from the Casey datasets and predictions were compared to the observed data. Models performance was assessed using classification matrixes and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Overall correct classification rates for the Casey models varied from 57% to 90%. However, two geomorphologically different sub-regions (coastal islands and inland mountains) were clearly distinguished in terms of habitat selection by Casey model predictions but also by the specific variations in coefficients of terms in new models, derived from the Mawson data sets. Observed variations in the snow petrel aggregations were found to be related to local habitat availability. We discuss the applicability of various types of models (GLM, CT) and investigate the effect of scale on the prediction of snow petrel habitats. While the Casey models created with data collected at the nest scale did not perform well at Mawson due to regional variations in nest micro-characteristics, the predictive performance of models created with data compiled at a coarser scale (habitat units) was satisfactory. Substrate type was the most robust predictor of nest presence between Casey and Mawson. This study demonstrate that it is possible to predict at the large scale the presence of snow petrel nests based on simple predictors such as topography and substrate, which can be obtained from aerial photography. Such methodologies have valuable applications in the management and conservation of this top predator and associated resources and may be applied to other Antarctic, Sub-Antarctic and lower latitudes species and in a variety of habitats.

We investigated the distribution, abundance and feeding behaviour of seabirds in the Mozambique Channel in relation to physical and biological environmental variables, with a specific interest in mesoscale features. Seabird censuses were conducted in summer and winter during 7 cruises in the southern and northern Mozambique Channel. Tropical species accounted for 49% of the 37 species identified and 97% of the individuals, and species from the sub-Antarctic region constituted 30% of the identifications. The typically tropical sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscata) was the dominant species during all cruises, and overall accounted for 74% of the species observations and 85% of counted birds. Outputs of Generalised Linear Models at the scale of the Mozambique Channel suggested that higher densities of flying and feeding birds occurred in areas with lower sea surface temperatures and lower surface chlorophyll a concentrations. Most of the flocks of feeding birds did not associate with surface schools of fish or marine mammals, but when they did, these flocks were larger, especially when associated with tuna. While tropical species seemed to favour cyclonic eddies, frontal and divergence zones, non-tropical species were more frequently recorded over shelf waters. Sooty terns foraged preferentially in cyclonic eddies where zooplankton, micronekton and tuna schools were abundant. Among other major tropical species, frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) predominated in frontal zones between eddies, where tuna schools also frequently occurred and where geostrophic currents were the strongest. Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) concentrated in divergence zones characterised by low sea level anomalies, low geostrophic currents, and high zooplankton biomass close to the surface. Our results highlight the importance of mescoscale features in structuring the tropical seabird community in the Mozambique Channel, in addition to segregating tropical and non-tropical species. The mechanisms underlying the segregation of tropical seabirds seem to partially differ from that of other tropical regions, and this may be a consequence of the strong local mesoscale activity, affecting prey size and availability schemes. Beyond characterising the foraging habitats of the seabird community of the Mozambique Channel, this study highlights the importance of this region as a hot spot for seabirds; especially the southern part, where several endangered sub-Antarctic species over-winter. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.566237441,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,59,NA

On Marion Island, larvae of the moth Pringleophaga marioni are one of the key decomposers. Abundance of these caterpillars is higher in newly abandoned Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) nests than other habitats, and this observation has been explained by hypotheses regarding the thermal and nutrient advantages of nests. These hypotheses require a mechanism for increasing the abundance of caterpillars, since nests are an ephemeral resource, and here, we determine whether caterpillars respond to chemosensory and thermal cues using a laboratory choice chamber approach. Caterpillars show no significant preference for newly abandoned nest material over no other choice, old nest material, and the common mire moss Sanionia uncinata. Caterpillars that are acclimated to warm (15 ¬∞C) conditions do prefer lower (5 ¬∞C) to higher (15 ¬∞C) temperatures, perhaps reflecting negative effects of prolonged exposure to warm temperatures on growth. Caterpillars also show significant avoidance of conspecifics, possibly because of incidental cannibalism previously reported in this species. Thus, we find no empirical support for nest-finding ability in caterpillars based on chemosensory or thermal cues. It is possible that adult females or very early instar caterpillars show such ability, or high caterpillar density and biomass in nests are an incidental consequence of better conditions in the nests or deposition by the birds during nest construction. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.539957042,0,NA,NA,15,NA,,,26,NA

This review aims to summarise these data and show where it resides, to assist SO food-web modellers or those with limited specialist knowledge of SO zooplankton. First, a brief overview is provided of the diversity and basic biology of SO zooplankton, with an emphasis on abundance, distribution and feeding. Second, advice is provided on the uses, strengths and limitations of zooplankton data as inputs to SO data compilations or food-web models. Copepods overall comprise &gt;75% of the SO zooplankton biomass (excluding Euphausia superba). Total mesozooplankton biomass density differs little between the Antarctic sectors, but latitudinally it is maximal in the Polar Frontal Zone and declines to the north and south. Those compiling data on numerical density (no. m-2 or no. m-3) need to allow for differences in the extent of identification of early larval stages. Likewise, the time of year, depth of sampling and mesh size of sampler greatly influence the recorded abundance, since the populations can make seasonal vertical migrations and their pulsed reproduction causes great seasonal changes in size structure and abundance. Other issues are specific to polar environments, for example, lipid storage which leads to significantly different length-mass and mass-rate relationships than are reported in global literature compilations. Likewise, stenothermy (narrow temperature tolerance) means that fixed (Q10-type) temperature relationships based on global literature compilations must be applied with great caution in SO-specific studies. Protozoa/micrometazoa (&lt;200 Œºm) are the main grazers in the SO, since mesozooplankton typically remove &lt;30% of primary production. This emphasises the dominant role of microbial food chains involving small metazoans, relative to the classic short diatom-krill-whale type food chains. Even within regions of abundant krill, copepod production in summer roughly triples that of postlarval E. superba. This fact reflects a large flow of energy through multiple trophic levels, via copepods and their major invertebrate predators such as other predatory copepods, chaetognaths, small omnivorous euphausiids, amphipods up to myctophid fish and birds.",Article,Scopus,0.529342212,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,75,NA

In contrast to the general consensus that penguins feature in the diet most prominently in the absence of Brown Skuas, we found a much more frequent occurrence of penguin remains in samples at Potter than Cierva, but only in pellets. At Cierva, penguin feathers were largely replaced in the pellets by a high frequency of non-food moss. The rare occurrence of penguins in regurgitates from both sites is consistent with scavenging rather than active predation. The high frequency of feathers in pellets at Potter is consistent with a gut-cleansing function similar to that performed by moss, which is abundant only at Cierva. We conclude that pellets over-represent penguins in the diet. For any species that consumes feathers, the evidence must consider the alternative possibility of a nonfood function of ingesting feathers. ¬© Dt.

A total of 15 free-living micro-arthropod species were found in hand collections and heat extractions of 12 different substrate types, including one Diptera, three Collembola and 11 Acari. In addition, one vertebrate parasitic tick was recorded (Acari, Metastigmata), one probably introduced ""snow scorpion fly"" (Insecta, Mecoptera), and at least one species of Astigmata (Acari), which may be either parasitic or nidicolous. Greatest diversity was found in mosses and algal mats (13 species), although within individual samples it was similar (5-6 species per sample) from most low-altitude vegetated or open habitats. Greatest population densities were recorded from mats of the alga, Prasiola crispa. With the exception of vertebrate-associated species, which were obtained from nest material or in the vicinity of bird colonies, most micro-arthropods were generally distributed, although with widely-varying abundance. Species diversity was slightly lower than, but similar to, that obtained in recent detailed studies of other sites in the maritime Antarctic.

To address some of these issues, we examined the long-term foraging responses of Ad√©lie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae near Palmer Station, western Antarctic Peninsula, in relation to ice-induced changes in krill recruitment and availability. Our results suggest that (1) there is a direct, causal relationship between variability in ice cover, krill recruitment, prey availability and predator foraging ecology, (2) regional patterns and trends detected in this study are consistent with similar observations in areas as far north as South Georgia, and (3) large-scale forcing associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave may be governing ecological interactions between ice, krill and their predators in the western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea regions. Another implication of our analyses is that during the last 2 decades in particular, krill populations have been sustained by strong age classes that emerge episodically every 4 to 5 yr. This raises the possibility that cohort senescence has become an additional ecosystem stressor in an environment where ice conditions conducive to good krill recruitment are deteriorating due to climate warming. In exploring these interactions, our results suggest that at least 1 'senescence event' has already occurred in the western Antarctic Peninsula region, and it accounts for significant coherent decreases in krill abundance, predator populations and predator foraging and breeding performance. We propose that krill longevity should be incorporated into models that seek to identify and understand causal links between climate change, physical forcing and ecosystem response in the western Antarctic Peninsula region.",Review,Scopus,0.514633561,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,57,NA

Changes in species' abundance and distributions caused by human disturbances can have indirect effects on other species in a community. Although ecosystem approaches to management are becoming increasingly prevalent, they require a fuller understanding of how individual behaviour determines interactions within and between species. 2. Ecological interactions involving krill are of major importance to many species within the Antarctic. Despite extensive knowledge of the ecosystem that they occupy, there is still incomplete understanding of the links between species and the effect of environmental conditions on these interactions. In this study, we extended a behavioural model used previously to understand the interactions between penguins and krill to determine the indirect effect of krill fisheries on penguin foraging success and behaviour in adjacent breeding sites. 3. Increased fishing pressure offshore is predicted to reduce penguin food intake. Given the documented links between krill and penguins, this also leads to a prediction of decreased penguin survival and reproduction. Krill behaviour is predicted to cause stronger effects of krill fisheries than explained solely by the percentage of biomass removed. Environmental conditions that decrease krill growth rates or cause krill to spend time in deeper water are also predicted to increase the magnitude of the effect of fishing on penguin success. We show that changes in penguin foraging behaviour can be used to assess the impact of local fisheries on penguin reproductive success. 4. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that an understanding of predator-prey interactions, indirect effects between species, and individual behaviour is imperative to our ability to manage populations. We describe a general method to use what is known about ecological and evolutionary processes with species-specific information to predict the response of organisms to novel situations. We further show how individual behaviour can be used to assess the impact of human disturbance on ecosystems.",Article,Scopus,0.485567796,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,60,NA

Substantial changes in seabird populations are occurring worldwide and are likely to have important consequences for plant community composition on islands and coastal areas. This review focuses on the impact of seabirds on plant biomass, species richness and community composition. A total of 57 publications (42 studies) were selected for review. Of the 42 studies represented in the publications, 55% were descriptive. Most studies took place in Australia, New Zealand, the British Isles, Japan, North America, and sub-Antarctic islands. A few studies showed that aboveground plant biomass in seabird colonies increased with sufficient rainfall and moderate temperatures. The majority of studies on plant species richness showed a decrease in seabird colonies compared to areas unaffected by birds. However, species richness was higher in areas of intermediate seabird disturbance, compared to undisturbed areas. Moreover, the effects of seabirds on species richness varied with respect to island size. Most studies of plant community composition indicated that annuals, 'ruderals"", and cosmopolitan species increased in abundance in seabird colonies. Changes in plant communities in seabird colonies appear to result mainly from altered soil nutrient concentrations and pH, increased physical disturbance, and seed dispersal by seabirds and humans. However, few studies have rigorously studied the relative importance of these alterations. Both the direction and magnitude of seabird effects are modified by: (1) density of birds, (2) temperature and precipitation, and (3) proximity to human habitation. A reduction in seabird populations is likely to have negative consequences for native plant species that rely on seabird disturbance for their persistence. However, seed dispersal by nesting seabirds, especially gulls, frequently leads to invasion by cosmopolitan plant species and declines of native species. Further studies that incorporate both quantitative sampling and manipulative experiments would go a long way in improving our understanding of how seabirds affect plant communities. ¬© Springer 2005.",Review,Scopus,0.451227316,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,54,NA

To support local phytoplankton blooms, these highly productive ecosystems require a large input of iron (Fe), the sources of which are poorly known. Here we assess the relative importance of six different environmental factors in controlling the amount of phytoplankton biomass and rates of net primary production (NPP) in 46 coastal polynyas around Antarctica. Data presented here suggest that melting ice shelves are a primary supplier of Fe to coastal polynyas, with basal melt rates explaining 59% of the between-polynya variance in mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration. In a multiple regression analysis, which explained 78% of the variance in chlorophyll a (Chl a) between polynyas, basal melt rate explained twice as much of the variance as the next most important variable. Fe upwelled from sediments, which is partly controlled by continental shelf width, was also important in some polynyas. Of secondary importance to phytoplankton abundance and NPP were sea surface temperature and polynya size. Surprisingly, differences in light availability and the length of the open water season explained little or none of the variance in either Chl a or NPP between polynyas. If the productivity of coastal polynyas is indeed sensitive to the release of Fe from melting ice shelves, future changes in ice shelf melt rates could dramatically influence Antarctic coastal ecosystems and the ability of continental shelf waters to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. ¬© 2015.

Abundances of Panagrolaimus davidi and rotifers differed among rookeries, and year of sampling had a significant effect only on the populations of Panagrolaimus davidi. There were no temporal differences in soil moisture and soil chlorophyll a concentrations within each rookery or across rookeries. No invertebrates were correlated with soil moisture or chlorophyll a at the time of collection. Counter to our expectations, higher nutrient, organic matter, and moisture levels did not result in more abundant and diverse invertebrate communities in the rookery soils.

Two main forces were reported to influence Antarctic soil microbes: birds and plants. Both birds and plants are currently undergoing relatively large changes in their distribution and abundance due to global warming. However, we need to clearly understand the relationship between plants, birds and soil microorganisms. We therefore collected rhizosphere and bulk soils from six different sampling sites subjected to different levels of bird influence and colonized by Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Maritime Antarctic. Microarray and qPCR assays targeting 16S rRNA genes of specific taxa were used to assess microbial community structure, composition and abundance and analyzed with a range of soil physico-chemical parameters. The results indicated significant rhizosphere effects in four out of the six sites, including areas with different levels of bird influence. Acidobacteria were significantly more abundant in soils with little bird influence (low nitrogen) and in bulk soil. In contrast, Actinobacteria were significantly more abundant in the rhizosphere of both plant species. At two of the sampling sites under strong bird influence (penguin colonies), Firmicutes were significantly more abundant in D. antarctica rhizosphere but not in C. quitensis rhizosphere. The Firmicutes were also positively and significantly correlated to the nitrogen concentrations in the soil. We conclude that the microbial communities in Antarctic soils are driven both by bird and plants, and that the effect is taxa-specific. ¬© 2013 Teixeira et al.",Article,Scopus,0.319738197,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,44,NA
