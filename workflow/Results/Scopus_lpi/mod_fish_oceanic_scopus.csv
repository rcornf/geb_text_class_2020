Similar species of the mesopelagic micronekton have been reported in association with other landmasses at the boundary between the oceanic mesopelagic realm and upper continental or island slopes. These species may form a cosmopolitan ""mesopelagic-boundary community"" which shows regional differences in taxonomic composition, abundance and diversity. Boundary communities, with populations which are both tightly constrained geographically and relatively accessible to shore-based research programs, offer unique opportunities for studying biological processes of the mesopelagic realm and the interactions between neritic and oceanic populations.

The strong homing instinct leads to the formation of discrete, locally-adapted spawning populations, each of which has the potential to evolve as an independent evolutionary unit. It is important, therefore, that the genetic consequences of different management policies be carefully evaluated. If current management goals (e.g., doubling the abundance of anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River basin through increased hatchery production and supplementation of natural populations) are realized, genetic issues will assume even greater importance in the future. To date, however, genetic concerns have not been adequately incorporated into the management process. We identify three genetic approaches, primarily based on easily obtained electrophoretic data, that can provide valuable information on which to base management decisions: (1) Using the Genetic Stock Identification method for identifying stocks contributing to oceanic, mixed-stock fisheries. Genetic Stock Identification has several advantages over traditional tagging methods, including cost-effectiveness and easy access to wild as well as hatchery stocks. (2) Monitoring genetic changes in hatchery stocks. Analysis of the nature and magnitude of such changes is the best means of identifying stocks in which potentially dangerous levels of inbreeding may be occurring. (3) Detecting mixtures of gene pools. The ability to detect hybridization and introgression is necessary for an evaluation of the genetic consequences of releasing artificially propagated fish into the wild. ¬© 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus",0.419213180246323,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,388,NA

The animals were taken in a series of hauls made over a 24 h period with an opening-closing midwater trawl system (RMT 1+8), consisting of a net of 1 m2 mouth area combined in the same frame as one of 8 m2 mouth area. The samples were taken at 250 m depth in a position 30¬∞N; 23¬∞W on 7/8 April 1972. The specific composition of the community and the numbers of individuals changed continuously with time. The numbers of fish, decapods and chaetognaths increased at night, but those of copepods, ostracods and euphausiids decreased. More species of fish, decapods and copepods were present by night than by day, whereas the numbers of species per haul for other groups remained fairly constant. The relative abundances of groups caught by the RMT 1 have been analysed, but similar treatment of the RMT 8 samples was impossible as only 3 groups were taken from this net. Non-migrants were a minority in every group except chaetognaths. Migrant species have been put into one of 6 transitory categories according to their patterns of abundance and hence migrations. Within each category, migratory behaviour varied both inter- and intraspecifically. The patterns of abundance of many species were smooth and continuous, suggesting slow migratory cycles of small amplitude. Conversely, extensive migrants had discontinuous patterns and presumably more rapid movements. Few migrants had a steady numerical plateau between their upward and downward migrations, and most apparently moved up or down continuously. The presence of migratory species in the sampled layer depended upon the time of day or night. It is concluded that, in a vertical series of hauls, the depths of occurrence of migrants will vary with the sampling time. Further-more, a vertical series will show a species minimum migration range but not necessarily its maximum. Individuals of some species were out of phase with the migrations of their main populations. There is evidence that the distributions and migrations of some species of decapods, euphausiids, copepods and fish could be related to the distribution of underwater light. Three pairs of congeneric copepod species were both spatially and temporally segregated for at least part of their diurnal cycles. Such an orderly arrangement could provide a means of reducing competition between species. Some species, however, overtook others on their migrations and the pattern of underwater light cannot, therefore, regulate the distribution of all species in the same way. ¬© 1974 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Scopus",0.717997181084047,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,363,NA

The principal species were counted from 20-foot depth intervals and for 13 channel stations distributed from the Atlantic Ocean to fresh water. Accompanying hydrographic data were taken on salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and surface transparency. The estuary always showed a gradient salinity from fresh water to about 31‚Ä∞, but strong seasonal pulses responded to changes in runoff of fresh water. Temperatures varied from 3¬∞C to 28¬∞C in the river, with greater stability near the sea. Turbid river water cleared appreciably near the ocean, and dissolved oxygen levels were high except where pollution loading was apparent in the river. Both salinity and temperatures showed vertical stratification, especially during periods of maximum flow in winter and spring. The total standing crop of zooplankton was always greatest in the estuary, with smaller catches in the river and in the ocean. Seasonal levels of abundance per cubic meter were recorded for about 35 principal species. Among coelenterates, Aglantha digitale appeared in winter, Bougainvillia entered from the ocean in summer, Nemopsis bachei was produced locally in spring and summer, and Blackfordia virginica was sporadic. Ctenophores, especially Mnemiopsis leidyi, were abundant and are suspected to be heavy predators of plankton. The chaetognaths Sagitta elegans and S. enflata fluctuated seasonally but reached substantial levels of abundance. Catches occasionally included tomopterid and other worms, tunicates, isopods, larval and adult decapods, and fish larvae, but many of these were accidental and non-quantitative captures. Small crustacea usually comprised the catch in limnetic waters;Cyclops viridis and several cladocerans were important, especially in spring. The amphipod Gammarus fasciatus showed massive concentrations in the oligohaline zone (ca. 0.5-5.0‚Ä∞) during spring and summer. The relatively rich mesohaline zone (ca. 5.0-18.0‚Ä∞) was always dominated by endemic estuarine species. The most abundant were Eurytemora hirundoides and E. affinis, Acartia tonsa (the most numerous, persistent, and euryhaline copepod in this estuary), Pseudodiaptomus coronatus and Neomysis americana. Polyhaline waters (ca. 18.0-30.0‚Ä∞) characteristically contained low volumes of oceanic intruders, including Centropages typicus and C. hamatus, Labidocera aestiva, Temora longicornis, Penilia avirostris, Evadne nordmanni, Pseudocalanus minutus, and others. A small number of species dominated the catch. Five species made up 89% of the volume (Gammarus fasciatus 54%, Acartia tonsa 22%, Eurytemora hirundoides and E. affinis 7%, Neomysis americana 6%). Three species provided 84% of the number caught (Acartia tonsa 65%, Eurytemora hirundoides and E. affinis 19%). These are the resident species which make the estuarine zooplankton distinctly different from the ocean and the river, and much richer than either. They offer promising fields for additional research. The volume of plankton was highest in spring and summer, and it was markedly affected by changes in the important species. Gammarus was responsible for most of the high spring and summer crop, and Cyclops and Eurytemora also varied greatly with season. Some stability was provided by the year-round presence of large numbers of Acartia, Pseudodiaptomus, Centropages, Neomysis, and less abundant forms. The mechanisms which maintain holoplankters successfully in a flowing hydrographic system appear to involve specific patterns of behavior by individuals or by populations. Especially, these may provide adaptation to the two-layer system of circulation present in this estuary and in many others. Diurnal vertical migration, upstream sites of reproduction, species reservoirs in shoal lateral waters and other unknown mechanisms probably aid in successful estuarine existence. ¬© 1962 Estuarine Research Federation.","Article","Scopus",0.748028072074829,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,417,NA

The prey choice model suggests that predators will focus initially on high ranked prey, turning to lower ranked prey if abundance of higher ranked prey declines. It is suggested that increasing human population size would have resulted in increases in harvesting pressure and ultimately prey resource depression. To apply the prey choice model to archaeological faunal records and based on previous research, prey ranks are estimated using overall attributes of taxon body size; the larger the taxon, the higher the rank. Two indices, the Marine and Freshwater Fish Index, are developed to estimate the ratio of high to low ranked prey and are calculated for each zone of the rockshelter. Over time, the indices show a decreasing abundance of high ranked prey and increasing abundance of low ranked prey, which supports the view of resource depression. Skeletal elements from two of the high ranked prey, Serranidae and Anguilla sp., are measured to examine taxon-specific changes in fish body size/age that would indicate direct human exploitation pressure. Evidence for a decline in Serranidae body size over time suggests that some of the decline in prey abundance and encounter rates results from direct harvesting pressure along with behavioural adjustments in the prey. Sample sizes for Anguilla were insufficient for statistical treatment. Environmental and technological factors that might also affect prey abundance and taxonomic representation do not satisfactorily account for the patterns. Overall, the increasing use of lower ranked prey suggests a decline in foraging efficiency, given higher energetic costs associated with their use. The study adds to a growing body of evidence that Polynesians profoundly affected the indigenous biota on islands they colonized.

The samples were collected monthly using a net with 0.47m diameter opening and 280Œºm mesh. Copepods were predominant throughout the year (32-95%), followed by foraminiferans (1-34%), fish larvae and eggs (<1-28%), crustacean larvae (2-13.8%) and chaetognatha (1 - 6.5%). Mollusc and echinoderm larvae were also present. High densities of Zooplankton were obtained in January, August and October, with peak abundance in May. Low densities were found in April and November. Some groups like Copepoda, Chaetognatha, crustacean larvae and Polychaeta showed significant differences in their abundances from station to station. Amphipoda, Urochordata, mollusc and echinoderm larvae as well as ichthyoplankton showed no such differences. Comparing the rainy and dry season, a significant difference was detected between holo- and merozooplankton abundances; holozooplankton population dominated both in number and diversity. The lower diversity of larval forms is assumed to be a result of strong sedimentation and sediment resuspension. The variability of Zooplankton abundance and its distribution are influenced by the current system that predominates in Cahuita. Qualitative analysis suggests that the Zooplankton sampled in the Cahuita coral reef corresponds more to pelagic-oceanic Zooplankton than to demersal Zooplankton. Differences between the sampling sations may reflect the intensity of exchange between the reef water and surrounding water.","Article","Scopus",0.562907714559534,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41,NA

Here, we examine the feasibility of reconstructing salmon abundance using links between marine nutrients carried upstream by Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and growth of dominant riparian trees in two Alaskan systems. We employ standard dendrochronology methods and regression models to quantify relationships between annual tree-ring growth, salmon escapement, and the climate pattern that affects oceanic production of Northeast Pacific salmon stocks, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We find that known, annual salmon escapement is significantly related to tree-ring growth at two sites in the Pacific coastal rainforest (PCRF) (r2 = 0.23, P &lt; 0.05 at each site), but not at two sites in the boreal forest. We then use relationships established at PCRF sites to reconstruct preliminary salmon spawning abundances to 1820 A.D. The PDO was not correlated with local 19-yr salmon escapement records and could not be used in reconstructions. Reconstructions compare favorably to southeastern Alaska fisheries catch data from 1924 to 1994 (Pearson correlation = 0.301 [P = 0.02] and 0.401 [P &lt; 0.01]). This study demonstrates the promise and utility of dendrochronology for reconstructing salmon returns to streams.","Article","Scopus",0.539359943192153,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,45,NA

This resulted in a general impoverishment of this system. The consequences for some commercially important species, which had already been damaged by former EN events and the impact of overfishing, were severe off Peru and Ecuador although there were certain positive effects due to the inshore migration of various oceanic mackerels and the southward migration of (sub)tropical fish species such as dolphinfish and skipjack tuna. In the benthic subsystem, a factor of major importance, besides the increase in temperature, was the marked increase of dissolved oxygen at the seafloor. Despite mass mortalities of many of the cold-water adapted invertebrate species on sandy beaches, shallow soft bottoms and in the rocky intertidal zone, the overall effect on fisheries was rather positive. In the case of commercially exploited shellfish, this was due to an increased immigration of subtropical species, mostly crustaceans, as well as increases in abundance of some local species more tolerant of warm water. -from Authors","Article","Scopus",0.650992349000867,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,362,NA

Forty seven species were identified from Tucker trawl collections in the vicinity of 27¬∞N, 86¬∞W, with seven new records for the Gulf. All species have been recorded from the Atlantic and 69% are pan-oceanic at low latitudes. The Teuthoidea were the largest fraction of the catch, particularly species of the families Enoploteuthidae and Cranchiidae. All but three species occurred in the epipelagic zone at night and diel vertical migration is suggested for many of the population. Closing trawl data indicate that most of the cephalopod population occurs shallower than 200 m at night and centers at 100 to 400 m during the day. Populations of several of the abundant, smaller species were greatest in July but this could not be linked, on the basis of size measurements, to recruitment of juveniles to the population. Diet analysis indicates that micronektonic cephalopods are crustacean feeders as juveniles, but rely more on fish as they mature (&gt;4 cm mantle length). Some cannibalism is apparent. Cranchiids contained relatively little food which might result from a relatively inactive life strategy. The latter is suggested by rather flaccid musculature in comparison to other teuthoids. The copepod genus Pleuromamma is highly selected for by a number of species, perhaps a function of the strong bioluminescent signal produced by members of this genus. Cluster analysis revealed several feeding guilds among the abundant species, though intracluster diets usually exhibited strong overlap. Given the relatively low abundance levels of cephalopods (50-70¬∑103km-2; 0-1,000 m), trophic competition may stem primarily from more abundant (&gt;10√ó) micronektonic groups such as midwater fishes and shrimps than from other cephalopods.","Article","Scopus",0.714708055879029,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,381,NA

Oceanic taxa did not display this pattern, while marked areas of very high abundance characterized the island-related taxa, the most abundant including the gobiid Eviota epiphanes and the apogonid Pseudamiops sp. Estimates of geostrophic flow indicate that the region down-current of the atoll was one of return flow associated with apparent mesoscale eddies or meanders north and west of the island. This region may serve as a down-current retention area for the pelagic larvae of island-related taxa and may facilitate recruitment back to the source populations. ¬© 1992.","Article","Scopus",0.702250134460107,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,211,NA

The population is relatively sedentary and has formed the basis of a traditional trawler fishery since the middle 1960s. However, very little is known about this species' early life history stages and ecology. Beginning in 1985, bottom trawl surveys have been conducted annually to determine distribution and abundance of juvenile yellowtail flounder on the Grand Bank. It was found that both juveniles and adults maintained their shallow water depth distribution despite wide fluctuations in temperature. Based on the analyses of the distribution of age-1 group and older juveniles (up to 4 years) and incorporating historical information on egg and larval surveys, physical oceanography and substrate type in the region it was found that all early life history stages were retained in the same geographic area, on and adjacent to the Southeast Shoal on the southern Grand Bank. It is suggested that passive retention of eggs and larvae is related to a weak current regime on the southern Grand Bank. Age-1 group and older juveniles were consistently found on a sandy substrate in the same area, indicating that sediment size is an important factor influencing distribution. These observed patterns of distribution of eggs, larvae, and juveniles points to the Southeast Shoal area as being an oceanic nursery site for Grand Bank yellowtail flounder. But unlike the well-published North Sea coastal nurseries, this oceanic nursery also contains newly settled juveniles, older juveniles, and adults. ¬© 1992.","Article","Scopus",0.650713671582459,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,374,NA

Stomach samples were collected and compared among birds foraging at sea during the nonupwelling, post-spring transition (to upwelling), and upwelling periods each year from 1985 to 1988. Upwelling-period samples also were compared with samples regurgitated to chicks on the Farallon Islands during that period; such samples had been collected during 1971 and 1977- 1991. During the non-upwelling period, auklets fed on the small, energetically interior, oceanic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica, but following the spring transition, the auklets switched to small, juvenile fish (mostly Sebastes spp.) until these had grown too large for capture. Thereafter, the auklets switched to the larger and energetically more valuable euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera, which had become available upon the onset of upwelling. This general pattern was repeated each year, although some between-year variability among ancillary prey was evident. Auklet foraging locality, however, varied only slightly throughout the year; auklets were most dispersed during El Nino. It was apparent that the availability of T. spinifera was linked to upwelling, the decrease in the prevalence of T. spinifera in the diet fed to chicks from 1971 to 1991 is consisted with decreased intensity of upwelling in the region, as is the reduction in numbers of auklets in the region over the same period.

Since the mid-1950s it has been believed that this high productivity results, in part, from biological response to the physical interaction between oceanic currents and the abrupt topographic profiles represented by most seamounts. The 'classic theory' for the production/maintenance of seamount nektonic stocks suggests that (i) the combination of localized upwelling and the trapping/concentrating action of closed anticyclonic vortices (i.e. Taylor cones) enhance local primary production, (ii) thereby promoting local secondary productivity that, (iii) supports local nektonic populations. Here we test one element of this theory: whether proximity to a shallow seamount is associated with changes in zooplankton abundance and species composition. Zooplankton samples were collected near Cobb Seamount, a shallow (< 100 m) northeast Pacific seamount 50-km west of Vancouver Island. Both upwelling and closed recirculations occur at Cobb Seamount, but the latter is confined to depths > 100 m and is not an effective retention mechanism. Total zooplankton abundance did not vary significantly on- versus off-seamount. However, using a variety of nonparametric multivariate techniques we demonstrate that a 'seamount effect' on zooplankton-community composition is detectable up to 30 km from the seamount summit. This effect is superimposed on (and locally much stronger than) the expected slow decline in resemblance as between-sample geographic distance increases. Possible mechanisms by which this effect operates include: differential growth or reproduction, differential mortality and behavioral or migratory effects. The on off seamount differences are accounted for largely by the increased relative abundances of two fast-growing opportunists, doliolids (Dolioletta sp.) and larvaceans (Oikopleura sp.), near Cobb Seamount. Predation pressure from seamount fish and active avoidance of the seamount by zooplankton may also play a role in generating the seamount effect. The absence of an effective trapping mechanism and the fact that total zooplankton abundance does not increase near the seamount lead us to conclude that the bottom-up model of localized energy transfer proposed under the 'classic hypothesis' is incorrect for Cobb Seamount: nektonic stocks at Cobb Seamount (and, possibly, other shallow seamounts) are more likely supported by flow-through (i.e. advected) rather than local production.","Article","Scopus",0.434204174094761,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,378,NA

These species, as well as four other common species, exhibited an asynchronous diel vertical migration pattern (450-900 m during day; 20-300, 550-900 m at night). The percentage of the populations of the three dominant species migrating daily ranged from 50-70%.

Long rough dab are distributed from the coastal waters off western and northern Svalbard, south along the continental shelf edge to the northwest coast of Norway and eastward into the Barants Sea to Goose Bank. The greatest concentrations are located within the Barants See. Both juvenile and adult long rough dab overlap considerably in their distribution and are most abundant along the shelves and slopes of various banks close to the Polar Front, in particular the slopes of Spitsbergen Bank. Analyses of icthyoplankton and demersal survey data together with historical data and hydrography of water masses in the area suggest that spawning of long rough dab takes place mainly in the western and central Barents Sea and along the northwest coast of Norway, corroborating Milinsky's hypothesis of an east to west spawning migration. A spawning migration in the direction opposite to larval drift would permit long rough dab to maintain its position within the region, a strategy common to many other demersal and pelagic fish in the Barents Sea. The distributional pattern of newly-settled and age-1 juvenile long rough dab is closely linked to the physical oceanographic processes of water masses, in particular the North Atlantic water mass, and the drift of early life-history stages in the system of currents along coastal areas and the Polar Front. The association of large aggregations of juveniles with sediments of a particular structure and a high biomass of benthos may be more than coincidental and would indicate that other physical factors may influence both settlement in the oceanic nursery areas and the overall pattern of distribution of the population.","Article","Scopus",0.636148301608982,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,419,NA

Comparisons were made with data from the Atlantic Ocean and additional data from published sources: in all 836 samples were assessed, from 750 stations. The animals were grouped into deposit-feeders, suspension-feeders and carnivores. The ratio of the weights of the three groups indicates the predominant trophic group in a sample. Such data, combined with information on geographic distribution, were then compared with feeding conditions including: sediment type and sedimentation rate; organic carbon content; degree of transformation of organic matter on and in the sediment; redox potential, biochemical oxygen demand; and state of the sediment microflora. In the Pacific and Indian Oceans it has been possible to define eutrophic and oligotrophic areas. The eutrophic areas correspond to regions of high production in surface waters and extend over the peripheral and equatorial parts of the oceans. Sediments in eutrophic areas contain enough digestible organic matter to allow deposit-feeders to predominate. Oligotrophic areas are restricted to the open parts of the oceans, outside the equatorial belt, where sedimentation rates are low, organic matter is scarce and suspension-feeders predominate, although their population density is very low. In contrast to the Pacific, conditions on the Atlantic Ocean floor are more generally eutrophic. This seems to be related to the stronger currents near the bottom in Atlantic abyssal depths, particularly near the continents. In the Near-Continental areas suspension-feeders (such as sponges, stalked barnacles, bivalves and ascidians) predominate in the macrobenthos. The South Atlantic Near-Continental Area is characterized by the occurrence of many carnivorous invertebrates, particularly ophiuroids, that feed on a ""rain of dead bodies"" from the sea above (euphausiids, pteropods and small fishes). This ""rain"" exerts a strong influence on the trophic structure of the macrobenthos in this part of the Atlantic. The recognized deep-sea trophic areas differ in the frequency of occurrence of deposit-feeding invertebrates and their degree of restriction to the area, in the size, number and species composition of the macrobenthic invertebrates and in sedimentation conditions. Differences in trophic pattern between the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans are closely related to the size and shape of each ocean. There is evident latitudinal and circumcontinental zonation in the distribution of trophic areas of all three oceans. The impact of trophic factors on the distribution patterns of deep-sea macrobenthos is shown in the three main types of species distribution: (i) Near-Continental; (ii) Oceanic (for species penetrating from the Near-Continental Area into the Equatorial Area as well as into the extraequatorial oceanic areas); and (iii) Panthalassic (for species which penetrate from eutrophic into oligotrophic areas). Species abundance decreases from the near-continental eutrophic areas to the Oceanic and the Equatorial areas and is least in the Northern and Southern oligotrophic areas.

It extends from the edge of the shelf to the beginning of the abyss and is a substantial part of the ocean, being larger than the shallow shelf zone, including the sublittoral. Some taxa of benthic animals attain their optimal number of species and abundance in the bathyal zone. The distribution of the bathyal fauna is described on the basis of groups of species with comparable geographical range, termed geographic faunistic elements or types of range. The Brachiopoda, which have been thoroughly studied from a large database of samples and records, are used to establish clear biogeographical patterns in the bathyal zone of the world ocean. There are depth-related changes within the limits of the bathyal zone: the number of species; the number of geographic faunistic elements; and the number of latitudinal (climatic) faunistic belts diminish with increasing depth. Correspondingly, there is a reduction in number of faunistic provinces. The simplification in biogeographic structure of bottom fauna down the slopes is in accordance with the simplification in the structure of the water masses that are in contact with the bottom along the slopes. Food supply is also an important factor related to depth distribution of the macrobenthic animals. The basic biogeographical divisions of the bathyal zone become asymmetric under the influence of the unequal distribution of land and water masses on the globe, and in relation to oceanic gyres that cause differences in productivity on the eastern and western sides of the oceans. This inequality results in faunistic differences especially in the number of species in different taxa. The bathyal zone may have acted as a reserve of species for recolonization of the shelves and the abyss between periods of global changes in climate. Partly related to this, the bathyal zone contains many relict species, some of which are the most primitive extant members of their groups. The function of the bathyal zone as a reserve of species is challenged by the consequences of commercial exploitation of the non-sustainable fish and shellfish populations on the upper part of the continental slope and on seamounts.

The prevalence and abundance of lice on one sea winter (1SW) salmon were significantly higher on escaped farmed fish than on wild salmon. However, no difference in abundance was observed between 2SW farmed and wild salmon. The average number of lice per surface area of fish (density) was significantly higher in 2SW wild salmon than in ISW wild salmon, indicating an accumulation of lice on the salmon in the oceanic phase. No differences in density were observed between 1SW and 2SW farmed salmon. The prevalence of Caligus elongatus was low (5.5%), with an abundance of 0.9 lice per salmon.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.614690684778776,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,252,NA

Its bed has a complex topography comprising a variety of sub-basins, elevated slopes and shelves. The particular hydrologic regime of this sea clearly determines ichthyoplankton distribution, and controls the horizontal and vertical patterns of plankton productivity at the basin level. The fact that anticyclonic gyres have lower biological productivity than cyclonic gyres has been confirmed. In the latter, the upwelling of colder, more nutritious waters favours phytoplankton growth; light penetration is lower; and maximum subsurface chlorophyll is situated closer to the surface level. The temperature differences detected in the surface and middle water layers make it possible to roughly divide the surveyed area into four zones which are bounded, latitudinally, by parallel 36¬∞N (middle waters) and, longitudinally, by meridian 4¬∞W (surface waters). For the anchovy and the gilt sardine (coastal pelagic fishes), this longitude separates the maximum abundance of eggs and larvae of these species. The anchovy component predominates in the western zone (waters of mostly Atlantic origin, which are colder in the surface layers), while the gilt sardine is predominant in the eastern zone (waters of mostly Mediterranean origin, which are warmer in these layers). For different mesopelagic species (the adults of which live in deeper waters outside the shelf), north of this parallel the dominant larvae are those of boreao-arctic lantern-fish (eg Benthosema glaciale), while those of a temperature-subtropical boreo-arctic lantern-fish (eg Benthosema glaciale), while those of a temperate-subtropical nature (eg Ceratoscopelus maderensis) are dominant to the south of it. These peculiar offshore hydrodynamics set off a clear West-End displacement of ichthyoplankton, due to an inflowing Atlantic water-jet, moving adjacent waters in the same direction. At the coastal-oceanic level, important spatial water exchanges in both direction seem to be occurring. This would account for the presence of larvae of characteristically inshore species in offshore waters, and those of mesopelagic species at coastal stations. This phenomenon is probably favoured by the narrowness of the continental shelf in the Alboran Sea. With the formation of meanders and subsequent rings that break off from the main current, this water-jet may occasionally cease to represent an impassable barrier for the interchange of water masses in a North-South direction. Thus, biological confirmation of the northern origin of a small cyclonic circulation area detected in the south has been possible, due to the presence of larvae of mesopelagic fishes characteristic of northern waters instead of the larvae that would be expected in a southerly location. Throughout the seasonal cycle under consideration (spring, summer and autumn), larvae of fish belonging to different taxonomic groups (Myctophidae, Sparidae, Gobiidae, Callionymidae, Blenniidae and Bothidae) and to the Capros aper (boar fish) species were present on the northern coast. Although the values obtained in an analysis of the seasonal variation in larvaldiversity were slightly higher in summer, they suggest the persistence in time of an ichthyoplankton community structure in which replacements of dominant species do not substantially alter the distribution of relative abundance. The area's high biological productivity rates, together with the higher concentrations of plankton and pelagic fishes, were found at the edges of the northern subarea (eastern and western zones) during particular times of the year. This situation is chiefly determined by the presence of two thermohaline front systems in these distal zones in the northern Alboran Sea. A seasonal variation has bene observed in the space-time distribution of ichthyoplantkon and the zooplankton biomass. The maximum coincidence values for both these variables in this subarea occur in the eastern zone (Adra-Atlantia) during the autumn and in the western zone (Estepona-Marbella) during the summer. The anchovy completes its entire life cycle in the Bay of Malaga, judging by the presence of eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults of this species throughout the year. This phenomenon is interpreted as meaning that a scarcely migratory population is involved. This bay is also highly important for the nursery phase of several species. Morever, the highest summer diversity of larvae in the entire Alborean Sea has been found to occur in this bay. During the summer, the main anchovy spawning season, the presence of the ichthyoplankton for this species coincides space-wise in this area with major larval quantities of virtually competing species, such as boar fish (west of 4¬∞'W longitude) and gilt sardine (to the east thereof).

The outer margin of the area was delimited by a rectangle of 15 full depth CTD casts and the hydrography was further defined by two Seasoar surveys within the box. Midwater trawls were used to sample the populations at three stations, oceanic, slope and shelf edge respectively. Day and night samples of macroplankton and micronekton were taken at each station to determine the extent of diel vertical migration and the effect of the hypoxic region on these migrations. Concurrent ADCP data were used to follow the migrations and spatial changes in real time. Despite the limited area studied the patterns of upwelling and their temporal and spatial changes were complex. Coastal upwelling was observed directly only at the southwestern edge of the area during both Seasoar surveys. Persian Gulf Water was a consistent but spatially discrete feature of the region at depths of 200-300 m. Arabian Sea Surface Water was present at the eastern margin of the first survey. Between these two water masses was a large area with small horizontal gradients and variable silicate and chlorophyll levels. Satellite data suggest that this water may have been advected as a filament from a more northerly coastal source. Very marked changes took place in the hydrography and in the phytoplankton composition and abundance at the reference station at 19¬∞N 59¬∞E over the 16 day period between visits. The highest biomass of plankton and micronekton (expressed as wet volume or as carbon) occurred in the upper 100 m, closely correlated with the relatively high oxygen levels at these depths. Gelatinous animals predominated in these layers, with additional swarms of swimming crabs. Quite large populations of myctophid and photichthyid fishes and of decapod crustaceans were present below the oxycline by day. Most of these migrated into the surface layers at night, leaving minimal biomass behind, with the result that the ADCP backscatter data from beneath the oxycline at night were often below instrument resolution. Daytime ADCP data, on the other hand, showed multiple fine layering, some of which correlated with salinity differences. At the base of the oxygen minimum layer there was a large increase in biomass, marking the presence of a more typical bathypelagic fauna.","Article","Scopus",0.64996723532573,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,248,NA

Although photosynthesis is directly fueled by light energy, it has been hypothesized that the 'auxiliary' energy provided by mixing can subsidize or control ecosystem function. Unrealistic mixing has also been cited as one explanation for difficulties in reproducing natural plankton dynamics in enclosed experimental ecosystems (mesocosms). To explore the importance of mixing in shallow planktonic ecosystems, we traced changes over a 4 wk period in population, community, and ecosystem level properties in replicate 1 m3 experimental ecosystems subjected to different mixing regimes. Mixing energy was delivered by slowly rotating impellers on a cycle of 4 h on and 2 h off to match the semidiurnal pattern of tidal mixing that characterizes many temperate estuaries. Three mixing levels were generated by altering impeller rotation rates. The intermediate level was scaled to match typical mixing intensities of waters in Chesapeake Bay, the low mixing level approximated calm oceanic surface waters, and the high mixing level approximated the environment within a tidal front. High and low mixing levels encompassed a 6x range in turbulence intensity, a 9x range in the surface-bottom mixing time and eddy diffusivity coefficients, and a 230x range in turbulent energy dissipation rates. Mixing had a significant negative effect on copepod and gelatinous zooplankton abundance and also altered the timing of peak copepod densities. Chlorophyll a dynamics and phytoplankton group composition, as assessed with accessory pigment concentrations, also exhibited modest differences among mixing treatments. Mixing had negligible effects on nutrient concentrations and on community and whole-system productivity and respiration. Important caveats in interpreting the results of this experiment are that system size excluded observation of the effects of large-scale mixing processes, trophic complexity was limited (e.g. no fish), and in this whole-ecosystem context it was difficult to distinguish direct from indirect effects of mixing. Nevertheless, our results imply that ecosystem-level processes in planktonic systems may often be less sensitive to differences in small-scale turbulence than population and community dynamics, and also that mixing effects may be strongly dependent on the specific structure of particular ecosystems.","Article","Scopus",0.362479847430868,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,415,NA

Of several hypotheses advanced to explain the declines, the major ones attribute declines to genetic deterioration, disease accumulation, variations in oceanic conditions, and density-dependent mortality. To test some of these hypotheses, we estimated the survival rate of hatchery releases of coho and fall chinook. The data consisted of mark and recapture rates of coded-wire-tagged fish from the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The mean survival by hatchery and location was analyzed by means of graphs, generalized linear models, and cluster analysis. The results indicate that salmonid populations continue to decline in most of the geographical range. The declines are particularly marked from the late 1970s to the early 1980s and from the late 1980s to the most recent years available. Age of the hatchery is of little or no importance, so disease accumulation and genetic changes are not the causes of the observed survival declines. Some hatcheries continue to have good survival rates for long periods. The overall results indicate that changes in ocean conditions could be at least partially responsible for the survival declines of coho and chinook in the Pacific Northwest.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.773826127687392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,384,NA

Highest egg densities occurred in the fore-reef zone at night. Highest larval densities occurred in the reef-lagoon zone and were significantly greater at night. Thirty species, 54 genera, and 73 different taxa belonging to 54 fish families were enumerated. The most abundant families collected were Tripterygiidae (31.8%), Gobiidae (26.5%) and Clupeidae (6.0%).

One group included the most abundant families in the reef-lagoon and channel zones, and the other the oceanic families, some of which occurred only in the fore-reef zone.

The model can be extended to groups of animals, spatially and/or temporally aggregated, by appropriate integration. When information about animal counts is partial or inexact, as from mark-recapture or harvest data, state-space models are a natural framework for estimating both unknown parameters and animal abundance. As an example, a multivariate, linear normal state-space model that explicitly incorporates each of the three individual animal components is formulated for the migration and harvest of Pacific coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Using recoveries of tagged coho salmon caught in ocean fisheries and associated measures of fishing effort, the Kalman filter and maximum likelihood are used to estimate parameters of the processes, and the Kalman smooth is used to estimate abundances.

Fifty of these species were caught in Kachemak Bay, 24 at Chisik Island, and 12 at the Barren Islands. Pacific sand lance dominated Barren Islands and Kachemak Bay nearshore habitats, comprising 99% and 71% of total individuals, respectively. The nearshore Chisik Island fish community was not dominated by any one species; instead it exhibited higher diversity. These spatial differences appeared linked to local oceanographic regimes and sediment influx. Analysis of historical data revealed that the nearshore Kachemak Bay fish community changed significantly between 1976 and 1996, showing increased diversity and abundance in several taxa, notably gadids, salmonids, pleuronectids, and sculpins. Decadal differences appeared to be related to large-scale climate changes in the North Pacific. Catches of most taxa peaked in May-August, and were low during other months of the year. Several species were present for only part of the summer. Species composition of seine catches differed significantly between consecutive high and low tides, but not between consecutive sets or years.

Community structures in shelf and nearshore waters were similar: diversity was high and abundance low at Chisik Island, whereas a few abundant species dominated at both Kachemak Bay and the Barren Islands.

We use individual-based and hydrodynamic models to reinterpret the 'mechanics' of the menhaden life history, and put forward several potentially testable hypotheses. The success of the menhaden reproductive strategy seems to depend on the seasonal changes in the mean flow field of the Middle and South Atlantic Bights, suggesting that their life history may have been strongly structured by the regional physics of the system. Because the annual menhaden migration is size-based and spawning occurs throughout the population's range, the size distribution of the adult population may influence the supply of larvae to particular estuaries along the coast. Recruitment of larvae into Delaware and Chesapeake Bays may be dependent on spawning to the north of the bays' mouths, owing to coastline shape and orientation in the vicinity of the bays. Our results suggest that management of this resource might be improved by consideration of the spatial and temporal variability in both the biological and the physical system.","Article","Scopus",0.684417230053997,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,324,NA

Ichthyoplankton samples were collected over a 12 month period from five stations located along a transect up to 2¬∑5 km offshore, and from two stations north and south of the estuary mouth, respectively. In all, 6126 fish larvae, representing 89 families and 186 species, were collected. Larvae in the families Myctophidae and Tripterygiidae comprised 21% and 16% oft he total catch, respectively. The most abundant species were an unidentified triplefin, Tripterygiid 1 and the lanternfish Benthosema fibulatum, together which contributed nearly 18% of the total catch. Larvae of marine spawners independent of estuaries dominated the catch both in terms of density (90%) and in terms of number of taxa (89%). Some larvae of estuarine-associated species were present, in addition to a few specimens of estuarine resident species. Overall the dominant environmental variable affecting larval densities was temperature, particularly for Trypterygiid 1 where temperature contributed to 9% of the variance model. Densities of fish larvae peaked in November and December 1990 (late spring and early summer) and were lowest from January to June 1991 (summer, autumn an early winter). Different taxa dominated the catch each month with reef- and shelf-associated species accounting for the peak in August and September 1990, oceanic species in November 1990 and a mixture of the two groups in December. Overall larval densities were significantly higher in bottom samples with a trend of increasing densities offshore for reef and shelf taxa. The larvae of reef and shore taxa were predominantly preflexion larvae, whilst the few estuarine spawner species that were collected were mainly postflexion. Ontogenetic patterns related to depth and distance offshore were evident for the dominant species in each estuarine-association category. The present study has shown that temporal and spatial variations in the larval fish assemblage off St Lucia are related to environmental conditions and ontogenetic behavioural patterns of certain species. The origin of many of the larvae in the assemblages off the coast of St Lucia is probably from both local spawning populations in the shelf waters off KwaZulu-Natal and spawning populations farther north in shelf waters off Mozambique. Additional studies with more detailed oceanographic measurements will further our understanding of the physical processes that supply larvae to the St Lucia region.","Article","Scopus",0.713993365522422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,223,NA

Most chondrichthyan populations are of low productivity relative to teleost fishes, a consequence of their different life-history strategies. This is reflected in the poor record of sustainability of target shark fisheries. Most sharks and some batoids are predators at, or near, the top of marine food webs. The effects of fishing are examined at the single-species level and through trophic interactions. We summarize the status of chondrichthyan fisheries from around the world. Some 50% of the estimated global catch of chondrichthyans is taken as by-catch, does not appear in official fishery statistics, and is almost totally unmanaged. When taken as by-catch, they are often subjected to high fishing mortality directed at teleost target species. Consequently, some skates, sawfish, and deep-water dogfish have been virtually extirpated from large regions. Some chondrichthyans are more resilient to fishing and we examine predictions on the vulnerability of different species based on their life-history and population parameters. At the species level, fishing may alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes in species abundance. We review the evidence for such density-dependent change. Fishing can affect trophic interactions and we examine cases of apparent species replacement and shifts in community composition. Sharks and rays learn to associate trawlers with food and feeding on discards may increase their populations. Using ECOSIM, we make some predictions about the long-term response of ecosystems to fishing on sharks. Three different environments are analysed: a tropical shelf ecosystem in Venezuela, a Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem, and a North Pacific oceanic ecosystem.

Domino (Tremiti Islands), located in the Southern and Central Adriatic Seas (Mediterranean Sea), respectively. Data were collected in situ by using non-destructive diver visual census methodology. A higher species richness and fish density were observed over the Posidonia seagrass and, in turn, the rocky-algal reef and unvegetated sand habitats. Planktivorous fish species (Spicara maena, Spicara smaris and Chromis chrornis) showing patchy distributions were dominant in terms of abundance at both localities. The two former species did not show any particular habitat preference, while C. chromis was common over both the Posidonia and rocky-algal habitats and was only occasionally recorded over sand. Symphodus ocellatus, Diplodus annularis and Spondyliosoma cantharus were the most common species in the P. oceanica seagrass beds. Symphodus roissali, Symphodus tinca and Diplodus sargus were mainly associated with the rocky-algal reef habitats, while other species, such as Gymnammodytes cicerellus, Lithognathus mormyrus, Gobius geniporus, Mullus barbatus and Uranoscopus scaber, were censused over the unvegetated sand habitats. A cluster analysis performed on the entire fish density data set showed distinct groupings for seagrass, rocky-algal and bare sand fish assemblages, regardless of season and sampling site. Fish assemblages in the more structured (seagrass and rocky-algal reef) habitats were relatively similar to each other but quite different from those of the unstructured bare sands. With regard to small-sized specimens (juvenile stages including recruits), those of S. ocellatus, Symphodus mediterraneus, Serranus cabrilla, D. annularis, S. cantharus and Sarpa salpa were mainly censused over P. oceanica beds, while juveniles of C. chromis inhabited predominantly rocky-algal bottoms rich in crevices. Small individuals of Coris julis were censused over both P. oceanica and rocky-algal habitats. No juveniles of any species were observed over bare sand. These results suggest that differences in fish species richness and abundance are primarily related to habitat structure. Different habitat preferences were evidenced for the juveniles and adults of several fish species. The ecological importance and need for protection of such shallow inshore habitats are discussed in relation to their crucial role as nurseries for many fish species, and their overall importance in maintaining littoral fish populations and species diversity is emphasized.

Trends in population indices from commercial catch data, upstream passage counts, and seine, trawl, and electrofishing surveys were analyzed and found to be either not significant or significantly negative. Explanations for this decline, whether natural or anthropogenic, are unknown, due to variation and incompleteness in abundance data, and incomplete knowledge of eel life history, ecology, and population dynamics. A number of potential factors may be contributing to the decline, including (in alphabetical order): barriers to migration, habitat loss and alteration, hydro turbine mortality, oceanic conditions, overfishing, parasitism, and pollution. The paucity of life table data associated with the unconventional life history characteristics of anguillid eels (catadromy, panmixis, semelparity, high age at maturity, wide geographic distribution, and ecological generalist habit) prevents development of accurate population models and determination of overall effects influencing production and recruitment for this species. Historically there has been little attention to management of this species. A new coastwide management initiative by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has taken a conservative approach to limiting controllable and anthropogenic sources of mortality and enhancing recruitment and restoration of available habitat. Objectives of the plan include: improving knowledge of eel utilization through better reporting of harvest, increasing knowledge of eel population dynamics and life history, providing migratory passage and access to historic eel freshwater habitat, and monitoring of abundance levels of various eel life stages.","Review","Scopus",0.760393205648889,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,239,NA

They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations. The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous ""tax"" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystemwide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a ""guilty until proven innocent"" approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.","Article","Scopus",0.39327031290964,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,420,NA

The seasonal descent had barely started. Both invertebrate and fish predators were most abundant in the Coastal and eastern Atlantic domains, with abundance strongly decreasing north-westwards. No tight relationship between total abundance of invertebrate or fish predators and that of C. finmarchicus was apparent.

These models combine population dynamics with stochastic variation in extinction and immigration parameters associated with local populations. One of the predictions of metapopulation models is a bimodal distribution of species frequency of occurrence, a pattern that led to the development of the core-satellite species hypothesis. The spatial scale and taxonomic classification of past core-satellite studies has often been undefined. In our study, we have integrated metapopulation dynamics with the roles that differential dispersal ability and history play in the shaping of communities. The differences in distribution patterns between landbridge islands and oceanic islands, and among various taxa (birds, mammals, herptiles, arthropods, fish, and plants) are analyzed. The majority of landbridge islands comprised locally and regionally abundant species (core species), whereas the majority of oceanic islands had a uniform distribution (or no end-peak in their distribution). The patterns of distribution among the taxonomic groups also showed differences. Birds (good dispersers) consistently showed bimodal- and core-distribution patterns. The bimodal prediction of species distribution is best exemplified in the landbridge islands and in birds, and least in oceanic islands and in organisms other than birds. These results illustrate the importance of testing models with various taxonomic groups and at different spatial scales and defining these scales before formally testing the predictions of the models.","Article","Scopus",0.498170925724681,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,139,NA

Zooplankton were sampled fortnightly using a vertically hauled WP-2 net (330 Œºm). Comparisons between zooplankton abundance at four fixed stations with Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) and four open water control stations were conducted to 1) describe the seasonal succession of mesozooplankton organisms in relation to physical parameters and 2) to test for any attraction phenomena of Zooplankton towards floating objects. Mean zooplankton densities were low and ranged from 4 ind¬∑nv-3 to 659 ind¬∑nr-3. Species composition showed no significant inter-annual variations and a dominance of copepods.

Although, in the past, floating structures have been shown to increase spatial heterogeneity in the pelagic environment and enhance the aggregation of several fish species, the present study found no evidence of mesozooplankton aggregation below FADs. No significant differences were found in the abundance or biomass of zooplankton at sites with FADs, suggesting that the intrinsic variability in Zooplankton overrides any possible FAD effect on plankton aggregation. We hypothesise that at the mesoscale level FADs do not provide a microhabitat with sufficiently different physical conditions, although they could locally induce patchiness in resource availability and predation linked with the presence of shoals of juvenile fishes aggregated underneath the floating device. ¬© 2001 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus",0.556496103938092,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,57,NA

Secondary production by these zooplankton supports most food webs of the open sea, directly affecting pelagic fish populations and the biological pump of carbon into the deep ocean. Models of marine ecosystems are quite sensitive to the formulation of the term for zooplankton mortality, although there are few data available to constrain mortality rates in such models. Here we present the first evidence for nonlinear, density-dependent mortality rates of open-ocean zooplankton. A high-frequency time series reveals that per capita mortality rates of eggs of Calanus finmarchicus Gunnerus are a function of the abundance of adult females and juveniles. The temporal dynamics of zooplankton populations can be influenced as much by time-dependent mortality rates as by variations in 'bottom up' forcing. The functional form and rates chosen for Zooplankton mortality in ecosystem models can alter the balance of pelagic ecosystems, modify elemental fluxes into the ocean's interior, and modulate interannual variability in pelagic ecosystems.","Article","Scopus",0.609283735581108,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,108,NA

The annual copepod population size on all salmonids caught was estimated by combining the calculated number of copepods carrying on each salmonid species. The copepod population fluctuated markedly from year to year, which resulted largely from marked annual changes in abundance of pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). Since pink salmon were most frequently and heavily infected and since their abundance changed every year, the copepod population was high in the years when this salmonid species was abundant, but low when it was rare. On the contrary, chum salmon (O. keta) did not show high prevalence and intensity of infection, but the annual abundance of this host species was consistently high, i.e. chum salmon carried many copepods every year. Copepods on other salmonid species (sockeye salmon O. nerka, coho salmon O. kisutch, chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, and steelhead trout O. mykiss) constantly formed a small percentage of the total copepod population. Both chum and pink salmon are the most important hosts in terms of their substantial contribution to support the copepod population, but the importance as hosts of each species is definitely different between the species. Chum salmon is a stable important host supporting the copepod population at a relatively high level every year, while the number of copepods on pink salmon annually exhibits marked fluctuations, and this salmonid species is regarded as an unstable important host.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.68693188028115,"1",NA,"Mentions large annual changes in abundance of salmon",5,NA,8,NA

This study compares paired zooplankton samples taken with a ring net and a 0.71-m or 0.6-m bongo net to determine the relative performances of the two net types for catching calanoid copepods. Thirty-one species and stages were enumerated, along with the category 'total female calanoids'. Twenty-one categories of calanoid copepods were abundant enough to test for effects of changes in net type. No significant differences between the nets were found after correcting for multiple testing.

For these categories of copepods, any population changes greater than a factor of 1.5-3.0 that might be found from the CalCOFI data set can be assumed to be the result of factors other than the change in net type. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These shifts affected the mix and abundance of suites of coexisting species during each period of relative environmental stability-from primary producers to apex predators. However, the 1989 regime shift was not a simple reversal of the 1977 shift. The regime shifts occured abruptly and were neither random variations nor simple reversals to the previous conditions. Timing of these anomalous environmental events in the North Pacific Ocean appears to be linked to physical and biological responses in other oceanic regions of the world. Changes in the atmospheric pressure can alter wind patterns that affect oceanic circulation and physical properties such as salinity and depth of the thermocline. This, in turn, affects primary and secondary production. Data from the North Pacific indicate that regime shifts can have opposite effects on species living in different domains, or can affect similar species living within a single domain in opposite ways. Climatic forcing appears to indirectly affect fish and marine mammal populations through changes in the distribution and abundance of their predators and prey. Effects of regime shifts on marine ecosystems are also manifested faster at lower trophic levels. Natural variability in the productivity of fish stocks in association with regime shifts indicates that new approaches to managing fisheries should incorporate climatic as well as fisheries effects.","Article","Scopus",0.539578037630763,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,225,NA

Approaching the northern border of the system, the conspicuous presence of Oithona helgolandica, cladocerans and appendicularians, and the low fecundities of calanoid copepods suggest that a high proportion of the primary production may be channelled through microheterotrophic processes. Towards the southern area, calanoids dominated over cyclopoids, 'large' species (Drepanopus forcipatus, Calanoides cf. carinatus) were abundant, and copepod fecundities were high and steady, suggesting that there may be a more classical-like herbivorous food web. Paracalanus parvus and Ctenocalanus vanus occurred over the whole system but seemed to be key species in mixed and weakly stratified waters. Copepods peaked in stratified waters away from the front itself, while the abundance of eggs and nauplii was highest in weakly stratified waters next to the front. Apparently, the general heating occurring over the region in spring 1998 strongly affected both the physical and biological structure of the system. Unlike in 1995, a massive bloom of gelatinous zooplankton took place in 1998 and a bloom of the phagotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca sp. occurred in the northern area. Co-occurring copepod populations were depressed and their reproductive patterns seemed to be highly disrupted. Present observations stress the significance of variable external forcing in driving satisfactory habitat conditions for juvenile fish in the area.","Article","Scopus",0.520347480072388,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,229,NA

The project will focus on pelagic, benthopelagic and epibenthic macrofauna, and analyse distribution and abundance patterns in relation to the abiotic and biotic environment, as well as trophic relationships and life history strategies. Fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and gelatinous plankton and nekton have the highest priority in the study. A major challenge of the project is to overcome observation difficulties at large depths and in rugged terrain. A central aim is thus to utilise modern remote sensing technology (acoustics, optics) using advanced instrument carriers (e.g. towed vehicles, ROVs, AUVs, etc.). The project will be carried out as a multi-ship operation in 2003-2005, and the ongoing planning is a collaborative effort involving many nations around the North Atlantic. The project will work on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and in adjacent waters from the Azores to Iceland, both by surveying large areas by acoustics and mid-water trawling, and by focusing on three selected sub-areas for intensive sampling and observation by traditional and novel methods and technology. Overlapping with the field seasons, the period 2004-2008 will be an analytical phase, also including submission of data to OBIS. ¬© 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/√âditions scientifiques et m√©dicales Elsevier SAS.

Inshore, the ecological role of demersal fish is more important than that of krill. There, demersal fish are major consumers of benthos and also feed on zooplankton (mainly krill in summer). They are links between lower and upper levels of the food web and are common prey of other fish, birds and seals. Offshore, demersal fish depend less on benthos and feed more on zooplankton (mainly krill) and nekton, and are less accessible as prey of birds and seals. There, pelagic fish (especially lantern fish) are more abundant than inshore and play an important role in the energy flow from macrozooplankton to higher trophic levels (seabirds and seals). Through the higher fish predators, energy is transferred to land in the form of fish remains, pellets (birds), regurgitation and faeces (birds and seals). However, in the general context of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, krill (Euphausia superba) plays the central role in the food web because it is the main food source in terms of biomass for most of the high level predators from demersal fish up to whales. This has no obvious equivalent in other marine ecosystems. In Antarctic offshore coastal and oceanic waters the greatest proportion of energy from the ecosystem is transferred to land directly through krill consumers, such as flying birds, penguins, and seals. Beside krill, the populations of fish in the Antarctic Ocean are the second most important element for higher predators, in particular the energy-rich pelagic Myctophidae in open waters and the pelagic Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the high Antarctic zone. Although the occurrence of these pelagic fish inshore has been poorly documented, their abundance in neritic waters could be higher than previously believed.","Review","Scopus",0.67079463026391,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,369,NA

Contemporaneous samples of adults were obtained by trawl sampling in the study region. Daily larval production (7.56 √ó 1010 larvae/d) and the larval mortality rate (Z=0.11/d) during the cruise were estimated from a larval ""catch curve,"" wherein the logarithm of total age-specific larval abundance was regressed against larval age. For this analysis, larval age compositions at each of the 150 sample sites were determined by examination of otolith microstructure from subsampled larvae (n=2203), which were weighted by the polygonal Sette-Ahlstrom area surrounding each station. Female population weight-specific fecundity was estimated through a life table analysis that incorporated sex-specific differences in adult growth rate, female maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality (M). The resulting statistic (102.17 larvae/g) was insensitive to errors in estimating M and to the pattern of recruitment. Together, the two analyses indicated that a total biomass equal to 1366 metric tons (t)/d of age-1+ shortbelly rockfish (sexes combined) was needed to account for the observed level of spawning output during the cruise. Given the long-term seasonal distribution of spawning activity in the study area, as elucidated from a retrospective examination of California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) ichthyoplankton samples from 1952 to 1984, the ""daily"" total biomass was expanded to an annual total of 67,392 t. An attempt to account for all sources of error in the derivation of this estimate was made by application of the delta-method, which yielded a coefficient of variation of 19%. The relatively high precision of this larval production method, and the rapidity with which an absolute biomass estimate can be obtained, establishes that, for some species of rockfish (Sebastes spp.), it is an attractive alternative to traditional age-structured stock assessments.","Article","Scopus",0.672032976072065,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,397,NA

Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackfish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.","Article","Scopus",0.657379006800678,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,412,NA

We examine the population biology of an example system using the recent northward range expansion of the marine neogastropod Kelletia kelletii (Forbes, 1852). Location: This is a marine coastal shelf neogastropod species whose range extends from Isla Asuncion (Baja California, Mexico) to Monterey (CA, USA). Research sites spanned the extent of the range. Methods: We examine abundance distributions and size frequency distributions of K. kelletii for evidence of factors determining historic and contemporary distributional patterns. Population studies were supplemented by historic and contemporary hydrographic data, including seawater temperature data from California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) and National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), and seawater circulation data. Results: The structure of recently established populations varied dramatically from that of historic populations. Markedly low densities and irregular size frequency distributions characterized recently established populations and suggested only occasionally successful recruitment. The point of transition between historic and recently established populations also corresponded to the location of a gradient in seawater temperature and the confluence of two major oceanic currents. The accumulated data suggest that temperature and/or barriers to dispersal could have set both contemporary patterns in population structure as well as the former northern range limit. Main conclusions: Early life stages play a critical role in determining distributional patterns of K. kelletii. Dispersal barriers and temperature limitation are two plausible mechanisms that could determine both contemporary and historic distributional patterns. Future studies on this species should attempt to tease apart the relative importance of these factors in maintaining the populations at the northern edge of the range.","Article","Scopus",0.636715610754652,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,273,NA

They were focused on S. pteropus in the Atlantic and S. oualaniensis in the Indian and Pacific (mainly eastern Pacific) Oceans. The quantitative distribution of squids is not uniform; the areas of dense concentrations coincide with dynamically active zones of divergences and convergences and hydrological fronts. Planktonic paralarvae live in the epipelagic zone near pycnocline. Juveniles and adult squids are interzonal animals, rising to the surface during the night-time for feeding, and descend to the depths of 200-1000 m at dawn. The spatial range structure is complicated and consists of several areas with high squid abundance, which are isolated geographically and encompass different ecological parameters of the squid populations. Genetic exchange exists between these areas, thus they represent the superpopulational level of intraspecies structure. Both species, especially S. oualaniensis, are in process of active adaptive radiation. Five intraspecific forms of S. oualaniensis and two forms of S. pteropus were found. Sthenoteuthis spp. are very fast-growing animals: they can reach ML 55-60 cm and BW 8-9 kg at the age of 300 d. They are typical r-strategists with small eggs (0.75-1.0 mm), high fecundity (up to 10-22 million oocytes), monocyclic 1-yr life cycle, fast replacement of generations, quick variations of size structure and high productivity. Paralarvae and early juveniles eat mainly crustaceans while main food items of adults are micronektonic lantern fishes (Myctophidae) and squids. Adult Sthenoteuthis do not play an important role in the feeding of large oceanic top-predators. In the epipelagic ecosystems the main food chain is: crustaceans ‚Üí nyctoepipelagic myctophids ‚Üí Sthenoteuthis. A high degree of individual and social behavioral organization is characteristic of Sthenoteuthis squids. This is one of the most important prerequisites for their ecological progress.

Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80% within 15 years of exploitation. Compensatory increases in fast-growing species were observed, but often reversed within a decade. Using a meta-analytic approach, we estimate that large predatory fish biomass today is only about 10% of pre-industrial levels. We conclude that declines of large predators in coastal regions5 have extended throughout the global ocean, with potentially serious consequences for ecosystems5-7. Our analysis suggests that management based on recent data alone may be misleading, and provides minimum estimates for unexploited communities, which could serve as the 'missing baseline'8 needed for future restoration efforts.","Article","Scopus",0.601447248208065,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,300,NA

Our results revealed large inter-annual changes in macrozooplankton assemblages during the two summers. An upwelling regime associated with El Ni√±o conditions prevailed during the first summer, resulting in high chlorophyll concentrations and an abundance of both meso- and macrozooplankton. During this time, there were distinct inshore and offshore macrozooplankton assemblages that reflected an abrupt transition from upwelling-enriched shelf waters to oligotrophic oceanic waters. In contrast, the second summer was characterised by a downwelling regime associated with La Ni√±a conditions that resulted in low chlorophyll concentrations and decreased abundances of meso- and macrozooplankton. The lack of upwelling activity weakened horizontal gradients in macrozooplankton assemblages so that differences between surface and deep assemblages were more pronounced. Catches in light traps were dominated by hyperiid amphipods during the first summer and by the neritic euphausiid Pseudeuphausia latifrons during the second.

Examples are presented of application of the data to studies on North Sea herring, cod, mackerel, blue whiting and redfish as well as more general plankton studies relevant to fisheries research. Variations in the migration patterns of herring as well as recruitment have been related to abundances and species composition of the plankton in the CPR survey. Extensive use has been made of the CPR data in relation to cod, particularly in the development and testing of the 'match-mismatch' hypothesis. Advection of sufficient numbers of Calanus from the core oceanic areas of its distribution into the areas where the cod stocks occur may partly determine the success of those stocks. The analysis of the distribution and abundances of mackerel larvae in the CPR survey have shown contrasting variations between the North Sea and Celtic Sea. The expansion of the horse mackerel fishery in the north-eastern North Sea since 1987 has been related to physical events and a 'regime shift' in the plankton, described from CPR data. The oceanic spawning areas of the blue whiting and redfish were highlighted by the expansion of the CPR survey into the north-eastern and north-western Atlantic respectively. These results helped to focus the attention of fisheries scientists on stocks that have subsequently become the targets for commercial exploitation. The results of the CPR survey, particularly those on Calanus finmarchicus, the phytoplankton standing stock as measured by the CPR colour index, the overall patterns of trends in plankton abundance and distributions of indicator species have been used by fisheries scientists to interpret variations in fish stocks. Generally the CPR data can be used to determine whether changes in the distributions and growth rates of fish have resulted from changes in planktonic food, changes in strength of ocean currents and distribution of water masses and to identify trends in larval abundances. With the tightening regulation of fisheries to reduce overfishing, global climate change and changing anthropogenic inputs into the sea, the unique source of information on unexploited populations in the long-term time series of the CPR survey will be of increasing value to fisheries scientists in the study of natural variability. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.759087605015994,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,336,NA

A marked increase in the freshwater flow into the estuary of the Hunter River enhances the seasonal seaward movement of prawns and produces an initial increase in the abundance of adults in the adjacent oceanic waters; it is suggested that the disturbance to the estuarine sediments and to the prawns' normal burrowing and respiratory activity, as a result of the increased river flow, is responsible for this pronounced emigration. This initial increase in adult abundance enhances the prawns' reproductive potential, and the heavy rainfall indirectly assists the recruitment of young to the cotuary and their growth and survival, and thereby increases prawn abundance in the following year also. Prolonged dry weather adversely affects the prawns, and usually results in a smaller population. The annual fluctuations and absence of a downward trend in the catch statistics indicate that this stock has not been overfished. ¬© 1973 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Scopus",0.747370741977255,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,116,NA

Sampling distance contours positioned at 6, 10, 13, 17, 29 and 46 km from the coastline were occupied along three transects for a total of 18 stations sampled each cruise. A total of 35,024 larval fishes, representing 81 families was collected. Larval fish abundance declined across the neritic-oceanic gradient in each of the three sampling cruises. Coral reef fish larvae were the numerically dominant assemblage as far as 29 km (OC-29), but declined to less than 5 ind/100m3 at OC-46, where oceanic type larvae represented more than 85% of the total individuals. This data suggests that the distribution of coral reef fish larvae is mostly restricted to a fringe of less than 46 km from the coastline off La Parguera, in the northern Caribbean. Larval taxonomic structure at neritic contours (N-6 and N-10) was dominated by Clupeiformes, Gobiidae, Pomacentridae, Blennioidae, and Lutjanidae. The shelf-edge (SE-13) and oceanic contours down to OC-29 presented a mixed taxonomic assemblage of reef and oceanic larvae. Contour OC-46 formed a distinct cluster of 'oceanic type' larvae numerically dominated by Myctophidae (59.5%), Scombridae (7%) and Gonostomatidae (6%). Three basic dispersion patterns of Caribbean coral reef fish larvae can be discerned from this study, one mostly neritic, a widespread oceanic, and one associated with the outer shelf and the shelf-edge. Clupeiformes (sardines and anchovies), Labridae (wrasses) and Lutjanidae (snappers) are presented as model populations for the different dispersion patterns of coral reef fish larvae off La Parguera.","Article","Scopus",0.591620933488095,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,222,NA

Interannual variation in recruitment is the most important source of biological variability facing fisheries managers. Because most variation in recruitment occurs during early, mainly planktonic stages, recruitment fisheries oceanography usually integrates studies of plankton and physical oceanography. The concepts upon which these studies rest were first expressed in the late 1800s by Spencer Fullerton Baird, the first Commissioner of the US Commission of Fish and Fisheries. These concepts appear to have been independently developed by Johan Hjort and others in northern Europe in the early 1900s, and brought back to the United States through contacts between Hjort and Henry Bryant Bigelow, who passed the ideas to his students at Harvard University, including Lionel Albert Walford and Oscar Elton Sette. Although both Walford and Sette did their initial work in recruitment fisheries oceanography off the US east coast, as federal fisheries scientists, they were sent to California in response to the decline of the sardine fishery, where they incorporated the ideas of Hjort into the programme that has become the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). The original plan for CalCOFI research was to provide a test of Hjort's ideas. Scientists working with CalCOFI implemented this plan and conducted subsequent research that had its roots in the ideas expressed by Baird. This research was in marked contrast to the fishery-yield orientation of most fisheries research that was being conducted at the time on the west coast of North America, under the dominating influence of William Francis Thompson. In recent years, federal fisheries programmes have investigated recruitment processes of a number of other fish stocks, and considerable effort has been expended toward refining the conceptual framework beyond the hypotheses of Hjort. This paper expands on this history, making note of scientists who were particularly important in the evolution of this discipline. We conclude that although recruitment fisheries oceanography has become a well-established field of study, and many technological advances have been made, the recruitment process is still not well understood and fluctuations in year-class abundance remain a major source of uncertainty in managing marine fisheries.","Review","Scopus",0.680353725261715,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,382,NA

Habitat degradation and fishery overexploitation have led to drastic population declines on a global scale. Population monitoring is therefore essential to determine current status and manage conservation. In this first study in Italian waters on the geographic and ecological distribution of the two Mediterranean species, Hippocampus hippocampus and Hippocampus ramulosus, recreational scuba divers were recruited and trained to report sightings. A specially formulated questionnaire was produced and distributed to scuba diving schools and centers. In the 3-year study, 2536 divers spent 6077 diving hours gathering data and completed 8827 questionnaires. Eight percent of the questionnaires showed seahorse sightings, for a total of'3061 sighted specimens, 68% of which referred to Hippocampus ramulosus. The two species had overlapping geographic distributions. Seahorse abundance varied, with the northern Adriatic Sea showing greatest abundance, followed by the central-southern Tyrrhenian Sea. Seahorses were rare in the Ligurian and northern Tyrrhenian seas. Preferred habitats were shallow areas with either sandy bottoms or Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadows. Seahorse distribution may be correlated with the degree of degradation of P. oceanica meadows. Resource users (the divers) were willing to take part in biological monitoring and contributed in scientific terms by collecting considerable amounts of data over short time periods and in economic terms by decreasing costs. The greatest limitation with volunteers was the difficulty in obtaining a uniformly distributed sample across time and space. We conclude that recreational divers and other resource users can play an active part in monitoring the marine environment and that the Mediterranean Hippocampus Mission may be used as a model for biodiversity monitoring.","Article","Scopus",0.64131853131946,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,347,NA

Large-scale manipulations of human access replicated over a range of physical and biological conditions can generate insights over the processes shaping marine assemblages. We examined the relative roles of human impacts and hydrographic conditions on assemblages of shallow (3-10 m depth) rocky reefs by comparing no-take reserves with fishing areas occurring in gradients of exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves around two Mediterranean islands, Capraia and Giannutri, Italy. We hypothesized that fishing influences assemblages directly by reducing populations of target fish species, and indirectly by reducing predation on sea urchins, intensifying herbivory, and causing ""barrens"" of encrusting coralline algae. We examined how the possible effects of fishing varied with physical exposure of the coastline. The composition of fish assemblages differed significantly between sites within no-take reserves and fished reference sites. Abundances and sizes of predatory fishes targeted by local fisheries were greater in no-take reserves than in fished areas. Sea urchin densities, the extent of coralline barrens, and the structure of the algal and invertebrate benthic assemblages showed clear variation associated with exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves, but weak effects of protection from human use. Densities of the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula were significantly greater along the windward than along the leeward sides of the islands, and were positively correlated with the extent of coralline barrens. In contrast, the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus was more abundant along the leeward sides of islands and showed indirect responses to protection at Giannutri, where purple sea urchins tended to have greater densities at fished than at protected sites. Protection from fishing influenced fish assemblages directly, and benthic assemblages indirectly, but the latter effect was observed only at sites with lower physical exposure. Indirect effects of fishing and recovery of assemblages within marine protected areas through cascading trophic interactions are likely to vary depending on local physical conditions and on the characteristics of species that are locally dominant. ¬© 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.712044859671109,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,409,NA

Studies in Puerto Rico suggest that reproduction occurs over many months and that life spans are short and annual mortality rates high. We tracked 44 adult largemouth bass with ultrasonic telemetry over an 18-month period (two spawning seasons) to determine the temporal and spatial utilization of spawning grounds. During the 1998 spawning season, both males and females demonstrated high site fidelity to specific areas characteristic of spawning grounds over the first half of the calendar year. Within this period, two distinct spawning events were evident from fish movements and were subsequently verified by hatch frequencies of young. The two spawning events, from mid-January through March and from late May through June, coincided with highly fluctuating water levels. When levels were high, shallow, vegetated areas were available and used for spawning. The reoccupation of nest areas corroborates previous gonad analyses that suggested multiple partial spawns by individual fish. During the 1999 spawning season, water levels were high in January and spawning occurred for 3 weeks, but levels rapidly declined thereafter, minimizing reproduction. Both male and female largemouth bass exhibited strong homing and nest site fidelity by returning to previous nesting areas. Individual fish were observed nesting in the same spawning grounds, and several males repeatedly utilized the same nest site during each of the separate spawning events and during both years. Because in tropical reservoirs recruitment to the fishable largemouth bass stock is directly related to the abundance of age-0 fish, maintaining high, stable water levels during the spawning season should enhance the largemouth bass population.","Article","Scopus",0.789628388605701,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,396,NA

We found that spring winds and water temperature mediate the intensity of density-dependent survival from the eggs to the age-0 stage. Fall water temperature and juvenile pollock predator abundance mediate density dependence from the age-0 to the age-1 stage. The inclusion of such nonadditive and nonlinear effects in a population dynamics model improved our ability to simulate pollock recruitment. Our results point to the importance of understanding nonadditive and nonlinear interactions between external (climate) and internal factors in the presence of underlying environmental variation.

The approach incorporates observation errors, model uncertainty, and considers a possible shift in the productivity of Atlantic salmon. The risk analysis framework further incorporates uncertainty in the fishery harvest characteristics and presents the catch advice as probabilities of meeting or exceeding the conservation objectives relative to catch options. There is very strong evidence from the analyses that there has been a phase shift in productivity of Atlantic salmon of North American origin in the Northwest Atlantic. The change in productivity likely resulted from a change in marine survival which occurred in the early 1990s and has persisted to date. When the uncertainties in the input data are considered, the most parsimonious models suggest that there has been a shift in absolute abundance independent of variations in the spawner index contributing to the recruitment. There continues to be a large amount of uncertainty in the measures of abundance and population dynamics of Atlantic salmon. Uncertainty in the understanding of population dynamics does not necessarily equate to uncertainty in management advice. If model results suggest that spawning objectives are unattainable even when harvest rates are zero, then any harvest level will either accelerate the rate of decline if the model prediction is correct or diminish the probability of recovery if the model prediction is wrong.

Spatio-temporal gradients in temperature, turbidity, food availability and predation risk simulate the environment. We modeled predation as a function of temperature, the optical properties of the ambient water, the time allocation of feeding and the abundance of whiting (Merlangius merlangus). Growth and metabolic costs were assessed using a bioenergetic model. Model runs using real input data for the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, The Netherlands) and the southern North Sea show that estuarine residence results in fitter individuals through a considerable increase in survival probability of age-0 fish. Young herring pay for their migration into safer estuarine water by foregoing growth opportunities at sea. We suggest that temperature and, in particular, the time lag between estuarine and seawater temperatures, acts as a basic cue for herring to navigate in the heterogeneous space between the offshore spawning grounds at sea and the oligohaline nursery zone in estuaries.","Article","Scopus",0.509409081011359,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,313,NA

Common whelks are the main source of shells for large hermit crabs in the northern Atlantic but are vulnerable to direct and indirect effects of fishing activity. This study examined the potential consequences of degrading shell resources for common hermit crabs. Laboratory trials demonstrated that hermit crabs avoid low-quality damaged shells throughout their life history. This laboratory preference was corroborated by direct field observations of shells preferentially occupied by hermit crabs, compared with shells available for occupation. In the field, 8 times as many empty shells had holes compared to shells occupied by hermit crabs. In the North Sea, the abundance and biomass of live whelks and hermit crabs collected at sites where they cooccurred were significantly related. However, whelks occurred at far fewer sites overall and were more patchily distributed at high abundance than hermit crabs, which were more widespread. At a subset of sites, whelks of the same body-mass range occurred in the Irish and North Sea. However, at these sites, hermit crabs sampled from the North Sea had a significantly lower biomass. This suggests that the shells available for occupation at the North Sea sites would not support crabs of a body mass comparable to that found in the Irish Sea. Using published data, we calculated that in some of the intensively fished areas of the North Sea, 24% of the available shell resource will be damaged each year. The reduction in shell quality in the North Sea may impose a physical constraint on the upper size limit currently attainable by hermit crabs and hence may have implications for population viability. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2004.","Article","Scopus",0.574993799961528,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,344,NA

In the model, the population of saury is composed of two spawning cohorts: one spawned in the Kuroshio region during autumn-winter and the other spawned in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Transition Zone during winter-spring. The life cycle of saury was divided into six stages: namely egg, larval, juvenile, young, immature and adult stages. The life cycle model combines growth, survival, fishing and reproductive processes, in which the effects of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Kuroshio region and El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on the winter-spawning cohorts, the effects of SST in the Oyashio region on the spring-spawning cohorts, and the effects of fishing on the two spawning cohorts are taken into account. Results of basic modeling, in which environments are assumed stable and the stock is affected by fishing only, shows that the interannual fluctuations in the abundance are small and could hardly explain the observed large annual changes in abundance. On the contrary, results of modeling incorporating the effects of oceanic-climatic changes corresponded well with actual interannual-decadal variations in abundance. These results suggest the following environmental effects: (1) SST in the Kuroshio region affects decadal changes in abundance; (2) ENSO events influence the survival of the winter spawning cohort and result in large interannual variations in the abundance. It is concluded that large-scale climatic and oceanic changes strongly affect the abundance of saury.","Article","Scopus",0.674671090034329,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,261,0

Efforts to restore these populations to self-sustaining levels have been under way since the 1950s and continue to the present. In 1998-1999, we fitted 27 adult Gulf-strain striped bass with radio transmitters and released them in Lake Blackshear, Georgia. We used data on their survival, habitat use, and movement patterns to assess the potential long-term survival of fingerling striped bass stocked in this lake since 1996. Overall, we re-located only 27% of tagged fish in cool-water springs, and all radio-tagged striped bass that remained in the lake died during summer. Drought conditions based on rainfall and groundwater withdrawals during the study caused some cool-water springs in Lake Blackshear to stop flowing. Lake temperatures >27¬∞C for 13 consecutive weeks, die-offs of non-tagged fish, intermittent spring flows, and widespread mortality of tagged fish suggest that the long-term survival of stocked striped bass in Lake Blackshear probably will be poor. Successful re-introductions of Gulf-strain striped bass to rivers and reservoirs in their historic range will depend on the presence of cool-water springs. The persistence, abundance, and sizes of springs in this region are heavily dependent on the periodicity of droughts and the magnitude of groundwater use. Regional climatological data indicate that droughts occur about every 3 years. Therefore, better management of groundwater withdrawals during drought periods will become increasingly important to maintain aquifer levels (and cool-water springs) needed for restoring native striped bass to Gulf Coast rivers.","Article","Scopus",0.641359266694882,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,400,NA

Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Vald√©s, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. ¬© 2005 Mammal Society.","Review","Scopus",0.7262456491296,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,85,NA

The differences occur as successively more data are used for estimation, and they appear to be structural biases caused by a mis-specification of the SPA. In some cases the retrospective problem is so severe that the SPA is considered to be too unreliable for stock assessment purposes. There are many possible sources of retrospective patterns, and it is usually difficult in practice to determine which are more likely. We propose diagnostics to help determine the more likely causes. We use local influence diagnostics to investigate whether small changes or perturbations to SPA input components such as catches or natural mortalities can remove or reduce retrospective patterns. We show, for the fall-spawning herring stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence SPA, that relatively small age- and year-specific changes to the SPA assumptions about the proportional relationship between an abundance index and stock size can result in greatly reduced retrospective patterns. We therefore conclude primafacie that these assumptions are a plausible source of the retrospective pattern. Larger changes to catches, natural mortality assumptions, or estimation weights are required to reduce the retrospective pattern. These other factors seem to be less plausible sources of the retrospective pattern, although this is best assessed by the herring stock experts who are more knowledgeable about the fishery and other scientific information for this stock. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933.

Here, we use historical sources to understand ecosystem trends and establish a biomass estimate for a key marine species prior to the industrialization of fishing. Declining trajectories have been described for predatory fishes and complex coral reef systems globally, but few numerical estimates of past abundance exist. We combined historical research methods and population modeling to estimate the biomass of cod on Canada's Scotian Shelf in 1852. Mid 19th-century New England fishing logs offer geographically specific daily catch records, describing fleet activity on fishing grounds with negligible incentive to falsify records. Combined with ancillary fishery documents, these logs provide a solid, reliable basis for stock assessment. Based on these data we estimate a biomass for cod of 1.26 √ó 106 mt in 1852 - compared with less than 5 √ó 104 mt of total biomass today. In the current policy debate about rebuilding depleted fisheries and restoring marine ecosystems, it is important to recognize that fisheries for key commercial species like cod were far more productive in the past. As we attempt to rebuild these fisheries, our decisions should reflect real and realistic goals for management, not just recently observed catch levels. ¬© The Ecological Society of America.","Review","Scopus",0.695834447515152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,368,NA

Abundance trends provide key guidance when setting conservation priorities, whether indicating population decline, stability or recovery. Knowledge of the power of surveys to detect trends is essential, as the consequences of not detecting a real trend can be profound. 2. Unfortunately, some surveys have been established with no assessment of power, and others are used to study species that were not their original focus. The latter is common in the marine environment, where rare fish are monitored using catch data from surveys that target more abundant commercially fished species. 3. We calculated the power of a large-scale annual monitoring survey (the English North Sea bottom trawl survey) to detect decline and recovery of species that are vulnerable to fishing. As fisheries exploitation invariably precedes scientific investigation, the survey began after many vulnerable species had already been depleted. 4. The power of the survey to detect declines in the abundance of vulnerable species on time scales of < 10 years was low and the survey often failed to detect declines that would lead to listings under the IUCN A1 Red List criteria. Thus conservation prioritization based solely on survey data may fail to identify species at risk of regional extinction. 5. If conservation measures were effective, and vulnerable populations recovered at the maximum potential rate, 5-10 years of monitoring would often be required to detect recovery. 6. Power to detect trends in abundance was increased by developing a composite indicator that reflected trends in abundance of several vulnerable species. This indicator provided an overview of their conservation status. 7. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the precautionary principle, conservation prioritization and management action should not depend on the statistical significance of recent abundance trends when low power is a consequence of historical depletion. If the conservation prioritization and management of rare and/or vulnerable species have to be predicated on evidence of significant declines, then higher type 1 error rates (falsely detecting a decline) should be acceptable. This is because the costs of type 1 errors are lower than those of type 2 (failure to detect a real decline). ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.","Review","Scopus",0.793212815704934,NA,"1",NA,NA,15,263,NA

This study used a large-scale perspective and proposed two new indices: one based on the sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic, and the other on coastal wind stress. The proposed indices were not only consistent with empirical evidence but were also based on current understanding of the processes underlying environmental variability and pelagic fish recruitment dynamics. Prior to the mid-1980s, sardine recruitment strength was positively correlated with SST and negatively with wind. Subsequently, these relationships reversed, recruitment being negatively correlated with SST and positively correlated with wind. GAM models incorporating recruitment, spawning stock biomass and environmental indices were built and compared, and two hypotheses were formulated to explain the reversal of the environment-fish relationships. The first addressed a switch between two environmental regimes: the first (prior to the mid-1980s) characterised by weak stratification and strong enrichment, and the second (late 1980s and the 1990s) characterised by frequent warm events, stronger stratification, and reduced enrichment and productivity. The second hypothesis suggested that the reversal can be attributed to changed population structure, distribution and migration behaviour of the severely overfished sardine stock resulting in a shift from the optimal spawning area in the vicinity of Walvis Bay to the a less favourable spawning habitat in the north. The present depressed state of the stock does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about the effect of the environment on its population dynamics, nor to consider the implications for management. However, it is argued that an appreciation of how such relationships may change through time is important in further understanding and modelling oceanic and fisheries systems in the region.

From juvenile landings collected over 38 years, the thresholds of environmental factors were determined that limited the optimal environmental window (OEW) for sardine (Sardina, pilchardus recruitment success in the northwestern Iberian peninsula. The environmental factors considered were: water column stability in February, offshore water transport in March-April (QxMA), upwelling intensity in the preceding year from May to August (QxMJJA), and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. From 1875 to the mid-1920s, the mean number of years within the OEW was relatively constant. However, since the mid-1920s, there have been oscillations and alternating decades with high and low number of years within the OEW, which were related to oscillations in sardine landings. From 1906 to 2000, there were four record, low sardine catches in the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, related to a high number of successive years with prevailing conditions out of the OEW. From 1875 to the present, a high year-to-year variation of the NAO, QxMJJA and water stability in February was observed, although with mean values usually within the OEW. The collapse in the 1950s was related, partly, to successive years with low Q xMJJA. Successive years with high NAO values may be related to the collapse of the sardine fishery in the 1990s. QxMA has been the most significant factor controlling SRS in this area, being the factor related to the low catches observed in the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. Water stability was not responsible for any of the collapses observed, but since the 1920s, there has been a significant trend toward decreasing water column stability before the onset of the spring bloom.","Article","Scopus",0.744737834960458,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,NA

An extended hatching period (January to June) and a high (0.63-1.50-mm/d) juvenile daily growth rate required high sampling effort because age-0 largemouth bass recruited to the sampling gear between February and September.

Harvest-related poisoning events are common in tropical streams, yet research on stream recovery has largely been limited to temperate streams and generally does not include any measures of ecosystem function, such as leaf breakdown. 2. We assessed recovery of a second-order, high-gradient stream draining the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, 3 months after a chlorine-bleach poisoning event. The illegal poisoning of freshwater shrimps for harvest caused massive mortality of shrimps and dramatic changes in those ecosystem properties influenced by shrimps. We determined recovery potential using an established recovery index and assessed actual recovery by examining whether the poisoned reach returned to conditions resembling an undisturbed upstream reference reach. 3. Recovery potential was excellent (score = 729 of a possible 729) and can be attributed to nearby sources of organisms for colonisation, the mobility of dominant organisms, unimpaired habitat, rapid flushing and processing of chlorine, and location within a national forest. 4. Actual recovery was substantial. Comparison of the reference reach with the formerly poisoned reach indicated: (1) complete recovery of xiphocaridid and palaemonid shrimp population abundances, shrimp size distributions, leaf breakdown rates, and abundances of oligochaetes and mayflies on leaves, and (2) only small differences in atyid shrimp abundance and community and ecosystem properties influenced by atyid shrimps (standing stocks of epilithic fine inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll a, and abundances of chironomids and copepods on leaves). 5. There was no detectable pattern between any measured variables and distance downstream from the poisoning. However, shrimp size-distributions indicated that the observed recovery may represent a source-sink dynamic, in which the poisoned reach acts as a sink which depletes adult shrimp populations from surrounding undisturbed habitats. Thus, the rapid recovery observed in this study is consistent with results from other field studies of pulse chlorine disturbances, harvest-related fish poisonings, and recovery of freshwater biotic interactions, but it is unlikely to be sustainable if multiple poisonings deplete adult populations to the extent that juvenile recruitment does not offset adult shrimp mortality. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.537694876638234,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,270,NA

A direct comparison showed that there was a linear relationship between MVBS and log-transformed zooplankton dry weight. This linear relationship, determined from a mixed zooplankton-species population, was then compared with that reported in previous work from a region dominated by a single species of copepod and found to be significantly different. The scatter around the linear relationships determined between MVBS and log-transformed dry weights in regions of complex, mixed zooplankton populations results in our inability to distinguish different relationships that could be expected from different populations in varying oceanic regions. It is suggested that, without further manipulation of the data, ADCP MVBS cannot be used to determine quantitative estimates of zooplankton abundance and biomass in mixed populations. ""Observed MVBS"" was compared with model-predicted backscattering, calculated using acoustic models and abundance and size measurements of zooplankton from net samples. The results show that at high backscattering intensities (>-80 dB) the observed MVBS from an ADCP was generally consistent with the model predictions. Abundance, biovolume, and model-predicted backscattering contributions of six ""significant acoustic-scattering"" groups (amphipods, chaetognaths, copepods, euphausiids, fish, and pteropods) are shown to vary disproportionately. In particular, a rare and small but strong acoustic scatterer such as a pteropod can contribute as little as 0.1% to the total sample abundance and 0.1% to the biovolume but represent 69.5% of the total model-predicted backscattering. Model, instrumental, and methodological artefacts are identified as potential sources of inconsistencies between the observed and model-predicted backscattering. These include the effect of the orientation of zooplankton, inadequate knowledge of model parameters such as the sound-speed and density contrasts, the mismatch between sampling volumes of the net and acoustic instrument, and net avoidance by the more mobile scatterers. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Each spring and summer a tidal front is formed around the islands separating a well-mixed inshore habitat from a stratified offshore habitat. The objective of this study was to assess the foraging impact on zooplankton by age-0 pollock in the vicinity of this frontal structure. A bioenergetic model was used to estimate age-0 pollock food consumption from field estimates of water temperature, age-0 pollock density, diet and growth. Sampling of field variables took place over three hydrographic habitats along an inshore-offshore transect located north of the islands. The bioenergetics analysis was applied for a 2-week period during the late summer of four consecutive years, 1994-1997. Model results of age-0 pollock food consumption indicated variable levels of food depletion, changing with prey type, year and habitat. The foraging impact of age-0 pollock on copepods and euphausiids (most common prey) ranged from about 3% to 77% of the biomass available at the start of the simulation. Copepod depletion was typically greater than euphausiid depletion. Consequently, juvenile pollock < 60 mm in standard length were more likely to experience food limitation due to the greater proportion of copepods in their diet. We present evidence of severe foraging impact during 1996, when one of the primary prey items of juvenile pollock (i.e. large copepods) was scarcely represented both in their diet and in the water column. In all years, most instances of prey depletion were found at the inshore and front habitats; age-0 pollock densities were too low relative to their prey to severely impact the offshore zooplankton populations. We discuss these results with respect to modeling assumptions and in the context of previously acquired knowledge of fish behavior around frontal regions.","Article","Scopus",0.66286613768545,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,413,NA

A major shift in size composition and indices of species abundance and community biomass accompanied the start of fishing. The largest and most abundant predators, such as sharks and large tunas, suffered the greatest declines in abundance (21% on average). They also showed striking reductions in mean body mass. For example, the mean mass, of blue shark (Prionace glauca) was 52 kg in the 1950s compared to 22 kg in the 1990s. The estimated abundance of this species was 13% of that in the 1950s. Overall, the biomass of large predators fell by a factor of 10 between the periods. By contrast, several small and formerly rare species increased in abundance, e.g., pelagic stingray (Dasyatis violacea). However, the increases in small species did not balance the reductions in the biomass of large predators.

Mass occurrence of Scyphomedusa Aurelia aurita has been observed over the last 20 years, and its abundance has leveled off in recent years. A. aurita occurrence was from March to November with peak abundance in summer. Major source regions of A. aurita in Sagmi Bay are inferned to be in Tokyo Bay. Invasion of the Kuroshio Current into Sagami Bay (Kyucho events) sometimes supplies A. aurita from Tokyo Bay. Mass occurrence of another Scyphomedusa Chrysaora melanaster occurring from April to November has been also observed over the last 20 years, though it was restricted to the eastern and middle parts of the bay. Recently, however, the Chrysaora population is increasing in the western part of the bay.

During mass occurrence, the amount of inflow of jellyfishes into a set net was estimated to be 1 √ó 102-103 kg per day. The number of days of mass occurrence was 6 to 38 days per year from 1998 to 2002 in the western part of the bay. Jellyfishes are a nuisance to fisheries in Sagami Bay and are an obstacle for the operation of fisheries, damaging the freshness of fishing crops, stinging fishermen, etc. Moreover, especially during Kyucho events, jellyfishes are an impediment to the use of set nets because of net drag.

Currently, stock assessments in the Northeast Pacific are limited to the most important commercial species, little being known about the status of non-commercial species. Nevertheless, standardized bottom-trawl surveys conducted in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Gulf of Alaska (GoA), although primarily designed to assess commercial species, provide valuable information on the abundance, distribution, and mean weight of numerous taxa. Using a novel statistical approach and survey data for the years 1993-2003, we examined trends in catch per unit effort (cpue), frequency of occurrence, and mean weight of individuals for each taxon. Time trends were computed as the slope of a linear regression of each indicator on year, and were summarized separately for the eastern and western GoA and for the EBS. Within each system, trends were further compared between commercial and non-commercial taxa. Simulations were used to obtain reference distributions for the expected distribution of slopes across many dependent populations. Observed distributions of trends were compared with simulated distributions, suggesting that more taxa than expected showed a decreasing trend in cpue in the EBS, but not in the GoA. These trends likely resulted from low groundfish productivity in the EBS during the 1990s. At the same time, the frequency of occurrence of significantly more taxa than expected increased in the EBS and, to a lesser extent, in the western GoA. Increases in frequency of occurrence were much more common among non-commercial, invertebrate taxa, and may be a response to reductions in trawl fishing effort during the 1990s. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

After early marine life in coastal waters in northern Japan, chum salmon of Japanese origin spend their first summer in the Okhotsk Sea, then move to the Western Subarctic Gyre for the first winter at sea. Thereafter, they migrate between summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea and wintering grounds in the Alaskan Gyre for a period of usually up to four years, and finally return to their natal rivers to spawn. Carrying capacity (K) for chum salmon at an unfished equilibrium level was estimated from a Ricker spawner-recruitment curve, and the residual carrying capacity (RCC=(K-abundance)K-1). was positively correlated with body size at age 4, and negatively correlated with age at maturity. Marine survival of Hokkaido chum populations was affected by body size at release, but neither by Aleutian low pressure activity nor sea-surface temperature (SST) around coastal Hokkaido in spring, although there is some correlation between survival rate and coastal SST. Juveniles of the Pacific stock of Japanese sardine become broadly distributed in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) as far east as 180¬∞ longitude during spring. Adults disperse as far as the central Pacific and the southern areas of the Okhotsk Sea and Western Subarctic Gyre in years of high abundance. Somatic growth and age at maturation of sardine are density-dependent. We used catch, biomass and residuals of observed recruitment numbers from a Ricker curve (LNRR) as a measure of sardine population dynamics. LNRR was highly correlated with SST of KE in winter, which shifted in 1970 and 1988. Recent biomass and catch remain at extremely low levels due to a combination of adverse environmental conditions and intensive fishing. We suggest that Japanese populations of chum salmon and Japanese sardine have a broader geographic range than North American populations, perhaps because of differences between western and eastern boundary current systems, and associated larval drift (sardine) or avoidance of intra-species competition (chum salmon). ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Three regions of the Aegean Sea with aquaculture zones were sampled in May and September (reproductive and recruitment periods, respectively for most species in the Aegean Sea). In each region, 2 sub-areas were sampled: 1 located nearby the fish farming zones (within 2 to 3 n mile) and a similar site ('reference site') far away from these zones (>20 n mile). Three replicate hauls were made in each sub-area for each of the 3 investigated regions. Significant differences were observed in community structure between farming and reference sites, which were mainly due to quantitative rather than qualitative aspects. The overall abundance and/or biomass of wild demersal fish was significantly higher near the fish farms in every region studied during May without any significant change in diversity or biodiversity. During the recruitment period in September, total abundance and biomass were fairly similar. These findings support the hypothesis that the presence of fish farms affects the wild fish populations in the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean at a spatial scale larger than the immediate vicinity of fish cages. It seems that during the recruitment period all sites were stocked with fish close to the carrying capacity of the respective areas, and by late spring the areas close to fish farming zones had suffered little losses during winter, whereas populations at the reference sites had decreased substantially. ¬© Inter-Research 2005.","Article","Scopus",0.713887748540849,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,330,NA

Some species are even regarded as near obligate commensals of tunas. As food is one of the main factors that shape breeding strategies and determine breeding success of seabirds, it is of interest to test the hypothesis that variations in tuna abundance may have effects on foraging success and thus on breeding parameters of tropical seabirds. The Mozambique Channel is appropriate for such a study because relative tuna abundance is assessed annually (through fishery catches) and seabird populations are abundant. A regional synopsis shows that at least 3.034 million pairs of seabirds breed on islands of the Mozambique Channel, 99.3% being sooty terns. This super-abundant seabird is strongly associated with tuna and marine mammals when feeding. More than 99% of the sooty tern population of the Mozambique Channel breeds at three remote coralline islands, namely Juan de Nova (66%), Europa (25%) and Glorieuses (9%). Various breeding parameters (breeding population size, breeding time, growth rate of the chicks, daily food intake, diet) are studied at these three sites in order to investigate their relation to the marine environment (including tuna abundance). A preliminary estimate is made of the quantity of food eaten by the sooty tern population. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Tagging studies indicate that they are highly migratory, seasonal residents of Canadian waters, representing the northern extension of a North Atlantic-wide population centred at more southerly latitudes. Annual catches in Canadian waters average 60-80 mt per year, which represents but a small part of that estimated for the population as a whole. New ageing results indicate that the species grows more slowly than was reported previously, thus making the population less productive and more susceptible to overexploitation than has been reported. Two indices of population abundance did not provide a definitive view of mako shark population status. A standardized catch rate index from the commercial large pelagic fishery suggested stable abundance since 1988. However, the analysis did not have the statistical power to detect anything less than a severe decline. In contrast, the median size of mako sharks in the commercial catch has declined since 1998, suggesting a loss of larger sharks. These results are broadly consistent with a previous report of population decline, although it appears unlikely that current exploitation rates in Canada are having an appreciable impact on the population.

Data collected aboard tuna vessels have been used to estimate trends in relative abundance, while data collected from fishery-independent research vessels have been used to estimate trends in actual abundance. One of the largest discrepancies between the two data sources is that tuna vessels tend to report dolphin schools that are 400%-500% larger than schools observed by research vessels. After comparing research vessel and tuna vessel observations overlapping in space and time, it appears that either measurement error or selective reporting of large schools is the most likely explanation for the disparity. Comparing single-species schools against portions of mixed-species schools introduced bias. Revised fishery-dependent abundance estimates were generated using only single-species dolphin schools, resulting in estimates that appear more similar to recent fishery-independent abundance estimates. Biases associated with mixed-species schools did not appear to be correctable in fishery-dependent data, suggesting that data on mixed-species schools should not be considered if fishery-dependent data are to be combined with fishery-independent data for stock assessment purposes. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Article","Scopus",0.66492242045655,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,122,NA

Based on data for 177 populations (62 species) from four north-temperate oceanic regions (Northeast Atlantic and Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, North mid-Atlantic), 81% of the populations in decline prior to 1992 experienced reductions in their rate of loss thereafter; species whose rate of population decline accelerated after 1992 were predominantly top predators such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), sole (Solea solea) and pelagic sharks. Combining population data across regions and species, marine fish have declined 35% since 1978 and are currently less than 70% of recorded maxima; demersal species are generally at historic lows, pelagic species are generally stable or increasing in abundance. Declines by demersal species have been associated with substantive increases in pelagic species, a pattern consistent with the hypothesis that increases in the latter may be attributable to reduced predation mortality. There is a need to determine the consequences to population growth effected by the reductions in age (21%) and size (13%) at maturity and in mean age (5%) and size (18%) of spawners, concomitant with population decline. We conclude that reductions in the rate of population decline, in the absence of targets for population increase, will be insufficient to effect a recovery of marine fish biodiversity, and that great care must be exercised when interpreting multi-species patterns in abundance. Of fundamental importance is the need to explain the geographical, species-specific and habitat biases that pervade patterns of marine fish recovery and biodiversity. ¬© 2005 The Royal Society.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.835125841956233,NA,"1",NA,NA,5,50,NA

Fish use of discarded conch shells was investigated in four different habitat types: sand, seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and coral reefs. The study was carried out in the waters off South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), between October 2003 and January 2004. The density of discarded shells was greatest near coral reefs; however, the percentage of shells occupied by adult fish was higher in isolated shells on sand and in mangrove habitats. Juvenile fish also showed a preference for sheltering in conch shells relative to other microhabitat types on sandy plains and in mangrove and seagrass habitats. Differences in use of single shells by fish in different habitats were attributed to differences in piscivore abundance and habitat complexity. Although not all isolated shells were occupied by fish, all conch middens deposited by fishermen had fish inhabitants. Examination of fish use of conch middens in three habitat types and conch piles of one, three, and five shells constructed on sand found both fish diversity and abundance increased on conch middens of increasing size. This study suggests that disposal of conch shells as large middens in habitats of low complexity will increase the amount of shelter present and may enhance fish populations in these habitats. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2005.","Article","Scopus",0.613864741981607,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,339,NA

In 1989, enormous mass development of the comb jelly in the Black Sea coincided with a breakdown of the commercially highly important anchovy Engraulis encrasicholus fishery in this area. This collapse probably resulted from multiple factors, among which overfishing and food competition from the ctenophore played a prominent role, enhanced by predation of M. leidyi on the early life stages of the anchovy. The abundance of food due to the depletion of the anchovy stock permitted a population explosion of M. leidyi. Subsequently, reduced fishing pressure allowed recovery of the anchovy stock and led to a new peak in anchovy landings in the Black Sea in 1995. Moreover, changes in the atmospheric and oceanic patterns in the northern hemisphere in the second half of the 1980s could have altered the composition of the phyto- and zooplankton communities and thus the food base of the small pelagic fish species. In the second half of the 1990s, the invasion of the Black Sea by another alien ctenophore, Beroe ovata, preying on ctenophores, raised hopes that this species could control M. leidyi. However, it is uncertain whether the preying capacity of B. ovata is sufficient to control M. leidyi in other than locally favourable conditions. At the present time, judging by the recent development in the Black Sea, the invasion of the Caspian Sea by M. leidyi does not yet seem to have reached maximum intensity. More consistent and comparable investigations in the Caspian and Black Seas are necessary to improve the protection, management and exploitation of the stocks of small pelagic fishes, in order to increase their capacity to resist and survive unforeseeable disturbances of their ecosystem by invaders such as M. leidyi. In view of the new invasion by this ctenophore, research into the exploitation of the Caspian kilka Clupeonella spp. stocks and the influence of atmospheric teleconnection patterns on ecological conditions in the Caspian Sea is of particular importance.","Review","Scopus",0.62862025063981,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,410,NA

Particular emphasis is given to two complementary (young-of-year = yoy, and older) life stages whose relative abundances differed between FFS and Midway. Older fishes averaged one-third higher in density at FFS, whereas yoy were two-threefold higher at Midway. Populations of fishes at the two atolls thus have different underlying temporal dynamics. Endemic species were generally important at both atolls, especially at Midway, farther upchain (and downcurrent) in the archipelago. The yoy of Hawaiian endemics were disproportionately numerous, which may indicate more consistent recruitment of endemics - an observation worthy of further evaluation elsewhere. Despite the whole reef-scale differences in yoy densities between atolls, habitat effects on yoy were largely consistent at both. The size/age composition of fishes differed among habitats, with yoy dominating numerically on semi-sheltered backreefs and especially on sheltered lagoonal patch reefs. This is likely due to two related factors: the wave-sheltered location and the relative abundance of small-sized shelter (coral rubble and branching corals) in (semi) sheltered habitats compared to the scoured limestone and large-scale 'spur-and-groove' relief of wave-exposed forereefs. In the NWHI, extensive areas of (semi)sheltered habitat occur only at emergent and drowned atolls that are increasingly represented in the more ancient, northwestern part of the archipelago. The potential importance of sheltered atoll lagoons as juvenile nursery habitat makes atolls prime candidates for consideration as no-take Marine Protected Areas within the provisional NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve and perhaps elsewhere. This tentative conclusion justifies a long-term evaluation of spatial variations in recruitment among habitats of varying wave exposure at additional atolls, at other more wave-exposed fringing reefs surrounding basalt pinnacles in the NWHI, and at other oceanic atolls and continental reefs.","Article","Scopus",0.731756518211766,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,52,NA

Mar. Sys. 25 (3-4) (2005) 405]), but with an increased resolution of the zooplankton stage variable [J. Plankton Res. 23 (2001) 1217; ICES Marine Science 219 (2003) 208]. The model copepods are represented by five stages: eggs, an aggregated variable of nauplii, two aggregated groups of copepodites and adults. The transfer among the stages, i.e., hatching, molting and reproduction, is controlled by food availability and temperature. As usual, the model food web is truncated at the level of zooplankton. The study explores the effects of different parametrization of zooplankton mortality and looks in particular on light-dependent rates. The light climate may serve a proxy for the effects of visual feeding of fish larvae and fish. Different choices of the mortality parameters can result in remarkable differences in abundances and biomass of the model zooplankton and in the timing of its development. It is found that the different choices of mortality affect the development of populations in several ways: Relative small initial differences of abundances at the beginning of the spring bloom are important for the development of the model populations. Higher mortality rates are less important at food rich conditions than at scarce resources. At low phytoplankton levels, the individual development of the copepods through the stages can be faster for elevated mortality rates because then less animals have to share the available food. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrothermal venting and an associated biological assemblage were discovered in the volcanic crater (‚àº250 m depth). Warm water with bubbling gas emanated through rock fissures and sediments. Shrimp (some of them swimming) were clustered at vents, while other individuals lay immobile on sediments. The shrimp fauna consisted of 3 mesopelagic species that had no prior record of benthic or vent association. We suggest that these midwater shrimp, from deeper water populations offshore, were trapped within the crater during their downward diel vertical migration. It is unknown whether they then succumbed to the hostile vent environment (immobile individuals) or whether they are potentially opportunistic vent residents (active individuals). Given the abundance of submarine arc volcanoes worldwide, this phenomenon suggests that volcanic arcs could be important interaction sites between oceanic midwater and vent communities. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

One hypothesis for the decline in this western Steller sea lion population is that a climate regime shift in 1976-1977 changed the species composition of the fish community and reduced the nutritional quality (energy density) of the sea lion prey field. This in turn led to nutritional stress and reduced individual fitness, survival, and reproduction of sea lions. Implications of this regime shift-""junk food"" hypothesis are that (1) the recruitment and abundance of supposed high quality species (e.g., Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi) decreased while those of supposed low quality (e.g., species in the family Gadidae) increased following the regime shift, (2) Steller sea lion diets shifted in response to this change in fish community structure, and (3) a diet composed principally of gadids (e.g., walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma) is detrimental to sea lion fitness and survival. We examine data relating to each of these implications and find little support for the hypothesis that increases in the availability and consumption of gadids following the regime shift are primarily responsible for the decline of the western population of Steller sea lion. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","Review","Scopus",0.70369941503669,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,294,0

They are also important food items for many fish and benthivorous seabirds. It has commonly been thought that predation pressure on blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) populations is negligible in the Baltic Sea, owing to the scarcity of major invertebrate predators such as starfish and crabs. It has recently been shown, however, that the blue mussel is the main food item for roach (Rutilus rutilus) in the archipelago areas of the western Gulf of Finland, where this freshwater fish species has become increasingly abundant, mainly due to increased eutrophication. To quantify the influence of roach predation on blue mussel populations we measured the standing biomass and size structure of the local blue mussel population and used a bioenergetic model to estimate mussel consumption by individual roach during two consecutive summers, 1997 and 1998. The results of the model were combined with existing data on roach abundance, giving annual consumption estimates of 75-105 kg blue mussel dry weight ha-1 in the study area, approximately two-thirds of these consumed mussels being &gt; 10 mm. This corresponds to approximately one-third of the standing population of mussels &gt; 10 mm in the area. Our results suggest that the predation effects of vertebrates on Baltic blue mussel populations are not insignificant, as previously believed. Predation by roach and other predators may have an important structuring effect on unstable blue mussel communities within the Gulf of Finland, where the species lives at the edge of its range. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2005.","Article","Scopus",0.639797733902257,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,243,NA

However, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are numerous and have an alternating-year pattern of abundance that provides a natural experimental control to test for interspecific competition in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Since a number of studies have recently examined pink salmon interactions with other salmon, we reviewed them in an effort to describe patterns of interaction over broad regions of the ocean. Research consistently indicated that pink salmon significantly altered prey abundance of other salmon species (e.g., zooplankton, squid), leading to altered diet, reduced total prey consumption and growth, delayed maturation, and reduced survival, depending on species and locale. Reduced survival was observed in chum salmon (O. keta) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) originating from Puget Sound and in Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (O. nerka). Growth of pink salmon was not measurably affected by other salmon species, but their growth was sometimes inversely related to their own abundance. In all marine studies, pink salmon affected other species through exploitation of prey resources rather than interference. Interspecific competition was observed in nearshore and offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, and one study documented competition between species originating from different continents. Climate change had variable effects on competition. In the North Pacific Ocean, competition was observed before and after the ocean regime shift in 1977 that significantly altered abundances of many marine species, whereas a study in the Pacific Northwest reported a shift from predation- to competition-based mortality in response to the 1982/1983 El Nino. Key traits of pink salmon that influenced competition with other salmonids included great abundance, high consumption rates and rapid growth, degree of diet overlap or consumption of lower trophic level prey, and early migration timing into the ocean. The consistent pattern of findings from multiple regions of the ocean provides evidence that interspecific competition can significantly influence salmon population dynamics and that pink salmon may be the dominant competitor among salmon in marine waters. ¬© Springer 2005.","Article","Scopus",0.603562486654647,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,281,NA

Three different types of regime shift (smooth, abrupt and discontinuous) are identified on the basis of different patterns in the relationship between the response of an ecosystem variable (usually biotic) and some external forcing or condition (control variable). The smooth regime shift is represented by a quasi-linear relationship between the response and control variables. The abrupt regime shift exhibits a nonlinear relationship between the response and control variables, and the discontinuous regime shift is characterized by the trajectory of the response variable differing when the forcing variable increases compared to when it decreases (i.e., the occurrence of alternative ""stable"" states). Most often, oceanic regime shifts are identified from time series of biotic variables (often commercial fish), but this approach does not allow the identification of discontinuous regime shifts. Recognizing discontinuous regime shifts is, however, particularly important as evidence from terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems suggests that such regime shifts may not be immediately reversible. Based on a review of various generic classes of mathematical models, we conclude that regime shifts arise from the interaction between population processes and external forcing variables. The shift between ecosystem states can be caused by gradual, cumulative changes in the forcing variable(s) or it can be triggered by acute disturbances, either anthropogenic or natural. A protocol for diagnosing the type of regime shift encountered is described and applied to a data set on Georges Bank haddock, from which it is concluded that a discontinuous regime shift in the abundance of haddock may have occurred. It is acknowledged that few, if any, marine data are available to confirm the occurrence of discontinuous regime shifts in the ocean. Nevertheless, we argue that there is good theoretical evidence for their occurrence as well as some anecdotal evidence from data collection campaigns and that the possibility of their occurrence should be recognized in the development of natural resource management strategies. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Blackburnia lenta (Sharp), described from specimens collected just below HaleakalƒÅ summit in 1894, was found at lower elevational sites ranging from 2,400 to 2,750 m. Mecyclothorax rusticus Sharp, last seen in 1896, and M. nubicola (Blackburn), collected only in 1878, were also rediscovered in that vicinity. Recent collections of B. lenta contradict the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's previous classification of this species as one likely to be extinct. Nevertheless, B. lenta's known distribution comprises only 145 ha within an elevational zone that is bounded above and below by unicolonial populations of the invasive alien Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr). The known recent collections of M. rusticus and M. nubicola also occurred outside the distributional range of the Argentine ant. Mature eggs held in the lateral oviducts of B. lenta females averaged 1.4x the volume of the largest eggs previously reported among 13 species of Blackburnia. We hypothesize that the giant eggs of B. lenta result from selective forces favoring large, well-nourished developing and hatched first-instar larvae, consistent with a patchy distribution of suitable microhabitat and prey in the subalpine HaleakalƒÅ landscape. The specialized life history of B. lenta, and coincidence of distributional limits of the three rediscovered carabid species with range limits of the Argentine ant populations suggest that all would be jeopardized by future distributional expansion of Argentine ant. These intersecting phenomena compel us to conclude that B. lenta, M. nubicola, and M. rusticus are appropriate candidates for I.U.C.N. threatened species designation, pending further studies of their geographic ranges and historical trends in abundance. ¬© 2005 by University of Hawai'i Press All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus",0.538143120892847,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,399,NA

Surveys were used as indices and Paulik analysis revealed relationships between stages. In 80% of the years, year class strength reflected SSB. Poorer than expected year classes were determined during the larva to 0-wr phase, whilst stronger than expected year classes were apparently determined during the 0-wr to 1-wr stage. There was no clear relationship between survival of young stages of herring and the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus but the year class strength of 0-wr and 1-wr had a negative relationship to bottom water temperature. Lower sea water temperatures in the North Sea are associated with higher Calanus abundance. The analysis shows that the strength of aberrant year classes of North Sea herring is determined between the pelagic larval and the juvenile stages. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.601636759716139,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,358,NA

A biophysical modeling study is presented here in which factors are examined that may have led to the difference in population mean growth. A one-dimensional physical model, forced by winds and tides, was used to simulate the vertical structure (of currents, temperature field, and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate) following a column of water in a Lagrangian sense at a site on the southern flank of Georges Bank over 5-day periods in late May of 1993 and 1994. The biophysical model and observed zooplankton abundance allowed us to explore the vertical structure and temporal (hourly) evolution of feeding and growth for cod larvae in relation to environmental conditions. Our trophodynamic model is improved over previous versions and now includes the effect of light on larval feeding response, as well as the effect of temperature on larval metabolic costs, ingestion, and digestion. Larval prey profiles, comprising four copepod species, were used from a time series of 1/4-m 2 MOCNESS tows to define the prey field. Data from a collateral time-series of larval gut contents (1-m2 MOCNESS tows) was used to define maximum ingestion (satiation level) and prey selection. Model outputs provide depth-dependent estimates of growth, prey biomass ingested, larval length, and larval weight. Water-column growth-rate profiles were made for four size classes of larvae (5, 6, 7 and 9 mm) under the environmental conditions observed in May 1993 and 1994. A weighted-mean growth rate based on the mean vertical distribution of larvae was estimated for each size class. In all cases, when using all available potential prey, the model-derived 1994 growth rates were higher (by 3-6% day-1) than those for 1993. However, simulations in which 7-mm larvae followed the field-derived weighted mean depth over the sampling period, and were limited to their preferred Pseudocalanus prey, resulted in average growth of 12.2% day-1 for 1993 and 9.7% day -1 for 1994. These compared closely to the field growth means of 11.3% day-1 in 1993 and 9.8% day-1 in 1994. Thus, the lower observed growth in May 1994 may have resulted from depth-dependent food limitation and prey-selectivity coupled with the greater metabolic costs induced by the higher temperature that year. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.525182921542739,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,54,NA

However, as fisheries monitoring started long after exploitation of many species began, this is a difficult issue to address. Here we show how the 'shifting baseline' syndrome can affect the stock assessment of a vulnerable species by masking real population trends and thereby put marine animals at serious risk. Current fishery data suggest that landings of the large Gulf grouper (Mycteroperca jordani, Serranidae) are increasing in the Gulf of California. However, reviews of historical evidence, naturalists' observations and a systematic documentation of fishers' perceptions of trends in the abundance of this species indicate that it has dramatically declined. The heyday for the Gulf grouper fishery occurred prior to the 1970s, after which abundance dropped rapidly, probably falling to a few percent of former numbers. This decline happened long before fishery statistics were formally developed. We use the case of the Gulf grouper to illustrate how other vulnerable tropical and semi-tropical fish and shellfish species around the world may be facing the same fate as the Gulf grouper. In accordance with other recent studies, we recommend using historical tools as part of a broad data-gathering approach to assess the conservation status of marine species that are vulnerable to over-exploitation. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Review","Scopus",0.721754288035978,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,326,NA

A reduction in the spawning stock biomass of herring may release jellyfish from competition for prey with herring and exacerbate any impact by jellyfish on herring survival. Both jellyfish abundance and the spawning success of herring fluctuate from year to year and increase under similar environmental conditions. The abundance of medusae (diameter = 1 to 47 cm, June to August) at herring spawning areas in the North Sea was correlated positively with the abundance of recently hatched herring larvae (&lt;1 cm, sampled 1 to 15 September 1971 to 1986), and this concurrence heightens the potential for competition. A significant negative relationship (p &lt; 0.05) between the survival of herring to Age 0 and the abundance of the scyphozoan Aurelia aurita implies that this jellyfish might adversely impact the North Sea herring population.

Abundances of Aurelia aurita, Cyanea lamarckii and Cyanea capillata medusae (Scyphozoa) in the North Sea appear to be linked to large-scale inter-annual climatic change, as quantified by the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), the Barents Sea-Ice Index (BSII) and changes in the latitude of the Gulf Stream North Wall (GSNW). Hydroclimatic forcing may thus be an important factor influencing the abundance of gelatinous zooplankton and may modulate the scale of any ecosystem impact of jellyfish. The population responses are probably also affected by local variability in the environment manifested in intra-annual changes in temperature, salinity, current strength/direction and prey abundance. Aurelia aurita and C. lamarckii in the north-west and south-east North Sea exhibited contrasting relationships to change in the NAOI and BSII: north of Scotland, where the North Sea borders the Atlantic, positive relationships were evident between the abundance of scyphomedusae (data from 1974 to 1986, except 1975) and the indices; whereas west of northern Denmark, a region much less affected by Atlantic inflow, negative relationships were found (data from 1973 to 1983, except 1974). Weaker negative relationships with the NAOI were also found in an intermediate region, east of Scotland, for the abundance of A. aurita and C. capillata medusae (1971 to 1982). East of Shetland, the abundance of jellyfish was not correlated directly with the NAOI but, in contrast to all other regions, the abundances of A. aurita and C. lamarckii (1971 to 1986, not 1984) were found to correlate negatively with changes in the GSNW, which itself was significantly positively correlated to the NAOI with a two year lag. On this evidence, we suggest that, for jellyfish, there exist three regions of the North Sea with distinct environmental processes governing species abundance: one north of Scotland, another east of Shetland, and a more southerly group (i.e. east of Scotland and west of northern Denmark). Impacts by jellyfish are likely to vary regionally, and ecosystem management may benefit from considering this spatial variability.","Article","Scopus",0.677779840370617,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,113,NA

Monitoring of temporal patterns in abundance of early benthic stages of P. elephas indicated that predation may be higher inside the Medes Islands MPA relative to adjacent control sites. Tethering experiments were performed to test whether predation rates actually differed within and outside the MPA. Relative mortality of recently-settled juveniles inside the MPA was much higher than in control sites in adjacent non-protected areas. Treatments with and without shelter indicated that predation on recently-settled juvenile spiny lobsters was moderated by the availability of suitable shelter.

We tested for density-dependent distribution on both regional and local scales. At the regional scale, a density-dependent response was observed in the majority of populations. At the local scale, density was expected to remain stable in areas of high density and to change more rapidly in marginal areas, in response to changes in regional abundance. Lower local density responses were associated with areas of higher density, but deviations were evident, in part due to the magnitude of decline and in part due to fishing effects. Former areas of high density can be eroded if the population has severely declined. Fishing directed at an area of high density can cause local depletion when recolonization rates are low relative to the intensity of fishing. Thus, areas occupied during periods of low regional abundance do not of necessity reflect the historical array of core areas. We do not recommend the use of IFD theory to identify core areas of heavily exploited species. Instead, we recommend a precautionary approach that assumes the existence of low-mixing populations that can be differentially affected by fishing. For species at risk, only data derived before significant population declines should be used to identify high-density areas. Such areas would represent those with the potential to support higher densities as well as the historical array of subpopulations.

The recruitment survey resampled all NMFS survey sites south of Hudson Canyon and a selection of sites north and east of Hudson Canyon off the Long Island coast over the entire depth range of this species with the exception of the most inshore reaches off Long Island. More ocean quahogs were encountered, on a per tow basis, in the vicinity of and north of Hudson Canyon. The proportion of recruits in the size-frequency distribution was higher in the south and the most recent recruitment events were concentrated there. Analysis of the 104 size-frequency distributions delineated regions of recent recruitment, areas that have not seen significant recruitment for many decades and areas that received heavy recruitment some decades previously but not recently. Overall, the survey suggests that three regionally distinctive processes determine the size-frequency distributions of ocean quahog assemblages and recruitment therein. The area northeast of Hudson Canyon is unique in the regionally extensive uniformity of size-frequency distributions among sampled assemblages, the near absence of recent recruitment and the presence of large numbers of older recruits, 65-80 mm in size. The inshore (by ocean quahog standards) area off New Jersey is unique in the dominant presence of the largest size classes of ocean quahogs and the remarkable absence of significant recruitment over an extraordinary time span. The area south of 39¬∞N is unique in the widespread presence of relatively young recruits, including some animals with ages within the time span of the present fishery. Recruitment events in ocean quahog populations, although rare in the sense of occurring only once in a score or two of years, are frequent in the context of the +200-year life span of this species, yet also rare in the context of stock survey timing and fishery dynamics. This study strongly supports the assumption that long-lived species recruit successfully only rarely when at carrying capacity. This study also suggests that the history of recruitment over the last perhaps two-score years, revealed by this survey, may be a poor measure of the recruitment dynamics to be anticipated over the next two-score years when the population abundance is reduced to what is anticipated to approximate the biomass at maximum sustainable yield. Given the long time span required for ocean quahogs to grow to fishable size, a substantive disequilibrium may exist between the recruitment anticipated from the relationship of adult biomass to carrying capacity and the contemporaneous number of recruits for minimally 20 y after adult abundance is reduced from circa-1980 carrying capacity to biomass, maximum sustainable yield.","Article","Scopus",0.807886668820223,NA,"0",NA,NA,15,377,NA

Sizes at sex change are deduced from the median overlap in size distributions of initial phase (IP: female or female and precocious male) and terminal phase (TP) male individuals for each labroid species and from the median sizes of transitional morph individuals of the endemic, spectacled parrotfish Chlorurus perspicillatus. Relative (to maximum) sizes at sex change vary significantly among 4 major species and, within these species, among the 6 reef populations, a finding that contrasts with a recent model of invariant relative size at sex change in protogynous fishes. Overall median size at sex change is compared to the density of a large carangid (giant trevally Caranx ignobilis, the biomass-dominant apex predator) and to that of the respective labroid species population at each atoll. Size at sex change is inversely related to the density of giant trevally but not meaningfully related to the density of the respective labroid population. The size distributions of the labroids - like those of all other prey reef fishes - are strongly skewed toward smaller and larger fish at atolls with higher and lower densities, respectively, of giant trevally. Altogether these observations strongly suggest that higher mortality from predation at greater predator densities, rather than slower growth rates under greater intraspecific competition at higher prey densities, is the cause of the observed differences among atolls in prey attributes. We suggest that prey body size distribution can potentially provide a sensitive measure, complementary to predator density, for assessing changes in the abundance of apex predators on coral reefs. Phenotypic indices of size at sex change from adult female to male in sexually dimorphic labroids with striking differences in coloration (that facilitate underwater observations) have great potential as nondestructive alternatives to gonad examination requiring specimen sacrifice. Labroid color change thus represents a potentially useful index for assessing changes in the functional structure of coral reef fish assemblages and reef ecosystems. ¬© Inter-Research 2005.","Article","Scopus",0.71406718989288,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,302,NA

We tested this hypothesis by modeling nitrate input through upwelling to the upper layers of the ocean off Peru between 6¬∞ and 14¬∞S using data on wind stress and sea surface temperature. The model predicted the amount of carbon fixed by primary production each year from 1925 to 2000, which was then apportioned to the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass and ultimately to the seabird population and the anchovy fishery, the largest single-species fishery on Earth. The model predicted a marked increase in primary production as a consequence of increasing wind stress. It overestimated the anchovy biomass after the collapse of the fishery in 1972, but closely predicted the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to the mid-1960s, and their decline thereafter, explaining about 94% of the variation in seabird numbers from 1925 to 2000. The model indicates the seabirds consumed 14.4% of the available anchovies and, thus, that seabirds consumed 2.3% of the new production, before the development of the anchovy fishery, and only 2.2% of the available anchovies and 0.3% of the new production after the development of the fishery. The model results clarify the roles that environmental and anthropogenic factors may have had in regulating the guano-producing seabird populations. It indicates that the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to 1955 was likely a response to increased productivity of the Peruvian upwelling system and that the subsequent drastic decline in seabird abundance was likely due to competition for food with the fishery, which caught ‚àº85% of the anchovies, which otherwise would have been available for the seabirds. This model also shows that an increase in oceanic primary production promotes reproductive success and population growth in higher trophic level organisms.","Article","Scopus",0.706418519817093,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,197,NA

Thus, fisheries are monitored and regulated in management units largely determined by the distribution of fisheries, areas which may or may not coincide with biological self-perpetuating units. There are several methods of identifying fish stocks, including the interpretation of distribution and relative abundance, tagging studies, genetic analyses and spatial variation in morphometrics, life-history parameters, parasites and contaminants. The natural variability and difficulty in measuring life history and morphological characteristics at the population level suggest that these are not good indicators of stock separation for elasmobranchs. Information on population demography does, however, reveal the relationships between fisheries and resource, and indicates where sampling programmes for the collection of stock assessment data should take place. Tagging studies, in particular, can indicate a stock's main range and migrations, if linked with a good description of the fisheries that are involved with its exploitation. The environmental parameters associated with the distribution of a species are also a useful guide to the likely boundaries of movement. In this paper, we discuss the utility of these approaches to delineate areas to be used for stock assessments of elasmobranchs, and show how biological and fishery information has been used to describe the stock identity for six case study species in the Northeast Atlantic.","Review","Scopus",0.593994909999381,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,367,NA

Biological data, now available from recent research surveys and an ongoing observer program, provide an opportunity to examine the potential impact of the rajid fishery at a species level.

Here we survey three generations of fishers from Mexico's Gulf of California (N = 108), where fish populations have declined steeply over the last 60 years, to investigate how far and fast their environmental baselines are shifting. Compared to young fishers, old fishers named five times as many species and four times as many fishing sites as once being abundant/productive but now depleted (Kruskal-Wallis tests, both p &lt; 0.001) with no evidence of a slowdown in rates of loss experienced by younger compared to older generations (Kruskal-Wallis test, n.s. in both cases).

Owing to such ecological considerations, it is essential to understand the role that climate might play in the interannual variability of these organisms and the mechanisms by which it could modify the ecosystem functioning. In this study, a causal chain of meteorological, hydrological and ecological processes linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was identified in the Ligurian Sea, Northwestern Mediterranean. The forcing by the NAO drives most of the hydro-climatic variability during winter and early spring. Subsequently, interannual and decadal changes of the dominant copepods Centropages typicus and Temora stylifera were significantly correlated to the state of the hydro-climatic signal and tightly coupled to the NAO. Direct and indirect effects whose influence promoted phenological changes in the two copepod populations drove the species' responses to climatic forcing. Opposite responses of the analysed species were also highlighted by these results. While years characterized by the positive phase of the NAO leads to enhancement of the strength and the forward move of the C. typicus peak, they act negatively on the annual cycle of T. stylifera, the abundance of which drops twofold and the annual peak appears delayed in time. In contrast, low NAO years lead to high abundance of T. stylifera and a forward timing of its peak, and acts in turn negatively on the C. typicus annual cycle in both abundance (low) and timing (delayed). Owing to the synchronism between hydro-climatic conditions and the NAO, and the major role of these species in the pelagic ecosystem of the studied area, these results provide key elements for interpreting and forecasting decadal changes of planktonic populations in the Ligurian Sea. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2005.","Article","Scopus",0.548623237490423,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,279,NA

This species was previously only caught as bycatch in the Loligo gahi and finfish trawl fishery. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the Falkland Islands population of Dissostichus eleginoides using an age-structured production model (ASPM). Two models were investigated; one using a Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship and another using trawler CPUE based estimates of toothfish abundance to estimate yearly recruitment. A stock recruitment relationship was not included within the model that used abundance estimates, as recruitment to the population was estimated directly from the index of relative recruit abundance calculated from trawler CPUE. The model was fitted to longline standardised CPUE and to the catch-at-length data. The models produced estimates that provided similar declines in the toothfish population although the start and end biomass estimates varied slightly. The models provided estimates of between 13,000 and 26,000 tonnes of current spawning stock biomass and showed current biomass to be between 38 and 46% of virgin biomass. The fit to CPUE was poor between 1994 and 1996, which we hypothesised could have been due to unreported catches or changes in q or M. This was a time when there was considerable IUU fishing in the southwest Atlantic. When the model was allowed to estimate a level of extra catch the fit was improved and 5000 tonnes of extra catch was estimated. Two further models were briefly examined to investigate the possibility of changes in M and q but both required large changes in those parameters in order to fit. Estimates of MSY varied widely, from 912 to almost 3000 tonnes. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus",0.79805241933345,NA,"1",NA,NA,15,78,NA

A substantial population of the species was studied in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). The population density and the spatial distribution of P. jacobaeus were estimated in the lake with line transect sampling by SCUBA diving, a method not previously used for scallop density estimations. Individuals of the first size class (small) were mainly restricted to shallow waters (4-8 m), while individuals of the second size class (large) were mainly restricted to deeper waters (>12 m). Possible reasons for this size-separation were: (1) the most appropriate settlement substrate for pediveligers was in shallow waters, (2) the strong summer thermocline in the lake may have induced the selection of the shallow and warm bottoms of the lake as settlement areas, (3) intraspecific competition between adults and pediveligers, and (4) the high fishing mortality of large individuals in shallow waters. On the hypothesis that successful recruitment of P. jacobaeus occurred mostly in the shallow areas of the lake, it was deduced that P. jacobaeus gradually migrated, as they grew, from the shallow settlement fields of the lake to the deeper areas. The density of large individuals was associated with depth and the degree of scatter (QDœÜ) of the granule size frequencies. Higher densities of large individuals were found deeper and in poorly sorted sediments (QDœÜ > 1.0). The size of large individuals was positively correlated with depth. The size of P. jacobaeus population in Lake Vouliagmeni was estimated. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus",0.768241794105421,"0",NA,NA,10,NA,14,NA

Predicted patterns are robust to alternative assumptions about how mobile organisms may alter dispersal behavior in relation to local fitness (per capita gain from net food intake minus predation mortality). Large marine protected areas (MPAs) would be needed to rebuild endangered populations and counter impacts of growing fishing effort. We expected that increases in dispersal rate in response to lower food availability and higher predation risk would reduce efficacy of MPAs as a management tool. Instead, simulations indicated that this negative effect may generally be eliminated or even reversed by positive effects of fitness-maximizing behaviors. Interannual variability in ocean circulation can further reduce the efficacy of MPAs; therefore, the dynamic nature of pelagic environments should also be considered in MPA design. Anomalies in ocean circulation may shift productive areas relative to MPA location, resulting in increased fishing mortality and (or) misinterpretation of catch statistics. ¬© 2005 NRC.","Article","Scopus",0.568651859072509,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,338,NA

In sea herring, flounder, cod, and other late immigrants (which probably colonized the Baltic after the Ancylus stage), abundant year classes occur in periods of higher salinity.

This led to regime shifts in the ecology of the North Sea (NS) and the central Baltic Sea (CBS), which involved all trophic levels in the pelagial of these two neighbouring continental shelf seas. Increasing air and sea surface temperatures, which affected critical physical and biological processes, were the main direct and indirect driving forces. After 1987, phytoplankton biomass in both systems increased and the growing season was extended. The composition of phyto- and zooplankton communities in both seas changed conspicuously, e.g. dinoflagellate abundance increased and diatom abundance decreased in the CBS. Key copepod species that are essential in fish diets experienced pronounced changes in biomass. Abundance of Calanus finmarchicus (NS) and Pseudocalanus sp. (CBS) fell to low levels, whereas C. helgolandicus (NS) and Temora longicornis and Acartia spp. (CBS) were persistently abundant. These changes in biomass of different copepod species had dramatic consequences on biomass, fisheries, and landings of key fish species: North Sea cod declined, cod in the CBS remained at low levels, and CBS sprat reached unprecedented high biomass levels resulting in high yields. The synchronous regime shifts in NS and CBS resulted in profound changes in both marine ecosystems. However, the reaction of fish populations to the bottom-up mechanisms caused by the same climatic shift was very different for the three fish stocks. ¬© 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Atka mackerel were found in dense aggregations near the Aleutian Islands where they are a major prey item of endangered Steller sea lions. In 1999, 1375 tagged fish were released and a biomass of 76 679 metric tonnes (t) was estimated outside a trawl exclusion zone using a simple Petersen model. In 2000, 8773 tagged fish were released and the estimated biomasses were 117 900 t inside and 82 057 t outside the trawl exclusion zones using an integrated tagging model. Movement into the open zone was small after 107 days (0.6%), whereas movement from the open area was potentially large but highly uncertain after 107 days (81%). Our model suggests that trawl exclusion zones in Seguam Pass are effective in separating a large biomass of potential prey for Steller sea lions from the immediate effects of local fisheries. Atka mackerel do not appear to move substantially outside their local aggregations (<70 km), and they show strong habitat preferences within their local home ranges. In one instance, fish released in an area of low Atka mackerel abundance returned to their capture location about 2 miles away. Thus individual Atka mackerel may have an affinity for particular areas within their home range, perhaps resulting from adaptations to local oceanic conditions along the Aleutian Island archipelago. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.674908547290304,"1",NA,NA,5,NA,4,NA

Meiofauna, which are among the smallest benthic organisms, may be more resistant to disturbance by trawling since they are likely to be re-suspended rather than killed by trawls. Their short generation times allow populations to withstand elevated mortality. In this study, we determined the effect of trawling disturbance, season and sediment type on the structure of meiofaunal communities in a commercial fishing ground in Thermaikos Gulf, north Aegean Sea, Greece. The trawling season is limited to 8 months between October and May. A grid of five nearshore stations was chosen along a north-south productivity gradient and an additional offshore station was included as a reference point. Sediment chemistry and meiofaunal community structure were studied before the trawling season started, as well as 1 and 4 months after the initiation of the fishing period. Results showed that there were no short term (30 days) trawling impacts on meiofauna in terms of abundance and community structure but that there were recognizable effects on the community structure of nematodes and the abundance of polychaetes. In contrast, most meiofaunal taxa displayed significant seasonal variability, 4 months after the initiation of the fishing period; however, other closely related factors such as temperature, sediment particle size and primary productivity are more likely to be responsible for the observed patterns. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Similarly, during June 1999, fin whales were the most numerically dominant species of large whale in the SE Bering Sea, with highest densities and abundance in the 'central' middle shelf (163.7 to 168.1¬∞ W): 0.0169 fin whales km-2, N = 938 (CV = 0.54). During the summers of 1997 and 1999, 65 and 79 % of the prey consumption by fin whales in the SE Bering Sea occurred on the central middle shelf. Prey biomass consumed by fin and humpback whales on the SE Bering Sea shelf and slope in 1997 (264474 to 723504 metric tons, mt) is equivalent to 34-94% of the 1997 echo-integration trawl estimate of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma biomass (age 1+) for the shelf east of 170¬∞ W (0.77 √ó 106 mt). Large whales were much more abundant on the middle shelf during the late 1990s than during preceding decades and, therefore, their foraging may have impacted trophic dynamics, carbon pathways and nutrient cycling. The partitioning of available carbon and energy in the pelagic and benthic systems of the shelf, as determined previously during the 1970s, when whales were rare, should now be reexamined relative to the increased ecological impact of these top-level predators. Fluxes of carbon that involve pathways through whales should be incorporated in shelf and oceanic carbon budgets.","Review","Scopus",0.729368670691809,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,206,NA

It was revealed that in austral autumn-winter of 2000 and 2002 the Falkland Current shifted from its normal offshore position westwards and entered the feeding grounds of the spring-spawning cohort of the Patagonian squid Loligo gahi located in the north-eastern part of the Falkland Shelf (at 50-51¬∞S). A good correspondence was observed between the inshore movement of the Current in May-July with the squid abundance (in terms of CPUE) in the following September-October much further north 'downstream' on the Patagonian Shelf (46¬∞S). Both age structure and earlier genetic studies revealed that squid occurred in both regions (51¬∞ and 46¬∞S) belonged to the same cohort. Analysis of the dynamics of the Falkland Current with catches of L. gahi in both regions suggested that in years when the Current was intensified and shifted westwards (2000 and 2002), a part of squid population was likely to be displaced from their common feeding grounds much further north and aggregated on the shelf at 46¬∞S. Reduction of fishing effort and its re-allocation to other areas is recommended in years of such displacements. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The coexistence of alternative reproductive phenotypes will probably be shaped by spatial and temporal variability in the environment. However, the effects of such variability on coexistence and the scale at which it operates are seldom understood. 2. To quantify such effects, we examined spatial and temporal dynamics in the abundance and frequency of alternative phenotypes of male coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch Walbaum, which mature as either large fighters (age-3 'hooknoses') or small sneakers (age-2 'jacks'). Using over 20 years of data on coded-wire tagged fish released from nine Oregon hatcheries, we tested for the effects of ocean environment independent of those due to freshwater rearing. 3. Annual fluctuations of the abundance of jack and hooknose males within populations were correlated strongly by brood year (cohort) but not by return year (breeding group). This occurred independently of significant effects of release practice (i.e. the number of fish released, body size at release and date of release), indicating that a synchronized fluctuation in mortality during the first year at sea was the predominant cause. As a result, the annual frequency of the alternative phenotypes at breeding varied considerably within populations. 4. Spatial patterns in the annual fluctuations of the two phenotypes were similar (i.e. synchronous among populations), except that jacks showed local spatial structure (decreased synchrony with distance) not evident among hooknoses. This suggests that oceanic processes affecting the two phenotypes operate at different spatial scales. Despite effects on salmon abundance, the ocean environment had little influence through its effects on salmon growth on the relative frequencies of the alternative phenotypes within and among populations. 5. The results provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of alternative phenotypes, including an intragenerational time lag that increases annual variability in phenotype frequencies at breeding (return years) and the significance of local freshwater processes, rather than oceanic processes, on phenotype expression. Freshwater processes, such as juvenile growth, timing of migration and breeding competition, operating at evolutionary and intragenerational time-scales, are probably the predominant forces affecting phenotype frequency. ¬© 2006 British Ecological Society.","Article","Scopus",0.604255740215209,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36,NA

In the fishery area off Peru, squid abundance was positively associated with sea surface temperatures (SST) between 17 and 22¬∞C during July, corresponding to the peak of the fishery season. In the putative hatching area close to the Costa Rica Dome, squid abundance was positively associated with SST of between 24 and 28¬∞C during September, prior to the start of the fishery season. Squid abundance is apparently strongly influenced by mesoscale variability linked to ENSO, with low levels of upwelling during the very strong El Ni√±o of 1997 to 1998 leading to very low catches of squid off Peru. Variability in upwelling off Peru and in the Costa Rica Dome region may drive primary and secondary production and transport processes affecting the planktonic early life stages and also the availability of food and suitable habitat for adult squid. ¬© Inter-Research 2006.","Article","Scopus",0.609828235832754,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,264,NA

We quantified habitat preferences for 6 tropical seabird species representing a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse group within the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). Seabird censuses were conducted aboard NOAA research vessels from August to November of 1989 and 1990 using 300 m strip transect methods. Simultaneously with the seabird censuses and from the same ships, oceanic habitat was quantified by measuring sea surface temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll, as well as thermocline depth and strength. We quantified seabird habitat using generalized additive models fitted with forward and backward selection algorithms based on minimizing the Akaike information criterion (AIC). In general, seabird habitat models performed well in explaining spatial variability in abundance, reducing the null deviance to ranges between 42.8 and 73.5 %, and predicting seabird density patterns with an accuracy ranging from 56.6 to 80.5 %. Relative abundance of the species modeled affected the outcome: the higher the abundance, the more robust the fit. Seabirds feeding on fishes and squids associated with habitats characterized by deep (&gt;100 m) and strong (&gt;2¬∞C 10 m-1) thermoclines, while planktivorous species preferred habitat characterized by shallower thermoclines with cooler surface temperatures (&lt;25¬∞C) and a less stratified water column. Thus, seabirds in different feeding guilds have clear and distinct habitat preferences within the ETP. We propose thermocline topography as a key variable in predicting distribution and abundance of seabirds in this area, probably due to its influence on the availability of seabird prey. ¬© Inter-Research 2006.","Article","Scopus",0.548118469067364,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,142,NA

Samples were collected during February-March 2002 using a Bongo net and a multiple opening/closing net in five depth layers (0-30m, 30-60m, 60-100m, 100-140m and 140-220m). Eggs and larvae were restricted mainly to the shelf areas in the Angola-Benguela Front and southern Angola Current waters. Their vertical distributions in the Angola-Benguela Front and northern Benguela upwelling region showed a sharp decline in abundance at about 60m depth. This decline appeared to be correlated to the distribution of dissolved oxygen in the water column. It is hypothesised that low oxygen concentrations have a strong impact on the development and survival of the early life-cycle stages of fish, and that recruitment of sardine and other pelagic species relies more on the upward extension of the oxygen minimum layer than was previously thought.

This study aimed to assess the migration and survival of large farmed salmon released from fish farms at different times during autumn and winter. Farmed salmon were individually tagged with external tags and released from two fish farms, one in southern Norway and the other in northern Norway. Salmon released in autumn one year before attaining sexual maturity appeared to survive poorly to sexual maturation, whereas salmon escaping later in winter showed greater survival. The released salmon appeared to move with the current and appeared to have a very weak homing instinct, if any. Based on the results of the tagging experiments, the direction and speed of ocean currents, and information about the abundance of fish farm escapees in salmon fisheries and stocks in several countries in the Northeast Atlantic, two hypotheses are advanced: first, salmon that escape during early autumn the year before they become sexually mature are transported with the currents to Arctic areas and subsequently do not survive the winter; second, large salmon escaping from fish farms in Ireland, Scotland, the Faroe Islands, and Norway during winter and spring move with the current and, during the following summer or autumn, may enter homewater fisheries and spawning populations far away from the site of escape, when they become sexually mature. ¬© 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","Article","Scopus",0.704917590685273,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,141,NA

This summary is based on the results of two complementary series of relatively recent underwater diver surveys conducted by the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and allied-agency personnel that began in the early 1990s and extended through 2004. The first series of surveys began in 1992 at French Frigate Shoals and 1993 at Midway Atoll as a re-characterization of a decade-prior baseline assessment conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). These surveys were repeated yearly from 1995 through 2000. A second series of assessment surveys began in 2000 and extended through 2001 and 2002. The first series thus is an intensive long-term but spatially limited characterization that complements a spatially extensive but relatively short-term characterization for all ten emergent NWHI reefs in the second series. Among the more important patterns linked to predation and related processes that have been revealed recently are: a nearly threefold greater standing biomass of shallow-water reef fishes in the NWHI (versus the Main Hawaiian Islands, MHI) that primarily reflects the near extirpation of apex predatory reef fishes in the MHI and a large reduction in secondary carnivores; the importance of wave-sheltered habitats as juvenile nurseries for many species and the value of atolls that provide disproportionate amounts of sheltered habitat; the heretofore unquantified extent of endemism (e.g., > 50% by numerical abundance) in NWHI reef fishes and its geographic increase with latitude-longitude to maxima at the three northernmost atolls; and the effects of apex predators on the body size distribution of prey reef fishes and the size-at-sex change in protogynous parrotfishes in the NWHI. These findings have identified the NWHI as one of the few remaining predator-dominated coral-reef ecosystems and an important part of an archipelago with a unique and strongly endemic fish fauna.","Article","Scopus",0.738874322430043,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,150,NA

Approximately 150,000 pearl oysters were either exported or killed during the exploitation. An expedition in 1930 to assess post-harvest population status found 480 P. margaritifera and determined the population to be severely depleted. Limited surveys in 1994 and 2000 found only a few pearl oysters and led to the conclusion that the population was still depleted. In 2003, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-led multi-agency marine debris removal team spent several months conducting surveys at Pearl and Hermes Atoll that included quantitative observations of Pinctada margaritifera. Data were collected on location, size, depth, habitat, and orientation of individual pearl oysters on the reef. Analyses of the 1930 and 2003 data sets revealed similar size-frequency distributions of the P. margaritifera population. The population has a spatial distribution within the Atoll similar to the 1930 post-harvest distribution, and some sustained level of reproduction. Density and depth distribution comparisons from the two survey periods suggest that pearl oysters are significantly more abundant in the shallow waters where they were harvested during the fishery but at a similar density overall as they were during the 1930 survey. Although no estimates of absolute population size are available for any time period, the large number of oysters harvested prior to the 1930 survey, together with estimates of oyster density in 1930 and 2003, suggest that the population may never have recovered to its pre-exploitation level.","Article","Scopus",0.787060797445555,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,69,NA

This study shows how indigenous peoples assisted in the design of MPAs by identifying marine substrates and related resident taxa on aerial photos, information which was then incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) database, along with dive survey data. Two questions were asked: (1) Is indigenous ecological knowledge accurate enough for mapping the benthos and associated taxa? (2) Is such an approach an appropriate way for assisting in the biological and social design of MPAs in Oceania? Conventional quadrat field dive surveys were used to measure the accuracy of substrate identification by local informants and a visual survey was used to test hypotheses formulated from local knowledge regarding the spatial distribution and relative abundance of non-cryptic species within certain benthic habitats. Equivalence rates between indigenous aerial photo interpretations of dominant benthic substrates and in situ dive surveys were 75-85% for a moderately detailed classification scheme of the benthos, which included nine locally-defined abiotic and biotic benthic classes for the MPA seabed. Similarly, the taxa inventory showed a strong correspondence between the qualitative predictions of local fisherfolk and the quantitative analysis of non-cryptic species distribution, including their relative abundance and geophysical locations. Indigenous people's predictions about the presence or absence of fish in different benthic habitats corresponded 77% and 92% of the time (depending on scoring schema) with in situ visual measurements. These results demonstrate how incorporating local knowledge of benthic heterogeneity, existing biological communities, and particular spatio-temporal events of biological significance into a GIS database can corroborate the production of scientifically reliable base resource maps for designing MPAs in an environmentally and culturally sound fashion. This participatory approach was used to design and then establish MPAs in the Roviana and Vonavona region of the Western Solomon Islands. Under appropriate conditions, interdisciplinary work can complement the design of scientific fishery management and biodiversity conservation prescriptions for coastal Oceania. ¬© 2006 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Article","Scopus",0.470616010167914,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,74,NA

Here we present evidence from the marine environment that exploited species exhibit higher temporal variability in abundance than unexploited species. This remains true after accounting for life-history effects, abundance, ecological traits and phylogeny. The increased variability of exploited populations is probably caused by fishery-induced truncation of the age structure, which reduces the capacity of populations to buffer environmental events. Therefore, to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain the total viable biomass but also to prevent the significant truncation of age structure. The double jeopardy of fishing to potentially deplete stock sizes and, more immediately, to amplify the peaks and valleys of population variability, calls for a precautionary management approach. ¬©2006 Nature Publishing Group.","Article","Scopus",0.677200487958815,"?",NA,"Larval fish surveys",5,NA,7,NA

The analysis of fish larvae distribution in relation to geostrophic circulation and hydrography is an innovative interdisciplinary approach for the understanding of fish larvae ecology. The Bray-Curtis Index defined two larval fish assemblages with spatial-temporal variations: coastal assemblage dominated by epipelagic coastal species (e.g. Sardinops caeruleus) and oceanic assemblages - oceanic and transitional oceanic assemblages both dominated by mesopelagic species (e.g. Vinciguerria lucetia and Benthosema panamense) but with different larval abundance. The assemblage variations appear to be related to water exchange between the bay and the Gulf through the North Mouth. During July-October, the geostrophic flow through the entrance is strong, and the oceanic assemblages spread in the whole bay, whereas during February-May when the geostrophic transport is weak, the coastal assemblage is distributed over the whole bay. The strong summer-autumn water interchange between bay and gulf is in agreement with the annual evolution of the surface water properties inside the bay, from high-salinity Gulf of California Water during winter-spring to fresher Tropical Surface Water during summer-autumn, when the highest species number was recorded. ¬© The Author 2006.

Here, we report the results of a general survey of several lakes and the first data on the Hang Du I lake, a small basin devoid of any apparent communication with the surrounding sea. Hang Du I is characterized by the presence of Rhizostomeae, genus Mastigias, suggesting strong similarities with the famous lakes described from the archipelago of Palau. Among the benthic organisms sponges are the most important group. Temperature and abundance of the monsoon rains are the main factors influencing remarkable seasonal variations in physical-chemical parameters and the community structure of the lake. A thermal crisis with water temperatures up to 36 ¬∞C was recorded in September 2003. In this period, usually abundant medusae and sea anemones totally disappeared. Sponge populations showed fast growth rates in winter and spring and a partial degeneration to face the harsh conditions of the summer season.

In this paper we report the results of an experiment in French Polynesia, in which densities of an abundant sea urchin, Echinometra mathaei, were manipulated within the territories of an abundant omnivorous, 'gardening' pomacentrid fish (Stegastes lividus) in thickets of Acropora pulchra. Increasing the sea urchin density resulted in reductions in the standing crop of algae and over-grazing of the dead coral substratum on which the algae grew. After 2 yr of this treatment, the coral thickets began to collapse. Reducing sea urchin densities to very low levels also resulted in collapse of the coral thickets and reduced densities of the fish, although algal biomass was apparently unaffected. We posit that the fish-coral-sea urchin-algal assemblage is relatively robust to wide fluctuations in sea urchin densities, but when sea urchin densities are driven to extremes the coral-algal habitat becomes destabilised and the entire system collapses, possibly as a result of different bioerosion processes in play at high and low sea urchin densities. ¬© Inter-Research 2007.","Article","Scopus",0.642058379398757,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,192,NA

Long time series of scientific survey data, underpinning the management of commercially exploited species such as cod, are being used to diagnose mechanisms that could affect the composition and relative abundance of species in marine food webs. By assembling published data from studies in exploited North Atlantic ecosystems, we found pronounced geographical variation in top-down and bottom-up trophic forcing. The data suggest that ecosystem susceptibility to top-down control and their resiliency to exploitation are related to species richness and oceanic temperature conditions.

The genera are genetically diverse, comprising several known ecotypes or lineages. However, little is known of the distribution of these lineages over large geographic areas. Here, we analysed the relative abundance of Prochlorococcus ecotypes and Synechococcus lineages at the ocean basin scale along an Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) using dot blot hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. The transect covered several contrasting oceanic provinces (gyres, upwelling, temperate regions) as well as environmentally 'equivalent' regions in the northern and southern hemisphere (northern and southern gyres and temperate regions). Flow cytometric data revealed a discrete separation in abundance of major picocyanobacterial genera. Prochlorococcus reached highest abundance in oligotrophic regions, while more mesotrophic waters were dominated by Synechococcus. Individual genetic lineages of both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus showed highly similar distributions in corresponding regions in the northern and southern hemisphere. In addition, Prochlorococcus showed a distinctive depth distribution, with HLI and HLII ecotypes near the surface and co-occurring LL ecotypes further down in the water column. Conversely, Synechococcus generally revealed no obvious depth preference, but did show highly specific distribution at the horizontal scale, with clades I and IV particularly dominating temperate, mesotrophic waters in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The data clearly reveal that specific picocyanobacterial lineages proliferate in similar oceanic provinces separated by large spatial scales. Furthermore, comparison with an earlier AMT dataset suggests that basin scale distribution patterns for Prochlorococcus ecotypes are remarkably reproducible from year to year. ¬© 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation ¬© 2007 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.430957966408856,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,307,NA

Environmental parameters, such as sea temperature and oceanographic processes, have a large influence on movement at the various life cycle stages, particularly those of oceanic squid. Tag recapture studies are the most common way of directly examining cephalopod movement, particularly in species which are heavily fished. Electronic tags, however, are being more commonly used to track cephalopods, providing detailed small- and large-scale movement information. Chemical tagging of paralarvae through maternal transfer may prove to be a viable technique for tracking this little understood cephalopod life stage, as large numbers of individuals could be tagged at once. Numerous indirect methods can also be used to examine cephalopod movement, such as chemical analyses of the elemental and/or isotopic signatures of cephalopod hard parts, with growing interest in utilising these techniques for elucidating migration pathways, as is commonly done for fish. Geographic differences in parasite fauna have also been used to indirectly provide movement information, however, explicit movement studies require detailed information on parasite-host specificity and parasite geographic distribution, which is yet to be determined for cephalopods. Molecular genetics offers a powerful approach to estimating realised effective migration rates among populations, and continuing developments in markers and analytical techniques hold the promise of more detailed identification of migrants. To date genetic studies indicate that migration in squids is extensive but can be blocked by major oceanographic features, and in cuttlefish and octopus migration is more locally restricted than predictions from life history parameters would suggest. Satellite data showing the location of fishing lights have been increasingly used to examine the movement of squid fishing vessels, as a proxy for monitoring the movement of the squid populations themselves, allowing for the remote monitoring of oceanic species. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.479629926308844,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,394,NA

The prevalence of maturing females and mature males, along with the collection of a single viable egg mop, provide the first evidence of spawning of this species at the northern limit of its geographic range of distribution. Northward expansion of the long-finned squid population may be related to a general warming trend in Newfoundland near-shore waters. However, trends in size and abundance of short-finned squid (Illex illecebrosus) suggest that this expansion may also be related to reduced competition. We hypothesize that these two squid species share, to a large extent, a common niche on the eastern USA shelf and that opposing responses to ecosystem variation affect their relative abundance. We address this hypothesis by applying time-series analysis of species-specific fishery- and survey-based abundance indices with biologic and environmental input variables. Our models indicate that direct competition is not important, but that variation in atmospheric forcing, as well as latitudinal position of the Shelf-Slope Front (SSF), are closely related to direct oceanographic processes that exert opposing effects on these two species. While the direct oceanographic mechanisms that regulate year-class strength remain unknown, we present a hypothesis to account for opposing population responses to oceanographic variation that operates early in the life history of both species. For the oceanic and highly migratory short-finned squid, variation in the latitudinal position of the SSF is related to efficiency of downstream dispersal by the Gulf Stream and survival of young stages. For the neritic long-finned squid, variation in local inshore temperature affects the time exposed to intense predation through its effect on rates of embryonic development and growth. The expansion of long-finned squid population abundance in 2000 was associated with both warm local water temperatures and an unusual eastward displacement of the atmospheric features associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). These conditions may have resulted in an unfavorable oceanic regime for short-finned squid but a favorable regime for long-finned squid on the continental shelf as far north as southern Newfoundland. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","Article","Scopus",0.570049610734021,"0",NA,NA,15,NA,28,NA

I examined the potential for this phenomenon in two fishes, a wrasse and its grouper predator, at a Caribbean island where the near-shore oceanographic regime produces a temporally consistent spatial pattern of fish recruitment. I found that recruitment and adult abundance of groupers were spatially correlated with recruitment of wrasse prey. Furthermore, the local abundance of predators strongly affected the nature of density-dependent prey mortality. At sites with few predators, wrasse mortality was inversely density-dependent, while mortality was positively density-dependent at sites with higher predator densities. This phenomenon could be important to the dynamics of any metacommunity in which physical forces produce correlated dispersal. ¬© 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Article","Scopus",0.697869491478818,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,87,NA

We observed a pattern of genetic patchiness among arrival waves, namely a highly significant genetic differentiation without a temporal grouping of samples. Although natural selection and gene flow could also play a role, we suggest that the pattern observed results from the high variance in reproductive success in each spawning season. A low effective population size might have contributed to the current decline in the abundance of European eel. A precautionary approach to fisheries should be implemented in order to preserve maximal genetic potential to cope with changing anthropogenic and environment pressures. ¬© 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.","Article","Scopus",0.530422972209372,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,386,0

The species often occurs inshore at steeply shelving coastal and insular locations, and has now been identified by divers at eight widely separated shallow water sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, most O. ferox were caught by trawl on the continental slope, where its bathic range was extended to at least 880 m. Large specimens (>200 cm TL) were found across the whole depth range, but almost all juveniles were caught between 200 and 600 m. The largest recorded male was 344 cm TL, and female 450 cm TL. The few biological data suggest that size at maturity for males is around 200-250 cm TL, and for females 300-350 cm. No pregnant females were recorded but size at birth is probably about 100 cm TL. Nowhere has the species been found in large numbers. Survey and commercial catch data from south-east Australian trawl grounds suggest that numbers of O. ferox there have declined since the advent of deepwater commercial trawling in the 1970s. In areas of steep untrawlable terrain, increased gill-netting and longlining are likely to impact on local populations, with mature individuals being particularly vulnerable. Although O. ferox is not specifically targeted by commercial fishing activities, its likely very low fecundity make it susceptible to local extirpation, even at seemingly small capture rates. This species is protected off New South Wales and is considered "" vulnerable"" globally, by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Article","Scopus",0.752444771704538,"1",NA,NA,10,NA,15,NA

We advocate the use of a Multivariate Oceanic and Climatic index (MOCI), derived from 'synthetic' and independent variables from a linear combination of the total initial variables objectively obtained from Principal Component Analysis. We test the efficacy of the index using long-term data from marine animal populations. The study area is the southern half of the Bay of Biscay (43¬∞-47¬∞N; western Europe). Between 1974 and 2000 we monitored cetaceans and seabirds along 131000 standardized line transects from ships. Fish abundance was derived from commercial fishery landings. We used 44 initial variables describing the oceanic and atmospheric conditions and characterizing the four annual seasons in the Bay of Biscay. The first principal component of our MOCI is called the South Biscay Climate (SBC) index. The winter NAO index was correlated to this SBC index. Inter-annual fluctuations for most seabird, cetacean and fish populations were significant. Boreal species (e.g. gadiformes fish species, European storm petrel and Razorbill...) with affinities to cold temperate waters declined significantly over time while two (Puffin and Killer Whale) totally disappeared from the area during the study period. Meridional species with affinities to hotter waters increased in population size. Those medium-term demographic trends may reveal a regime shift for this part of the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the specific observed trends were highly correlated to the SBC index and not to the NAO. Between 40% and 60% of temporal variations in species abundance were explained by the multivariate SBC index suggesting that the whole marine ecosystem is strongly affected by a limited number of physical parameters revealed by the multivariate SBC index. Aside the statistical error of the field measurements, the remaining variation unexplained by the physical characteristics of the environment correspond to the impact of anthropogenic activities such overfishing and oil-spills. ¬© 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.696468969733132,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,200,NA

The 36-station, zig-zag survey along the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR; Iceland to the Azores) covered the full depth range (0 to >3000 m), from the surface to near the bottom, using a combination of gear types to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the pelagic fauna. Abundance per volume of deep-pelagic fishes was highest in the epipelagic zone and within the benthic boundary layer (BBL; 0-200 m above the seafloor). Minimum fish abundance occurred at depths below 2300 m but above the BBL. Biomass per volume of deep-pelagic fishes over the MAR reached a maximum within the BBL, revealing a previously unknown topographic association of a bathypelagic fish assemblage with a mid-ocean ridge system. With the exception of the BBL, biomass per volume reached a water column maximum in the bathypelagic zone between 1500 and 2300 m. This stands in stark contrast to the general ""open-ocean"" paradigm that biomass decreases exponentially from the surface downwards. As much of the summit of the MAR extends into this depth layer, a likely explanation for this mid-water maximum is ridge association. Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that the dominant component of deep-pelagic fish biomass over the northern MAR was a wide-ranging bathypelagic assemblage that was remarkably consistent along the length of the ridge from Iceland to the Azores. Integrating these results with those of previous studies in oceanic ecosystems, there appears to be adequate evidence to conclude that special hydrodynamic and biotic features of mid-ocean ridge systems cause changes in the ecological structure of deep-pelagic fish assemblages relative to those at the same depths over abyssal plains. Lacking terrigenous input of allochthonous organic carbon, increased demersal fish diversity and biomass over the MAR relative to the abyssal plains may be maintained by increased bathypelagic food resources. The aggregation of bathypelagic fishes with MAR topographic features was primarily a large adult phenomenon. Considering the immense areal extent of mid-ocean ridge systems globally, this strategy may have significant trophic transfer and reproductive benefits for deep-pelagic fish populations. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This suite shows high interannual fluctuation in recruitment success in the SCB, with no known cause. One hypothesis gaining mention in management literature is the idea that recruitment booms in the SCB originate from larvae swept poleward from Mexico during El Ni√±o flow-reversal events. If true, SCB stocks may be reliant on Mexican sources. We used 3 diverse sources of data to investigate the likelihood of El Ni√±o-driven recruitment success and connectivity for S. pulcher and P. clathratus. Time series of larval abundance revealed that neither species shows synchrony with El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles that would suggest influx of Mexican larvae during El Ni√±o flow reversals. P. clathratus age structure data show that recruitment strength is unrelated to ENSO cycles but correlates to spring sea surface temperature in the SCB, indicating that local environmental factors drive interannual variation in local production. Genetic analyses of 14 populations of P. clathratus with 7 microsatellite loci revealed distinct patterns of genetic structure in the SCB and Baja California that reflect localized connectivity patterns and contradict patterns that would be expected if dispersal primarily occurred during El Ni√±o flow reversals. While these results support the importance of protecting local sources in the SCB, continued study of dispersal and recruitment at large scales will help characterize the causes of interannual variation and the exact scale of cross-border connectivity. ¬© Inter-Research 2007.","Article","Scopus",0.521835759777824,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,53,NA

However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels. ¬©2008 Nature Publishing Group.","Article","Scopus",0.73524031294097,"?",NA,"larval record",5,NA,1,NA

The SSI area is surveyed each austral summer by the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program, and the acoustic data are used to examine trends in krill biomass and to assess the potential impact of fishing to the reproductive success of land-based predators (seals and penguins). The time-series of recomputed biomass densities varies greatly from that computed using an empirical log-linear TS-model and fixed-ranges of differences in volume-backscattering strengths (ŒîSv), conventionally used to identify krill acoustically. The new acoustic estimates of biomass are significantly correlated with both proportional recruitment and krill abundance estimated from zooplankton samples. Two distinct peaks in biomass (1996 and 2003) are in accord with recruitment events shown by net-based krill time-series. The foundation for the new TS-model and the associated krill-discrimination algorithm, coupled with the agreement between acoustic- and net-survey results, provides strong support for the use of the new analytical technique. Variable biases in the re-estimated krill biomass have been greatly reduced. However, survey variability increased as a result of the increased rejection of acoustic backscatter previously attributed to krill. Management of Southern Ocean krill stocks based on a precautionary approach may therefore result in decreased allocations of krill, given its dependence on the variability of survey estimates. ¬© 2008 US Government and the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Marine Fisheries Service/Southwest Fisheries Science Center.","Article","Scopus",0.5584647090188,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,320,NA

Stations along the middle and outer shelf regions to the north and west, were characterised by low overall abundance. There was some evidence that groupings of stations to the north of the island originated in different water masses on either side of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, the major frontal system in the deep ocean close to South Georgia. However, transect lines during 1926/1927 did not extend far enough offshore to sample this frontal region adequately. Interannual variability of zooplankton abundance was assessed from stations which were sampled repeatedly during seven recent British Antarctic Survey cruises (1995-2005) to the region and following taxonomic harmonization and numerical standardization (ind. m-3), a subset of 45 taxonomic categories of zooplankton (species and higher taxa) from 1926/1927, were compared with similar data obtained during the BAS cruises using a linear model. Initially comparisons were restricted to BAS stations that lay within 40 km of Discovery stations although a comparison was also made using all available data. Despite low abundance values in 1926/1927, in neither comparison did Discovery data differ significantly from BAS data. Calculation of the percentage similarity index across cruises did not reveal any systematic differences in species composition between 1926 and 1927 and the present. In the light of ocean warming trends, the existence of more subtle changes in species composition is not ruled out, but an absence of finely resolved time-series data make this impossible to determine. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Relationships documented between cephalopod stock dynamics and environmental conditions are of two main types: those concerning the geographic distribution of abundance, for which the mechanism is often unknown, and those relating to biological processes such as egg survival, growth, recruitment and migration, where mechanisms are sometimes known and in a very few cases demonstrated by experimental evidence. Cephalopods seem to respond to environmental variation both 'actively' (e.g. migrating to areas with more favoured environmental conditions for feeding or spawning) and 'passively' (growth and survival vary according to conditions experienced, passive migration with prevailing currents). Environmental effects on early life stages can affect life history characteristics (growth and maturation rates) as well as distribution and abundance. Both large-scale atmospheric and oceanic processes and local environmental variation appear to play important roles in species-environment interactions. While oceanographic conditions are of particular significance for mobile pelagic species such as the ommastrephid squids, the less widely ranging demersal and benthic species may be more dependent on other physical habitat characteristics (e.g. substrate and bathymetry). Coastal species may be impacted by variations in water quality and salinity (related to rainfall and river flow). Gaps in current knowledge and future research priorities are discussed. Key research goals include linking distribution and abundance to environmental effects on biological processes, and using such knowledge to provide environmental indicators and to underpin fishery management. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.430969757778955,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,92,NA

Before 2004, snake pipefish were mainly found in coastal areas and have been reported only occasionally in oceanic waters. The oceanic form lives free in the water column while the coastal form is found among sea weeds or in sea grass beds. Abundance indices (numbers per hour fishing) from inshore surveys have remained at the same level, while those from offshore surveys show a very strong increase since 2004. The length distributions differ significantly between surveys, with coastal snake pipefishes being larger. Although the outward appearance of the coastal pipefishes seems different from the pelagic specimens, no differences were found when comparing taxonomic features. Apart from appearance the habitat is different for the two types of snake pipefish. The oceanic specimens of snake pipefish are much leaner than the coastal specimens. Stomach contents of the oceanic snake pipefishes revealed remains of relatively small calanoids (mean length 2.4¬†mm). The calanoid population has recently changed and is nowadays dominated by the smaller Calanus helgolandicus. Here we put forward the hypothesis that the sudden appearance of the snake pipefish in the deeper waters is a result of the change in the average lengths of calanoids which in turn is caused by changes in the hydroclimatic environment. The mass occurrence of the snake pipefish is affecting the ecosystem. Seabirds are feeding their chicks with them and they are also found in stomachs of fish and sea mammals. ¬© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although not targeted, night sharks make up a segment of the shark bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery. Historically, night sharks comprised a significant proportion of the artisanal Cuban shark fishery but today they are rarely caught. Although information from some fisheries has shown a decline in catches of night sharks, it is unclear whether this decline is due to changes infishing tactics, market, or species identification. Despite the uncertainty in the decline, the night shark is currently listed as a species of concern due to alleged declines in abundance resulting from fishing effort, i.e. overutilization. To assess their relevance to the species of concern list, we collated available information on the night shark to provide an analysis of its status. Night shark landings were likely both over- and under-reported and thus probably did not reflect all commercial and recreational catches, and overall they have limited relevance to the current status of the species. Average size information has not changed considerably since the 1980's based on information from the pelagic long-line fishery when corrected for gear bias. Analysis of biological information indicates night sharks have intrinsic rates of increase (r) about 10% yr-1 and have moderate rebound potential and an intermediate generation time compared to other sharks. An analysis of trends in relative abundance from four data sources gave conflicting results, with one series in decline, two series increasing, and one series relatively flat. Based on the analysis of all currently available information, we believe the night shark does not qualify as a species of concern but should be retained on the prohibited species list as a precautionary approach to management until a more comprehensive stock assessment can be conducted.","Article","Scopus",0.723069275789559,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,204,NA

A negative correlation between the abundance of pelagic fishes (e.g. jack mackerel) in the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) region and the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) region was attributed to the climatic modulation of larval transport and recruitment, which depends on the winter monsoon-induced drift, current systems, and spawning season and site. The changes in abundance and alternation of dominant fish populations in the two regions in the 1930s, 1970s, and late 1980s mirrored changes in the climate indices (ALPI, AOI and MOI). Oscillations in the decadal climate shifts between the two regions led to zonal differences in larval transport and recruitment, and hence differences in the abundance of the pelagic fish populations. During deep Aleutian Lows, as in the 1980s, larval transport from the East China Sea to the KOC region increases in association with the strong winter Asian monsoon, cool regime and increased volume transport of the Kuroshio Current systems, whereas during a weak Aleutian Low (as in the 1990s), larval transport to the TWC region increased in association with a weak winter Asian monsoon, a warm regime, and increased volume transport of the Tsushima current system. We postulate that the increased chub mackerel abundance in the TWC region and the decreased abundance in the KOC region in the 1990s are partly attributed to changes in recruitment and availability to the fishing fleets under the warm regime in the spawning and nursery grounds in the East China Sea in association with the quasi-steady state of mild winter monsoon in the 1990s. The fluctuations in chub mackerel and jack mackerel abundance are under the environment-dependant growth form, although the tropicalization was identified in the TWC region. The density-dependant growth form was found in Japanese sardine populations, but no tropicalization by fishing was identified in the long (10-15 year) periods of abundance despite their short (3-4 year) generation time, suggesting that the environment-dependant growth form drove the changes in abundance. Year-to-year and decadal scale variations in abundance and population structure of the Pacific saury responded to climate regime shifts (1976/1977, 1988/1989), suggesting that the fish is a key bio-indicators for changes in the ecosystem.","Article","Scopus",0.817513548822187,"1","1",NA,5,10,2,NA

The results of a two-step generalized additive model (GAM) suggested that suitable seabed substrate and temperature best explain sandeel distribution (presence/absence) and that sandeel abundance (given presence) was best described by a model that included bottom temperature, difference between surface and bottom temperature and surface salinity. The current study suggests that suitable seabed substrate explains sandeel distribution in the water column. Bottom temperature and surface salinity also played an important role in explaining distribution and abundance, and we speculate that sandeels favour hydrographically dynamic areas. Contrary to our hypothesis sandeels were not strongly associated with areas of high zooplankton density. We speculate that in early spring on the western Dogger Bank plankton is still patchily distributed and that sandeels only emerge from the seabed when feeding conditions near their night-time burrowing habitat are optimal. The results also suggested that when abundance is over a threshold level, the number of sandeel schools increased rather than the schools becoming bigger. This relationship between patchiness and abundance has implications for mortality rates and hence fisheries management.

Cod, once an abundant fish species that had been commercially exploited for many decades, declined precipitously during the mid-1980s onwards. This decline was attributed to climatic changes that affected the entire food chain from zooplankton to fish, sea birds and marine mammals. A monitoring programme was introduced, sampling cod by otter trawling using research vessels. The fish, after capture, were frozen at - 20¬∞C, subsequently thawed and the digestive tract removed and examined for the parasite in 2006. Data from samples taken in 1976, 1980-81, 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2003 were compared statistically with those collected in 2006. The results indicate a decline in the prevalence and mean abundance of E. gadi in 1986 with a minimum in 2000 but increasing gradually in 2003 and 2006. These changes were coincident initially with a decline of oceanic temperature and the entire food web, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), a preferred prey of cod and primary source of E. gadi. The increase in prevalence and mean abundance of the parasite in 2006 were associated with an increase of oceanic temperature and the return of small schools of capelin to offshore areas. Cod older than 4 years harboured a greater abundance of E. gadi than younger fish, while no difference was observed between the sexes. The results suggest that the abundance of E. gadi can be useful as a bioindicator of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic. ¬© 2008 Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus",0.75483599205584,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,90,NA

They were the descendants of people with a long maritime tradition, who took their first steps into the Oceanic world east of New Guinea some 35,000 years ago. By the time these people had settled the far flung islands of the Pacific and reached New Zealand they possessed advanced fishing technology and deep knowledge of fish habits and ecology. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the archaeozoology of fishing in prehistoric New Zealand. It begins with preliminary sections describing the tropical Pacific background to New Zealand archaeology, and the methodologies which are used in New Zealand relating to fishing and the analysis of fish remains. This is followed by a description of the New Zealand fishery, and the species which were caught by prehistoric MƒÅori. A database in the Museum of New Zealand contains information on fish remains from 126 archaeological sites covering all regions and periods in New Zealand (total MNI=40,400). Although about 750 species are present in New Zealand waters, only about 35 occur in prehistoric catches, and of these only 6 occur with abundances over 7%. These are: barra-couta, Thyrsites atun (Gempylidae); blue cod, Parapercis colias (Mugiloididae); snapper, Pagrus auratus (Sparidae); wrasses (Labridae); red cod, Pseudophycis bachus (Moridae); and greenbone, Odax pullus (Odacidae). Together these make up 85% of all fishes caught in prehistoric times. The technology and material culture associated with these prehistoric catches are described, tracing the knowledge of cordage and knots, netting and fish hooks, canoe design, fish preservation and cooking methods. Special attention is given to the functional attributes of the rotating hook, so common throughout Oceania. The economic basis of prehistoric MƒÅori society varied markedly in New Zealand from horticultural people in the north to hunter-gatherers in the south. Regionalism in fish catches is examined, and although a biogeographical base to this can be identified, there is also a strong cultural expression over the top of it. A large section of the paper is concerned with changes in fish catches over archaeological time. Two aspects are considered -changes in relative abundance of fish types over time, and changes in size-frequency diagrams over time. It is found that New Zealand-wide trends have very little meaning, but that changes relating to the activities of essentially individual prehistoric communities show significant trends. These changes are presented after first considering climate change over the last 1,000 years and, in particular, the way that this affected surface sea water temperatures. There is increasing evidence that the so-called Little Ice Age was important in New Zealand, resulting in dramatic changes in fish recruitment rates, and in one case the extinction of a spawning population. This was the genetically distinctive snapper population of Tasman Bay in the northern South Island. This is reflected in the absence of snapper in prehistoric catches in this area during the period of the Little Ice Age. Of special interest is the finding that sustained predation in many parts of New Zealand resulted in increasing fish size over archaeological time. This is attributed to the widespread Polynesian custom of taking all fish, no matter how small, putting pressure on juveniles to increase their growth rate. This conclusion is supported by experimental research on preferential targeting of fish of different sizes, resulting in rapid evolution through genetic selection. The role of fish in early New Zealand diet is then considered, bearing in mind fundamental aspects of human nutritional needs. It is shown that protein was effectively super-abundant in prehistoric New Zealand, largely because of the wealth of marine foods available, and that the more important consideration was access to fat and/or carbohydrate foods. Isotope research on human bone collagen shows that food deriving from the marine environment varied from about 11% for inland people to 61% for some coastal peoples. The final part of the paper is concerned with modelling human predation and its effect on marine environments. It is suggested that archaeologists need to be a great deal more careful in this field in future and work from the bottom up, not the top down. In particular, optimal foraging theory is criticised as naive and not well founded in evidence in the case of marine food gathering. The widespread custom of slash and burn and fallow' has a counterpart in marine harvesting whereby people take all specimens down to very small size, depleting an area of its biomass, and then move away to a new settlement, leaving the former area to recover over long periods. There is considerable evidence for such a pattern of exploitation of the marine environment. This is a conservation strategy not often considered by archaeologists or in modern fisheries management. Prehistoric Maori fishermen in New Zealand were clearly extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of the New Zealand fishery. The abundance of fish available meant that all necessary food could be obtained in shallow waters, more than 80% being caught less than 100 metres from the shore.","Article","Scopus",0.678788889493742,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,376,NA

In the Humboldt current ecosystem, which now hosts huge populations of pelagic fishes (mainly anchovy and sardine), fish scale abundance in the sedimentary record may be useful indicators of environmental change. Here we assess such a proxy record in a 42 cm-long sedimentary core collected from 80 m in Mejillones Bay (23¬∞S, northern Chile). We also analyse fish remains in surface sediment sampled along a bathymetric transect (from 10 to 110 m water depth) in the same bay. In the core-top record, the fluctuations of sardine and anchovy scale deposition rates (SDR) agreed with those of industrial catches for these two species in northern Chile, tending to validate the SDR as a proxy of local fish biomass when bottom anoxic conditions prevail. However, apparent SDR for records prior to 1820 have probably been influenced by dissolution processes linked to the oxygenation of the bottom environment of Mejillones Bay, as suggested by other proxy records. After 1820, the fluctuations in the relative abundance of sardine and anchovy scales point to alternating warm and cold conditions during about 30 years and then a progressively cooler period. Since ca. 1870, marked fluctuations of SDR of both species are observed, probably as a consequence of the onset of a different oceanographic regime characterized by intensified upwelling, stronger subsurface oxygen deficiency, higher primary productivity, and enhanced ""ENSO-like"" interdecadal variability. While anchovy SDR fluctuated in periods of 25-40 years, only two peak periods of sardine SDR occurred (late 19th century and late 20th century), suggesting that sardine abundance depends on other ocean-climatic factors. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The interdecadal variability is characterized by periods of high and low abundance, termed ""pseudo-cycles"", because of their irregular periodicity. Fisheries targeting small pelagic fish suffer from overall overcapitalization, like many other fisheries, but also from an additional overcapitalization problem: a phase displacement between rapid fish population decreases and a slower disinvestment which follows. This lag produces economic hardship. Here we document the fish:fishery relationship for the Peruvian anchoveta. Anchoveta pseudo-cycles of 20 to >100 years are observed, with the present stock abundance most likely located near upper part of the cycle. Fleet overcapacity expressed as the proportion of unused present capacity is estimated at 72% and processing overcapacity at 89%. A simple bio-economic model demonstrates the risks associated with the pseudo-periodicity in fish stock abundance in conjunction with fishery investment, open access, and overcapacity: a timing bomb for the fishing sector. The lag between disinvestment and decrease in fish abundance is quantified. A reduction of the fishing and processing capacity and measures to decrease the investment lag are recommended to limit the social, economical and political tensions that will result from the expected decrease in stock abundance. Finally, some management options to reduce these risks are discussed. ¬© 2008.","Article","Scopus",0.746877011855323,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,102,NA

Here, we investigate seasonal and inter-annual patterns in abundance and distribution of jellyfish in the North Atlantic Ocean to determine if there have been any system-wide changes over the period 1946-2005, by analysing records of the presence of coelenterates from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. Peaks in jellyfish abundance are strongly seasonal in both oceanic and shelf areas: oceanic populations have a mid-year peak that is more closely related to peaks in phyto- and zooplankton, whilst the later peak of shelf populations mirrors changes in SST and reflects processes of advection and aggregation. There have been large amplitude cycles in the abundance of oceanic and shelf jellyfish (although not synchronous) over the last 60 years, with a pronounced synchronous increase in abundance in both areas over the last 10 years. Inter-annual variations in jellyfish abundance in oceanic areas are related to zooplankton abundance and temperature changes, but not to the North Atlantic Oscillation or to a chlorophyll index. The long-term inter-annual abundance of jellyfish on the shelf could not be explained by any environmental variables investigated. As multi-decadal cycles and more recent increase in jellyfish were obvious in both oceanic and shelf areas, we conclude that these are likely to reflect an underlying climatic signal (and bottom-up control) rather than any change in fishing pressure (top-down control). Our results also highlight the role of the CPR data in investigating long-term changes in jellyfish, and suggest that the cnidarians sampled by the CPR are more likely to be holoplanktic hydrozoans and not the much larger meroplanktic scyphozoans as has been suggested previously. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.769069230425729,"0",NA,NA,5,NA,9,NA

The effect of meadow size was tested in 9 shallow unprotected meadows of Posidonia oceanica encompassing a wide range of areas. The effect of fishing protection was examined by comparing 9 unprotected meadows (controls) with 3 marine protected areas (MPAs) with at least 20 yr of protection that also varied in meadow size (large >3 ha, medium 1 ha < x < 2 ha and small <1 ha). At each site, we quantified the abundance, size distribution and grazing pressure of the 2 most important herbivores, the fish Sarpa salpa and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. A strong negative relationship between meadow size and both the abundance and grazing rates of S. salpa was evident in the unprotected meadows, but no effects were detected on either the abundance or grazing rates of P. lividus. Results also showed that populations of S. salpa (mainly large individuals) benefit from fishing protection and tended to concentrate in MPAs (with the exception of Port-Cros), resulting in enhanced grazing pressure. In P. lividus abundances or size distributions did not present any significant difference between protected and unprotected areas, although most MPAs presented low sea urchin densities. While MPAs are important to preserve seagrass ecosystems, results from this study indicate that it is crucial to account for the size of these habitats, particularly when functional aspects of seagrass habitats are so strongly altered by size. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.","Article","Scopus",0.685834655349864,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,111,NA

This has mostly been attributed to direct impacts of human activities such as overfishing or habitat loss and degradation, whilst the potential influence of changes in oceanic conditions has received less attention. Eel are characterized by a complex and still enigmatic life cycle that includes a trans-oceanic spawning and larval migration. The apparent synchrony in the decline of eel populations worldwide suggests that the oceanic mechanisms involved are similar for all populations. We analyse the relationships between oceanic conditions in eel spawning areas and glass eel recruitment success of the 3 most commercially important species of the genus Anguilla: A. anguilla, A. rostrata, and A. japonica. We provide evidence that the survival of eel larvae is strongly correlated with food availability during their early life stages. Over the last 4 decades, changes in the marine production related to global warming may have led to the decline of European, American and Japanese eel populations. In the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the shifts in the temperature regime detected in the late 1970s were followed by shifts in the recruitment regime of glass eel for the 3 species. The decrease in primary production through climate-driven processes has therefore affected the recruitment of eel populations. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.","Article","Scopus",0.678270252223545,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,241,0

We had two hypotheses, that the species had a nonrandom distribution, related to substrate and body size, and that relative abundance outside the national park would be lower than within, possibly due to fishery pressure. We found a patchy distribution over all, with octopuses almost confined to substrates with a large proportion of hard surfaces. There were seasonal and depth effects on distribution of the very small octopuses found mainly in shallow water (intertidal to 5 m depth) during the dry season.

Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. ¬© 2009 British Ecological Society.","Review","Scopus",0.534185877448544,"1",NA,NA,10,NA,21,NA

In acoustic evaluations conducted along the Moroccan coast since 1995, the absence of juveniles in 1996 and 1998 and the collapse of the sardine stock between 1996 and 1997 represent the main events until 2002. Sardines are known to be microphageous planktivores and thus are sensitive to environmental variability. A biogeochemical model coupled to a hydrodynamic model (ROMS) was run over the Canary Current System (1991-2002) to investigate the environmental factors that could have played a role in the variability of the sardine spawning. A grid refinement (1-12¬∞) centred on the Saharan Bank (SB) region was built to study the main spawning ground of sardines off northwest Africa. The volume of the potential spawning habitat (PSH) of sardines was defined as a function of depth, temperature and salinity, which are included in the ranges 0-200 m, 15-21¬∞C and 35.8-36.8, respectively. Our modelling frame was able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of temperature, phytoplankton concentration and PSH over the SB. It also captured the warming associated with the negative index of the North Atlantic Oscillation of 1995-1997 and allowed a description of the inter-annual variability of the PSH. Our experiment shows that the volume of PSH was much reduced in 1996 compared to the other years. The results suggest that the delay between high abundance of plankton and favourable spawning conditions is a good proxy for determining the recruitment failure of sardine in this oceanic region.","Article","Scopus",0.535999097896407,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,319,NA

For estimation of their aggregations in the bottom layer, the traditional method was used with the help of the modified egg net (0.2 m2 opening area, 564 Œºm mesh size). The net is used for collecting euphausiids in the autumn-winter period when their activity is reduced, which results in high-catch efficiency. The findings confirmed the major formation patterns of the euphausiids species composition associated with climate change in the Arctic basin. As before, in the warm years, one can see a clear-cut differentiation of space distribution of the dominant euphausiids Thysanoessa genus with localization of the more thermophilic Thysanoessa inermis in the north-west Barents Sea and Thysanoessa raschii in the east. The major euphausiids aggregations are formed of these species. In 2004, the first data of euphausiids distribution in the northern Barents Sea (77-79¬∞N) were obtained, and demonstrated extremely high concentrations of T. inermis in this area, with the biomass as high as 1.7-2.4 g m-2 in terms of dry weight. These data have improved our knowledge of the distribution and euphausiids abundance during periods of elevated sea-water temperatures in the Barents Sea. The oceanic Atlantic species were found to increase in abundance due to elevated advection to the Barents Sea during the study period. Thus, after nearly a 30-year-long absence of the moderate subtropical Nematoscelis megalops in the Barents Sea, they were found again in 2003-2005. However in comparison with 1960, the north-east border of its distribution considerably shifted to 73¬∞50‚Ä≤N 50¬∞22‚Ä≤E. The portion of Meganyctiphanes norvegica also varied considerably-from 10% to 20% of the total euphausiids population in the warm 1950s-1960s almost to complete disappearing in 1970-1990s. The peak of this species' occurrence (18-26%) took place in the beginning of warm period (1999-2000) after a succession of cold years. The subsequent reduction of the relative abundance of M. norvegica to 7% might have been mostly caused by fish predation during a period of low population densities of capelin. This high predation pressure may therefore have been mediated both by other pelagic fishes (i.e. herring, blue whiting, polar cod) but also by demersal fishes such as cod and haddock. Similar sharp fluctuations in the capelin stock (the major consumer of euphausiids) created marked perturbations in the food web in the Barents Sea in the middle 1980s and the early 1990s. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The densities of recruits (juveniles ‚â§5 cm total length) were higher overall on windward versus leeward sectors of carbonate rock-rubble back reefs at both atolls, and the pattern was stronger for smaller (likely younger, more recently settled) recruits of four of the five most abundant species and the remainder pooled as an ""Other"" taxon. The windward-leeward disparity was four-fold greater at Pearl Hermes (the atoll with a three-fold longer perimeter) than at Kure. Resident predator biomass also was correlated with recruit densities, but habitat (benthic substratum) effects were generally weak. The distribution and abundance of recruits and juveniles of the primarily endemic reef fishes on shallow back reefs at these atolls appear partly influenced by relative rates of water flow over windward vs. leeward sectors of barrier reef and by the size, shape, and orientation of habitat parcels that filter out postlarval fishes with relatively weak swimming capabilities like labroids. Whole-reef geomorphology as well as fine-scale habitat heterogeneity and rugosity should be considered among the suite of many factors used to interpret observed spatial patterns of post-settlement juvenile fish distribution at atolls and perhaps some other tropical reefs. ¬© The Author(s) 2009.","Article","Scopus",0.668132017122815,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,75,NA

Important geographical factors influencing management include the physical isolation of the country, small human population, no human habitation in the interior, low energy demands, and lack of many alternative uses of land around rivers. Biological and ecological factors include small size of the salmon stocks, high variations in annual abundance, long residency of adult salmon in rivers before spawning, and maintenance of good flesh quality of prespawners. Social and political factors include the prohibition of mixed-stock oceanic fisheries, emphasis on recreational fishing, relative cultural and linguistic homogeneity, and administration of salmon by the Ministry of Agriculture as a freshwater fish. The management consists of key national restrictions on harvest designed to provide an ecologically sound framework for stock-specific management, even in the absence of detailed data about stocks. Managers are generalists, and management tends to be parsimonious; i.e., it occurs at the lowest organizational level necessary to achieve goals. The major challenge facing managers is how to protect wild stocks of salmon amid rapidly expanding private cage-rearing and ranching operations. ¬© 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus",0.566376202903432,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,406,NA

In turn, these depend on the structure of the vertical velocity field. In coastal areas and in oceanic regions characterized by the presence of strong submarine topographic features, the variable bottom topography induces significant effects on vertical velocities and upwelling/downwelling patterns. As a consequence, large plankton and fish abundances are frequently observed above seamounts, canyons and steep continental shelves. In this work, the dynamics of an NPZ (nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton) system is numerically studied by coupling the ecosystem model with a quasi two-dimensional (2D) fluid model with topography. At variance with classical 2D approaches, this formulation allows for an explicit expression of the vertical motions produced when fluid columns are squeezed and stretched as they experience changes of depth. Thus, input or output of nutrients at the surface are associated with fluid motion over the bottom topography. We examine the dynamics of a cyclonic vortex over two basic topographies: a steep escarpment and a submarine mountain. We show that plankton abundance over the escarpment is modulated by the passing of topographic Rossby waves, generated by the vortex-topography interaction. In such configuration, advection effects driven by the flow over the escarpment are of limited relevance for the dynamics of biological fields. By contrast, we find that the flow resulting from the interaction of a vortex with a seamount is sufficiently strong and persistent to allow for a remarkable increase of nutrients, and a corresponding enhancement of phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations. Over the seamount, advection effects associated with trapped flow perturbations around the summit play an essential role. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Seafloor drilling was carried out at two hydrothermal fields, on- and off-ridge of the back-arc spreading centre of the SMT. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries for bacterial and archaeal communities were constructed from the fluid samples collected from the boreholes. Phylotypes related to Thiomicrospira in the Gammaproteobacteria (putative sulfide-oxidizers) and Mariprofundus in the Zetaproteobacteria (putative iron-oxidizers) were recovered from the fluid samples. A number of unique archaeal phylotypes were also recovered. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated the presence of active bacterial and archaeal populations in the fluids. The Zetaproteobacteria accounted for up to 32% of the total prokaryotic cell number as shown by FISH analysis using a specific probe designed in this study. Our results lead to the hypothesis that the Zetaproteobacteria play a role in iron oxidation within the oceanic crust. ¬© 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.337221244736344,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,143,NA

This CTZ shows the singularity that the Canary Archipelago interrupts the main flow of the Canary Current and Trade Winds, introducing large mesoscale variability, in the form of island warm wakes and cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies downstream of the islands. Besides, upwelling filaments stretch towards the archipelago from the African coastal upwelling, transporting phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish larvae. They also interact with eddies shed from the islands to exchange water properties and biogenic material. All these mesoscale features influence the composition, structure, abundance and distribution of the larval fish community (LFC) of the region. The Canary Current (CC) and eddies shed from the islands drag larvae of island neritic fish species into the oceanic region and contribute, along warm wakes, to the horizontal distribution of fish larvae. Upwelling and upwelling filaments transport larvae of African neritic species into the oceanic region. These larvae dominate the LFC and account for the relatively high average larval fish abundance found in the C-ACTZ during the summer upwelling season. Filaments originated in the region of Cape Juby-Cape Bojador are entrained around a quasi-permanent cyclonic eddy, trapped between Gran Canaria Island and the African coast, forming a system through which most of the African neritic larvae may return to the African shelf. However, some larvae reach the eastern islands of the Canary archipelago and they may be spread all over the neritic region of the archipelago by eddies shed from the islands. Also in summer, the distribution of the LFC of the C-ACTZ is vertically stratified and fish larvae seem to carry out little or not diel vertical migration. Overall, this study highlights the strong relationship between mesoscale oceanographic processes and the LFC in the C-ACTZ. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Managers, tasked with developing harvest strategies on these runs, may have preseason estimates of total run size but little information on run timing. Without both it is difficult to assess a run's status in real time. Consequently, to avoid overharvest, managers tend to control the timing of harvest. However, this strategy may inadvertently affect the component stocks disproportionately and therefore the run's diversity. Thus, accurate estimates of run timing are needed to improve management. We developed a model that includes genetic and environmental factors to predict the mean run timing of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, Oregon, USA. The model predicted mean run timing (P &lt; 0.00001, r2 = 0.78) by characterizing genetic run timing components from the arrival timing of precocious males returning one year prior to the remainder of the adults and environmental influences of oceanic and riverine flows that impede or advance the run timing. Variations in the relative abundances of the populations in the run explain 62% of the interannual variation in mean run timing while the oceanic and riverine factors combined account for 15.5%. We suggest that when genetic run timing characteristics are preserved in species with multiple maturation strategies the information can be used to improve run time predictions and maintain genetic diversity of harvested species ¬© 2009 by the Ecological society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.499912222856374,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,134,NA

Recent observations indicate that the CanC region as a whole has been experiencing a progressive warming and a decrease in productivity over the last decades. This overall trend is however not directly reflected in the fisheries of the region. Here we update recent results and previous reviews on the CanC, covering aspects from the physical environment to fish populations and fisheries on a range of time scales. We approach these topics, when possible, through a comparative exploration of the biogeographical characteristics of different sub-regions comprising this ecosystem. This review shows that variability in coastline configuration, shelf width, coastal upwelling, nutrient fertilization, productivity, or retentive vs. dispersive physical mechanisms, among other factors, may help explain sub-regional differences in fish distributions and abundances in the CanC. Nevertheless, the lack of systematic information on the regional variability of physical and biological processes hampers an integrated understanding of the relative contribution of natural vs. human-induced variability in the populations of at least small-pelagic fishes and their associated fisheries. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Visual confirmation of fishing vessels by nocturnal aerial surveys indicated that lights detected by satellites are reliable indicators of fishing effort. Overall, fishing activity was concentrated off the following Channel Islands: Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Catalina. Fishing activity occurred at depths of 100 m or less. Landings, effort, and squid abundance (measured as landings per unit of effort, LPUE) markedly declined during the 1997-98 El Ni√±o; landings and LPUE increased afterwards. Within a fishing season, the location of fishing activity shifted from the northern shores of Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in October, the typical starting date for squid fishing in the Bight, to the southern shores by March, the typical end of the squid season.

We investigated the metazoan meiofaunal response to fish-farm impact in four regions of the Mediterranean Sea. Meiofaunal assemblages were investigated in two habitats (seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica and non-vegetated soft bottoms) comparing sites receiving faeces and uneaten food pellets from fish farms to control sites. We report here that, consistently across different regions, the meiofaunal abundance typically responded positively to fish-farm effluents. Biodeposition caused also significant changes in assemblage structure and the reduction in the richness of higher meiofaunal taxa, but the multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the effects were region- and habitat-specific. In non-vegetated systems, three of the four regions investigated displayed significant effects of the fish farms on richness of meiofaunal taxa. In vegetated habitats, meiofauna did not respond to biodeposition (except in one region), suggesting that seagrass meadows can mask the effects of fish-farm effluents on benthic biodiversity. We conclude that different indicators of fish-farm impact are needed in vegetated and non-vegetated benthic systems. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurements of isotopic nitrogen content in epiphytes and seagrass leaf tissues, epiphyte biomass, shoot size, herbivory pressure, shoot density and seagrass meadow cover, performed in this meadow (FA area) were compared with those obtained in an undisturbed control meadow (CA area) to evaluate: (1) the remote influence of waste and (2) the impact of such influence on seagrass condition. In addition, Œ¥15N measurements in particulate organic matter of natural and anthropogenic origin were used in a single-isotope mixing model to elucidate the relative contributions of these sources to the isotopic N signal measured in epiphytes and leaf tissues. Total tissue N content was similar between meadow areas, but Œ¥15N signatures were significantly higher in the FA area than in the CA area both in epiphytes and seagrass leaf tissues. Results from the mixing model, together with available information on local currents and previous studies, support the conclusion that the dispersion of farm wastes over large areas (spanning kilometres) are responsible for the elevated Œ¥15N signatures found in the FA meadow area. Despite this, no changes in meadow structure were detected and only some changes at the level of seagrass community (epiphytes abundances and herbivores activity) could be interpreted at the light of nutrient-induced effects in the FA area.

The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change. ¬© 2010 Inter-Research.","Article","Scopus",0.724651652932162,"0",NA,NA,15,NA,33,NA

In March 1992, we found the highest macrofauna abundance and the smallest sizes in the canyon, suggesting a positive effect of river discharges on suprabenthos recruitment. By contrast, macroplankton (decapods, fishes and euphausiids) did not show higher recruitment into canyons. After analyzing the diet of 23 decapod crustaceans, we found a significant segregation between guilds feeding on zooplankton and on benthos. Zooplankton (euphausiids and Pasiphaeidae) and infauna (polychaetes, Calocaris macandreae and ophiuoroids) were consistently the main prey exploited by decapod crustaceans around Berenguera Canyon. We also found some macrophyte (Posidonia oceanica) consumption, which was higher in periods of water column homogeneity (winter-spring and late autumn). Positive correlations between decapods' gut fullness (F) and decapod abundance indicate feeding aggregations, while positive correlations were also found between F and Llobregat River (situated ca. 18 km from Berenguera head) flow 1 to 2 months before sampling. Increases in F were delayed only 1 month when zooplankton feeders were analyzed alone, while benthos feeders did not show significant relationships with any environmental variables. That indicates that the response of megabenthic decapods feeding on benthos to environmental shifts is slower than that of zooplankton feeders. The importance of river flows in enhancing food supply of macro- and megabenthos dwelling close to submarine canyons was apparent, with a delay in the fauna response of 0-2 months after river flow peaks. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Due to their large size, they are key prey species for many vertebrates, and several species are subject to commercial fisheries. The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises-usually in summer-to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species.

Their diversity is high in marine waters. However, quantitative information about distribution patterns of flavobacterial clades is scarce. We analyzed the diversity and clade-specific abundances of individual Flavobacteria in different oceanic provinces in the North Atlantic Ocean. Samples were taken along the 30¬∞W meridian between the East Greenland current and the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Comparative sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene libraries revealed high diversity and significant spatial variability within the class Flavobacteria. Published and newly designed oligonucleotide probes were used to enumerate eleven flavobacterial clades by catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). We found that different provinces harbor distinct flavobacterial communities. Clade DE2 accounted for a substantial fraction of total Flavobacteria only in the Polar Biome (BPLR), whereas the VISION clades VIS1 and VIS4 significantly increased in the Arctic (ARCT) province. Members of the genus Polaribacter were the most abundant clade in all the water masses analyzed, with highest absolute numbers in BPLR and ARCT. We improved the CARD-FISH protocol to quantify the rare clades VIS2, VIS3, VIS5 and VIS6, which were present in abundances below 0.5%. They all showed pronounced regional distribution patterns. Microscopic analysis proved a specific enrichment of Flavobacteria in the phycosphere of nanophytoplankton of BPLR and ARCT.

Here we use visual and video surveys from 36 submersible dives to evaluate the role of canyons as abundance and diversity hotspots for megafauna in the Hawaiian Archipelago, an island chain embedded in an oligotrophic ocean. We surveyed megafauna in canyon and slope settings at depths of 350-1500 m along the margins of four islands: the low 'islands' of Nihoa and Maro Reef, and the high islands of Oahu and Moloka'i. Megafaunal communities in canyons differed significantly from those in nearby slope habitats at all depths. Highly mobile fishes and invertebrates were consistently more abundant in canyons than on nearby slopes at the same depth off all islands, suggesting that canyons may be important sources of larvae for surrounding habitats. In the few cases where megafaunal abundances were similar or higher on the slope, the differences were typically driven by higher slope abundance of sessile suspension feeders or animals with limited mobility, i.e. by organisms which are likely to have difficulty with high currents and sediment transport in canyons. Megafaunal species richness and diversity generally trended higher within canyons, especially for the highly mobile taxa. Canyons contained 41 megafaunal species never observed on the slope, and increased estimated regional species richness by 25-30 species, indicating that canyons enhanced beta and gamma (regional) biodiversity. An expected trend of greater enhancement of diversity and abundance in canyons on the margins of high versus low oceanic islands was not observed, although megafauna were generally more abundant in both canyon and slope habitats on the high islands (Oahu and Moloka'i). We conclude that submarine canyons on both low and high islands in the Hawaiian Archipelago may provide keystone structures, enhancing megafaunal abundance, providing source populations for the open slope, and enhancing local and regional species diversity. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Article","Scopus",0.576287168463607,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40,NA

In light of these new observations, we reappraise the occurrence and diversity records of hadal fishes that have been constructed from fragmentary and often misleading information derived from historical explorations and global data sets.

These observations confirm the hypothesis that phylogenetic factors restrict community composition to helminth species specific to marine turtles. There were significant community dissimilarities between turtles from different localities, the overall pattern being compatible with the hypothesis that parasite communities reflect the ontogenetic shift that juvenile loggerheads undergo from oceanic to neritic habitats. The smallest turtles at the putative oceanic, pelagic-feeding stage harboured only the 2 digenean species that were regionally the most frequent, i.e. Enodiotrema megachondrus and Calycodes anthos; the largest turtles at the putative neritic, bottom-feeding stage harboured 11 helminth taxa, including 3 nematode species that were rare or absent in turtles that fed partially on pelagic prey.

This has led to a focus in recent literature on the identification of ""hotspots"" important for migratory marine predators, i.e., regions where predators spend disproportionate amounts of time ostensibly due to high prey abundance; and determination of the environmental features characteristic of such areas. We investigated factors predicting foraging success in southern bluefin tuna (SBT; Thunnus maccoyii), by integrating telemetry-based feeding and movement data (n =19 fish, length to caudal fork [LCF] = 99 ¬±3 cm) with environmental data over the scale of their annual oceanic migrations during 1998-2000. We used widely available statistical modeling techniques, generalized linear models, and generalized linear mixed models, formulated to represent feeding as a Markov process. The results showed increased feeding and predictability of feeding occurs in the coastal waters of southern Australia, providing some evidence that this area represents a fixed foraging ""hotspot"" for juvenile tuna during the austral summer. However, in oceanic waters southern bluefin tuna did not fit the common model of migration, but rather showed a pattern of relatively high foraging success throughout their migratory range, especially during periods of continuous travel. Interestingly, foraging ""coldspots"" (prolonged low-feeding periods) as well as ""hotspots"" were apparent across individual tracks, predicted most strongly by warm ocean temperatures. These results provide a new perspective on the ecology of large-scale feeding migrations within the context of the heterogeneous ocean environment, where the continuous and opportunistic feeding of generalist predators may be more common, particularly in predatory large pelagic fishes, than is currently documented. ¬© 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.530303542232195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,183,NA

Paralarvae varied from 1260 to 7580 m, and their abundance decreased abruptly as they grew. Statolith increments were clearly visible without grinding in almost all material, allowing reliable estimation of age. Paralarvae are planktonic for at least 3 months.

A simulation-estimation (SE) approach was derived to test the performance of the method. If the data showed responses to harvest, the estimates of the most important figures, i.e. the initial abundance and the second recruitment pulse, were accurate, with relatively small bias.

Understanding the foraging ecology of these species in the Southern Ocean is important for monitoring and ecosystem conservation and management. Methodology/Principal Findings: Tracking data from sooty and short-tailed shearwaters from three regions of New Zealand and Australia were combined with at-sea observations of shearwaters in the Southern Ocean, physical oceanography, nearsurface copepod distributions, pelagic trawl data, and synoptic near-surface winds. Shearwaters from all three regions foraged in the Polar Front zone, and showed particular overlap in the region around 140¬∞E. Short-tailed shearwaters from South Australia also foraged in Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front. The spatial distribution of shearwater foraging effort in the Polar Front zone was matched by patterns in large-scale upwelling, primary production, and abundances of copepods and myctophid fish. Oceanic winds were found to be broad determinants of foraging distribution, and of the flight paths taken by the birds on long foraging trips to Antarctic waters. Conclusions/Significance: The shearwaters displayed foraging site fidelity and overlap of foraging habitat between species and populations that may enhance their utility as indicators of Southern Ocean ecosystems.

Recent investigations focus on the changes in ecosystem diversity and functioning associated to such shifts. Of particular interest, because of the implication on climate drivers, are shifts that occur synchronously in separated basins. Principal Findings: In this work we analyze and review long-term records of Mediterranean ecological and hydro-climate variables and find that all point to a synchronous change in the late 1980s. A quantitative synthesis of the literature (including observed oceanic data, models and satellite analyses) shows that these years mark a major change in Mediterranean hydrographic properties, surface circulation, and deep water convection (the Eastern Mediterranean Transient). We provide novel analyses that link local, regional and basin scale hydrological properties with two major indicators of large scale climate, the North Atlantic Oscillation index and the Northern Hemisphere Temperature index, suggesting that the Mediterranean shift is part of a large scale change in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide a simplified scheme of the different effects of climate vs. temperature on pelagic ecosystems. Conclusions: Our results show that the Mediterranean Sea underwent a major change at the end of the 1980s that encompassed atmospheric, hydrological, and ecological systems, for which it can be considered a regime shift. We further provide evidence that the local hydrography is linked to the larger scale, northern hemisphere climate. These results suggest that the shifts that affected the North, Baltic, Black and Mediterranean (this work) Seas at the end of the 1980s, that have been so far only partly associated, are likely linked as part a northern hemisphere change. These findings bear wide implications for the development of climate change scenarios, as synchronous shifts may provide the key for distinguishing local (i.e., basin) anthropogenic drivers, such as eutrophication or fishing, from larger scale (hemispheric) climate drivers. ¬© 2010 Conversi et al.","Review","Scopus",0.385793377271434,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,195,NA

The model included an enhanced definition of habitat indices, movements, and accessibility of tuna predators to different vertically migrant and non-migrant micronekton functional groups. The simulations covered the Pacific basin (model domain) at a 2¬∞√ó2¬∞ geographic resolution. The structure of the model allows an evaluation from multiple data sources, and parameterization can be optimized by adjoint techniques and maximum likelihood using fishing data. A first such optimized parameterization was obtained for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Pacific Ocean using historical catch data for the last 50years and a hindcast from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model driven by the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. The parameterization provided very plausible biological parameter values and a good fit to fishing data from the different fisheries, both within and outside the time period used for optimization. We then employed this model to forecast the future of bigeye tuna populations in the Pacific Ocean. The simulation was driven by the physical-biogeochemical fields predicted from a global marine biogeochemistry - climate simulation. This global simulation was performed with the IPSL climate model version 4 (IPSL-CM4) coupled to the oceanic biogeochemical model PISCES and forced by atmospheric CO2, from historical records over 1860-2000, and under the SRES A2 IPCC scenario for the 21st century (i.e. atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 850ppm in the year 2100). Potential future changes in distribution and abundance under the IPCC scenario are presented but without taking into account any fishing effort. The simulation showed an improvement in bigeye tuna spawning habitat both in subtropical latitudes and in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) where the surface temperature becomes optimal for bigeye tuna spawning. The adult feeding habitat also improved in the ETP due to the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration in the sub-surface allowing adults to access deeper forage. Conversely, in the Western Central Pacific the temperature becomes too warm for bigeye tuna spawning. The decrease in spawning is compensated by an increase of larvae biomass in subtropical regions. However, natural mortality of older stages increased due to lower habitat values (too warm surface temperatures, decreasing oxygen concentration in the sub-surface and less food). This increased mortality and the displacement of surviving fish to the eastern region led to stable then declining adult biomass at the end of the century. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.619826891221436,"1",NA,NA,15,NA,31,NA

Identifying the spatial distribution of Atlantic sturgeon is necessary to identify critical habitat and appropriate management actions. We used five fishery-independent surveys to assess habitat use and movement of Atlantic sturgeon during their marine life stage. The size distribution ranged from 56 to 269 cm total length (mean=108 cm). Ninety-eight percent of all Atlantic sturgeon were smaller than 197 cm-a size that indicated the majority were immature. The pattern of habitat use revealed concentration areas and potential migration pathways used for northerly summer and southerly winter migrations. Atlantic sturgeon were largely confined to water depths less than 20 m and aggregations tended to occur at the mouths of large bays (Chesapeake and Delaware bays) or estuaries (Hudson and Kennebec rivers) during the fall and spring and to disperse throughout the Mid-Atlantic Bight during the winter. In most surveys depth, temperature, and salinity were significantly related to the distribution of Atlantic sturgeon. Knowledge of their habitat and movements can be used to devise spatially based conservation plans to minimize bycatch and to enhance population recovery.","Article","Scopus",0.711858057812308,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,164,NA

Marine fish and invertebrates have been sampled in San Francisco Bay since 1980 and exhibit large, unexplained population changes including record-high abundances of common species after 1999. Our analysis shows that populations of demersal fish, crabs and shrimp covary with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), both of which reversed signs in 1999. A time series model forced by the atmospheric driver of NPGO accounts for two-thirds of the variability in the first principal component of species abundances, and generalized linear models forced by PDO and NPGO account for most of the annual variability of individual species. We infer that synchronous shifts in climate patterns and community variability in San Francisco Bay are related to changes in oceanic wind forcing that modify coastal currents, upwelling intensity, surface temperature, and their influence on recruitment of marine species that utilize estuaries as nursery habitat. Ecological forecasts of estuarine responses to climate change must therefore consider how altered patterns of atmospheric forcing across ocean basins influence coastal oceanography as well as watershed hydrology. ¬© 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.","Article","Scopus",0.613073745116795,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,59,NA

Although sites were relatively similar in the cover and composition of coral communities, substantial differences in the structure and composition of associated fish assemblages were apparent. Fish assemblages in the southern Persian Gulf held significantly lower estimates of abundance, richness and biomass, with significantly higher abundances of smaller sized individuals than Gulf of Oman assemblages. Functionally, southern Persian Gulf sites held significantly lower abundances of nearly all the common fish trophic guilds found on Gulf of Oman sites, although higher abundances of herbivorous grazers were apparent.

For marine animals whose offspring must migrate long distances, natural selection may favour reproduction in areas near ocean currents that facilitate migratory movements. Similarly, selection may act against the use of potential reproductive areas from which offspring have difficulty emigrating. As a first step towards investigating this conceptual framework, we analysed loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nest abundance along the southeastern US coast as a function of distance to the Gulf Stream System (GSS), the ocean current to which hatchlings in this region migrate. Results indicate that nest density increases as distance to the GSS decreases. Distance to the GSS can account for at least 90 per cent of spatial variation in regional nest density. Even at smaller spatial scales, where local beach conditions presumably exert strong effects, at least 38 per cent of the variance is explained by distance from the GSS. These findings suggest that proximity to favourable ocean currents strongly influences sea turtle nesting distributions. Similar factors may influence patterns of abundance across the reproductive ranges of diverse marine animals, such as penguins, eels, salmon and seals. ¬© 2010 The Royal Society.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.666999206318627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,148,NA

Although a relatively common feature in oceanic ecosystems, little information is available that identifies those that are biologically important. Improved knowledge offers opportunities for unique management of these areas, which may advance the sustainable management of oceanic resources. In this study, we evaluate the existence of an association between seamounts and tuna longline fisheries at the ocean basin scale, identify significant seamounts for tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean, and quantify the seamount contribution to the tuna longline catch. Methodology/Principal Findings: We use data collected for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean for bigeye, yellowfin, and albacore tuna at the ocean basin scale. GLMs were applied to a coupled dataset of longline fisheries catch and effort, and seamount location information. The analyses show that seamounts may be associated with an annual longline combined catch of 35 thousand tonnes, with higher catch apparent for yellowfin, bigeye, and albacore tuna on 17%, 14%, and 14% of seamounts respectively. In contrast 14%, 18%, and 20% of seamounts had significantly lower catches for yellowfin, bigeye and albacore tuna respectively. Studying catch data in relation to seamount positions presents several challenges such as bias in location of seamounts, or lack of spatial resolution of fisheries data. Whilst we recognize these limitations the criteria used for detecting significant seamounts were conservative and the error in identification is likely to be low albeit unknown. Conclusions/Significance: Seamounts throughout the study area were found to either enhance or reduce tuna catch. This indicates that management of seamounts is important Pacific-wide, but management approaches must take account of local conditions. Management of tuna and biodiversity resources in the region would benefit from considering such effects. ¬© 2010 Morato et al.","Article","Scopus",0.495305298553425,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,187,NA

SAV helps improve water quality, provides food and shelter for waterfowl, fish, and shellfish, as well as protects shorelines from erosion. In coastal bays most SAV was eliminated by disease in the 1930's. In the late 1960's and 1970's a dramatic decline of all SAV species was correlated with increasing nutrient and sediment inputs from development of surrounding watersheds (MDNP et. al 2004). Currently state programs work to protect and restore existing wetlands, however, increasing development and population pressure continue to degrade and destroy both tidal and non-tidal wetlands and hinder overall development of SAV growth. The focus of this research was to utilize spatial referencing software in the mapping of healthy submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitats. In cooperation with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), students from Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) developed and applied Geographic Information Systems (GIS) skills to evaluate the distribution and abundance of SAV in North Carolina's estuarine environments. Utilizing ESRI ArcView, which includes ArcMap, ArcCatalog and ArcToolbox, and the applications of on-screen digitizing, an assessment of vegetation cover was made through the delineation of observable SAV beds in Core Sound, North Carolina. Aerial photography of the identified coastal water bodies was taken at 12,000 feet above mean terrain (AMT) scale 1:24,000. The georeferenced aerial photographs were assessed for obscurities and the SAV beds were digitized. Through the adoption of NOAA guidelines and criteria for benthic habitat mapping using aerial photography for image acquisition and analysis, students delineated SAV beds and developed a GIS spatial database relevant to desired results.

Since the 1980s a steady decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels to freshwater and in total eel landings. The eel is considered as critically endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of species. The Skagerrak beach seine survey from Norway constitutes the longest fishery-independent dataset on yellow/silver eels (starting in 1904). The Skagerrak coastal region receives larvae born in the Sargasso Sea spawning areas that have followed the Gulf Stream/ North Atlantic Drift before they penetrate far into the North Sea. The Skagerrak coastal time series is therefore particularly valuable for exploring the impacts of oceanic factors on fluctuations in eel recruitment abundance. Analyses showed that Sargasso Sea surface temperature was negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 12 years revealing a cyclic and detrimental effect of high temperatures on the newly hatched larvae. The North Atlantic Oscillation index and inflow of North Atlantic water into the North Sea were negatively correlated with eel abundance, with a lag of 11 years. Increased currents towards the North Atlantic during high North Atlantic Oscillation years may send larvae into the subpolar gyre before they are ready to metamorphose and settle, resulting in low recruitment in the northern part of the distribution area for these years. The Skagerrak time series was compared with glass eel recruitment to freshwater in the Netherlands (Den Oever glass eel time series), and similar patterns were found revealing a cycle linked to changes in oceanic factors affecting glass eel recruitment. The recent decline of eels in the Skagerrak also coincided with previously documented shifts in environmental conditions of the North Sea ecosystem. ¬© 2010 The Royal Society.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.698373938593202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,73,0

Upwelling, upwelling filaments, cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies and island wakes are typical mesoscale features of the northwest African coast in summer. A single upwelling filament off Cabo Juby was joined in mid-August by a second that originated about 100 km to the north. The two filaments flowed together and merged 100 km offshore. The merged filament was partially entrained around a cyclonic eddy, trapped between the Canary Islands and the African coast, and interacted with cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies shed from Gran Canaria. Mesoscale oceanographic features strongly influenced the horizontal distributions of fish larvae. Eddies acted as a mechanism of concentration, while upwelling filaments were dispersive, transporting larvae from the African neritic zone into oceanic areas and towards the Canary archipelago. This transport was the major cause of the predominance of neritic larvae in the composition of the larval fish community of the area. The results also suggest: (1) that anchovy larvae are good indicators of the offshore displacement of upwelled water; (2) that the alternation between anchovy and sardine as species dominant in the larval fish community of the area during summer depends upon the water temperature in the African upwelling region, anchovy dominating at higher temperature; (3) that a coupling of anchovy and sardine spawning with the mesoscale oceanographic structure formed by the upwelling filaments and trapped eddy overcomes the negative effect that Ekman transport has on their populations. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Current strength was highest at both the northern and southern ends of the atoll and largely controlled by local wind and weakly by tidal forcing. Benthic functional group distributions varied throughout the atoll and had distinct areas of dominance. In contrast, dominance of coral species was weaker, reflecting the lost cover and zonation of Acropora, Porites, and Montastraea that were reported in the 1970s. Hard and soft corals dominated the windward rim, while the central and leeward lagoon had lower current strengths and sea grass and fleshy green algae were relatively more abundant. Brown erect algae were relatively more common in the north and calcifying green and red algae the southern ends of the atoll. Only Montastraea-Agaricia agaricites distributions were similar to reports from the 1970s with high relative dominance in the southern and northeast atoll.

Hard and soft coral cover abundance declined away from the reef rim and tidal channels and was associated with fast seawater turnover and high surgeonfish abundance. Consequently, the windward rim area has retained the most original and persistent hard-soft coral and surgeonfish community and is considered a priority for future management, if the goal is to protect coral from fishing impacts. ¬© 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Scopus",0.633563617142756,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,135,NA

They are known to undertake seasonal migrations within the Maldives, but these movements have not been well documented. The aims of this study were to map the seasonal distribution of manta rays within the Maldives, and to provide some indications of the physical and biological oceanographic processes affecting their distribution. The seasonal distribution of mantas was determined from a national survey of fishermen, interviews with experienced divers and personal observations. The data demonstrate that the distribution of mantas is strongly influenced by the seasonally reversing monsoon currents. Mantas occur on the downstream sides of the atolls, and are rare on the upstream sides, switching sides biannually as the monsoon currents change direction. These seasonally alternating currents are driven by monsoon winds which also alternate according to the season, and bring clear oceanic water to the upstream sides of the atolls. As the currents pass over the Maldives ridge, nutrient-rich waters are lifted to the surface, promoting phytoplankton blooms (as demonstrated by the distribution of chlorophyll-a) on the downstream sides of the atolls. This manifestation of the island mass effect supports an abundance of zooplankton, which in turn supports the manta rays. ¬© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.545302679053267,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,178,0

However, little is known about its biology, abundance, or spatial ecology there. Results are presented on the migration and behaviour of three porbeagles tagged with archival pop-up tags off Ireland between September 2008 and January 2009. One shark migrated >2400 km to the northwest of Morocco, residing around the Bay of Biscay for approximately 30 days. The other two remained more localized in off-shelf regions around the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay and off western Ireland. The sharks occupied a broad vertical depth range (0-700 m) and a relatively limited temperature range (‚àº9-17¬∞C), with notable variations in diving behaviour between individual sharks. There were distinct day-night differences in depth distribution, each shark being positioned higher in the water column by night than by day. Night-time depth distribution also appeared to be driven by the lunar cycle during broad-scale migration through oceanic waters. Our results show that porbeagles occupy and traverse regions of high fishing activity where they are potentially vulnerable to population depletion.

In contrast, inshore Alaska Coastal Water (ACW) is much less productive. Yet the Chukchi Bight and Kotzebue Sound, located under ACW in the southeastern Chukchi Sea, contain a substantial faunal abundance and biomass of invertebrates, fishes and marine mammals. We examined food web structure to gain an understanding of how a relatively rich benthic fauna with a high biomass can be supported under ACW with a supposedly low flux of carbon to the benthos. We measured stable isotope (Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N) values of selected organisms (from zooplankton to fishes) as markers of food sources and trophic position to compare fauna on the shelf under BSAW with that in the Chukchi Bight and Kotzebue Sound under ACW. Relative isotope position of organisms in all three regions was similar, even though some pelagic species within the Sound were depleted in Œ¥13C compared to the other regions. We attribute the depletion to the influence of terrestrially derived carbon. We suggest that the hydrodynamics along an oceanic front between the Chukchi Shelf and the Chukchi Bight support the advection of nutrient-rich POC into the Bight and Sound as additional food sources to local production. We conclude that local conditions and multiple POC sources in the Bight and Sound support the substantial population of benthic invertebrates and the fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals that feed on them. ¬© 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Scopus",0.443149738996609,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,227,NA

Fourteen systematic boat surveys were conducted between August and early December 2005 to photo-identify the bottlenose dolphins. The estimated number of animals, with long-lasting marks, in the population obtained from Chapman's and Mth models were 51 (95% CI = 49-53) and 52 (95% CI = 51-60), respectively. Taking into account the proportion of dolphins with long-lasting marks in the population, the total estimated population size ranged between 84 (95% CI = 76-93) and 86 (95% CI = 78-95) individuals, respectively, which was very similar to the 84 individuals revealed by the population census. Our results did not differ from the abundance estimate carried out in 1998, prior to the high fishing-related mortality event, suggesting that the population is stable. Plausible argument to explain the stability of the population is that some carcasses found on the oceanic coastal beaches near Patos Lagoon estuary come from animals that do not belong to the estuary community. Future studies should investigate fine-scale habitat partition between estuarine and adjacent coastal dolphins. If the existence of different communities living in close proximity (estuarine and coastal areas near to the estuary) is confirmed, a new abundance estimate is needed to access the conservation status of bottlenose dolphins in this region. ¬© 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.","Article","Scopus",0.843195431802915,NA,"1","multiple studies?",NA,5,112,NA

Designing conservation strategies for this group depends on basic knowledge of the geographic distribution and diversity of known species. So far, this information has been fragmented and incomplete. Here, we have synthesized the first global shark diversity pattern from a new database of published sources, including all 507 species described at present, and have identified hotspots of shark species richness, functional diversity and endemicity from these data. We have evaluated the congruence of these diversity measures and demonstrate their potential use in setting priority areas for shark conservation. Our results show that shark diversity across all species peaks on the continental shelves and at mid-latitudes (30-40 degrees N and S). Global hotspots of species richness, functional diversity and endemicity were found off Japan, Taiwan, the East and West coasts of Australia, Southeast Africa, Southeast Brazil and Southeast USA. Moreover, some areas with low to moderate species richness such as Southern Australia, Angola, North Chile and Western Continental Europe stood out as places of high functional diversity. Finally, species affected by shark finning showed different patterns of diversity, with peaks closer to the Equator and a more oceanic distribution overall. Our results show that the global pattern of shark diversity is uniquely different from land, and other well-studied marine taxa, and may provide guidance for spatial approaches to shark conservation. However, similar to terrestrial ecosystems, protected areas based on hotspots of diversity and endemism alone would provide insufficient means for safeguarding the diverse functional roles that sharks play in marine ecosystems. ¬© 2011 Lucifora et al.","Article","Scopus",0.444527799242292,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,190,NA

The aim of the present study is to estimate the effective population size of the European eel and the possible existence of a genetic bottleneck, which is expected during or after a severe demographic crash. Using a panel of 22 EST-derived microsatellite loci, we found no evidence for a genetic bottleneck in the European eel as our data showed moderate to high levels of genetic diversity, no loss of allele size range or rare alleles, and a stationary population with growth values not statistically different from zero, which is confirmed by finding comparable value of short-term and long-term effective population size. Our results suggest that the observed demographic decline in the European eel did not entail a genetic decline of the same magnitude. Forward-time simulations confirmed that large exploited marine fish populations can undergo genetic bottleneck episodes and experience a loss of genetic variability. Simulations indicated that the failure to pick up the signal of a genetic bottleneck in the European eel is not due to lack of power. Although anthropogenic factors lowered the continental stock biomass, the observation of a stable genetic effective population size suggests that the eel crash was not due to a reduction in spawning stock abundance. Alternatively, we propose that overfishing, pollution and/or parasites might have affected individual fitness and fecundity, leading to an impoverished spawning stock that may fail to produce enough good quality eggs. A reduced reproduction success due to poor quality of the spawners may be exacerbated by oceanic processes inducing changes in primary production in the Sargasso Sea and/or pathway of transport across the Atlantic Ocean leading to a higher larval mortality. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.613455275318834,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,234,NA

A total of 62 trawls were completed during four separate cruises in the austral fall (April-June) and winter (July-September) of 2001 and 2002. Crustaceans dominated the system in both seasons, accounting for 32 of the 55 species captured in the fall and 30 of the 48 species captured in winter. In both seasons, a very few species made up the majority of the catch. In the fall, the euphausiids Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia superba, and Thysanoessa macrura, and the mysid Antarctomysis ohlinii numerically dominated the assemblage, contributing over 85% of the total. In the winter, the same three euphausiids and the chaetognath Pseudosagitta gazellae were the numerical dominants, comprising over 90% of the catch. A significant increase in total abundance and biomass was observed from 2001 to 2002. The invertebrate micronekton/macrozooplankton communities found in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP were a mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna: a direct result of local hydrographic conditions. Near the shelf break and in the outer reaches of the Marguerite Trough, a deep canyon transecting the shelf in a south-southeast direction, the communities were more diverse, dominated by oceanic species such as Euphausia triacantha, Salpa thompsoni, and Themisto gaudichaudi. The assemblages present in the nearshore fjords exhibited lower diversity and were dominated by neritic species such as E. crystallorophias and A. ohlinii. At the mid-shelf and mid-trough locations, the assemblages were composed of a variable mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna. The faunal mixing and overall species composition in those areas is the result of episodic Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions onto the shelf via deep bathymetric features such as the Marguerite Trough. Species diversity and integrated abundance for the upper 200. m of the water column were similar between seasons in the WAP study region, but integrated biomass was nearly three times greater in fall than in winter. Integrated estimates from the WAP study region were similar to those from other studies conducted in the Scotia and Weddell Seas, but were orders of magnitude lower than estimates from a study in Croker Passage, primarily due to a large catch of E. superba. In contrast, species diversity in the WAP was higher than recorded in any of the previously mentioned studies, which is due to the mixing of typical oceanic fauna with endemic nearshore fauna. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.699533635810317,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,176,NA

We report the apparent impact of declining oxygen on midwater fishes within the OMZ of the southern California Current (CC). Principal component analysis of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) ichthyoplankton time series from 1951 to 2008 indicates that the dominant temporal pattern (principal component 1 [PC1]) represents the marked decline of the region's mesopelagic fishes during periods of reduced oxygen. Of the 27 taxa with loadings > 0.5 on PC1, 24 were mesopelagic. PC1 was strongly correlated with intermediate-water oxygen concentrations (r = 0.75, p < 0.05), which were about 20% lower in the past decade and the 1950s than in the period from 1970 to 1995. The abundance of mesopelagic fishes represented by PC1 was reduced, on average, by 63% between periods of high and low oxygen concentrations. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism is the shoaling of the hypoxic boundary layer during periods of reduced oxygen, which renders the mesopelagic fauna more vulnerable to visually orienting predators. The mesopelagic fish fauna provides a vital trophodynamic link between the marine plankton and many higher predators. The decline of deepwater fish populations has profound implications for commercial fisheries, marine food webs and marine conservation: climate models predict a 20 to 40% decline in global deepwater oxygen concentrations over the coming century. ¬© 2011 Inter-Research.","Article","Scopus",0.641587395759673,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,218,NA

Although most species go through these early life history stages, not all species follow the same strategy. Life history strategies occur in three general categories: habitat specialists, habitat generalists, and ontogenetic shifters. Despite this variation in life history strategy, common processes affect the early life history stages of tropical marine fishes and decapods. The life history transition from planktonic larva to benthic post-larva connects oceanic and coastal habitats. However, benthic features and benthic processes affect early life history stages so that settlement and post-settlement distributions are not perfect reflections of larval supply patterns. The abundances and distributions of settlement and post-settlement life history stages result from complex interactions of larval supply, larval behavior, and the interactions of early settlers with the benthic environment. Since much of the very high mortality that occurs during settlement and early post-settlement appears to be due to predation, the direct effects of predators may be the most important factors acting on these early life history stages. Habitat selection, priority effects, predator avoidance, inter-and intra-specific competition, and aggression during and after settlement are also important influences on abundances and distributions of settlement and post-settlement fishes and decapods. The connection between nursery habitat availability and adult population abundances has been demonstrated, so it is likely that these other interactions of early life history stages with the benthic environment have demographic implications that are not yet understood. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Book Chapter","Scopus",0.490282349143877,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,350,NA

Other breeding populations exist in New Zealand, south-western Western Australia and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. Tagging and banding studies indicate that breeding birds of the Lord Howe Island population inhabit waters mainly to the west of the Island during October to May. Birds then migrate north to waters surrounding Japan during the Austral winter. Seabirds are attracted to the baited hooks of longline vessels and can become snagged and drown as the line sinks into the water. Observations of flesh-footed shearwater (FFS) bycatch in Australian waters have been recorded on both Japanese and domestic longline fishing vessels. Increased observer coverage between 2002 and 2004 on Australian longline vessels, in order to monitor the effectiveness of an under-water setting chute and various line-weighting regimes, showed large bycatch rates of seabirds, and in particular flesh-footed shearwaters (Baker and Wise, 2005). In addition, substantial reductions in colony size have occurred on the island due to housing development. As a consequence of these sources of additional mortality, concerns have been expressed about the population's sustainability. Australia has international and national obligations to ensure that fishery interactions with seabird populations are not deleterious to their populations. The ""incidental catch (or by-catch) of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations"" has been listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as a key threatening process for seabirds (Environment Australia, 1998). Flesh-footed shearwaters were nominated as being at risk from longline fishing. This paper presents a quantitative impact assessment that fully integrates information on the biology, foraging distributions, links to oceanography, fishing interactions (Northern and Southern Hemisphere), and potential impacts from housing on Lord Howe Island. A discrete age-, sex- and colony-structured model is developed that accounts for natural and fishing mortality, together with potential consequences from the loss of nesting habitat on Lord Howe Island. The model is able to fit to tagging data on breeding foraging distributions. These data assist the model in predicting where the birds might be when at sea. The birds' position is assumed to be a function of time of year, sea surface temperature and longitude. Using the predicted positions, the model fits to data on the observed bycatch from the Australian domestic longline fishery. These data enable the model to predict the probability of catching a bird, given various operational characteristics (e.g. setting at night). The model also fits to data from the two surveys of breeding abundance that have occurred on Lord Howe Island.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.806503311678462,NA,"1","Mentions bycatch rates over two years, and full impact assessment",NA,15,199,NA

Amphidromy is a likely adaptation for colonisation of island streams following stochastic events that lead to local extirpation. In the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Australia, steep coastal mountain streams share similar physical characteristics to island systems. These streams are poorly surveyed, but may provide suitable habitat for amphidromous species. However, due to their ephemeral nature, common non-diadromous freshwater species of continental Australia are unlikely to persist. Consequently, we hypothesise that coastal Wet Tropics streams are faunally more similar, to distant Pacific island communities, than to nearby faunas of large continental rivers. Methods/Principal Findings: Surveys of coastal Wet Tropics streams recorded 26 species, 10 of which are first records for Australia, with three species undescribed. This fish community is unique in an Australian context in that it contains mostly amphidromous species, including sicydiine gobies of the genera Sicyopterus, Sicyopus, Smilosicyopus and Stiphodon. Species presence/absence data of coastal Wet Tropics streams were compared to both Wet Tropics river networks and Pacific island faunas. ANOSIM indicated the fish fauna of north-eastern Australian coastal streams were more similar to distant Pacific islands (R = 0.76), than to nearby continental rivers (R = 0.98). Main Conclusions/Significance: Coastal Wet Tropics streams are faunally more similar to distant Pacific islands (79% of species shared), than to nearby continental fauna due to two factors. First, coastal Wet Tropics streams lack many non-diadromous freshwater fish which are common in nearby large rivers. Second, many amphidromous species found in coastal Wet Tropics streams and Indo-Pacific islands remain absent from large rivers of the Wet Tropics. The evolutionary and conservation significance of this newly discovered Australian fauna requires clarification in the context of the wider amphidromous fish community of the Pacific. ¬© 2011 Thuesen et al.","Article","Scopus",0.58875329731137,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,175,NA

We examined spawning and larval ecology of Western Atlantic sphyraenids using monthly ichthyoplankton samples collected over 2 years along a transect spanning the east-west axis of the Straits of Florida (SOF). Samples were dominated by the great barracuda (92. 8%) and sennets (Sphyraena borealis and Sphyraena picudilla; 6. 6%). While larval sennets and S. barracuda displayed similar vertical distributions (majority in upper 25 m), horizontal and temporal patterns of abundance suggested a spatial and temporal species replacement between larval S. barracuda and sennets that tracks adult ecology. The diet of both taxa consisted largely of copepods, with inclusion of fish larvae at 8 mm SL, and in S. barracuda alone, a switch in the wet season to exclusive piscivory by 12 mm SL (18 days post-hatch). A lack of piscivory in S. barracuda larvae captured in the dry season corresponded to slower larval growth than in the wet season. Larval growth was also related to size-at-hatch and larval age such that larvae that were larger at hatch or larger (older) at capture grew faster at earlier ages, suggesting faster larval growth, and indirectly larger hatch size, conveys a survival advantage. Unlike larval growth, instantaneous mortality rate did not differ with season, and no lunar cyclic patterns in spawning output were identified. Our results provide insight into the pelagic phase of sphyraenids and highlight the importance of both diet and hatch size to the growth and survival of fish larvae in low latitude oceanic environments. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Review","Scopus",0.619732833079488,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,181,NA

Carnivorous fishes were the largest trophic group in terms of biomass, followed by omnivores and roving herbivores. The two predominant types of reef habitat, fringing reefs built by coralline algae and rocky reefs made of volcanic boulders, showed significant differences in the biomass and the abundance of the trophic guilds. Within each habitat type, significant differences in species richness, density and biomass were detected among crest, slope and interface zones. Although similar in overall species composition to coastal reefs in Brazil, the fish fauna of Trindade Island shares certain characteristics, such as a high abundance of planktivores, with other Brazilian oceanic islands. Despite comparatively high fish biomass, including the macro-carnivorous species habitually targeted by fisheries, signs of overfishing were evident.

There are quantitative and qualitative methods that estimate extinction probability based on past sighting records. However, because current baselines about species' abundances and distributions in the sea were mostly established after humans had started affecting marine populations, researchers must often rely on historical data to elucidate past environmental conditions. We review early historical records from the Archipelago of Saint Paul's Rocks, together with data from recent expeditions, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that reef sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) have become extinct there. Our analyses are based on non-parametric probabilistic tests for extinction and on a qualitative framework to examine and judge as objectively as possible the likelihood of local extinction. Until the mid-20th century, visitors to St. Paul's Rocks invariably commented on the remarkable number of sharks around the Archipelago. These observations contrast with those of expeditions carried out during the last decade, which report no carcharhinid reef sharks while scuba diving in the archipelago, despite many more hours of underwater fieldwork than previous expeditions. All quantitative and qualitative methods conclude that the reef shark Carcharhinus galapagensis is locally extinct at St. Paul's Rocks after a sharp decrease in abundance that took place following the commencement of fishing. However, the persistence of occasional individuals of the once locally common Carcharhinus falciformis in the vicinity of the Archipelago, as a result of constant immigration of this oceanic species from outside the area, suggest that the population might recover if the present fishing pressure was removed. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.676251867565125,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51,NA

Larvae were collected during 8 expeditions in 2003, 2004 and 2005 from surface horizontal plankton samples at different distances around the archipelago and inside a cove located between the main islets. Identification resulted in 80 taxa distributed across 29 families; 72 taxa represented individual species. Mycto - phidae was the most diverse family, followed by Gonostomatidae. The larvae of reef fish, such as the endemic damselfish Stegastes sanctipauli and the blenny Entomacrodus vomerinus, were most abundant. Pelagic fish larvae were also common in the samples, but at low abundances. Reef fish larvae were also the most abundant and frequent in the cove, while at distances up to 500 m and >500 m from the islets, larvae of pelagic species such as the lanternfishes Ceratoscopelus warmingii and Lampadena luminosa, and the flyingfish Oxyporhamphus micropterus were more representative. Cluster analysis superimposed on a non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated 4 significantly different groups (SIMPROF, p < 0.05) within the samples. Indicator species analysis revealed 4 fish larvae assemblages in the surface layer: a reef assemblage, a neritic assemblage, a nighttime oceanic assemblage and a daytime oceanic assemblage. Our findings illustrate the distribution of fish larvae that inhabit the surface waters around Saint Paul's Rocks and provide information about the temporal variability in larval abundance of some reef and pelagic species. ¬© Inter-Research 2012.","Article","Scopus",0.590464219803178,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,124,NA

The team makes use of novel biotelemetry (primarily acoustic telemetry curtains), biologging, and oceanographic technologies to better understand changing ocean dynamics and their impact on ocean ecosystems, animal movements, and ecology and the dynamics of marine animal populations, many of which are commercially important. The network is organized around three ocean arenas (i.e., the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific) where specific research projects will occur. However, all projects will contribute toward addressing a single unifying national scale question-what are the movements of continental shelf marine animals, how do these movements affect species interactions, and what are the consequences of environmental variability/change and human activities on these species' distributions and abundance? Taxa that will be tracked include diadromous (e.g., salmon, eels, sturgeon) and marine (e.g., sharks, capelin, cod) fishes and a variety of marine mammals (e.g., grey seals, killer whales). Some of the common activities that occur in all arenas include measurements of oceanographic characteristics and variability at various spatial and temporal scales, movements of key species at several trophic levels, and use of key acoustic ""bioprobes"" (animals that carry tags that record locations visited, ocean conditions, and interactions with other tagged animals) and ""roboprobes"" (remotely controlled autonomous vehicles such as gliders that measure physical, biological, and chemical conditions) to complement measurements from fixed OTN acoustic telemetry curtains. Ultimately, scientific information generated will inform resource management, help formulate new socioeconomic policies, and provide some impetus to the reformulation of governance practices and legal standards.","Article","Scopus",0.458756288029612,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,366,NA

Whereas sea trout remain in near-shore waters throughout their marine migration, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts typically move quickly offshore into oceanic waters. It might therefore be predicted that salmon smolts would be less vulnerable to coastal stressors and less likely to be negatively affected by infestations of sea lice early in their marine phase. Groups of microtagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts were fed either untreated pellets or pellets incorporating the in-feed sea louse treatment SLICE (emamectin benzoate) prior to eight experimental releases in three marine locations over a 3-year period. In total, 74 324 smolts were released and analysis of tag recaptures from returning adult salmon showed that emamectin-treated smolts experienced increased survivorship and were 1.8 times more likely to return compared with control fish. These results suggest that sea lice-induced mortality on adult Atlantic salmon returns in Ireland can be significant, and that sea lice larvae emanating from farmed salmon may influence individual survivorship and population conservation status of wild salmon in these river systems.","Article","Scopus",0.576202417433919,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,145,NA

By contrast, the CalCOFI assemblage was relatively stable through time. Depth, temperature, and zooplankton explained more of the variability in assemblage structure at the CalCOFI scale than they did at the CCA scale. CalCOFI sampling revealed that oceanic species impinged upon the CCA between 2002 and 2003 in association with warmer offshore waters, thus explaining the increased influence of these species in the CCA during the El Nino years. Multi-scale, spatially explicit sampling and analysis was necessary to interpret assemblage dynamics in the CCA and likely will be needed to evaluate other focal oceanic marine reserves throughout the world.","Article","Scopus",0.588865601524372,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,67,NA

The total catch level of the 7 species in the KOC region was generally higher than that in the TWC region before 1991 but was lower after 1992, suggesting that the fish populations in the Pacific side are shifted to the TWC region by zonal oscillation of the oceanic conditions in relation to the climate regime shift in the late 1980s. ¬© The Ecological Society of Korea.","Article","Scopus",0.724657423944928,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,79,NA

Aims of this article are to characterize through ROV image analysis the population structure of the sponge assemblages found in two deep habitats of the Mediterranean Sea and to test their structuring role, mainly focusing on the demosponges Pachastrella monilifera Schmidt, 1868 and Poecillastra compressa (Bowerbank, 1866). In both study sites, the two target sponge species constitute a mixed assemblage. In the Amendolara Bank (Ionian Sea), where P. compressa is the most abundant species, sponges extend on a peculiar tabular bedrock between 120 and 180 m depth with an average total abundance of 7.3 ¬± 1.1 specimens m -2 (approximately 230 gWW m -2 of biomass). In contrast, the deeper assemblage of Bari Canyon (average total abundance 10.0 ¬± 0.7 specimens m -2, approximately 315 gWW m -2 of biomass), located in the southwestern Adriatic Sea between 380 and 500 m depth, is dominated by P. monilifera mixed with living colonies of the scleractinian Madrepora oculata Linnaeus, 1758, the latter showing a total biomass comparable to that of sponges (386 gWW m -2). Due to their erect growth habit, these sponges contribute to create complex three-dimensional habitats in otherwise homogenous environments exposed to high sedimentation rates and attract numerous species of mobile invertebrates (mainly echinoderms) and fish. Sponges themselves may represent a secondary substrate for a specialized associated fauna, such zoanthids. As demonstrated in oceanic environments sponge beds support also in the Mediterranean Sea locally rich biodiversity levels. Sponges emerge also as important elements of benthic-pelagic coupling in these deep habitats. In fact, while exploiting the suspended organic matter, about 20% of the Bari sponge assemblage is also severely affected by cidarid sea urchin grazing, responsible to cause visible damages to the sponge tissues (an average of 12.1 ¬± 1.8 gWW of individual biomass removed by grazing). Hence, in deep-sea ecosystems, not only the coral habitats, but also the grounds of massive sponges represent important biodiversity reservoirs and contribute to the trophic recycling of organic matter. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.488509171346208,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,163,NA

In particular, when keystone species are involved, this relative coupling between demographic stages can have significant implications for the functioning of ecosystems. We examined benthic and pelagic abundances of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus in order to: 1) understand the main life-history bottlenecks by observing the degree of coupling between demographic stages; and 2) explore the processes driving these linkages. P. lividus is the dominant invertebrate herbivore in the Mediterranean Sea, and has been repeatedly observed to overgraze shallow beds of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica and rocky macroalgal communities. We used a hierarchical sampling design at different spatial scales (100 s, 10 s and &1 km) and habitats (seagrass and rocky macroalgae) to describe the spatial patterns in the abundance of different demographic stages (larvae, settlers, recruits and adults). Our results indicate that large-scale factors (potentially currents, nutrients, temperature, etc.) determine larval availability and settlement in the pelagic stages of urchin life history. In rocky macroalgal habitats, benthic processes (like predation) acting at large or medium scales drive adult abundances. In contrast, adult numbers in seagrass meadows are most likely influenced by factors like local migration (from adjoining rocky habitats) functioning at much smaller scales. The complexity of spatial and habitat-dependent processes shaping urchin populations demands a multiplicity of approaches when addressing habitat conservation actions, yet such actions are currently mostly aimed at managing predation processes and fish numbers. We argue that a more holistic ecosystem management also needs to incorporate the landscape and habitat-quality level processes (eutrophication, fragmentation, etc.) that together regulate the populations of this keystone herbivore. ¬© 2012 Prado et al.","Article","Scopus",0.535088639709592,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,191,NA

We report on opportunistic before-after-control-impact surveys describing changes to coral reef communities both 4 weeks into the harvest and 1 year later compared with pre-harvest conditions. Prior to the harvest, there was a gradient in mean fish abundance and biomass per transect, with highest levels in the north of the closure (250 fish transect -1, 8,145. 8 kg ha -1), intermediate levels in the south of the closure (159 fish transect -1, 4,672. 1 kg ha -1) and lowest levels in the control area open to fishing (109 fish transect -1, 594. 0 kg ha -1). During the harvest, there were extensive depletions in large-bodied, primary targeted fish species, with significant loss in biomass of Acanthuridae and Carangidae in the north and Lutjanidae and Serranidae in the south. We also observed significant increases in Acanthuridae, Lethrinidae and Scaridae in the control, suggesting a ""bail-out"" effect whereby fish left the closure in response to a rapid increase in fishing pressure. These changes were coupled with a large increase in turf algal cover at all survey areas, despite a large numerical increase in small, roving acanthurids (e. g., Ctenochaetus striatus) and scarids (e. g., Chlorurus sordidus). By 1 year later, fish biomass was significantly lower within the closure than before the harvest, while values in the control returned to pre-harvest levels, suggesting non-compliance with the reinstated fishing ban.

The eddy was ‚àº90 km in diameter and ‚àº70 m deep. A larval fish assemblage, representing a mix of oceanic and coastal species, was defined mainly in the eddy from 200 m depth to the surface. Mesopelagic species, such as Vinciguerria lucetia, were dominant. Coastal reef (Diplectrum sp.) and pelagic (Auxis spp.) species were found mainly in the surface layer. This suggests that, because of the Gulfs relative narrowness, the eddy trapped coastal fish larvae during its formation and trajectory southward, retaining larvae of different adult habits. Another larval fish assemblage was defined off the eastern coast; its high larval abundance and specific richness was probably associated with coastal upwelling. Mesopelagic species (e.g. Triphoturus mexicanus) dominated this assemblage, and coastal demersal species that were absent from the eddy (e.g. Symphurus williamsi) were recorded in the surface layer, suggesting that the thermocline was a vertical boundary in this assemblage. The 3D differentiation of planktonic habitats was the result of the mesoscale hydrodynamics in the area sampled, in particular that associated to the eddy life history and characteristics (radius, depth and velocity), and to coastal upwelling, promoting larval retention of a mix of species of different adult habits. ¬© 2012 The Author.","Article","Scopus",0.595385508613783,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,153,NA

Quantifying density of sharks in the absence of humans (baseline) is, however, hindered by a paucity of pertinent time-series data. Recently researchers have used underwater visual surveys, primarily of limited spatial extent or nonstandard design, to infer negative associations between reef shark abundance and human populations. We analyzed data from 1607 towed-diver surveys (>1 ha transects surveyed by observers towed behind a boat) conducted at 46 reefs in the central-western Pacific Ocean, reefs that included some of the world's most pristine coral reefs. Estimates of shark density from towed-diver surveys were substantially lower (<10%) than published estimates from surveys along small transects (<0.02 ha), which is not consistent with inverted biomass pyramids (predator biomass greater than prey biomass) reported by other researchers for pristine reefs. We examined the relation between the density of reef sharks observed in towed-diver surveys and human population in models that accounted for the influence of oceanic primary productivity, sea surface temperature, reef area, and reef physical complexity. We used these models to estimate the density of sharks in the absence of humans. Densities of gray reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), whitetip reef sharks (Triaenodon obesus), and the group ""all reef sharks"" increased substantially as human population decreased and as primary productivity and minimum sea surface temperature (or reef area, which was highly correlated with temperature) increased. Simulated baseline densities of reef sharks under the absence of humans were 1.1-2.4/ha for the main Hawaiian Islands, 1.2-2.4/ha for inhabited islands of American Samoa, and 0.9-2.1/ha for inhabited islands in the Mariana Archipelago, which suggests that density of reef sharks has declined to 3-10% of baseline levels in these areas. ¬© 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Article","Scopus",0.728346162124784,"0",NA,NA,15,NA,32,NA

Abundances of recent settlers and adults for nearshore rockfish species are also positively correlated with front probability. The interaction of coastal topography and bathymetry sets spatial scales of fronts and consequently recruitment at approximately 50 km during active upwelling, compared to 200 km or greater during non-upwelling periods. Such relationships between fronts and recruitment are likely to be consistent across other marine ecosystems-from coastal waters to the open ocean-and provide a critical link between adults and widely dispersing young. Ocean fronts, already known as features with high biodiversity and resilience in pelagic habitats, also set recruitment and connectivity patterns across multiple taxa for intertidal and rocky reef communities, thus linking biodiversity and resilience in coastal and benthic habitats as well. ¬© 2012, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.","Article","Scopus",0.499937406348054,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,170,NA

At one extreme, the genome of placental mammals is littered with hundreds of thousands of copies resulting from the activity of a single clade of nLTR-RT, the L1 clade. In contrast, fish genomes contain a much more diverse repertoire of nLTR-RT, represented by numerous active clades and families. Yet, the number of nLTR-RT copies in teleostean fish is two orders of magnitude smaller than in mammals. The vast majority of insertions appear to be very recent, suggesting that nLTRRT do not accumulate in fish genomes. This pattern had previously been explained by a high rate of turnover, in which the insertion of new elements is offset by the selective loss of deleterious inserts. The turnover model was proposed because of the similarity between fish and Drosophila genomes with regard to their nLTR-RT profile. However, it is unclear if this model applies to fish. In fact, a previous study performed on the puffer fish suggested that transposable element insertions behave as neutral alleles. Here we examined the dynamics of amplification of nLTR-RT in the three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In this species, the vast majority of nLTR-RT insertions are relatively young, as suggested by their low level of divergence. Contrary to expectations, a majority of these insertions are fixed in lake and oceanic populations; thus, nLTR-RT do indeed accumulate in the genome of their fish host. This is not to say that nLTR-RTs are fully neutral, as the lack of fixed long elements in this genome suggests a deleterious effect related to their length. This analysis does not support the turnover model and strongly suggests that a much higher rate of DNA loss in fish than in mammals is responsible for the relatively small number of nLTR-RT copies and for the scarcity of ancient elements in fish genomes. We further demonstrate that nLTR-RT decay in fish occurs mostly through large deletions and not by the accumulation of small deletions. ¬© 2012 The Author(s).","Article","Scopus",0.386068671693511,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,408,NA

The abundance and distribution of the larvae of 5 pelagic fish taxa (Auxis spp., Euthynnus alleteratus, Thunnus thynnus, other Thunnus spp., and Coryphaena spp.) were estimated from surveys conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Marine Fisheries Service each spring between 1993 and 2007. We observed a tendency for higher northward extension of the Loop Current (LC) during spring each year, with maximum northern penetration in summer, although the exact location of the LC varied from year to year. Generally, higher total larval abundances occurred during years of high northward penetration in a region that was crossed by the LC during its excursions. However, the interannual variability of the LC was not mirrored in a general increase or decrease of larval fish densities in the water masses out of the LC front. Further, the results show that larvae of T. thynnus and Auxis spp. were more abundant within the boundaries of anticyclonic features (usually between 148 to 158 cm of sea surface height) and within GOM common waters, defined as the background waters in between the boundaries of mesoscale features.

Although maintaining connectivity among habitats within a seascape is necessary for preserving population resistance and resilience, quantifying movements of individuals within seascapes remains challenging. Traditional methods of identifying and valuing potential coral reef fish nursery habitats are indirect, often relying on visual surveys of abundance and correlations of size and biomass among habitats. We used compound-specific stable isotope analyses to determine movement patterns of commercially important fish populations within a coral reef seascape. This approach allowed us to quantify the relative contributions of individuals from inshore nurseries to reef populations and identify migration corridors among important habitats. Our results provided direct measurements of remarkable migrations by juvenile snapper of over 30 km, between nurseries and reefs. We also found significant plasticity in juvenile nursery residency. Although a majority of individuals on coastal reefs had used seagrass nurseries as juveniles, many adults on oceanic reefs had settled directly into reef habitats. Moreover, seascape con figuration played a critical but heretofore unrecognized role in determining connectivity among habitats. Finally, our approach provides key quantitative data necessary to estimate the value of distinctive habitats to ecosystem services provided by seascapes.","Article","Scopus",0.568145872418714,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,276,NA

Determining the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems requires understanding the direct effects on all trophic levels as well as indirect effects mediated by trophic coupling. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of climate change on the pelagic food web in the Celtic Sea, a productive shelf region in the Northeast Atlantic. Using long-term data, we examined possible direct and indirect 'bottom-up' climate effects across four trophic levels: phytoplankton, zooplankton, mid-trophic level fish and seabirds. During the period 1986-2007, although there was no temporal trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), the decadal mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Celtic Sea increased by 0.66¬±0.02¬∞C. Despite this, there was only a weak signal of climate change in the Celtic Sea food web. Changes in plankton community structure were found, however this was not related to SST or NAO. A negative relationship occurred between herring abundance (0- and 1-group) and spring SST (0-group: p = 0.02, slope = -0.305¬±0.125; 1-group: p = 0.04, slope = -0.410¬±0.193). Seabird demographics showed complex species-specific responses. There was evidence of direct effects of spring NAO (on black-legged kittiwake population growth rate: p = 0.03, slope = 0.0314¬±0.014) as well as indirect bottom-up effects of lagged spring SST (on razorbill breeding success: p = 0.01, slope = -0.144¬±0.05). Negative relationships between breeding success and population growth rate of razorbills and common guillemots may be explained by interactions between mid-trophic level fish. Our findings show that the impacts of climate change on the Celtic Sea ecosystem is not as marked as in nearby regions (e.g. the North Sea), emphasizing the need for more research at regional scales. ¬© 2012 Lauria et al.","Article","Scopus",0.615410297710321,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,65,NA

Surprisingly, of the seven tags that successfully transmitted archived data, six were ingested by warm-gutted predators, as observed by a sudden increase in water temperature. Gut temperatures were in the range of 20 to 25¬∞C-too cold for marine mammals but within the range of endothermic fish. In order to identify the eel predators, we compared their vertical migratory behavior with those of satellite-tagged porbeagle shark and bluefin tuna, the only endothermic fishes occurring non-marginally in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. We accurately distinguished between tuna and shark by using the behavioral criteria generated by comparing the diving behavior of these two species with those of our unknown predators. Depth profile characteristics of most eel predators more closely resembled those of sharks than those of tuna. During the first days following tagging, all eels remained in surface waters and did not exhibit diel vertical migrations. Three eels were eaten at this time. Two eels exhibited inverse diel vertical migrations (at surface during the day) during several days prior to predation. Four eels were eaten during daytime, whereas the two night-predation events occurred at full moon. Although tagging itself may contribute to increasing the eel's susceptibility to predation, we discuss evidence suggesting that predation of silver-stage American eels by porbeagle sharks may represent a significant source of mortality inside the Gulf of St. Lawrence and raises the possibility that eels may represent a reliable, predictable food resource for porbeagle sharks. ¬© 2012 B√©guer-Pon et al.","Article","Scopus",0.609809339892752,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,100,NA

Results show that the abundance of C. sinicus was significantly higher in 2006 and 2007 than that in 1959 which may be correlate with both the bottom-up and top-down effects; the distribution pattern in the spring of the two years was similar, on the contrary, However, the hydrographical characteristics were conspicuously different between the two springs, for example, the coverage and strength of the Qingdao Cold Water Mass, the penetrating pathway of Yellow Sea Warm Current and the distribution pattern of the oceanic front. Correspondingly, the distribution pattern of C. sinicus in the summer of the two years showed great differences. Thus, it is suggested that the distribution pattern of C. sinicus in summer might be influenced by the hydrographical characteristics in spring, which probably further affects the present of some economically important fishes which fed on C. sinicus. ¬© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.567731759783235,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,63,NA

Another large female was opportunistically tagged in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Data from 1,563 total tracking days and 1,142,598 combined depth and temperature readings were obtained.

Hydroacoustic surveys indicated that B. glaciale and the deep-scattering layer are widely distributed throughout the region with limited evidence of patchiness, with an average abundance of 6 fish m-2 and biomass of 9.3gm-2. There was clear evidence of diurnal variations in feeding activity that was achieved through vertical migration from several hundred meters depths to the surface layer. B. glaciale fed principally on calanoid copepods, with prey size dependent on the length of the fish but the relative variability in prey size was independent of predator length. Average rations were generally less than 1% of body weight per day, and the patterns of diurnal vertical migration by myctophids suggest that individuals fed once every two days rather than daily. The estimated mortality caused by B. glaciale on the calanoid populations, which considers most sources of uncertainty, ranged from 0.002 to 1.8% d-1, with the mid-point of these estimates being ~0.15% d-1, which is well below the estimated mortality rates of 10-20% d-1 based on vertical life tables. From observations from this and other ecosystems, understanding and contrasting the drivers of population dynamics and productivity of calanoid copepods in different deep basins of the North Atlantic will likely require a more comprehensive characterization of the plankton and pelagic and oceanic fish faunas of the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones and their trophic relationships and interactions. ¬© 2013.","Article","Scopus",0.633835871774526,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,104,NA

The lagoon and channel areas had distinct fish assemblage structures. Several abundant species (e.g. Atherinella brasiliensis, Eugerres brasilianus, Geophagus brasiliensis, Achirus lineatus and Centropomus parallelus) were of a smaller size in the lagoon compared with the estuarine channel and probably use the lagoon as nursery grounds. Moreover, some species (e.g. Anchoa tricolor, Anchoa januaria, Gobionellus oceanicus and Poecilia vivipara) were abundant and occurred only in the lagoon, whereas others (e.g. Trinectes paulistanus, Ctenogobius shufeldti and Citharichthys arenaceus) reached their highest abundance in the lagoon and were rarely found in the estuarine channel.

Despite its size, few studies have described the distribution of pelagic fishes along the MAR. Recent evidence from MAR-ECO, a Census of Marine Life field project, reported increased abundance and biomass of deep-pelagic fishes below 1000m on the ridge, which stands in stark contrast to the traditional view that abundance and biomass decline exponentially with increasing depth in 'typical' open ocean ecosystems. Among the midwater fishes sampled during the MAR-ECO campaign, Bathylagus euryops (Argentiniformes: Microstomatidae) was the biomass-dominant pelagic species and ranked third in total abundance. In this paper, we characterize the distribution of B. euryops in relation to physical and biological variables along the MAR. Average catch of B. euryops over the MAR varied between 0.68 individuals/100,000m3¬±0.70 individuals at the Azorean Zone and 5.82 individuals/100,000m3¬±2.08 individuals at the Reykjanes Ridge. Generalized linear models applied to B. euryops catch data indicated that ridge section, depth zone, and prey abundance were important explanatory variables in structuring the distribution along the MAR. Analyses of vertical distribution patterns, relative to time of day and fish size, showed that larger fish were found deeper in the water column, likely due to an ontogenetic migration to depth. Mean fish size increased from 58.9mm standard length in the epipelagic zone and continually increased to 155.7mm standard length between 2300-3000m. Due to the high abundance and biomass observed along the MAR, B. euryops appears to be an important species in the oceanic food web of the North Atlantic Ocean. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.707253025994788,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,123,NA

Another effect of the upwelling is that temperate warm water species that normally occur in deeper waters and offshore species are taken along with the current resulting in shifts in local zooplankton species composition and changes to the ecological structure and function of this group. This research was based on data from three oceanographic surveys in the offshore waters of the Yushan fishery during April, July and November of 2010. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, the primary aim of this paper was to examine the influence of upwelling on the ecological distribution of zooplankton in this area. A total of 64 species mainly dominated by copepods were identified which were classified into five major ecological groups including coastal temperate warm water species, offshore temperate warm water species, coastal subtropical water species, offshore subtropical water species and oceanic tropical water species. Coastal temperate warm water species were prevalent in spring, coastal subtropical water species and offshore subtropical water species in summer and subtropical species in autumn. The higher abundance of temperate warm water species such as Calanus sinicus, Paracalanus parvus and Sagitta nagae in summer relative to spring and autumn was primarily caused by the upwelling that transported these species from the bottom to the surface. This phenomenon is very different from the hydrodynamic processes that occur in the East and Yellow China Seas. Additionally, coastal species were the dominant zooplankton group, which means that coastal currents have the greatest influence on species composition in these waters. According to the research of Hu Dun-Xin, the main power of the Zhejiang coastal upwelling comes from the upward movement of subsurface water from the Kuroshio current as it follows the continental shelf. The subsurface water of the Kuroshio current runs southeast to northwest and shifts to the east forming an upwelling when it is blocked by the Chen Island Archipelago. With low temperatures and high salinities, the subsurface water of the Kuroshio current carries temperate warm water species and offshore species. As a result, during periods of coastal upwelling temperate warm water species are carried to the surface from the bottom, producing the unusual phenomenon were the number of temperate warm water species in summer is higher than in spring and autumn, contrary to the situation in other areas that have similar climatic conditions. In terms of abundance, coastal temperate warm water species accounted for 98.79% of the zooplankton in April and also a large proportion in July, whereas coastal subtropical water species were the dominant zooplankton group in October. Upwelling leading to the appearance of large numbers of temperate warm water species is a key factor affecting the ecological composition of zooplankton in these waters. The dominance of coastal species that are influenced by Jiao-Jiang runoff was a prime ecological characteristic of zooplankton in this region.","Article","Scopus",0.533384078909373,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,179,NA

Climate and harvest affect tuna stocks, populations of non-target, dependent species and the ecosystem. To provide relevant advice we need an improved understanding of oceanic ecosystems and better data to parameterise the models that forecast the impacts of climate change. Currently ocean-wide data collection in the Pacific Ocean is primarily restricted to oceanographic data. However, the fisheries observer programs that operate in the region offer an opportunity to collect the additional information on the mid and upper trophic levels of the ecosystem that is necessary to complement this physical data, including time-series of distribution, abundance, size, composition and biological information on target and non-target species and mid trophic level organisms. These observer programs are in their infancy, with limited temporal and spatial distribution but recent international and national policy decisions have been made to expand their coverage. We identify a number of actions to initiate this monitoring including: consolidating collaborations to ensure the use of best quality data; developing consistency between sub-regional observer programmes to ensure that they meet the objectives of ecosystem monitoring; interrogating of existing time series to determine the most appropriate spatial template for monitoring; and exploring existing ecosystem models to identify suitable indicators of ecosystem status and change. The information obtained should improve capacity to develop fisheries management policies that are resilient and can be adapted to climate change. ¬© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus",0.566606095331476,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,345,NA

The major modes of this climate variability include the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) also referred to as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Other modes of climate variability include the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO). ENSO events are the principle source of interannual global climate variability, centred in the ocean-atmosphere circulations of the tropical Pacific Ocean and operating on seasonal to interannual time scales. ENSO and the strength of its climate teleconnections are modulated on decadal timescales by the IPO. The time scale of the IOD is seasonal to interannual. The SAM in the mid to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere operates in the range of 50-60 days. A prominent teleconnection pattern throughout the year in the Northern Hemisphere is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) which modulates the strength of the westerlies across the North Atlantic in winter, has an impact on the catches of marine fisheries. ENSO events affect the distribution of tuna species in the equatorial Pacific, especially skipjack tuna as well as the abundance and distribution of fish along the western coasts of the Americas. The IOD modulates the distribution of tuna populations and catches in the Indian Ocean, whilst the NAO affects cod stocks heavily exploited in the Atlantic Ocean. The SAM, and its effects on sea surface temperatures influence krill biomass and fisheries catches in the Southern Ocean. The response of oceanic fish stocks to these sources of climatic variability can be used as a guide to the likely effects of climate change on these valuable resources. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus",0.67403298021452,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,127,NA

The benefit to rearing off Kodiak Island vs. in the Semidi Islands vicinity increased among years with body length because larger fish consumed more euphausiids, and euphausiids were apparently more available in the Kodiak region. This explains previously observed regional variation in body size, condition, and growth rates within the GOA population and points to potential importance of the Kodiak region as a walleye pollock nursery. During September 2005, 2007, and 2009, Kodiak midwater was cooler and saltier than Semidi midwater, presumably due to a relatively narrow continental shelf and greater oceanic influence. Zooplankton composition differed between regions with the greater euphausiid population density off Kodiak being most relevant to walleye pollock food habits. As found historically, age-0 walleye pollock abundance was lower in the Kodiak region than in the Semidi region. However, the Kodiak fish were larger in both length and length-specific weight, and had fuller stomachs than Semidi fish, although differences were not significant in all years. Regional differences were most pronounced during the relatively warm year 2005 when fish were particularly large. Fish dietary mass was dominated by euphausiids, especially for Kodiak fish ‚â•55 mm standard length. Bioenergetics model output suggests that the greater euphausiid dietary proportion translates into faster growth of the Kodiak fish. The midwater habitat off Kodiak Island might therefore support above-average production of recruits to the GOA adult population due to better condition and likely survival of walleye pollock juveniles, especially when fish are large and thus able to more fully exploit euphausiids, but confirmation of above-average production of recruits depends on our ability to determine spatial structure in juvenile-adult population connectivity. ¬© 2013 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2013.","Article","Scopus",0.725577872155603,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,137,NA

Monthly sampling campaigns at ten stations in the BPNS in 2009 and 2010 yielded a total of 137 mesozooplankton taxa (46 holoplanktonic, 50 meroplanktonic and 41 tychoplanktonic), of which nine species had never been reported in the area. Smaller neritic copepods, especially Temora longicornis and Acartia clausi, were present in all samples and dominated zooplankton densities (66%), together with the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica (10%). They were joined by high numbers of meroplanktonic echinoderm larvae (9%) in spring and summer. Based on diversity alone, the mesozooplankton could be typified as one neritic zooplankton community, due to the ubiquitous presence in time and space of the dominant copepods. Yet, these neritic species were often joined by low numbers of oceanic species that are occasionally imported with the inflow of Atlantic oceanic water in the BPNS. Based on a combination of abundance and diversity, our results indicate distinct seasonal and spatial distribution patterns in the mesozooplankton. Months with highest average densities were May, June and July, lowest densities were noted in December and January. Only limited long-term zooplankton data are available for the BPNS from the Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys or the long-term monitoring stations in the vicinity of our research area. However, our data suggest that nowadays zooplankton species appear earlier in the BPNS, comparable with other areas in the North Sea. Densities varied between 150 and 15,000ind.m-3, and averaged highest at midshore stations, then nearshore and offshore. This is partially comparable with the spatial patterns recorded for other ecosystem components, such as demersal fish, epibenthos and macrobenthos, of which densities peak in a stretch almost parallel to but some miles away from the coastline in the BPNS. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.677397393168407,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,NA

Both techniques show a diet that is closely linked to prey availability and abundance, with some specialisation occurring for Myctophid fishes which dominated the diet numerically and taxonomically. Mean monthly differences in total lipid content of the digestive gland correlated with satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll, illustrating that the diet is closely linked to short-term (monthly) temporal changes of primary productivity. Multidimensional scaling analysis of prey and T. filippovae signature fatty acid profiles revealed apparent intra-specific predator to prey relationships. Significant season versus site interactions for various lipid classes and fatty acids were observed, further indicating that temporal dietary shifts are related to site-specific oceanography and ecosystem structure (prey composition and/or productivity). Comparing fatty acid profiles with other Southern Ocean squid species, interspecific similarities and differences in diet composition were evident. Results demonstrate that signature lipid profiling of squid can be used as a complimentary or even alternative and cost effective tool to examine key changes in prey-community structure and ecosystem productivity.

Differential habitat utilization by species, geomorphological features and oceanographic patterns are discussed as potential causes of patterns observed.

A semi-quantitative ERA was conducted for the Marshall Islands longline bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) fishery. The study used information from analyses of observer data, surveys of captains and crew and inventories of gear and equipment. Relative risks were evaluated through a consideration of phylogenetic uniqueness, risk of population extirpation, risk of species extinction and importance in ecosystem regulation. The fishery presents a highest relative risk to leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), green (Chelonia mydas) and olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtle Regional Management Units that overlap with the fishery, in that order. The next highest relative risk is to affected stocks of oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), blue (Prionace glauca), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks, in that sequence. Seabird bycatch is likely not problematic. There was inadequate information to assess risks to cetacean populations. Risks to stocks of market and non-market species of marine fishes with r-selected life history characteristics were not assessed. This is because estimates of critical threshold levels of local and absolute abundance and current biomass are not known for many of these stocks. Several best practice gear technology methods to mitigate problematic catch of vulnerable species groups are currently employed: monofilament leaders, whole fish for bait, single-hooking fish bait, no lightsticks, and no fishing at shallow submerged features. Setting terminal tackle below 100. m and carrying and using best practice handling and release equipment were methods identified to reduce fishing mortality and injury of vulnerable species. More information is needed to determine if weaker hooks should be prescribed to mitigate cetacean bycatch. The large benefit to sea turtles of replacing remaining J-shaped hooks with circle hooks might outweigh a possible small increase in elasmobranch catch rates. The consumption of 2024. l of fuel per tonne of landed catch, which is within the range of available estimated rates from similar fisheries, could be reduced, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, through more frequent maintenance and upgrading vessel equipment and materials. Observer data quality may be adequate to support a quantitative Level 3 ERA to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on standardized catch rates and to estimate population-level effects from fishing mortality. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.693328336847108,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,221,NA

Traditional laboratory and mesocosm experiments last days to weeks and thus only give a limited picture of thermal adaptation, whereas ocean warming occurring over decades allows the potential for selection of new strains better adapted to warmer conditions. Evidence for adaptation in natural systems is equivocal. We used a 50-year time series comprising of 117 056 samples in the NE Atlantic, to quantify the abundance and distribution of two particularly important and abundant members of the ocean plankton (copepods of the genus Calanus) that play a key trophic role for fisheries. Abundance of C. finmarchicus, a cold-water species, and C. helgolandicus, a warm-water species, were negatively and positively related to sea surface temperature (SST) respectively. However, the abundance vs. SST relationships for neither species changed over time in a manner consistent with thermal adaptation. Accompanying the lack of evidence for thermal adaptation there has been an unabated range contraction for C. finmarchicus and range expansion for C. helgolandicus. Our evidence suggests that thermal adaptation has not mitigated the impacts of ocean warming for dramatic range changes of these key species and points to continued dramatic climate induced changes in the biology of the oceans. ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.470876449880371,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,125,NA

To develop the MOCI, we selected, compiled, and synthesized 14 well-known atmospheric and oceanographic indicators of large-scale and regional processes (transport and upwelling), as well as local atmospheric and oceanic response variables such as wind stress, sea surface temperature, and salinity. We derived seasonally-stratified MOCI using principal component analysis.

The seasonal MOCI related well to subarctic copepod biomass and seabird productivity, but poorly to chlorophyll-a concentration and krill abundance. Our results support a hypothesis of enhanced sub-arctic influence (transport from the north) and upwelling intensification in north-central California over the past two decades. Such environmental conditions may favor population growth for species with sub-arctic zoogeographic affinities within the central-northern California Current coastal ecosystem. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.509766713117634,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,258,NA

Many aspects of the migratory ecology of this species are poorly described, including the scope of individual variability in movements across estuarine gradients. Population abundances have declined precipitously in recent decades leading to its classification as ""Vulnerable"" under the IUCN, lethal methods of identifying migration patterns such as otolith analyses are not feasible. We therefore examined the non-lethal alternative method of combined stable isotope and trace element analysis in subsamples of scales removed from living fish collected in subtropical areas of the western Gulf of Mexico and Puerto Rico. We found significant differences in chemical signatures from edges of scales collected from separate geographic regions. Within scales, we observed consistent enrichments in Œ¥15N values indicating ontogenetic trophic shifts and individual variation in the remaining proxies (Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, and Œ¥13C) that suggested differential patterns of movement between marine and fresh waters. Notably, values of Œ¥13C were positively related to Sr:Ca in all geographic regions, suggesting that scale Œ¥13C values primarily reflected movement across salinity gradients rather than fractionation associated with trophic increases. Multi-proxy chemical analysis of Atlantic tarpon scales therefore provides a non-lethal alternative to otolith geochemistry for identifying individual movement and trophic patterns of this highly mobile species. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.410009892706808,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,403,NA

The models are relatively simple, but they are characterized by major peculiarities of the natural communities. The fouling communities are model objects to study the appearance and development of biological systems, invasions of hydrobionts, application of the bioindicator species, etc. The presented models take into account the most important interactions of the main fouling species (Lepadidae crustaceans are the dominating species) in typical regions and depths for such invasion and at the favorable abiotic environmental factors that are comparatively stable. The interaction between the meroplanktonic larvae of Lepas and Conchoderma (Lepadidae), represented by C. virgatum, L. anatifera, L. anserifera, and L. hillii, and the most widespread predators (crabs Planes minutus and the fish species) is modeled as the system of differential equations. In particular, the model covers the dynamics of colonies of fouling species, the ""attractiveness"" of these colonies to other fouling species, and the feeding rates of the predators consuming both the fouling species and associated fauna. The computing experiments showed that the population density changed markedly in the different age groups of Lepas and Conchoderma. The predator stress on Conchoderma was significantly higher than that on Lepas. The ""attractiveness"" of the biofouling organisms to cypris larvae and predators keeping near the substrate has a major impact on their density dynamics. The models showed that the crabs and especially fish had the strongest effect on the biocenoses of oceanic biofouling communities, limiting the population density of fouling species. When the presence of fish was excluded from the model, the abundance of Conchoderma increased rapidly and became similar to the abundance of Lepas. The model showed that the most important factors limiting the oceanic fouling are the settling rate of Lepadidae larvae to the substrate, ""attractiveness"" of the fouling organisms to predators, and the consumption of these animals by the predators. The models are in good correlation with experimental data of oceanographic buoy areas. Usage of the mathematical models for forecasting and assessing the invasion rates of biofouling organisms and the further development of their biocenoses is very promising and cannot be totally replaced by the other research methods. Analogous models can be developed for other communities and marine environments, for example, for the forecasting of hydrobiont invasions into the marine and freshwater bodies of Russia. ¬© 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.519063589106299,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,155,NA

It is a nerito-oceanic species inhabiting mostly slope waters from surface down to >1000 m but also occurs on the shelf and in the open ocean. There are at least three populations - a migratory Northeast Atlantic population that reproduces at the mid-Atlantic ridge and forages as far north as off Iceland and Norway, and resident Mediterranean and Northwest African populations. Spawning takes place on the continental slope and around seamounts with peak in cold season. It is intermittent, females produce from 200,000 to >2,000,000 eggs of 1.1-1.2 mm. Juveniles disperse in surface waters carrying out diel vertical migrations. As they grow and mature, the animals switch to demersal life style gradually moving deeper down the slope. The species has an annual life cycle with some animals in northern waters living slightly more than one year. It is an omnivorous predator and its feeding spectra mirror the micro- and mesonekton composition, diversity, and abundance in pelagic waters. Generally the squid feeds on fishes, crustaceans and cephalopods in decreasing order of importance. T.sagittatus is preyed upon by a variety of cetaceans, seabirds, elasmobranchs and teleost fishes, the most important predators are swordfish and pilot whales. It is an important paratenic host for anisakid nematodes with intensity of infestation reaching 20-75%. T. sagittatus is taken as bycatch throughout the species range with no major fishing areas existing nowadays, but it has occasionally occurred in Norway and off Northwest Africa in sufficiently large numbers to support a target fishery yielding 10,000-20,000 t per annum. Stocks were not assessed though its annual consumption by predators might be roughly estimated as 2-3 million t. ¬© 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

While several studies demonstrate that distribution patterns are species specific, several also show that assemblages of species can be defined and such assemblages are associated with circulatory features and water mass distributions. In many subareas, sampling has, however, been scattered, restricted to shallow areas or soft substrata, and results from different studies tend to be difficult to compare quantitatively because of sampler differences. Particularly, few studies have been conducted on isolated deep oceanic seamounts and in Arctic deep-water areas. Time series of data are very few and most series are short. Recent studies of population structure of widely distributed demersal species show less than expected present connectivity and considerable spatial genetic heterogeneity and complexity for some species. In other species, genetic homogeneity across wide ranges was discovered. Mechanisms underlying the observed patterns have been proposed, but to test emerging hypotheses more species should be investigated across their entire distribution ranges. Studies of population biology reveal greater diversity in life-history strategies than often assumed, even between co-occurring species of the same family. Some slope and ridge-associated species are rather short-lived, others very long-lived, and growth patterns also show considerable variation. Recent comparative studies suggest variation in life-history strategies along a continuum correlated with depth, ranging from shelf waters to the deep sea where comparatively more species have extended lifetimes, and slow rates of growth and reproduction. Reproductive biology remains too poorly known for most deep-water species, and temporal variation in recruitment has only been studied for few deep-water species. A time series of roundnose grenadier Coryphaenoides rupestris recruitment spanning three decades of fisheries-independent data suggests that abundant year classes occur rarely and may influence size structure and abundance even for this long-lived species. ¬© 2013 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Review","Scopus",0.570322409068207,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,91,NA

Special attention was given to helminth infracommunities and effect of host sex on its structure. A total of 21 taxa including 5 ecto-parasites and 16 endo-parasites were identified. The number of ecto and endo-parasite species per individual host ranged from 1 to 3 and 3 to 10, respectively, while the mean numbers of parasite specimens per individual host were 4.7 and 1309.7, respectively. The rich abundance of infection suggests a rich concentration of helminth intermediate/paratenic hosts in the coastal waters of Terra Nova Bay. Chionodraco hamatus serves as a definitive host for 10 helminth taxa, while it acts as an intermediate/paratenic host for 6 helminth taxa. Larvae of 6 helminth taxa for which C. hamatus serves as intermediate/paratenic host represented 98.7% of all specimens found. Of these, the tetraphyllidean and diphyllobothridean cestodes and the nematode Contracaecum osculatum s.l. were the most prevalent and abundant. 'Larval' infracommunities had significantly higher species richness, total abundance and diversity than 'adult' infracommunities, suggesting the important role of C. hamatus in supporting the life cycles of those parasites in the study area as a paratenic/intermediate host. Significant differences in the pattern of helminth infracommunities of larval forms between male and female fish were found. These differences could be caused by physiological, and most probably by behavioral differences between sexes suggesting that sex is an important factor influencing parasite burden in C. hamatus during reproductive season. ¬© 2014 Santoro et al.","Article","Scopus",0.400380290284831,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,160,NA

Understanding the role of spatial patterns of compounded disturbances in determining invader establishment and spread can enhance the effectiveness of control strategies. Using the framework of 1/f noise models and by means of a field experiment, we evaluated how the simultaneous exposure of Posidonia oceanica meadows to disturbances (namely overgrazing and rhizome uprooting from vessel anchoring) differing in spatial extent and degree of autocorrelation influenced the establishment and spread of the invasive seaweed, Caulerpa racemosa. Effects on invader establishment and spread were evaluated by means of mixed-effect models relating spatial patterns of disturbance and presence or abundance of C. racemosa, quantified through spectral coefficients. The spatial distribution of C. racemosa mimicked that of overgrazing, both variables showing positive autocorrelation. Yet, C. racemosa was unable to disperse from disturbed patches into adjacent intact areas. The uprooting of rhizomes did not promote the establishment of C. racemosa, but magnified (‚âÉ18 times) the proliferation of the exotic seaweed when coupled with overgrazing. Synthesis and applications. Fish overgrazing of Posidonia oceanica lessens the resistance of seagrass beds to invasion by Caulerpa racemosa. Thus, conservation strategies (e.g. marine protected areas) aiming to restore over-exploited fish populations may indirectly enhance the susceptibility of P. oceanica meadows to invasion by C. racemosa. Uprooting of P. oceanica rhizomes, such as that caused by boat anchoring, exacerbates the effects of overgrazing. The anchoring of recreational vessels should be, therefore, strictly regulated in areas characterized by intense grazing of P. oceanica leaves. More generally, our study shows that native herbivores may indirectly facilitate invasion by reducing the resistance of resident plant communities and suggests that sounded strategies for controlling the establishment and spread of invasive species require taking into account the interactive effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

Understanding post-release mortality and behavior of sharks is required to ensure the adequacy of management strategies focusing on the release of live animals. Also, such information is crucial for addressing shark attack mitigation strategies focusing on mechanisms other than shark culling. This study used a combination of conventional tags with acoustic and satellite transmitters to assess both post-release survival and behavior and exposure to fisheries in tiger sharks caught in a longline survey off Recife, Brazil. Although none of the sharks experienced post-release mortality, one episode of presumable natural mortality occurred after 45days at-liberty. The exposure of tiger sharks to fishing pressure in this region seems to be high since at least 23% of the tiger sharks tagged and released off Recife were caught by coastal and oceanic fisheries, most (83%) of which after only 69 (¬±42)days at-liberty. Upon release, all satellite-tracked sharks moved offshore to deeper waters, usually in the oceanic realm, within an average of 17.72 (¬±10.99)h, corresponding to a minimum cross-shelf swimming speed of 0.40 (¬±0.22)m¬∑s-1. The archival data of 3 recovered satellite tags depicted post-release behaviors with exceptional detail, with all such sharks exhibiting a yo-yo movement pattern with increasing depths until the shelf break was reached. Some sharks consistently spent a period of 12 (¬±2)days in deep-diving before returning to shallower waters, presumably from the continental shelf, which could correspond to a species-specific behavioral response to hooking stress. Tagged sharks did not return to the area where they were caught and it would be unlikely that they would return before several months because most of them traveled through great distances to northward latitudes. Altogether, tiger sharks caught alive in longline gear seem to experience negligible post-release mortality if they are adequately released, thus an eventual mandatory release of live animals could be effective to improve the conservation of the species. Also, recently-released tiger sharks should not be expected to further interact with the same fishing gear that caught them for some time, or to further pose any threat to beach users in Recife, where an abnormally high shark attack rate is verified since 1992. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.629028328554688,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,308,NA

New proliferations of jellyfish may be occurring in the Mediterranean Sea, possibly in response to the cumulative effects of some of these anthropogenic impacts. In the Mediterranean Sea, many of these proliferation events are due to Pelagia noctiluca, an oceanic scyphozoan that has become very abundant along the coasts. Pelagia noctiluca is usually considered to be the most important jellyfish species in the Mediterranean Sea due to its widespread distribution, abundance, and ecological role and also because of its negative interaction with humans. Climatic conditions that favor enhanced reproduction by P. noctiluca and probably also determine optimal conditions for the formation of blooms are characterized by mild winters, low rainfall, high temperature, and high-atmospheric pressure. The Medusa Project in Catalonia aims to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the jellyfish populations in the NW Mediterranean Sea by undertaking daily sampling during summer (May to September) of 243 beaches, covering more than 500 km of coast. Data on beach strandings along the Spanish Catalan coast revealed that jellyfish occur in greatest concentrations along the northern Catalan coast and on beaches located close to marine canyons. The arrival of P. noctiluca to the coast depends firstly on the offshore production of jellyfish. Oceanographic structures like fronts, which enhance and maintain high levels of biological production and provide ideal conditions for feeding, growth, and reproduction of the jellyfish are present in the NW Mediterranean. The weakening of the front results in large numbers of P. noctiluca being driven into the coast by southeast winds. In the NW Mediterranean Sea P. noctiluca exert top-down control over a variety of prey including fish eggs and possibly the invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. P. noctiluca is also responsible for the majority of the stings incurred by bathers along the Catalan coast. Finally, we recommend that similar sampling programs should be done elsewhere to better understand changes in the distribution, abundance, and blooming patterns of dangerous jellyfish species. ¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

This is a 1 √ó 2 m frame fitted with a 0.505 mm mesh net, towed in a yo-yo fashion between the surface and 10 m. Sampling effectiveness of the three gears was compared by examining the abundance and length of larvae of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and seven co-occurring pelagic taxa (Auxis spp., Euthynnus alleteratus, Coryphaena spp., Katsuwonus pelamis, other Thunnus spp., family Istiophoridae, and Xiphias gladius) and vertical distributions of scombrid taxa were examined using MOCNESS samples. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) of net type and time of sampling (day/night) indicated that net type was a significant factor in assessing abundance and length for all taxa. Highest abundances for seven of eight taxa were in S-10 samples, and MOCNESS samples confirm highest scombrid abundance between the surface and 20 m. Our results show sampling effectiveness strongly depends on the depth fished by the net and that the S-10 net was more effective than standard SEAMAP bongo and neuston nets. Thus, future sampling with the S-10 net may improve the annual index of larval abundance for the western population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, traditionally based on abundance from bongo samples. ¬© 2014, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.","Article","Scopus",0.618347060724535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,325,NA

Microgobius carri (11%) was represented in all LS classes and was resident in the estuary for spawning, remaining there throughout their life cycle. The other species were considered rare due to their low densities and could not be classified in any guild. ¬© 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Article","Scopus",0.703029908238681,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,305,NA

The objective has been, and remains, the maintenance of populations of particular species at levels thought desirable to society. This approach has been in some respects very successful (e.g., for many highly prized game fish such as freshwater trout, largemouth bass, and striped bass). However, although one can find some examples where a region's fisheries have managed to thrive under formal management, these successful fisheries are the exceptions. In particular, many fisheries that at one time or another within the last fifty years produced the major proportions of the global fish catch have passed into commercial or virtual biological oblivion. For example, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Report on the Status of United States Fisheries found in 1997 that 86 species are listed as ""overfished,"" 183 species are listed as ""not overfished,"" and 10 species are considered to be approaching an overfished condition based on the criteria specified in the Magnuson- Stevens Act. The status relative to overfishing is unknown for 448 additional species. (NMFS 1997). The most recent statistical analyses of ""Status of Fisheries of the United States,"" compiled up to the year 2000, found that 14 of the 18 most important commercial species for the United States are considered commercially extinct, or in danger of that (NMFS 2001). Although there is no question that global fisheries are in serious trouble, the degree to which specific fisheries are in decline or danger is a complex and even controversial issue. Myers and Worm (2003) of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia write, ""Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80% within 15 years of exploitation"" and, referring to such fishes as cod, halibut, tuna, swordfish, and marlin, ""large predatory fish biomass is today only about 10% of preindustrial levels,"" that is, since the beginning of large-scale high seas fishing in the 1950s. They find that fishing is now so ""efficient"" that the population of any species can be caught within fifteen years, some populations disappearing within just a few years. Similar discouraging trends can be found in Pikitch et al. (1997) and Pauley et al. (2002). Fortunately, when these findings have been readdressed by researchers and managers more directly involved, they concluded that the results were not as dire as Meyers and Worm (and others) suggest. Over a year after the fact, and after several efforts to get their comments published, Nature finally published ""Comments on Myers & Worm,"" by John Hampton of the Oceanic Fisheries Programme at the Secretariat of the Pacific Community; John R. Sibert of the Pelagic Research Program, University of Hawaii; Pierre Kleiber, of the U.S. Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center; and Shelton J. Harley of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. These experts, who specialize in tuna fisheries, take apart almost every methodological aspect of the Myers and Worm article. ""Fundamentally flawed,"" ""incorrect,"" ""too restrictive"" are some of the epithets they use. They conclude that ""Myers and Worm do the fisheries community a disservice by applying a simplistic analysis to available data, which exaggerates declines in abundance and implies rebuilding benchmarks."" It would probably have paid for Meyers and Worm to have read both of the available Academic Press volumes on tunas by Sharp and Dizon (1978) and Block and Stevens (2001), as well as basic early 1970s Japanese research by S. Saito, S. Sasaki, Hanamoto, and others (referenced in both volumes) that changed the world of longline fishing after they employed vertical longline techniques to find out where, which, and what sizes of tunas were most abundant and thus most vulnerable to longline gear. The conclusion of all this pointed discussion within the scientific community is that although yes, in agreement with Myers and Worm, there is extreme concern about the commercial disappearance, or the potential disappearance, of many of our traditional fish stocks in light of our tremendous potential for industrialized overfishing, good science must be brought to know, monitor, and model fish populations and the functioning of fisheries. In addition, there has been a great deal of additional concern about the destruction of the ecosystems within which these fish live, including destruction by fishing itself, for example by the effects of large bottom trawler nets. Aquaculture, which was once believed to be the sustainable solution to feed a growing world's population, can also have disastrous impact on ocean ecosystems (Naylor et al. 2003). Fortunately, there has been an epidemic of introspection among fisheries scientists since the general recognition during the 1990s that fisheries management actions have been ineffective, if not actually destructive (Garcia and Grainger 1997; Sharp 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997; Hancock et al. 1997). A concise summary of these papers, the contents of the meetings at which they were given, and the literature they summarize is this: conventional fisheries science as implemented in resource management has failed abysmally. Why? Again, the consensus is that relatively few fisheries scientists appear willing or able to implement their commonsensical and often comprehensive knowledge of particular fisheries. Instead they are trained, and in some cases even mandated by their superiors, to apply conventionalized but poorly performing population assessment tools that they learned in graduate school and that have dominated fisheries education and management, rather than on the comprehensive systems approach that is needed. Therefore, little of what is known about any fish species or their related ecosystem or the fisherman's social system, or about the impact of continuing industrialization of the fishing fleet, is actually applied within the management realm until a crisis occurs. In addition, these scientists often defer to economic models that they may not understand well. The reasons for these failures include the lack of systems training for fisheries managers and the overwhelming power of the political and economic power aligned against the application of the fisheries manager's biological conclusions (Ludwig, Hilborn, and Walters 1993). Within this regime there has been little attention paid to the degree to which the economic framework within which fisheries science and management must operate is adequate or even appropriate for that task. This chapter brings together a biologist with a comprehensive understanding of the world's major fisheries (Sharp) with an ecologist who over the last three decades has attempted to understand economics (Hall) in an attempt to determine to what degree the failures (and the successes) of fisheries are a function of the increasing intrusion of market economics into fisheries. In a sense, this is a nearimpossible job because there are so many ways that fisheries can fail, so that teasing out the effects of markets can be very difficult. On the other hand, it may be useful to determine from those cases that appear to be clear-cut what if any principles might apply. We do not know the degree to which the specific case studies we provide here are broadly applicable, but we think they are. We acknowledge that our conclusions are based on some of the world's large industrial fisheries and not the artisanal fisheries that dominate some regions like West Africa and may be, on balance, more likely to be sustainable (Berkes et al. 2001). ¬© 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

Despite being endowed with a highly lethal venom, a proteomic analysis of its toxin composition was unavailable. The venoms of specimens collected in Golfo de Papagayo and Golfo Dulce (Costa Rica), where two distinctive color morphs occur, were chromatographically compared. The latter inhabits a fjord-like gulf where the transit of oceanic sea snakes into and from the basin is restricted, thus possibly affecting gene flow. RP-HPLC evidenced a conserved venom protein profile in both populations, despite their divergent color phenotypes. Following a trend observed in other sea snakes, P. platura venom is relatively simple, being composed of proteins of the three-finger toxin (3FTx), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), 5'-nucleotidase, and metalloproteinase families. The first three groups represent 49.9%, 32.9%, and 9.1% of total venom protein, respectively. The most abundant component (~26%) is pelamitoxin (P62388), a short-chain 3FTx, followed by a major basic PLA2 (~20%) and a group of three isoforms of CRISPs (~9%). Whereas isolated pelamitoxin was highly lethal to mice, neither the PLA2 nor the CRISP fraction caused death. However, the PLA2 rapidly increased plasma creatine kinase activity after intramuscular injection, indicating its myotoxic action. Differing from myotoxic PLA2s of viperids, this PLA2 was not cytolytic to murine myogenic cells in vitro, suggesting possible differences in its mechanism of action. The median lethal dose (LD50) estimates for P. platura crude venom in mice and in three species of fishes did not differ significantly. The sea snake antivenom manufactured by CSL Ltd. (Australia), which uses Enhydrina schistosa as immunogen, cross-recognized the three major components of P. platura venom and, accordingly, neutralized the lethal activity of crude venom and pelamitoxin, therefore being of potential usefulness in the treatment of envenomations by this species. Biological significance: Integrative analyses of animal venoms that combine the power of proteomics (venomics) with the characterization of their functional and immunological properties are significantly expanding knowledge on these remarkable bioweapons, both from a basic and a medical perspective. Costa Rica harbors a unique population of the yellow-bellied sea snake, Pelamis platura, that is restricted to a fjord-like gulf (Golfo Dulce). This population differs markedly from oceanic populations found elsewhere along the Pacific coast of this country, by presenting a patternless bright yellow coloration, instead of the typical bicolored or tricolored pattern of this species. It has been suggested that the dominance of this yellow-morph in Golfo Dulce might reflect gene flow restrictions, caused by the oceanographic conditions at this location. The present study demonstrates that the remarkable phenotypic variation between the two color morphs inhabiting Golfo Dulce and Golfo de Papagayo, respectively, is not associated with differences in the expression of venom components, as shown by their conserved RP-HPLC profiles. Proteomic analysis revealed the relatively simple toxin composition of P. platura venom, which contains three predominant types of proteins: three-finger toxins (protein abundance: 49.9%), phospholipases A2 (32.9%), and cysteine-rich secretory proteins (9.1%), together with few minor components. Further, the involvement of these most abundant proteins in the toxic effects of the venom, and their cross-recognition and neutralization by a sea snake antivenom produced against the venom of Enhydrina schistosa, were analyzed. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.35870520131944,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,398,NA

This fast-swimming top-level predator is abundant in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, where it is caught incidentally by artisanal fisheries, and represents a target species for both recreational and commercial fisheries in Mexico, Ecuador, Peru and Central America. Nowadays, local fishery information on this species is scarce, thus our objective was to analyze the size structure by sex and the catchper- unit-effort (CPUE) tendency of dolphinfish caught in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, from 2000 to 2007. For this, fishery catches information was obtained from the artisanal fleet, at six landing sites in the Gulf, and the sex ratio, fork length (FL) and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) were estimated. From all sampling sites, a total of 3 494 females, and 3 877 males were obtained, and dolphinfish size as fork length (FL) ranged from 20.5 to 152cm. Fish size ranged from 25.5 to 148cm furcal length (FL) in males, and 20.5 to 129cm FLin females. The sex ratio (males:Females) was 1:1, except in April-May (1:1.5, p<0.05) and November (1:0.5, p<0.05). The sex ratio at different size classes showed a significant bias towards females at smaller sizes (<75cm FL), whereas the males were predominant in larger size classes (>100cm FL). The size structure was bimodal, with a variation in the size average; the modes were defined as the small group (FL=50-55cm) and the large size group (FL=100-110cm). The CPUE showed seasonal changes: Values were high for the November-December period, and values were lower for July-August. The seasonal and inter annual variation in the abundance of dolphinfish is probably related to a pre-spawning migration in close relation to the rain-drought regime characteristic of the region, and the associated wind upwelling season of ""Tehuanos"" in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.","Article","Scopus",0.743013150368458,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,68,NA

Management systems in which harvest strategies and tactics are flexible in responding to unpredictable biological changes are more likely to succeed in maintaining productive populations. We explore the adaptability of fisheries management systems in relation to oceanic warming rates by asking how two important management characteristics vary with temperature changes for >500 stocks. (1) Harvest control rules, a framework for altering fishing pressure in response to changes in the abundance of targeted species (primarily due to fishing), may provide the capacity for harvest policies to change in response to climate-driven abundance declines also. (2) Seasonal openings with flexible dates that involve in-season monitoring may allow managers to better respond to possible changes in the timing of life-history periods like spawning to prevent fishing seasons falling out of sync with species' phenology. Harvest control rules were widely used across industrialized fisheries including in regions that experienced relatively high oceanic warming rates, but after controlling for regional factors we found no association between ocean warming and the use of harvest control rules. Flexible-date seasonal openings were rare compared to fixed-date seasonal openings, but tended to occur in areas with the greatest warming rates while fisheries without seasonal closures tended to occur in areas with the least observed temperature changes. We found no consistent evidence of recent ocean warming effects on the current biomass or exploitation rates relative to management targets of 241 assessed marine populations. Together, these results suggest that the oceanic areas expected to have the greatest climate impacts on populations do at least tend to contain fisheries that demonstrate the potential for adaptability to unpredictable climate impacts. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus",0.68911255819807,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,236,NA

To better understand the mechanisms supporting growth of Sargassum over its broad geographic range in the western North Atlantic, we measured growth rate, gross productivity, and C:N:P ratios of both Sargassum natans and Sargassum fluitans from a variety of neritic (Caribbean Sea, Straits of Florida, Gulf Stream) and oceanic (Sargasso Sea) locations. In neritic areas, the abundance of associated fishes was quantified with a purse seine net designed to minimize fish avoidance of sampling gear. Abundant fish species were also collected for measurements of ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus excretion rates. Low growth rates and productivity of both S. natans and S. fluitans were associated with high C:N and C:P ratios in oceanic populations in the Sargasso Sea, confirming strong nutrient-limitation in this oligotrophic gyre. In comparison, both species from the neritic areas had higher productivity and growth rates and lower C:N and C:P ratios, indicating relatively nutrient-enriched growth. Sargassum windrows in neritic locations had high abundances of associated fishes (mean of 128 fishes/kg wet weight Sargassum), especially juvenile filefish Stephanolepsis hispidus (Monacanthidae) and jacks (Carangidae). High excretion rates of ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus were associated with these mutualistic fishes, which can provide nutrients needed to sustain growth and biomass of Sargassum. These findings suggest that new production of Sargassum occurs in neritic waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, where mutualistic relationships with fishes, especially juvenile filefishes and carangids, contribute to nutrient supply and growth. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.597674862372015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,214,NA

The present study examined the influence of hydrodynamic and biological variables driven by monsoon system on the siphonophore assemblages through an annual cycle in 2004. Calycophorans, namely Chelophyes appendiculata, Diphyes chamissonis, Lensia subtiloides , Bassia bassensis , and Muggiaea atlantica, were the most dominant siphonophore species. Maximum abundance of these dominant species generally occurred during the warm period (May and August), while M. atlantica had a significantly peak abundance in February. Although no apparently temporal difference in siphonophore abundance was observed in the study, siphonophore assemblage was more diverse in August than in other sampling times. Result of a cluster analysis indicated that assemblage structure of siphonophores in the waters around Taiwan varied at temporal and spatial scales during the sampling period. The intrusions of the Kuroshio Branch Current and China Coastal Current to the study area play an important role on the transportation of siphonophores. Also, the distribution of siphonophore assemblage was closely related to the hydrographic characteristics, with temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and zooplankton abundance being the major environmental factors affecting the spatio-temporal variability of siphonophores. This study contributes substantially to the new knowledge of the siphonophore assemblage in the tropical-temperate waters of Taiwan. ¬© 2014 Lo et al.","Article","Scopus",0.540668226426552,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,93,NA

There is a lack of robust sampling methods, but information on the settlement, which represents a mortality bottleneck, is crucial for the follow-up of populations for fisheries and conservation purposes. Empirical evaluation of sampling methods focusing on settling fish has not been conducted in temperate habitats. Here, we compare six different sampling methods to collect pre- and post-settlement stages of fish and determine the best combination of techniques to utilise in Posidonia oceanica, an endemic Mediterranean seagrass that provides a key nursery habitat for coastal fish. We used three types of pelagic nets (bongo net, neuston net and ring net), two types of light-traps (Quatrefoil and Ecocean CARE¬Æ) to sample pre-settled stages and a low-impact epibenthic trawl for recent settlers. Our results show a significantly different size-spectrum for each method, with a continuous range of sizes from 2 mm to 200 mm. The smallest sizes were collected by the bongo net, followed by the ring net, the neuston net, the Quatrefoil, the Ecocean and finally the epibenthic trawl. Our results suggest that an appropriate strategy for collecting and estimating the abundance of key littoral fish species around settlement size is the combination of the Ecocean light trap and the epibenthic trawl.","Article","Scopus",0.526944666449616,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,353,NA

Based on data from three periods between 1962 and 2011, we identified the presence of two components of herring in a small semi-enclosed coastal marine ecosystem based on different somatic growth patterns and mean vertebrae sum (VS). The two components were interpreted as belonging to a resident herring population and the migratory, oceanic Norwegian spring spawning (NSS) herring population, and they co-occurred during spawning. In the 1960s, resident herring characterized by slow growth and low VS co-occurred with rapid growth, high VS oceanic NSS herring. Similar slow-growing resident and rapid-growing NSS herring were found in the 1970-80s, but both populations now had low VS suggesting similar origins. Finally, in the 2000s both populations showed rapid growth. The changes coincided with the NSS herring going from a state of high abundance and oceanic distribution to a collapse in the late 1960s that resulted in a coastal distribution closer to resident herring populations, before full recovery and resumption of the migratory, oceanic pattern in the 1990s. During all three periods, NSS herring were only present in the local system up to an age of about five years, but the synchronous spawning of the populations supports mixed spawning and interbreeding. During the investigation period both longevity, length at age (growth) and length-at-first maturity increased markedly for the resident herring, which then became more similar to the NSS herring.

Since empirical determination of self-recruitment vs. external recruitment is difficult, we used a modeling approach to examine the sensitivity of fishery management priorities to recruitment assumptions (self [closed], external [open]) in a local population of harvested giant clams (Tridacna maxima) on Mo'orea, French Polynesia. From 2006 to 2010, we measured growth, fecundity, recruitment, and survival (resulting from natural and fishing mortality). We used these data to parameterize both a closed (complete self-recruitment) and an open (no selfrecruitment) integral projection model (IPM), and then calculated elasticities of demographic rates (growth, survival, recruitment) to future population abundance in 20 years. The models' lowest projected abundance was 93.4% (95% CI, [86.5%, 101.8%]) of present abundance, if the local population is entirely open and the present level of fishing mortality persists. The population will exhibit self-sustaining dynamics. 1 k 1.07. as for a closed population if the ratio of self-recruits per gram of dry gonad is .0.775 (equivalent to 52.85% selfrecruitment under present conditions). Elasticity analysis of demographic parameters indicated that future abundance can most effectively be influenced by increasing survival of mid-sized clams (;80-120 mm) if the population is self-sustaining, and by increasing survival of juvenile clams (;40-70 mm) if the population is non-self-sustaining (as for an open population). Our results illustrate that management priorities can vary depending on the amount of self-recruitment in a local population. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.794659879189787,"0","0",NA,10,15,19,NA

Here, we hypothesize that predator-prey relationships vary spatially in association with underlying physical ocean conditions, leading to observable changes in demographic rates, such as reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we quantified spatio-temporal variability in hydrographic conditions, krill, and forage fish to model predator (seabird) demographic responses over 18 years (1990-2007). We used principal component analysis and spatial correlation maps to assess coherence among ocean conditions, krill, and forage fish, and generalized additive models to quantify interannual variability in seabird breeding success relative to prey abundance. The first principal component of four hydrographic measurements yielded an index that partitioned ''warm/weak upwelling'' and ''cool/strong upwelling'' years. Partitioning of krill and forage fish time series among shelf and oceanic regions yielded spatially explicit indicators of prey availability. Krill abundance within the oceanic region was remarkably consistent between years, whereas krill over the shelf showed marked interannual fluctuations in relation to ocean conditions. Anchovy abundance varied on the shelf, and was greater in years of strong stratification, weak upwelling and warmer temperatures. Spatio-temporal variability of juvenile forage fish co-varied strongly with each other and with krill, but was weakly correlated with hydrographic conditions. Demographic responses between seabirds and prey availability revealed spatially variable associations indicative of the dynamic nature of ''predator-habitat'' relationships. Quantification of spatially explicit demographic responses, and their variability through time, demonstrate the possibility of delineating specific critical areas where the implementation of protective measures could maintain functions and productivity of central place foraging predators. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.523096266890362,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,147,NA

In some coastal areas of Norway, the circumglobal Periphylla periphylla has increased to exceptionally high abundances and has replaced fish as the main planktivorous predator despite the ineffectiveness of its non-visual predation compared to visual fish predation. Using data from a bottom-mounted acoustic platform, we collected 12 341 in situ measurements of individual vertical movements of large individuals of P. periphylla. These jellyfish are characterized by a stepwise vertical movement. The distribution of their vertical swimming distances was extremely left skewed; about 85% of the swimming distances were less than 3 m, and a few displacements were extremely long with a maximum of 85 m. Chi-square tests of goodness of fit to the tail and Akaike's information criterion gave overwhelming evidence of the truncated power law. There was a clear diel pattern in the exponent with values significantly larger than 3 during the daytime and significantly lower than 3 at night. This pattern means that P. periphylla switches from relatively limited movements during the day to L√©vy-like flights during the night. Since the abundance of zooplankton is large in the P. periphylla fjord, Brownian motion, rather than L√©vy flight, is predicted by the optimal foraging hypothesis. It is therefore possible that the L√©vy-like search pattern has evolved in the food-scarce oceanic environment, which is the main natural habitat of P. periphylla. Alternatively, the large individuals of the population addressed here may forage on scarcer prey sources than the main prevailing zooplankton in Lurefjorden. ¬© Inter-Research 2014","Article","Scopus",0.625391879471834,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,392,NA

However, such works concerning anchovy population are mainly based on short historical catch records. In order to understand the causes of variability in fish stocks (natural and/or anthropogenic) and calibrate the error between catches and standing stocks, it is essential to develop long-term time series of fish stocks from the time when human impacts are minimal or negligible. Well preserved fish scales from sediment record are regarded as useful indicators revealing the history of fish population dynamics over the last centuries. Anchovy scales was first analyzed over the Yellow Sea and East China Sea and the largest abundance was found in the central South Yellow Sea where is regarded as the largest overwintering ground for Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicas). Thus in the central South Yellow Sea, two cores covering the last 150 years were collected for estimating fish scale flux. The scale deposition rate (SDR) records show that the decadal scale SDRs were obviously coherent between cores with independent chronologies. The calibration of downcore SDRs to the standing stocks of anchovy further validated that SDR is a reliable proxy to reconstruct the long-term anchovy population dynamic in the central South Yellow Sea where anoxic conditions prevail in the sediment. When assembled with other productivity proxies, it would be expected that SDR could be associated with changes in oceanic productivity and may make a contribution to determine the forcing factors and elucidate the mechanism of the process in future. ¬© 2014, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Scopus",0.681090439638739,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,291,NA

In some of the fishing grounds catch rates of both species are high, but in other areas, only one species is abundantly caught. Leased boats from Japan and China Taipei never aimed at any of those two species hence the catches were always small. However the leased fleet from Spain clearly focuses its actions in areas where catch rates of swordfish are high. The national fleet focuses effort in both, areas where swordfish dominates and areas where catch rates of swordfish and blue shark are concomitantly high.

We examined the hypothesis that the spread of an introduced alga in disturbed seagrass beds with degraded canopies depends on the depletion of large consumers. We mimicked the degradation of seagrass canopies by clipping shoot density and reducing leaf length, simulating natural and anthropogenic stressors such as fish overgrazing and water quality. Caulerpa racemosa was transplanted into each plot and large consumers were excluded from half of them using cages. Potential cage artifacts were assessed by measuring irradiance, scouring by leaf movement, water flow, and sedimentation. Algal invasion of the seagrass bed differed based on the size of consumers. The alga had higher cover and size under the cages, where the seagrass was characterized by reduced shoot density and canopy height. Furthermore, canopy height had a significant effect depending on canopy density. The alteration of seagrass canopies increased the spread of C. racemosa only when large consumers were absent. Our results suggest that protecting declining habitats and/or restoring fish populations will limit the expansion of C. racemosa. Because MPAs also enhance the abundance and size of fish consuming seagrass they can indirectly promote algal invasion. The effects of MPAs on invasive species are context dependent and require balancing opposing forces, such as the conservation of seagrass canopy structure and the protection of fish grazing the seagrass. ¬© 2015 Caronni et al.","Article","Scopus",0.509272536973781,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,144,NA

Fluctuating asymmetry (small, non-random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry) is an informative metric sensitive to contaminants that can be used to assess environmental stress levels. For this study, the well-studied and common Gulf of Mexico estuarine fish, Menidia beryllina, was used with pre and post-oil spill collections. Comparisons of fluctuating asymmetry in three traits (eye diameter, pectoral fin length, and pelvic fin length) were made pre and post-oil spill across two sites (Old Fort Bayou and the Pascagoula River), as well as between years of collection (2011, 2012)-one and two years, respectfully, after the spill in 2010. We hypothesized that fluctuating asymmetry would be higher in post-Deepwater Horizon samples, and that this will be replicated in both study areas along the Mississippi Gulf coast. We also predicted that fluctuating asymmetry would decrease through time after the oil spill as the oil decomposed and/or was removed. Analyses performed on 1135 fish (220 pre and 915 post Deepwater Horizon) showed significantly higher post spill fluctuating asymmetry in the eye but no difference for the pectoral or pelvic fins. There was also higher fluctuating asymmetry in one of the two sites both pre and post-spill, indicating observed asymmetry may be the product of multiple stressors. Fluctuating asymmetry decreased in 2012 compared to 2011. Fluctuating asymmetry is a sensitive measure of sub lethal stress, and the observed variability in this study (pre vs. post-spill or between sites) could be due to a combination of oil, dispersants, or other unknown stressors. ¬© 2015 Michaelsen et al.","Article","Scopus",0.449959915015659,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,193,NA

Altered prey assemblages resulting from fluctuations in oceanographic conditions may be mirrored by shifts in seabird diet. Long-term studies of dietary change in seabirds therefore provide valuable insight into the nature of environmental shifts within the systems in which they forage. In recent decades, the Agulhas region in South Africa has undergone significant oceanographic change related to warming and intensification of the Agulhas current. Concurrent with this change, the population ofCape gannets Morus capensis at Bird Island, Algoa Bay, has grownrapidly, probably as a result of an increased availability of its dominant prey items, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus.Using one of the longest andmost complete time-series available on diet of a seabird (spanning 34 years), we tested for changes in composition and the abundance of dominant prey species of this population. These observed changeswere also comparedwith acoustic survey estimates of their biomass, and annual catch data. Since 1979, the prey composition has remained similar, but the dietary contribution of sardine and anchovy, which fluctuated inversely to each other, increased over the study period. These shifts seemto be reflective of fluctuations in the stock size of sardine and anchovy. Conversely, a third species, saury Scomberesox saurus, dominant in the non-breedingdiet of the 1980s, decreased significantly in dietary abundance over the following two decades.

Accordingly, fishery-independent surveys were undertaken to investigate shark abundance along approximately 400 km of the tropical east coast of Australia. Generalised linear models were used to identify ecological drivers of the abundance of immature blacktip Carcharhinus tilstoni/Carcharhinus limbatus, pigeye Carcharhinus amboinensis, and scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini sharks. Results indicated general and species-specific patterns in abundance that were characterised by a range of abiotic and biotic variables. Relationships with turbidity and salinity were similar across multiple species, highlighting the importance of these variables in the functioning of communal shark nurseries. In particular, turbid environments were especially important for all species at typical oceanic salinities. Mangrove proximity, depth, and water temperature were also important; however, their influence varied between species. Ecological drivers may promote spatial diversity in habitat use along environmentally heterogeneous coastlines and may therefore have important implications for population resilience. ¬© 2015 Yates et al.","Article","Scopus",0.491442889613,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,117,NA

The responses of fish populations to variability in the marine environment have implications for decision making processes associated with resource management. There is still considerable uncertainty in estimating the responses of tuna populations to short-to-medium-term variability and longer-term change in the oceanic environment. A workshop was organised to examine how advances in oceanography, fisheries science and fisheries economics could be applied to the tuna fisheries of the WCPO and in doing so identify research priorities to improve understanding relevant to progressing management. Research priorities identified included: (i) improved parameterisation of end to end ecosystem model components, processes and feedbacks through expanded biological observations and incorporation of higher resolution climate models; (ii) development of seasonal and inter-annual forecasting tools enabling management responses to short-term variability in tuna distributions and abundances; (iii) improved understanding of the population dynamics of and the energy transfer efficiencies between food web components; (iv) assessment of the optimal value of access rights and overall fishery value under multiple scenarios of tuna distribution and abundance and influences on decision making by fisheries managers and fleets and (v) development of management strategy evaluation frameworks for utilisation in the implementing and testing of fishery management procedures and to help prioritise research directions and investment. Issues discussed and research priorities identified during the workshop have synergies with other internationally managed fisheries and therefore are applicable to many other fisheries. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.64008411531134,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,265,NA

This once-abundant sea has witnessed major declines in apex predators, now largely restricted to isolated pockets within marine reserves. This depletion could critically impact macrophyte communities that are strongly structured by top-down processes. We evaluated rates of predation on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a key herbivore of macroalgal and Posidonia oceanica seagrass seascapes, across a large stretch of the Western Mediterranean coastline. Fish predation was generally higher inside reserves, but was equally high at several locations outside these boundaries. Although critically low at some locations compared to reserves, predation was functionally ubiquitous in most habitats, seasons and sites. Fish were still primarily responsible for this predation with no clear evidence of meso-predator release. Macroalgal habitats were consistently subject to higher predation than in seagrass meadows, functionally critical given the vulnerability of macroalgal systems to overgrazing. Predation hotspots were clearly associated with high fish predator numbers and low refuge availability. Taken together, these results suggest that long-term overfishing may not necessarily reflect a complete loss of trophic function. Pockets of fish predation may still persist, linked to habitat complexity, predator behavioral adaptations and landscape-level features. Given the essential role top-down control plays in macroalgal communities, regulating fishing at these predation hotspots is vital to effectively conserve habitats from future hysteretic shifts. Even historically fished seas may retain areas where trophic function persists; identifying these areas is critical to preserving the remaining ecological integrity of these coastlines. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.666442742724835,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,186,NA

Unlike other tropical reef systems, sub-tidal habitats have very low abundance of both coral and macrophyte species. Visually dominant is a diverse assemblage of fish species, with particularly high densities of Melichthys Niger, a voracious omnivore. In contrast, the nocturnal species assemblage is notably different, visually dominated by benthic invertebrates. To quantify the difference between day and night visible assemblages, we conducted day/night pairs of transect surveys of fish and invertebrates across three depths, and spanning 9 months, assigning all species to one of 10 functional groups. Multivariate analysis of surveys revealed significant turnover in species between day and night surveys and between survey periods, with concomitant changes in species rank-abundance distributions. Juveniles of a number of fish species were determinate in observed differences. Conversely, diversity of functional groups between day/night surveys and between seasons were not different, however there was significant species turnover within functional groups between day and night assemblages. The lack of proportional change in functional groups but a turn-over of species between day and night assemblages suggest that there may be a degree of functional redundancy in Ascension Island's marine trophic profile.

However, the effects of overfishing and collapse of large top predators on the broad-scale biodiversity of oceanic ecosystems remain largely unexplored. Populations of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were overfished and several collapsed in the early 1990s across Atlantic Canada, providing a unique opportunity to study potential ecosystem-level effects of the reduction of a dominant predator on fish biodiversity, and to identify how such effects might interact with other environmental factors, such as changes in climate, over time. We combined causal modelling with model selection and multimodel inference to analyse 41 years of fishery-independent survey data (1970-2010) and quantify ecosystem-level effects of overfishing and climate variation on the biodiversity of fishes across a broad area (172 000 km2) of the Scotian Shelf. We found that alpha and beta diversity increased with decreases in cod occurrence; fish communities were less homogeneous and more variable in systems where cod no longer dominated. These effects were most pronounced in the colder north-eastern parts of the Scotian Shelf.

A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site.Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii.Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system. ¬© 2015.","Article","Scopus",0.791013895723758,NA,"0",NA,NA,15,219,NA

For the primarily catadromous eels of the family Anguillidae, there is growing international concern for the population abundance and escapement trends of some of these species and yet incomplete knowledge of their remarkable life-histories hampers management and conservation. Anguillids experience a suite of pressures that include habitat loss/modification, migration barriers, pollution, parasitism, exploitation, and fluctuating oceanic conditions that likely have synergistic and regionally variable impacts, even within species. In beginning to redress this rather fragmented picture, we evaluated the extinction risk of these species using the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria to infer population-wide trends from catch and monitoring data. Here we consolidate and build upon these species assessments by presenting an overview of the current state of global eel data and conservation, categorising the knowledge gaps and geographic regions where resources are needed and discussing future recommendations to improve our understanding of anguillids. We find stark disparity between the quality and length of data available to assess population trends and conservation priorities in temperate and tropical anguillids. Of the 13 species assessed, four were listed as 'Threatened' (Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered); four were Near Threatened, three were Data Deficient and two were deemed Least Concern. Comparing with other diadromous species, we examine the multiple threats that impact eels during their different life-history stages, highlighting the challenges of applying the Red List Categories and Criteria to geographically-expansive, catadromous and panmictic groups of species. ¬© 2015 The Authors.","Article","Scopus",0.604878352620768,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,296,NA

Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) with and without random effects were used to identify a relationship between abundance in the catch and oceanographic conditions. The outcomes of models with no random effects, with random vessel effects and with the random vessel and random week-of-the-year effects were examined. The GAMM incorporating a random vessel and week-of-the-year effect were selected as the best model on the basis of the Akaike information criteria (AIC).

Oceanic islands with narrow continental shelves, in particular, are sensitive to unsustainable levels of fishing intensity. Fish traps are the modality of artisanal professional fishing more important in the coastal waters of the Canary Islands (eastern Atlantic) to capture demersal resources, which are deployed all year-round and allow a release of undersized captures. We aimed at studying the structure of nearshore fish assemblages through deployment of benthic bottom traps carried out at Gran Canary Island. A quantitative description of catches, in terms of abundance, biomass and sizes, of traps deployed from May to October 2009, between ca. 20 to 50 m depth, was carried out. We used this information to test whether the structure of nearshore fish assemblages at the island scale varied between three zones located at the NW, NE and E of the island with varying habitat structure. A total of 58 species (22 families) were collected for the overall study from a total of 2568 deployed traps. The species Sparisoma cretense (25% of the total biomass), the family Sparidae (16 species, 44%) and Mullus surmuletus (4%) accounted for more than 73% of the total catch in terms of biomass. The parrotfish, S. cretense, was the fish with the largest catches in terms of number of individuals, followed by Dentex gibbosus, Diplodus vulgaris, Stephanolepis hispidus, Chromis limbata and Mullus surmuletus.

To implement these requirements, the MSFCMA directed the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop regulations by 2008 to provide guidance for establishing annual catch limits (ACLs) and related biological benchmarks. By the end of 2011, a requirement to implement ACLs and end overfishing in all federally managed fisheries came into effect. For fish stocks at low levels of abundance, stock rebuilding within a 10-year time frame (with some exceptions) is also required. Fishermen and fishing communities sometimes suffer from economic and social effects of harvest restrictions needed to satisfy MSFCMA overfishing and stock rebuilding requirements. Many question whether these requirements adequately address the complexities and uncertainties associated with managing fish stocks. Often fishermen express doubt over the efficacy of fish population assessments used for developing management measures because of data constraints and inadequate population models. Furthermore, they refer to studies showing that other factors, often outside the immediate control of fisheries managers, such as environmental conditions and the quality of fish habitat, also affect fish population abundance. Others, including environmentalists and fishery managers, counter that overfishing and previous management failures illustrate the need to maintain established fish stock rebuilding schedules. They emphasize that relatively short-term sacrifices today will result in long-term economic gains to recreational and commercial fishermen in the future. They point to 27 stocks that have been rebuilt since 2000 and cite notable examples of fully rebuilt stocks such as Northeast scallop, Mid-Atlantic bluefish, and Pacific lingcod. Overfishing has been arrested in most U.S. fisheries and progress has been made in rebuilding many others. However, these improvements have sometimes come at a cost to commercial and recreational fishermen and associated fishing communities, and in some cases stocks have not responded to management actions as managers anticipated. Some fishermen, fishery managers, and academics have posed questions related to (1) the effects of ACLs on allocation of fisheries benefits; (2) the possible social and economic benefits of greater flexibility during stock rebuilding, (3) the accuracy of data and models used to determine ACLs and rebuilding objectives, and (4) the decision-making process, especially in situations with limited data and related uncertainty. Several different bills concerning overfishing, stock rebuilding, and related issues have been introduced during the 112th Congress, including H.R. 1646, H.R. 2304, H.R. 3061, H.R. 4208, S. 238, S. 632, S. 1916, and S. 2184. Several hearings have been held to explore broad concerns related to overfishing, ACLs, and the related need to reduce uncertainty by improving fisheries data collection and stock assessments. The most recent was held on December 1, 2011, by the House Committee on Natural Resources, which considered a variety of bills and associated issues related to fisheries, including H.R. 1646, H.R. 2304, and H.R. 3061.

Previous estimates utilizing mean density over the CalCOFI area show a hyperstability bias because of the nearshore concentration of CalCOFI stations and the tendency of the anchovy population to contract into this area when abundances are low. New abundance estimates weight sample egg and larval densities to the local area represented by that sample, and then sum contributions to obtain total abundance. We develop total egg and larval abundance estimates for January and April, form a combined index, and calibrate it to the absolute biomass estimates produced by the Daily Egg Production Method in the early 1980s. Anchovy spawning biomass was very low, 10,000-20,000 Metric Tons (MT), in the early 1950s when CalCOFI sampling began. Abundance increased and fluctuated between 0.5 and 2 million metric tons from 1960 through 1990. After 1990, spawning biomass fluctuated around 200,000 tons, briefly increased during 2005-2006, then declined substantially over four years to below 20,000 tons from 2009 to 2011. CalCOFI ichthyoplankton data collected after 2011 are not yet available for analysis, but continuous underway egg sampling conducted during CalCOFI cruises indicates continued low abundance and very limited spawning through 2015 in both southern and central California. The recent collapse of anchovy abundance occurred in the absence of a significant fishery. Present annual catches of a few thousand tons are small by historical comparison, but the exploitation rate may now be relatively high given the low stock abundance. The decline in anchovy abundance coincides with recent die-offs and reproductive failures of anchovy-dependent predators in the ecosystem (e.g., sea lions and pelicans). ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.830817364457117,NA,"?","egg/larvae",NA,5,322,NA

Here, we examine larval fish distribution and abundance patterns in Palma Bay, a large (~20 km) wind-driven microtidal bay in the southern coast of Mallorca (Spain, NW Mediterranean Sea). Larval fish assemblage structure in the bay were analyzed during July 2010 and interpreted in the context of the observed circulation patterns, adult habitat distribution and spawning traits. Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) observations showed the presence of retentive flow patterns in the middle of the bay enhancing local larval accumulation and self-recruitment. In consequence, larval abundances were higher in this central part of the bay (~40 m depth, mean abundance 607.6 ¬± 383 ind. 10 m-2) than along the coastal fringe (&lt;35 m 113.7 ¬± 91 ind. 10 m-2). Also, a multivariate predictive approach based on Redundancy Analysis (RDA) revealed differences between the larval fish assemblages in areas inside the bay, constituted by small pelagic and benthopelagic taxa (gobids, Chromis chromis and Serranus hepatus) and offshore larvae, mostly from meso and large pelagic fish. These larval fish assemblages were structured according to depth variations and zooplankton abundance, and remained relatively unmixed because of the circulation patterns in the mouth of the bay that uncouple its dynamics from alongshelf circulation. Even larvae of typically pelagic species that spawn close to the coast (Sardinella aurita, Auxis rochei) were associated with the retentive effect of the bay. Our study highlights the important role of coastal bays in the regulation of coastal fish population dynamics and as hotspots for the maintenance of diversity in the Mediterranean Sea. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.713402020930269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,209,NA

They are schooling, planktivorous fish that provide forage for higher trophic levels. We describe the life cycle histories and patterns of distribution of sardine, anchovy, and mackerel species occupying the waters along the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico). The links between the physical and biological forcing and the structure and condition of their habitats, their patterns of movement, productivity, and stock structure (where information is available) are described in relation to the fisheries. We have used the catches as a proxy for the history of the different stocks, while recognizing that fisheries-derived information is biased by the operational scale and only covers areas where fish are available. We have relied mainly on studies of sardines to evaluate the validity of the principal paradigms in fisheries oceanography. We describe how the environment can structure a population by relating an example given by the spatiotemporal variability of the northern and southern stocks of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus) from 2000 to 2014. During this period, the northern stocks showed a marked tendency to contract southwards, as far south as Magdalena Bay, in response to the regional cooling that began in the previous decade. It appears that the combined effects of fishing and climate change may sufficiently alter habitat characteristics so that both the distribution and productivity of a population are shifted. ¬© 2015 Universidad Autonoma de Baja California.

While several hypotheses have been put forth to explain decadal shifts in sardine and anchovy populations, a mechanistic basis for how the physics, biogeochemistry, and biology combine to produce patterns of synchronous variability across widely separated systems has remained elusive. The present study uses a 50-year (1959-2008) simulation of a fully coupled end-to-end ecosystem model configured for sardine and anchovy in the California Current System to investigate how environmental processes control their population dynamics. The results illustrate that slightly different temperature and diet preferences can lead to significantly different responses to environmental variability. Simulated adult population fluctuations are associated with age-1 growth (via age-2 egg production) and prey availability for anchovy, while they depend primarily on age-0 survival and temperature for sardine. The analysis also hints at potential linkages to known modes of climate variability, whereby changes in adult abundance are related to ENSO for anchovy and to the PDO for sardine. The connection to the PDO and ENSO is consistent with modes of interannual and decadal variability that would alternatively favor anchovy during years of cooler temperatures and higher prey availability, and sardine during years of warmer temperatures and lower prey availability. While the end-to-end ecosystem model provides valuable insight on potential relationships between environmental conditions and sardine and anchovy population dynamics, understanding the complex interplay, and potential lags, between the full array of processes controlling their abundances in the California Current System remains an on-going challenge. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.55074290757179,"0",NA,NA,15,NA,29,NA

The quantities found in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) suggest that the fish has already established a self-sustaining population in this new ecosystem. There is understandable concern, therefore, that this new arrival may become invasive and spread, yet the invasion risk imposed by this fish has not been assessed. In this study, a computer model was employed to deliver a forecast of the potential range of incursion of N. cyanomos in the GOM spanning 5¬†years. The model incorporated oceanic water flow in the region, tolerances of this damselfish to the ocean environment, and their reproductive strategy in order to supply a temporal and spatial forecast of their spread. From this study, targeted early detection and removal of the fish can be directed if the fish is deemed a threat to native fauna. On the basis of this work, it is foreseeable that the reefs presently harboring N. cyanomos will likely see increased abundance of this damsel. Immediate attempts to eliminate the fish, therefore, should be focused in nearshore shallow waters spanning Veracruz to Frontera, Mexico. Further, water flows in the southern GOM are not widely conducive to long-distance transport of marine organisms with pelagic larvae, reducing the risk of this damsel permeating the greater GOM over 5¬†years. Aside from N. cyanomos, this study implicitly adds to mounting evidence supporting a biogeographic disconnect between the Veracruz reef complex and the greater GOM and the Caribbean. ¬© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Scopus",0.549455152862112,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,230,NA

This study investigated hydro-chemical properties, phytoplankton biomass, phytoplankton species composition, three-dimensional (horizontal, vertical and transect) distribution of phytoplankton abundance, as well as phytoplankton annual variation and the correlation of phytoplankton community with the upwelling of underlying current and nutrients according to samples of Fujian-Guangdong coastal upwelling zone in western Taiwan Strait from August 27 to September 8, 2009. The results manifest that the nutrient-rich cold and high salinity current on the continental shelf of South China Sea upwells to the Fujian-Guangdong coastal waters through Taiwan Bank and the surging strength to surface is weak while strong at 30-m layer. The thermohaline center of coastal upwelling shifts to the east of Dongshan Island and expanded to offshore waters in comparison with previous records. A total of 137 phytoplankton species belonging to 59 genera in 4 phyla are identified excluding the unidentified species. Diatom is the first major group and followed by dinoflagellate. Cyanobacteria mainly composed by three Trichodesmium species account for a certain proportions, while Chrysophyta are only found in offshore waters. The dominant species include Thalassionema nitzschioides, Pseudo-nitzschia pungens, Thalassionema frauenfeldii, Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima, Rhizosolenia styliformis, Chaetoceros curvisetus, Diplopsalis lenticula and Trichodesmium thiebautii. Phytoplankton community mainly consists of eurythermal and eurytopic species, followed by warm-water species, tropic high-salinity species and oceanic eurythermic species in order. Phytoplankton abundance ranges from 1.00√ó102 ind./L~437.22√ó102 ind./L with an average of 47.36√ó102 ind./L. For vertical distribution, maximum abundance is found at 30m-depth and the surface comes second. Besides, the abundance below 30m decreases with increasing water depth. The horizontal and transect distribution of phytoplankton abundance are both displayed in patchy size, and the peak area is the offshore waters from the east of Dongshan Island to the south of Zhangpu which is basically coincident with the thermohaline center of the upwelling, but the distribution range of phytoplankton high abundance is expanded out of the upwelling center. Phytoplankton abundances on 3 transects in offshore waters from the east of Dongshan Island to the south of Zhangpu are higher than that of nearshore waters and the other 5 transects. Moreover, the underlying current is accompanied by shade flora so as to offer a certain evidence for the presence of upwelling. Phytoplankton abundance at 30m-depth and bottom both present low significant positive correlation with phosphate, while there are not significant correlations between the content of inorganic nitrogen and phytoplankton abundance in all water layers. The intensity and range of Fujian-guangdong coastal upwelling has a regulating effect on the species succession, abundance distribution and the location of phytoplankton peak area. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.529345025946733,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,71,NA

These two families have contrasting life history strategies; ommastrephids spawn in the open ocean and are thought to have a high dispersal potential, while loliginids spawn on the bottom and are likely to have a low dispersal potential. Consequently, these squid species should display different patterns in their population dynamics, which can be inferred through commercial catches. To study the population dynamics of the Ommastrephidae and the Loliginidae families, monthly time series catches of Dosidicus gigas and Doryteuthis gahi were used. These artisanal fishery catches were made in northern Peru from 1999 to 2010. They were standardized to construct autocorrelation functions so that the relationship between catch dynamics and short-term environmental change (thermal anomalies of sea surface temperature were used as a proxy) could be studied. The results revealed that increases in catches of D. gigas and D. gahi are not related to thermal anomalies, but rather a pattern of drastic fluctuations in D. gahi catch sizes are seen. In, both species, temporal relationships indicate that the annual growth rate and changes in abundance can modelled as a function of the catch density observed in previous years. We propose that these population differences result from the contrasting life history strategies and differential habitat use of these two squid species. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.687487297876991,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,203,NA

Well-preserved fish scales in the sediments are regarded as useful indicators reflecting the fluctuations of fish populations over the last centuries. This study aims to validate the anchovy scale deposition rate as a proxy of local anchovy biomass in the Yellow Sea adjoining the western North Pacific. Our reconstructed results indicated that over the last 150 years, the population size of anchovy in the Yellow Sea has exhibited great fluctuations with periodicity of around 50 years, and the pattern of current recovery and collapse is similar to that of historical records. The pattern of large-scale population synchrony with remote ocean basins provides further evidence proving that fish population dynamics are strongly affected by global and basin-scale oceanic/climatic variability. ¬© 2016, Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Scopus",0.739555558034371,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,64,NA

Juvenile fishes of Diplodus puntazzo and Diplodus vulgaris showed a partial time overlapping, sharing the same zones in winter and early spring, from February to May. Multiple correspondence analysis showed that sea breams settle in well-defined habitats. The smallest juveniles of D. sargus and D. puntazzo settled primarily in the shallowest sheltered pebbly areas, located in sciaphilous crannies covered by red algae. Diplodus vulgaris settlers were observed on a wider range of substrata: rock on sand, gravel and pebbles without algal cover or large boulders, generally in deeper waters. The intermediate-size juveniles of D. sargus, D. puntazzo and D. vulgaris showed a preference for rocky substrata with substantial algal cover, with arborescent structures (Phaeophyceae). Diplodus annularis juveniles showed high fidelity to seagrass beds (Posidonia oceanica). The home range increased over time in all species, highlighting a loss of substrate specificity: larger juveniles were even observed in deeper and different microhabitats outside nursery grounds. This study suggests that shallow infra-littoral rocky communities with photophilic algae play a key role in recruitment of sparid fishes, affecting the distribution and abundance of juvenile fishes and therefore determining the renewal of populations and the structure of adult assemblages. ¬© 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Article","Scopus",0.581445989084431,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,269,NA

This shark's sub-surface habits and behaviors have only begun to be revealed in recent years through the use of archival and satellite tagging technology. We attached pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags to 35 whale sharks in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico off the Yucatan Peninsula from 2003-2012 and three tags to whale sharks in the northeastern Gulf off Florida in 2010, to examine these sharks' longterm movement patterns and gain insight into the underlying factors influencing their vertical habitat selection. Archived data were received from 31 tags deployed on sharks of both sexes with total lengths of 5.5-9 m. Nine of these tags were physically recovered facilitating a detailed long-term view into the sharks' vertical movements. Whale sharks feeding inshore on fish eggs off the northeast Yucatan Peninsula demonstrated reverse diel vertical migration, with extended periods of surface swimming beginning at sunrise followed by an abrupt change in the mid-afternoon to regular vertical oscillations, a pattern that continued overnight. When in oceanic waters, sharks spent about 95% of their time within epipelagic depths (&lt;200 m) but regularly undertook very deep (""extreme"") dives (&gt;500 m) that largely occurred during daytime or twilight hours (max. depth recorded 1,928 m), had V-shaped depth-time profiles, and comprised more rapid descents (0.68 m sec-1) than ascents (0.50 m sec-1). Nearly half of these extreme dives had descent profiles with brief but conspicuous changes in vertical direction at a mean depth of 475 m. We hypothesize these stutter steps represent foraging events within the deep scattering layer, however, the extreme dives may have additional functions. Overall, our results demonstrate complex and dynamic patterns of habitat utilization for R. typus that appear to be in response to changing biotic and abiotic conditions influencing the distribution and abundance of their prey. ¬© 2015 Tyminski et al.

Unfortunately the development of ecological time series considerably lags those for the physics and chemistry of the oceans. Ichthyoplankton time series are proposed here to fill this gap in ocean observations. Marine fish species spanning a wide range of families, habitats, feeding guilds, and trophic levels broadcast large numbers of their reproductive products into the open waters. For a limited period, the larvae generally reside in the upper 200 m of the water column, where they may be quantitatively sampled with plankton nets. Larval abundance provides a relative index for adult spawning stock biomass, enabling diverse fish communities to be monitored quantitatively by relatively simple means. Recent analyses of the ichthyoplankton time series extending back to 1951 from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program indicate that non-commercial as well as commercially-exploited taxa have experienced dramatic change in recent decades. The CalCOFI data set is re-sampled here to show that a reduced sampling program-one based on a few stations along a single transect (cf >50 stations along 6 transects for CalCOFI) or one based on a shorter time series-can, within limits, obtain similar single-species and multivariate patterns of abundance. Ichthyoplankton survey programs may thus provide the basis for a global system of ocean ecological observations in addition to their primary use today for fisheries stock assessment. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.585074460970403,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,81,NA

However, the effects of fish predation on amphipod assemblages in this system have received little attention. To address this gap in knowledge, experimental manipulations of predation intensity (exclusion and inclusion cages) were conducted at two sites in a Mediterranean marine protected area, where different levels of fish predation were expected to occur. We found that in the absence of predatory fishes (exclusion cages), total amphipod density and biomass were higher than in uncaged areas and partially controlled cages. At the species level, Caprella acanthifera and Iphimedia minuta responded to caging with increased abundance, while in most cases different species did not exhibit differences in density or biomass between treatments. The presence of one enclosed labrid fish predator (inclusion cages) resulted in a lower density and biomass of Aora spinicornis and a lower biomass of Phtisica marina, although total amphipod density and biomass were unchanged. In the inclusion cages, a size-frequency analysis revealed that predators mainly targeted large A. spinicornis and Apherusa chiereghinii individuals. Our results suggest that predation by fish may be an important factor in controlling amphipod abundances and biomasses in P.¬†oceanica meadows. Overall, amphipod community composition was not affected by exclusion or inclusion of fish predators. However, some significant effects at the species level point to more complex interactions between some amphipods and fish. ¬© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Article","Scopus",0.630969527571051,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,118,NA

The wide distribution range of this species renders it susceptible to coastal and oceanic fishing operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) consider this species to be highly vulnerable, especially due to its biological parameters, which are different from those of other sharks that occupy the same niche (e.g., Prionace glauca). Consequently, considerable declines in abundance have been detected over various parts of its range, most of which are linked to oceanic longline fishing. The species has conflicting life history parameters in studies conducted in the last 30 years, especially with regard to age and growth. The main discrepancies regard the interpretation of the periodicity of the deposition of band pairs (BPs) on vertebrae and the possibility of ontogenetic variations in growth. Shortfin mako sharks (n = 1325) were sampled by onboard observers of the Brazilian chartered pelagic longline fleet based in northeast Brazil from 2005 to 2011. Lengths were 79 to 250 and 73 to 296 cm (fork length, FL) for males and females, respectively, with a statistically significant difference in size between sexes and differences in the proportion of individuals in each size class. The onboard observers collected a subsample of vertebrae (n = 467), only 234 of which were suitable for analyses. Reliability between readings was satisfactory. However, it was not possible to validate periodicity in the formation of age bands in the sample. Thus, the von Bertalanffy growth function was used to calculate growth rates for the species through the interpretation of BPs in different scenarios: one BP per year (s1), two BPs per year (s2) and two BPs per year until five years of life (s3). Growth parameters varied for both females (Linf = 309.7[s3] to 441.6 [s1]; k = 0.04[s1] to 0.13[s3]; t0 = -7.08[s1] and -3.27[s3]) and males (Linf = 291.5[s3] to 340.2[s1]; k = 0.04[s1] to 0.13[s3]; t0 = -7.08[s1] and -3.27[s3]). To advance the understanding of the use of habitat, the first analysis of the spatial distribution of the life stages of the shortfin mako sharks caught by commercial longline fishing operations in the South Atlantic was performed. The findings indicate that the portion of the population exploited by the fleets is predominantly juvenile and future actions should take the following issues into account: improvements in the efficiency of data collection procedures, the reestablishment of the onboard observer program, emergency investments in studies that can contribute to a better understanding of habitat use and life history theory. ¬© 2016 Barreto et al.

Increased fishing pressure and such events suggest that the GOA is susceptible to climate variation; however the mechanistic links between ecosystem change and climate remain unclear. At-sea surveys were undertaken during the month of May from 1998 to 2009 to collect data on zooplankton abundance and water mass properties in the northern GOA. Significant changes in temperature, salinity and zooplankton abundance were identified during this period. The euphausiid Thysanoessa inermis and the copepod Calanus marshallae had increased abundances in years when there was a strong phytoplankton spring bloom preceded by anomalously cold winters. The euphausiid Euphausia pacifica and the copepods Pseudocalanus spp., Neocalanus plumchrus/flemingeri, and Oithona spp. were more resilient to relatively high mean water temperatures. High zooplankton abundances in years of substantial cross-shelf mixing suggest that iron and nutrient transport between the shelf and oceanic domains are essential for sustaining high zooplankton populations via phytoplankton blooms. The abundance of zooplankton in the northern GOA is highly influenced by advective processes and changes in temperature. Further understanding of biological and physical mechanisms that control the GOA ecosystem are of major importance to predict the response of zooplankton communities to environmental changes. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.676725204025294,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38,NA

The data from autumn surveys (acoustic capelin survey, 0-group survey, and ecosystem survey) were used to explore the effects of jellyfish (i.e. mostly Cyanea capillata) on krill, 0-group fish (capelin, herring, cod, haddock, polar cod, and redfish), and pelagic fish stocks (older capelin, herring, blue whiting, and lumpfish). The temporal and spatial patterns of the jellyfish, krill, and 0-group fish distributions reflected differences in the drift of these organisms with the inflow of Atlantic waters. During 1993-2013, jellyfish were present in two ""waves"" in the Barents Sea, namely, in the early 2000s and at the end of the studied period. In the 1990s, jellyfish were found at an average of 40% of stations, whereas in the 2000s, they were found at an average of 80% of stations. The increased occupation area led to increased overlap with other components of the pelagic community. The co-occurrence of the averaged and high concentrations of jellyfish and other studied species/groups indicated a highly productive area most likely defined by ocean currents. The results indicated a lack of robust evidence for the hypothesis that scyphozoan jellyfish limit the habitat of species in the Barents Sea during the late feeding period.

Cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish and octopuses) have a unique set of biological traits, including rapid growth, short lifespans and strong life-history plasticity, allowing them to adapt quickly to changing environmental conditions [2-4]. There has been growing speculation that cephalopod populations are proliferating in response to a changing environment, a perception fuelled by increasing trends in cephalopod fisheries catch [4,5]. To investigate long-term trends in cephalopod abundance, we assembled global time-series of cephalopod catch rates (catch per unit of fishing or sampling effort). We show that cephalopod populations have increased over the last six decades, a result that was remarkably consistent across a highly diverse set of cephalopod taxa. Positive trends were also evident for both fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent time-series, suggesting that trends are not solely due to factors associated with developing fisheries. Our results suggest that large-scale, directional processes, common to a range of coastal and oceanic environments, are responsible. This study presents the first evidence that cephalopod populations have increased globally, indicating that these ecologically and commercially important invertebrates may have benefited from a changing ocean environment. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.567505321290191,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,275,NA

There are more than 2000 sites along the coast of Brazil that range in age from 8,720 to 985 cal BP. Here, we studied the ichthyoarchaeological remains (i.e., cranial/postcranial bones, otoliths, and teeth, among others) at 13 shellmounds on the southern coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, which are located in coastal landscapes, including a sandy plain with coastal lagoons, rocky islands, islets and rocky bays. We identified patterns of similarity between shellmounds based on fish diversity, the ages of the assemblages, littoral geomorphology and prehistoric fisheries. Our new radiocarbon dating, based on otolith samples, was used for fishery characterization over time. A taxonomical study of the ichthyoarchaeological remains includes a diversity of 97 marine species, representing 37% of all modern species (i.e., 265 spp.) that have been documented along the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. This high fish diversity recovered from the shellmounds is clear evidence of well-developed prehistoric fishery activity that targeted sharks, rays and finfishes in a productive area influenced by coastal marine upwelling. The presence of adult and neonate shark, especially oceanic species, is here interpreted as evidence of prehistoric fisheries capacity for exploitation and possibly overexploitation in nursery areas. Various tools and strategies were used to capture finfish in seasonal fisheries, over rocky reef bottoms and in sandy littoral environments. Massive catches of whitemouth croaker, main target dermersal species of South Atlantic coast, show evidence of a reduction in body size of approximately 28% compared with modern fisheries. Fishery activity involving vulnerable species, especially in nursery areas, could mark the beginning of fish depletion along the southeastern Brazilian coast and the collapse of natural fish populations. ¬© 2016 Lopes et al.

In Alaska, the presence of both ancestral oceanic populations and derived landlocked populations, including recent lake introductions, allows us to examine rates and direction of evolution of osmoregulation following halohabitat transition. Hypotheses: Strong selection for enhanced freshwater tolerance will improve survival of recently lake-introduced stickleback in ion-poor conditions compared with their oceanic ancestors. Trade-offs between osmoregulation in fresh water and seawater will allow members of the ancestral population to survive better in response to seawater challenge, as mediated by upregulating salt-secreting transporters in the gill. Poorer hypo-osmoregulatory performance of derived fish will be marked by higher levels of taurine and other organic osmolytes. Methods: We reared clutches at a common salinity from an anadromous and a descendant population, Scout Lake, which has been landlocked for only two generations. We challenged 6-week-old juveniles with extreme low and high salinity treatments and sampled fish over 10 days to investigate putative molecular mechanisms underlying differences in halotolerance. We measured whole-body organic osmolyte content as well as gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) protein abundance. Other juveniles from these populations and also from Cheney Lake, a fourth-generation landlocked descendant, were gradually salt-acclimated to determine maximum halotolerance limits. Results: Scout Lake stickleback exhibited 67% higher survival in fresh water than the ancestral anadromous population, but individuals from both groups exhibited similar seawater tolerance. Likewise, the gradual salinity threshold for each population was equivalent (71 ppt). Gill NKA activity and NKCC abundance were both higher in seawater-challenged fish, but did not differ between populations. Sticklebacks from both populations responded to acute salinity stress by transiently increasing osmolyte levels in seawater and decreasing them in fresh water. Conclusion: Enhanced freshwater tolerance has evolved rapidly in recently landlocked stickleback compared with their anadromous ancestors (0.569 haldanes), but the former have retained ancestral seawater-osmoregulatory function. ¬© 2016 Jeffrey N.

Whaling killed almost three million whales in the twentieth century alone, with some populations estimated to have been reduced by 99% of their pristine abundance. Attempts to promote regulated, sustainable whaling by international agreement, notably through the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (1946), were almost immediately derailed by over-capitalization and profit-based self-interest. The major whaling nations used uncertainties in abundance estimates to ignore increasing evidence of population declines, and consistently exploited procedural flaws in the Convention to obstruct either the passage of rules designed to enact conservation measures or proposals for independent inspection of the industry. This major failure of regulatory efforts was exacerbated by secret, large-scale illegal whaling by the former Soviet Union and Japan that remained undisclosed for decades. Today, the status of the great whales varies widely: some species or populations are recovering strongly from exploitation, while a few others remain critically endangered. Although some whaling continues, the scale is greatly reduced from that of the twentieth century, and in this largely post-whaling world, other threats to whales are more significant. These include well-documented problems such as ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear, as well as issues for which population-level impacts are unclear (ocean noise) or largely unknown. The removal of so many whales by whaling likely significantly impacted the ecosystems in which they played a major role as consumers and, through their transport and recycling of nutrients, enhanced primary productivity. As populations recover, the effect of their reintegration into the marine environment represents a fascinating issue in ecosystem dynamics. Overall (and with some notable exceptions), whale populations will likely continue to recover; however, this generally optimistic outlook is clouded by the potential for large-scale oceanic ecosystem changes precipitated by global warming. ¬© 2016 by The Oceanography Society.","Article","Scopus",0.718682086688883,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,349,NA

In the Java Sea, the yearly monsoon cycle produces a complete reversal of the system currents, which strongly modifies the hydrological conditions. Winds and rainfall cause strong annual variations of the salinity in contrast to the uniform temperature. With the monsoon the whole circulation is changed and the water movements may be expected to have considerably bearing on the movements of fish. The Java Sea is inhabited by populations of fishes which have different behavior in relation to the variation of salinity. The landings of the purse seine fishery clearly show these changes. In the traditional fishing grounds the salinity is highly variable and the distribution of the populations of fishes changes according to the environmental conditions. In the eastern part of the Java Sea where the salinity is more stable the ratio of oceanic populations of fishes increases.The catches and the effort are strongly related to the winds and rainfall. There is a seasonal effect due to the monsoon. The reasons for such a consistent annual production cycle may reflect the response of fishermen to changes in the weather or of pelagic populations to more favourable environmental conditions that are similarly induced by the weather. ¬© 1990 IFREMER-Gauthier-Villars.","Article","Scopus",0.712200172560842,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,335,NA

The ecosystem model consists of a biogeochemical submodel embedded in a regional ocean circulation submodel, both coupled with a multi-species individual-based submodel for forage fish (sardine and anchovy) and California sea lions. Sardine and anchovy are explicitly represented in the model as they are commonly found in the diet of sea lions and exhibit significant interannual and decadal variability in population abundances that reflect variations in their environment and lower trophic level prey. Output from a 20 yr run (1989-2008) of the model demonstrates how different physical and biological processes control habitat utilization and foraging success of California sea lions on interannual time scales, with the dominant modes of variability linked to sardine abundance and coastal upwelling intensity. The results also illustrate how variability in environmental conditions, forage fish distribution, and prey assemblage affect sea lion feeding success. While specifically focusing on the foraging ecology of sea lions, the modeling framework has the ability to provide a more complete understanding of the physical and biological mechanisms impacting trophic interactions in the California Current, or other regions where similar fully coupled ecosystem models may be implemented. ¬© 2016 Inter-Research.","Article","Scopus",0.523029630219114,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,217,NA

Consequently, foraging is believed to be the main reason for the formation of whale shark aggregations. Feeding aggregations occur mainly in nearshore areas and are composed primarily of immature individuals. Conversely, aggregations of mature adults are rarely observed, and their occurrence is correlated with oceanic environments. Despite an increase in the number of whale shark studies, information on mating and parturition grounds is still lacking. In the present work, we assessed the ecological and behavioural aspects of the whale sharks that visit the archipelago of S√£o Pedro and S√£o Paulo (ASPSP), located ‚àº1,000 km off the coast of Brazil in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Forty-nine whale sharks were recorded from February 2005 to May 2014. The estimated mean - SD size was 8.27-2.52 m (range: 2.5-14.0 m) with no significant differences in size across the year. The maturational stages were classified by size as immature (<8.0 m; 32.56%) and mature (>9.0 m; 46.51%); with almost half of the observed animals being mature specimens. The majority of sightings occurred between February and June. During this period, the ocean current weakens and the waters are enriched by eggs and larvae of fishes and invertebrates that attract marine life to forage. At the same time, evidence of reproductive activity in adult females (i.e. swollen abdomen and bite marks on the pectoral fins), and the potential mating behaviour exhibited by one male, suggest that the ASPSP area might also have a role in whale shark reproduction. Irrespective of its use for feeding or reproduction, this insular habitat serves as a meeting point for both juvenile and adult whale sharks, and may play an important ecological role for the species. ¬© 2016 Macena, Hazin.

However, few studies have investigated these freshwater areas. Therefore, research must focus on establishing reference sites for aquatic conservation. We analyse the potential effects of water characteristics and the presence of an exotic predator fish, Gambusia holbrooki (Girard, 1859), on the abundance of an endemic aquatic beetle, Hydroporus guernei (R√©gimbart, 1891), on an oceanic island. During ten successive months, we sampled the abundance of H. guernei using a protocol that targeted macroinvertebrates in three temporary and two permanent ponds on Terceira Island, Azores archipelago. We also recorded the abundance of G. holbrooki, which was observed for the first time on the island, as well as the environmental characteristics of these ponds. H. guernei contributes a high degree of endemicity to the temporary ponds, while the exotic species only occurred in one permanent pond. The results of multiple regressions suggest that the abundance of H. guernei can be mainly explained by the conductivity (19.1%) and the abundance of G. holbrooki (14.5%). These results suggest that H. guernei is a species with a narrow tolerance to environmental changes. In addition, its abundance may be affected by the presence of G. holbrooki. We suggest that urgent monitoring actions be taken to control the abundance of this exotic fish in these ponds, thereby guaranteeing the conservation of endemic H. guernei populations. ¬© 2016 Asociaci√≥n Ib√©rica de Limnolog√≠a, Madrid.

However, these fish communities are difficult to monitor for logistic and financial reasons. Currently, monitoring of marine fishes largely relies on invasive techniques such as bottom trawling, and on official reporting of global catches, which can be unreliable. Thus, there is need for alternative and non-invasive techniques for qualitative and quantitative oceanic fish surveys. Here we report environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seawater samples from continental slope depths in Southwest Greenland. We collected seawater samples at depths of 188¬±918 m and compared seawater eDNA to catch data from trawling. We used Illumina sequencing of PCR products to demonstrate that eDNA reads show equivalence to fishing catch data obtained from trawling. Twenty-six families were found with both trawling and eDNA, while three families were found only with eDNA and two families were found only with trawling. Key commercial fish species for Greenland were the most abundant species in both eDNA reads and biomass catch, and interpolation of eDNA abundances between sampling sites showed good correspondence with catch sizes. Environmental DNA sequence reads from the fish assemblages correlated with biomass and abundance data obtained from trawling. Interestingly, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) showed high abundance of eDNA reads despite only a single specimen being caught, demonstrating the relevance of the eDNA approach for large species that can probably avoid bottom trawls in most cases. Quantitative detection of marine fish using eDNA remains to be tested further to ascertain whether this technique is able to yield credible results for routine application in fisheries. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that eDNA reads can be used as a qualitative and quantitative proxy for marine fish assemblages in deepwater oceanic habitats. This relates directly to applied fisheries as well as to monitoring effects of ongoing climate change on marine biodiversity-especially in polar ecosystems. ¬© 2016 Thomsen et al.","Article","Scopus",0.566882571300306,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,89,NA

We explored climate-driven oceanic variability as a source of estuarine variability by comparing monthly time series of temperature and chlorophyll-a inside San Francisco Bay with those in adjacent shelf waters of the California Current System (CCS) that are strongly responsive to wind-driven upwelling. Monthly temperature fluctuations inside and outside the Bay were synchronous, but their correlations weakened with distance from the ocean. These results illustrate how variability of coastal water temperature (and associated properties such as nitrate and oxygen) propagates into estuaries through fast water exchanges that dissipate along the estuary. Unexpectedly, there was no correlation between monthly chlorophyll-a variability inside and outside the Bay. However, at the annual scale Bay chlorophyll-a was significantly correlated with the Spring Transition Index (STI) that sets biological production supporting fish recruitment in the CCS. Wind forcing of the CCS shifted in the late 1990s when the STI advanced 40¬†days. This shift was followed, with lags of 1‚Äì3¬†years, by 3- to 19-fold increased abundances of five ocean-produced demersal fish and crustaceans and 2.5-fold increase of summer chlorophyll-a in the Bay. These changes reflect a slow biological process of estuary‚Äìocean connectivity operating through the immigration of fish and crustaceans that prey on bivalves, reduce their grazing pressure, and allow phytoplankton biomass to build. We identified clear signals of climate-mediated oceanic variability in this estuary and discovered that the response patterns vary with the process of connectivity and the timescale of ocean variability. This result has important implications for managing nutrient inputs to estuaries connected to upwelling systems, and for assessing their responses to changing patterns of upwelling timing and intensity as the planet continues to warm. ¬© 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd This article has been contributed to by US Government employees and their work is in the public domain in the USA.","Article","Scopus",0.517727073107404,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,317,NA

For locally rare species such removals could potentially lead to significant population level effects. However, information on the cetacean abundance and distribution is scarce. Similarly, it remains largely unreported where fishing fleets operate offshore. A cetacean survey took place during geophysical surveys (2013-2014) along the coasts of Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire. This provided a unique opportunity to study both offshore cetacean and fishing communities. Due to large group-sizes, melon-headed whales were the most abundant (0.34 animals km-1) followed by Fraser's dolphins and short-finned pilot whales. Range state records were confirmed for melon-headed whale and Fraser's dolphin in Ivoirian waters and ten further species represented first at-sea sightings. The artisanal fishing canoe was most abundant (92% of all vessels) and recorded up to 99.5 km from the Ghanaian coast. Asian trawlers operated over shelf areas and tuna purse-seine vessels in deep oceanic and slope waters. Fraser's dolphins, melon-headed whales, pantropical spotted dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and pilot whales were recorded in areas with the highest fishing densities. Melon-headed whales, pilot whales, and rough-toothed dolphins were observed in vicinity of trawlers; bottlenose dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, and pilot whales in vicinity of canoes. Some notable differences were found in the species composition between the present surveys and port-based surveys of landed cetaceans (bycatch/direct-captures). These may be explained by (1) feeding strategies (nocturnal vs. diurnal; surface vs. deep water); (2) different attractions to vessels/fishing gear; (3) variable body sizes; and (4) difficulty to positively identify species. Despite these differences, both cetaceans and fishing vessels predominantly occurred in shelf and slope waters (&lt; 1000 m depth contour), making fishery-related mortality likely. The poor knowledge on population trends of cetaceans in this unique upwelling region, together with a high demand for cetacean products for human consumption (as ""marine bushmeat"") may lead to a potential decline of some species that may go unnoticed. These new insights can provide a foundation for the urgently required risk assessments of cetacean mortality in fisheries within the northern Gulf of Guinea. ¬© 2016 de Boer, Saulino, Van Waerebeek and Aarts.","Article","Scopus",0.798760164041183,NA,"1",NA,NA,15,285,NA

While these processes generally increase larval survival, strong upwelling can also increase mortality due to an offshore transport of larvae towards unfavorable habitats. In 2013 a survey was conducted along the Senegalese coast to investigate the upwelling effect with regard to larval fish assemblages and possible larval fish retention. According to water column characteristics two distinct habitats during an upwelling event were discriminated, i.e. the inshore upwelled water and the transition area over the deepest part of the Senegalese shelf. Along the two areas 42,162 fish larvae were collected representing 133 species within 40 families. Highest larval fish abundances were observed in the inshore area and decreasing abundances towards the transition, indicating that certain fish species make use of the retentive function of the inner shelf area as spawning grounds. Two larval fish assemblages overlap both habitats, which are sharply delimited by a strong upwelling front. One assemblage inhabited the inshore/upwelling area characterized by majorly neritic and pelagic species (Sparidae spp., Sardinella aurita), that seem to take the advantage of a passive retention on the shelf. The second assemblage consisted of a mix of pelagic and mesopelagic species (Engraulis encrasicolus, Carangidae spp. and Myctophidae spp.). Some species of the second assemblage, e.g. horse mackerels (Trachurus trachurus and Trachurus trecae), large finned-lantern fish (Hygophum macrochir) and foureyed sole (Microchirus ocellatus), revealed larval peak occurrences at intermediate and deep water layers, where the near-ground upwelling layer is able to transport larvae back to the shelf. This indicates active larval retention for species that are dominant in the transition area. Diel vertical migration patterns of S.¬†aurita, E.¬†encrasicolus and M.¬†ocellatus revealed that a larval fish species may adapt its behavior to the local environment and do not necessarily follow a diurnal cycle. Field observations are essential to be integrated in larval drift models, since the vertical and horizontal larval distribution will have major consequences for survival. Comprehending larval survival mechanisms is necessary for the ultimate goal to understand and predict recruitment. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.574041455640073,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,149,NA

In tropical ecosystems, macroalgal habitats have recently been identified as nurseries for fish of commercial and conservation significance. Here, we explore how local-scale variations in seaweed habitat quality interact with large-scale climatic conditions (Southern Oscillation Index, SOI) to influence the recruitment of three tropical fish species (Lethrinus spp.), often targeted by fishers. New fish recruits and juveniles of all species were almost exclusively found in macroalgal nursery habitats, while adults of two of these species were predominantly found on adjacent coral reefs. Annual supply rates of new recruits were found to be strongly correlated to variations in the SOI, with La Nina conditions associated with higher recruitment. However, local rates of recruitment were generally poor predictors of older juvenile abundance. Instead, local juvenile abundance was more closely related to structural characteristics of macroalgae nursery habitat quality (density, canopy height, canopy cover) and/or predator biomass, at the time of survey, with species-specific habitat associations apparent. Given the dynamic nature of fish recruitment supply to the SOI, coupled with the effects of climatic and oceanic processes on the structure of macroalgal patches, these results suggest protection of macroalgal nursery habitats that maintain high canopy density, height and cover is critical to supporting the conservation of fish populations. ¬© 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography","Article","Scopus",0.712026130977289,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,268,NA

We present a study that incorporates stable isotopes and quantitative sampling to investigate the relative importance of different estuarine areas for juveniles of exploited prawn species within the context of habitat rehabilitation, and the potential drivers of these relationships. Eastern King Prawn (Penaeus [Melicertus] plebejus) and School Prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) were studied for two years in the lower Hunter River estuary, on the temperate east coast of Australia. The higher salinity areas near the lower end of the estuary were most important for Eastern King Prawn, and marsh systems in the lower estuary were only important for the species where there was good connectivity with oceanic water. Areas along the estuary were important for juvenile School Prawn, especially marsh habitats, and relative abundance tended to increase with increasing distance along the estuary. Designation of effective juvenile habitat for School Prawn may have been affected by high fishing mortality in fished areas, but this requires further investigation. Salinity, depth, turbidity and distance along the estuary were all important indicators of prawn distribution. The implications of these patterns for current and future habitat rehabilitation in temperate Australia are discussed. ¬© 2017","Article","Scopus",0.618526225868611,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,226,NA

Te surveys used an airborne lidar and vessel-based sampling, supported by near real time satellite observations of oceanic conditions. Te aerial survey was conducted from a fxed wing aircraft that few repeated surveys day and night, enabling data collection that was both broad-scale and synoptic. Vessel-based sampling included quantitative visual observations, trawl sampling, and qualitative dip-netting for species identifcations.

Large numbers of jellyfsh (Aurelia sp.) and low numbers of numerous other species were also observed. Te putative flying fsh aggregations had an average length scale of 6.1 km and an average population estimated at 10,000 individuals. While always near the surface, flying fsh aggregations were slightly deeper at night than during the day and found most often off the continental shelf in warm water with low chlorophyll concentrations.

With the reduction of this threat in many areas, coupled with other conservation actions, some populations have demonstrated encouraging recovery, although remaining below their previous levels and undergone additional modern threats such as incidental capture in fisheries and pollution. Trends in sea turtle populations have usually been assessed through monitoring of females or nests on nesting beaches. Here we present data from a 22-year monitoring period for a juvenile green sea turtle Chelonia mydas mixed-stock in southeastern Brazil that were incidentally captured in passive non-lethal pound nets. A total of 3639 green turtles were captured in 5323 fishing days.pound‚àí1 with mortality rate of 2%. Captures occurred in all months, but bycatch rates, excluding recapture events, were higher in September and October, probably due to the recruitment of turtles migrating from southern areas, as well as recruits from the oceanic zone.

Inside a laboratory flume, downstream-swimming eels were exposed to both live (putative attractant) and dead (putative repellent) conspecific washings to determine whether their trajectory of downstream movement, level of activity, or time spent inside targeted areas of the arena changed after exposure. Silver eels were not attracted to or repulsed by either odor, as none of five scoring metrics indicated a behavioral response. Results did not support the hypothesis that conspecific chemical cueing is a mechanism for downstream migration coordination or danger avoidance; however responses may not have been readily apparent in this type of assay.

Within this study, we developed a low-cost stereo-baited video camera (SBRUV) with high precision and accuracy able to deliver length frequency distributions, including the smallest juvenile fraction. The capacity of the SBRUV system increased the synopticity with respect to typical surveys. We tested the system over seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica in a Mediterranean bay, investigating the relationship of juvenile abundance and size of the sparid Diplodus annularis with depth, time of day and protection status (i.e. inside and outside of a Marine Protected Area, MPA).

Among 73 shark species documented in the eastern North Pacific (ENP), less than half reach maximum lengths > 200 cm, and 78% occur in demersal or benthic regions of the continental shelf or slope. Most small (‚â§ 200 cm) species (e.g., houndsharks) and demersal, nearshore juveniles of larger species (e.g., requiem sharks) consume small teleosts and decapod crustaceans, whereas large species in pelagic coastal and oceanic environments feed on large teleosts and squids. Several large, pelagic apex predator species occur in the ENP, but the largest species (i.e., Basking Shark, Whale Shark) consume zooplankton or small nekton. Size-based dietary variability is substantial for many species, and segregation of juvenile and adult foraging habitats also is common (e.g., Horn Shark, Shortfin Mako). Temporal dietary differences are most pronounced for temperate, nearshore species with wide size ranges, and least pronounced for smaller species in extreme latitudes and deep-water regions. Sympatric sharks often occupy various trophic positions, with resource overlap differing by space and time and some sharks serving as prey to other species. Most coastal species remain in the same general region over time and feed opportunistically on variable prey inputs (e.g., season migrations, spawning, or recruitment events), whereas pelagic, oceanic species actively seek hot spots of prey abundance that are spatiotemporally variable. The influence of sharks on ecosystem structure and regulation has been downplayed compared to that of large teleosts species with higher per capita consumption rates (e.g., tunas, billfishes). However, sharks also exert indirect influences on prey populations by causing behavioural changes that may result in restricted ranges and reduced fitness. Except for food web modelling efforts in Alaskan waters, the trophic impacts of sharks are poorly incorporated into current ecosystem approaches to fisheries management in the NEP. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Book Chapter","Scopus",0.619227725410531,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,395,NA

As humpback whales rebound from commercial whaling, their ability to influence their prey through top-down forcing increases. We compared the potential influence of foraging humpback whales on three herring populations in the coastal Gulf of Alaska: Prince William Sound, Lynn Canal, and Sitka Sound (133‚Äì147¬∞W; 57‚Äì61¬∞N) from 2007 to 2009. Information on whale distribution, abundance, diet and the availability of herring as potential prey were used to correlate populations of overwintering herring and humpback whales. In Prince William Sound, the presence of whales coincided with the peak of herring abundance, allowing whales to maximize the consumption of overwintering herring prior to their southern migration. In Lynn Canal and Sitka Sound peak attendance of whales occurred earlier, in the fall, before the herring had completely moved into the areas, hence, there was less opportunity for predation to influence herring populations. North Pacific humpback whales in the Gulf of Alaska may be experiencing nutritional stress from reaching or exceeding carrying capacity, or oceanic conditions may have changed sufficiently to alter the prey base. Intraspecific competition for food may make it harder for humpback whales to meet their annual energetic needs. To meet their energetic demands whales may need to lengthen their time feeding in the northern latitudes or by skipping the annual migration altogether. If humpback whales extended their time feeding in Alaskan waters during the winter months, the result would likely be an increase in herring predation. ¬© 2017 The Authors","Article","Scopus",0.749403495929031,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,82,NA

Intense exploitation over the past 65 years by a rapidly expanding high-seas fishing fleet has left many populations depleted, with consequences at the ecosystem level due to top-down control and trophic cascades. Despite increases in both CITES and IUCN Red Listings, the demographic trajectories of oceanic sharks and billfish are poorly quantified and resolved at geographic and population levels. Amongst MOFS trajectories, those of tunas are generally considered better understood, yet several populations remain either overfished or of unknown status. MOFS population trends and declines therefore remain contentious, partly due to challenges in deriving accurate abundance and biomass indices. Two major management strategies are currently recognised to address conservation issues surrounding MOFS: (i) internationally ratified legal frameworks and their associated regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs); and (ii) spatio-temporal fishery closures, including no-take marine protected areas (MPAs). In this context, we first review fishery-dependent studies relying on data derived from catch records and from material accessible through fishing extraction, under the umbrella of RFMO-administrated management. Challenges in interpreting catch statistics notwithstanding, we find that fishery-dependent studies have enhanced the accuracy of biomass indices and the management strategies they inform, by addressing biases in reporting and non-random effort, and predicting drivers of spatial variability across meso- and oceanic scales in order to inform stock assessments. By contrast and motivated by the increase in global MPA coverage restricting extractive activities, we then detail ways in which fishery-independent methods are increasingly improving and steering management by exploring facets of MOFS ecology thus far poorly grasped. Advances in telemetry are increasingly used to explore ontogenic and seasonal movements, and provide means to consider MOFS migration corridors and residency patterns. The characterisation of trophic relationships and prey distribution through biochemical analysis and hydro-acoustics surveys has enabled the tracking of dietary shifts and mapping of high-quality foraging grounds. We conclude that while a scientific framework is available to inform initial design and subsequent implementation of MPAs, there is a shortage in the capacity to answer basic but critical questions about MOFS ecology (who, when, where?) required to track populations non-extractively, thereby presenting a barrier to assessing empirically the performance of MPA-based management for MOFS. This sampling gap is exacerbated by the increased establishment of large (&gt;10000 km2) and very large MPAs (VLMPAs, &gt;100000 km2) - great expanses of ocean lacking effective monitoring strategies and survey regimes appropriate to those scales. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate the use of a non-extractive protocol to measure MOFS population recovery and MPA efficiency. We further identify technological avenues for monitoring at the VLMPA scale, through the use of spotter planes, drones, satellite technology, and horizontal acoustics, and highlight their relevance to the ecosystem-based framework of MOFS management. ¬© 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","Article","Scopus",0.692280095971256,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,355,NA

We modeled the probability of occurrence of dolphinfish as a function of spatial (geographical coordinates), temporal (month/year) and environmental variables (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll [CHL] and sea surface height [SSH], inferred from satellites) using logistic Generalized Additive Models. Dolphinfish preferred waters with SST values from 23 to 28¬∞C, low (&lt;0.2¬†mg/m3) CHL values, and primarily positive SSH values.

One of the first demonstrations of evolution of migration time was produced by monitoring allozyme alleles that were experimentally manipulated to genetically mark late-migrating pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). Here, we extend that research by using observations of the marker alleles in fry to demonstrate that these changes in migration time were caused by directional selection against the late-migrating phenotype during the oceanic phase of the salmonid life cycle. The selective event, which appeared to be driven by early vernal warming of the nearshore marine environment and consequent decreased survival of late-migrating fry relative to earlymigrating fry, decreased the late-migrating phenotype from more than 50% to approximately 10% of the total fry abundance in only one generation. These demographic changes have persisted over the subsequent 13 generations and suggest that a larger trend toward earlier migration time in this population may reflect adaptation to warming sea-surface temperatures. ¬© 2017 Canadian Science Publishing.

These assemblages were distributed in the north-frontal area of the Kuroshio Current within the slope area (A), the Kuroshio axis area (B), the subtropical area (C, D), and the coastal area within the slope area (E), indicating that such diverse communities were formed to correspond with the gradual change in the oceanic environment across the Kuroshio Current. The abundance of copepods in the north-frontal area of the Kuroshio Current (A) was 1.6 times greater than that of the other assemblages. Kuroshio/subtropical species were abundant in the assemblage, suggesting that these species that were transported from the Kuroshio and/or subtropical regions increased in the slope region. Abundance and species richness of two assemblages (C, D), which were found in the subtropical areas were higher at night (C) than during the day (D), suggesting that diel vertical migration of copepods is one of the most important factors affecting changes in the community. Furthermore, a generalized additive model revealed that the most dominant subtropical/Kuroshio species increased in years in which the Kuroshio Current flowed further south, with the Kuroshio axis located far from the Japanese coast. In contrast, the model showed that the lower latitude of the Kuroshio axis positioned negatively affected coastal-dominant species, such as Paracalanus parvus sensu lato (s.l.). These results indicate that onshore-offshore shifts of the Kuroshio axis caused by Kuroshio meandering was an important factor involved in the inter-annual change in the copepod community during April‚ÄìMay in the Kuroshio region, suggesting that the inter-annual change of copepod communities might affect survival and growth rates of larvae in pelagic migratory fish which utilize the Kuroshio region as spawning and nursery grounds. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.620844575173618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,77,NA

In this study, spatio-temporal variability in zooplankton community structure and size spectra on the Faroe shelf is investigated using observations from late April during the period 1997‚Äì2016. The main objective was to explore which environmental variables influence the zooplankton community structure in early spring. The zooplankton community in the permanently well mixed central shelf inside the tidal front consists of a mixture of neritic, cosmopolitan and oceanic species. In this region, redundancy analyses showed that chlorophyll concentration had a positive effect on abundance of neritic copepods and meroplankton as well as all zooplankton < 1.2 mm. The abundance variability of these species shows increased production around 2000 and 2008‚Äì2009. The highest zooplankton abundance, mainly consisting of Calanus finmarchicus, is however observed off-shore from the tidal front, especially on the western side of the Faroe Plateau. A shift in C. finmarchicus phenology occurred around 2007, resulting in earlier reproduction of this species, and this variability could not be explained by the employed regional environmental parameters.

Pelagic larval duration and recruitment phenology are 2 early life-history processes that are crucial for the biology, ecology, conservation, and management of amphidromous fishes. However, these processes are understudied in the Caribbean in general and have never been quantified in Puerto Rico. We quantified recruit abundance, recruitment phenology, and pelagic larval duration of several Caribbean amphidromous fish species in multiple rivers in Puerto Rico and explored the effects of environmental variables on recruit abundances. Two fish taxa - sirajo goby (Sicydium spp.) and River Goby (Awaous banana) - were exceptionally abundant as postlarvae and recruited to Caribbean rivers in pulsed migration episodes that were periodic at annual and lunar scales. Sirajo goby and River Goby recruit abundances varied among rivers, were greater at sunrise than at sunset, and were positively related to river discharge.

Here we use conventional bioeconomic theory to demonstrate that inherent biological constraints combined with nonlinear supply‚àídemand relationships can generate threshold effects due to harvesting. As a result, increases in overall demand due to human population growth or improvement in real income would be expected to induce critical transitions from high-yield/low-price fisheries to low-yield/high-price fisheries, generating severe strains on social and economic systems as well as compromising resource conservation goals. As a proof of concept, we show that key predictions of the critical transition hypothesis are borne out in oceanic fisheries (cod and pollock) that have experienced substantial increase in fishing pressure over the past 60 y. A hump-shaped relationship between price and historical harvest returns, well demonstrated in these empirical examples, is particularly diagnostic of fishery degradation. Fortunately, the same heuristic can also be used to identify reliable targets for fishery restoration yielding optimal bioeconomic returns while safely conserving resource abundance. ¬© 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Kelp forests in remote, offshore locations may provide an informative contrast due to reduced impacts from local stressors. We tested the hypothesis that shallow kelp assemblages (12‚Äì15 m depth) and associated fish and benthic communities in the coastal southwest Gulf of Maine (GOM) differed significantly from sites on Cashes Ledge, 145 km offshore by sampling five coastal and three offshore sites at 43.0 +/- 0.07 N latitude. Offshore sites on Cashes Ledge supported the greatest density (47.8 plants m2) and standing crop biomass (5.5 kg m2 fresh weight) of the foundation species Saccharina latissima kelp at this depth in the Western North Atlantic. Offshore densities of S. latissima were over 150 times greater than at coastal sites, with similar but lower magnitude trends for congeneric S. digitata. Despite these differences, S. latissima underwent a significant 36.2% decrease between 1987 and 2015 on Cashes Ledge, concurrent with a rapid warming of the GOM and invasion by the kelp-encrusting bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. In contrast to kelp, the invasive red alga Dasysiphonia japonica was significantly more abundant at coastal sites, suggesting light or dispersal limitation offshore. Spatial differences in fish abundance mirrored those of kelp, as the average biomass of all fish on Cashes Ledge was 305 times greater than at the coastal sites. Remote video censuses of cod (Gadus morhua), cunner (Tautaogolabrus adspersus), and pollock (Pollachius virens) corroborated these findings. Understory benthic communities also differed between regions, with greater abundance of sessile invertebrates offshore. Populations of kelp-consuming sea urchins Stronglyocentrotus droebachiensis, were virtually absent from Cashes Ledge while small urchins were abundant onshore, suggesting recruitment limitation offshore. Despite widespread warming of the GOM since 1987, extraordinary spatial differences in the abundance of primary producers (kelp), consumers (cod) and benthic communities between coastal and offshore sites have persisted. The shallow kelp forest communities offshore on Cashes Ledge represent an oasis of unusually high kelp and fish abundance in the region, and as such, comprise a persistent abundance hotspot that is functionally significant for sustained biological productivity of offshore regions of the Gulf of Maine. ¬© 2018 Witman, Lamb.

Variation in these currents is typically driven by large-scale changes in climate, in particular ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation). The dependence on large-scale climatic changes may, however, be modified by early life history traits of marine taxa. Based on eight years of annual surveys, along 150¬†km of coastline, we examined how ENSO influenced abundance of juvenile fish, coral spat, and canopy-forming macroalgae. We then investigated what traits make populations of some fish families more reliant on the ENSO relationship than others. Abundance of juvenile fish and coral recruits was generally positively correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), higher densities recorded during La Ni√±a years, when the ENSO-influenced Leeuwin Current is stronger and sea surface temperature higher. The relationship is typically positive and stronger among fish families with shorter pelagic larval durations and stronger swimming abilities. The relationship is also stronger at sites on the coral back reef, although the strongest of all relationships were among the lethrinids (r¬†=.9), siganids (r¬†=.9), and mullids (r¬†=.8), which recruit to macroalgal meadows in the lagoon. ENSO effects on habitat seem to moderate SOI‚Äìjuvenile abundance relationship. Macroalgal canopies are higher during La Ni√±a years, providing more favorable habitat for juvenile fish and strengthening the SOI effect on juvenile abundance. Conversely, loss of coral following a La Ni√±a-related heat wave may have compromised postsettlement survival of coral dependent species, weakening the influence of SOI on their abundance. This assessment of ENSO effects on tropical fish and habitat-forming biota and how it is mediated by functional ecology improves our ability to predict and manage changes in the replenishment of marine populations. ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Seabirds, as aerial predators which cover extensive areas across the oceans, can potentially be used to enhance our knowledge on the distribution and abundance of their prey. In this study, we combined tracking data and dietary data from individual Cory's shearwaters Calonectris borealis (n = 68) breeding in Selvagens archipelago, Madeira, Portugal, during the chick-rearing periods of 2011 and 2016, in order to infer prey origin within shearwaters‚Äô main foraging areas. The digestion state of each prey item in the diet was assessed and classified; and compared to digestion states from known prey items fed to captive birds. In a novel approach, we combined tracking data with information on the prey digestion duration and data on the transit times from foraging grounds to the colony to estimate the location of prey capture. We found a consistent heterogeneity in prey distribution across four different marine domains: Selvagens, deep-sea, seamounts, and continental shelf. In oceanic areas, the chub mackerel Scomber colias, the main prey of Cory's shearwaters, was strongly associated with seamounts and insular shelves, whereas oceanic species like pilot-fish, flying-squid, flying-fish were clearly associated with deep-sea waters. Sardines Sardina pilchardus, anchovies Engraulis encrasicolus and other coastal species were associated with the African shelf. Prey origin assignment was robust across three different sets of assumptions, and was also supported by information on the digestion state of prey collected over a large independent sampling period (671 samples, collected in 2008‚Äì2010). The integration of fine-scale dietary and foraging trip data from marine predators provides a new framework to gain insights into the distribution and abundance of prey species in poorly known oceanic areas. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.623253713554306,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,295,NA

Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40¬∞N‚Äì50¬∞N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.581249093496739,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,173,NA

Therefore, the prevalence of PRV and SAV in returning salmon caught in six sea sites was determined using real-time RT-PCR analyses. Of 419 salmon tested, 15.8% tested positive for PRV, while none were positive for SAV. However, scale reading revealed that 10% of the salmon had escaped from farms. The prevalence of PRV in wild salmon (8%) was significantly lower than in farm escapees (86%), and increased with fish length (proxy for age). Sequencing of the S1 gene of PRV from 39 infected fish revealed a mix of genotypes. The observed increase in PRV prevalence with fish age and the lack of phylogeographic structure of the virus could be explained by virus transmission in the feeding areas.

High trophic-level organisms are influenced by fluctuations of prey quality and abundance, which themselves may depend on climate oscillations. Modeling effects of such fluctuations is challenging because prey populations may vary with multiple climate oscillations occurring at different time scales. The analysis of a 28-yr time series of capture‚Äìrecapture data of a tropical seabird, the Nazca Booby (Sula granti), in the Gal√°pagos, Ecuador, allowed us to test for demographic effects of two major ocean oscillations occurring at distinct time-scales: the inter-annual El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and inter-decadal oscillations. As expected for a tropical seabird, survival of fledgling birds was highly affected by extreme ENSO events; by contrast, neither recruitment nor breeding participation were affected by either ENSO or decadal oscillations. More interesting, adult survival, a demographic trait that canalizes response to environmental variations, was unaffected by inter-annual ENSO oscillations yet was shaped by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and small pelagic fish regime. Adult survival decreased during oceanic conditions associated with higher breeding success, an association probably mediated in this species by costs of reproduction that reduce survival when breeding attempts end later. To our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that survival of a vertebrate can be vulnerable to a natural multidecadal oscillation. ¬© 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","Article","Scopus",0.615236944259633,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,385,NA

Nevertheless, ecological factors driving copepod co-existence and population dynamics are still largely unknown. Here, we aimed to explore feeding habits of four copepod species commonly found in Mediterranean seagrass detritus accumulations, representing distinct eco-morphotypes (planktonic, phytal, epibenthic and mesopsammic). Joint use of fatty acid and stable isotope trophic markers showed that co-occurring harpacticoid copepods have diversified diets. Contrary to what was expected, microphytobenthos does not serve as their main food source. Instead, we found evidence from both techniques that major food items include heterotrophic biomass, macro-epiphytes and, depending on eco-morphology and season, of seagrass detritus-derived organic matter. Isotopic niches suggested that eco-morphotypes showed resource segregation. This segregation varies temporally, and partial overlap occurs between niches of phytal and epibenthic eco-morphotypes in some seasons. Our results highlight that, contrary to what is often assumed for meiofaunal consumers, considerable trophic diversity exists among copepod assemblages. They also indicate that, through multiple non-exclusive possible mechanisms, copepods could constitute a major link between seagrass detritus and associated biomass and higher trophic levels (namely macroinvertebrates and juvenile fish). ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Scopus",0.325581491547022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,401,NA

There is also mounting evidence, mostly from continental shelf regions, that such positive effects will depend on the species ecological traits (e.g. mobility) and on the characteristics of the reserves (e.g. design, age and enforcement). This study examines the effects of protection on commercial coastal fishes with different ecological traits from three marine reserves with distinct habitats (coastal vs. offshore reefs), protection regime (legal vs. voluntary, partial vs. total protection) and age (8, 15 and 26 years old) across the oceanic archipelago of the Azores, mid North Atlantic. Overall, positive effects of protection on fish abundance or individual size were limited to species of larger maximum size and lower mobility in reserves with higher compliance levels. This result agrees with many studies elsewhere showing that reserves of small size and/or insufficient compliance do not provide adequate protection to the entire fish community, limiting their contribution to manage fisheries and conserve biodiversity. That might very well be the case of Azorean marine reserves but a more conclusive result will require testing the effects of protection on larger, well enforced reserves, which still do not exist in the region. There was also a clear influence of depth in commercial fish distribution and a common preference for substrates of higher complexity across ecological traits. Combined, these results highlight the need to include complex reef structures, diverse coastal habitats and larger areas when designing multispecies marine reserves and stress that an appropriate management regime is crucial for the success of the reserve, in particular to promote compliance. ¬© 2018","Article","Scopus",0.672878548949966,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,390,NA

These areas provide different ecosystem services, but with the increase of population and of the varied economic activities, the barely known local natural resources may be negatively impacted. Thus this research aimed to study plankton dynamics, productivity and ecological balance for the area during the dry season of 2012. For this, we established 17 stations and studied the monthly variation and spatial distribution of inorganic nutrients, temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, photic zone, plankton and fish larvae abundance and composition with standard methods, while spatial and temporal patterns where identified using cluster and multidimentional scaling analyses. Obtained results of biotic and abiotic parameters defined a pattern characteristic of productive estuarine zones as well as the existence of three specific areas associated with the natural and anthropic conditions of the area, such as: a) inner part of the Jambel√≠ Archipelago and in front of Pun√° island influenced by productive activities and the hydrography of the area; B) an area, formed by the stations located in the outer estuary where the oceanic influence is evident and c) the Jambel√≠ channel, characterized by mixing processes resulting from tides flow. This was supported by the presence of oceanic, neritic and estuarine phytoplankton; copepods with uniform distribution in the study area, and dominance of Engraulidae fish larvae, representative of this type of aquatic ecosystem. Temporally, rainfall records in May exceeded normal values, which would have influenced the high concentrations of nutrients, decrease of salinity and of the photic zone registered during this month. However, the availability of nutrients throughout the study period, allowed to maintain the composition and abundance of phytoplankton, with changes in representative species, recorded periods of greater (June to August) and lower (October to December) zooplankton abundance, could be the result of specific population patterns of present species, and the influence of the tide and the flows of the contributing river basin. A similar behavior was recorded for ichthioplankton, as a result of Anchoa macrolepidota concentrations, species, characteristics of this type of ecosystem. These patterns of spatio-temporal distribution, allowed the development of multiple abiotic and biotic interactions that determine different strategies to maintain the productivity of the area.

When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora 3,4 . Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (Œ¥15N) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of Œ¥15N were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean. ¬© 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus",0.499701876227987,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,80,NA

GAM indicated that very high squid abundance was associated with low values of dissolved oxygen (6.01‚Äì6.27¬†mg/L), sea surface temperature (28.03‚Äì28.62¬∞C), pH (7.75‚Äì8.56), salinity (30.42‚Äì34.48 psu), chlorophyll-a (0.4‚Äì0.6¬†mg/m3), zooplankton biomass (0.23‚Äì0.64¬†mL/m3), and shallow 20¬∞C isotherm (101.2‚Äì134.7¬†m) and mixed layer depth (17.8‚Äì29.8¬†m). As a carnivore from paralarval stages, S. oualaniensis depends on secondary and tertiary production to sustain its population for which primary production is used up. In the tropical Arabian Sea where temperature differences are not so pronounced, S. oualaniensis distribution was found to be related to a low but very narrow sea surface temperature¬†(SST) band. There is sufficient fishable biomass in the area to possibly launch a new targeted oceanic squid fishery from the western seaboard of India. ¬© 2018, ¬© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus",0.618664419537295,"0",NA,NA,10,NA,13,NA

Two independent, yet complementary time series, CalCOFI ichthyoplankton surveys and sampling of southern California power plant cooling-water intakes, have indicated that an assemblage of predominantly cool-water affinity fishes spanning nearshore to oceanic environments in the southern CCS has declined dramatically from the 1970s to the 2000s. We examined potential oceanographic drivers behind this decline both within and north of the CalCOFI survey area in order to capture upstream processes as well. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses using output from a data-assimilative regional ocean model revealed significant relationships between the fish time series and spatial patterns of upwelling, upper ocean heat content and eddy kinetic energy in the CCS. Correlation and linear regression analyses indicated that the declining trend in fish abundance was correlated with a suite of factors: reduced offshore and increased inshore upwelling; a long term warming trend combined with more recent interannual variability in ocean temperature; weaker eddy kinetic energy north of Point Conception (35¬∞N), potentially indicating reduced transport of the California Current (CC); increased influence of the California Undercurrent (CUC); and a decline in zooplankton displacement volume across the southern CCS. Understanding how changes in oceanography affect fish populations will offer insights into managing fisheries in a changing climate. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.623624296757926,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,43,NA

This study used generalized additive models (GAMs) fitted to Taiwanese longline fishery data from 1990 to 2009 and investigated the association between environmental variables and catch rates to identify the processes influencing bigeye tuna distribution in the Atlantic Ocean. The present findings reveal that the year (temporal factor), latitude and longitude (spatial factors), and major regular longline target species of albacore catches are significant for the standardization of bigeye tuna catch rates in the Atlantic Ocean. The standardized catch rates and distribution of bigeye tuna were found to be related to environmental and climatic variation. The model selection processes showed that the selected GAMs explained 70% of the cumulative deviance in the entire Atlantic Ocean. Regarding environmental factors, the depth of the 20 degree isotherm (D20) substantially contributed to the explained deviance; other important factors were sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height deviation (SSHD). The potential fishing grounds were observed with SSTs of 22‚Äì28¬∞C, a D20 shallower than 150¬†m and negative SSHDs in the Atlantic Ocean. The higher predicted catch rates were increased in the positive northern tropical Atlantic and negative North Atlantic Oscillation events with a higher SST and shallow D20, suggesting that climatic oscillations affect the population abundance and distribution of bigeye tuna. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.573107126494913,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,254,NA

The countries where multiple anguillid species occur have become important sources for supplying glass eels. In East Asia, the giant marble eel Anguilla marmorata was a bycatch species in the glass eel fisheries for A. japonica, whose population has declined dramatically over the recent three decades. We quantify the impact of glass eel fisheries on the bycatch of A. marmorata using a generalized depletion model with transit stock structure and examine the possible ecological origin of the bycatch. The catch and effort data from the glass eel fisheries targeting A. japonica in the estuary of the Shuang River, northeastern Taiwan, from 1981 to 1994 was used as an example. Compared to A. japonica, A. marmorata had lower catches, lower estimates of abundance, and higher variability in abundance among recruitment waves. The number of recruitment waves, exploitation rate, and relative escapement for A. marmorata were generally similar to those for A. japonica, implying similar impacts from the glass eel fisheries. The abundance estimates did not correlate with minimum annual sea surface temperature. Similarities in the early life history characteristics of A. marmorata and A. japonica could indicate possible ecological origins for the bycatch of A. marmorata, such as a similar splitting mechanism controlled by eddies during larval-stage oceanic migration. Lower abundance and higher variability in A. marmorata might result from a year-round opportunistic spawning pattern, or a strategy corresponding to the distribution edge. The generalized depletion model applied to anguillid glass eel fisheries for multiple vulnerable species showed that similar exploitation pressures may occur for both targeted and non-targeted species. This finding may be applicable to countries in Southeast Asia and Africa where multiple species of anguillid eels occur. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.597055266492126,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,341,NA

Recently, the snake pipefish underwent a short-lived, yet substantial, increase in abundance and range expansion into arctic waters. However, little is known about the species' population structure or if different ecotypes contributed to this outbreak. Specimens (n = 178) were sampled from 25 locations from six regions spanning 1.9 million km2. A fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and control region was used to assess population structure and genetic diversity. Both loci showed high haplotype diversity (Hd) and low nucleotide diversity (œÄ) over all sampled locations. A genetic signature of population expansion was evident through mismatch distributions and tests for recent population expansion (Fu's Fs, Tajima's D and R2). Effective population size analyses (Bayesian skyline plot) suggest an expansion 50-100 thousand years before present. However, we found neither significant population differentiation (analysis of molecular variance) among regions nor evidence of genetically distinct ecotypes. This lack of structure is probably due to a pelagic life style, fast development and long distance dispersal aided by ocean currents.

Patch size can influence species behaviour, movement, feeding and predation rates, with flow-on consequences for the diversity of species that inhabit these patches. To understand the importance of patchiness on regional species pools, we measured decapod richness and abundance in several seagrass patches with contrasting sizes. Additionally, we evaluated potential drivers of patch-specific species distribution including resource abundance, predator habitat use and the structural complexity of patches. Our results showed a non-random distribution of decapod species: small patches were clear hotspots of diversity and abundance, particularly of larger-bodied epifaunal decapods. Interestingly, these hotspots were characterized by lower nutrient resources, lower canopy height, but also lower predator use. Small fish invertivores such as Coris julis and several species of Symphodus were mostly restricted to large patches. These resident predators may be critical in clumping predation in large patches with consequences for how biodiversity of their prey is distributed across the seascape. Our results highlight the idea that a habitat mosaic with both large and small seagrass patches would potentially bolster biodiversity because preys and predators may seek refuge in patches of different sizes. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.495394431776986,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,271,NA

EN 1982-83 exceeded all these earlier events in strength and duration, and was the first to be investigated in more detail, both on a latitudinal gradient and including, for the first time, the benthic subsystem of the Humboldt Current upwelling area off the west coast of South America. Despite the fact that the coverage of the area of major impact (over 4,000 km of coastline) was by no means complete, and that most of the causes and mechanisms behind the observed changes remained unclear due to the lack of experimental (e.g. tolerance) studies, the observational evidence and the fluctuations observed in the landing statistics have contributed a great deal to our understanding of the way in which a major EN event affects the upwelling system as a whole. In the pelagic subsystem, a surface temperature increase of up to 11¬∞C, the effects of which could be traced down to at least 1,000 m depth, led to a tropicalization of the ecosystem, the disruption of the normal food web, and induced changes in species composition and migrations of a large number of fish and invertebrate species populations. This resulted in a general impoverishment of this system. The consequences for some commercially important species, which had already been damaged by former EN events and the impact of overfishing, were severe off Peru and Ecuador although there were certain positive effects due to the inshore migration of various oceanic mackerels and the southward migration of (sub)tropical fish species such as dolphinfish and skipjack tuna. These beneficial effects were, however, only of minor importance for the fisheries, which were not equipped to deal with the new target species. In the benthic subsystem, a factor of major importance, besides the increase in temperature, was the marked increase of dissolved oxygen at the seafloor during and after the event. Despite mass mortalities of many of the cold-water adapted invertebrate species on sandy beaches, shallow soft bottoms and in the rocky intertidal zone, the overall effect on fisheries was rather positive. In the case of commercially exploited shellfish (‚Äúmariscos‚Äù), this was due to an increased immigration of subtropical species, mostly crustaceans, as well as increases in abundance of some local species more tolerant of warm water such as the Peruvian scallop. This led to an unprecedented boom of some fisheries on the northern and central Peruvian coast. For the demersal fisheries and the artisanal finfish fishery, the immediate effects of EN were detrimental due to a general dispersal and downslope migration of many species, but the long-term effects appeared to have been beneficial: improved feeding conditions at the seafloor and decreased fishing pressure caused a major recruitment success of some species such as Pacific hake, and this may provide increased catches several years after EN. The primary EN effects described in this review apparently induced many secondary effects. The disruption of the pelagic food web caused mortalities and reproductive failures of guano birds and seals; mortalities (including marine algae) and increases in population abundance in shallow water led to temporary changes in species composition and successional processes that remain to be studied in more detail. On the whole, however, recovery of most species occurred rapidly, and relatively few long-term effects have remained, demonstrating the remarkable resilience of the upwelling ecosystem. ¬© 1990, Elsevier B.V.

The theory underlying most of these methods assumes the independence of the observed CPUEs. This assumption is invalid for a fish population because of their spatial autocorrelation. To overcome this problem, we incorporated spatial autocorrelation into the standard general linear model (GLM). We also incorporated into it a habitat-based model (HBM), to reflect, more effectively, the vertical distributions of tuna. As a case study, we fitted both the standard-GLM and spatial-GLM (with or without HBM) to the yellowfin tuna CPUE data of the Japanese longline fisheries in the Indian Ocean. Four distance models (Gaussian, exponential, linear and spherical) were examined for spatial autocorrelation. We found that the spatial-GLMs always produced the best goodness-of-fit to the data and gave more realistic estimates of the variances of the parameters, and that HBM-based GLMs always produced better goodness-of-fit to the data than those without. Of the four distance models, the Gaussian model performed the best. The point estimates of the relative indices of the abundance of yellowfin tuna differed slightly between standard and spatial GLMs, while their 95% confidence intervals from the spatial-GLMs were larger than those from the standard-GLM. Therefore, spatial-GLMs yield more robust estimates of the relative indices of the abundance of yellowfin tuna, especially when the nominal CPUEs are strongly spatially autocorrelated. ¬© 2004 Elsevier B.V.
