We assess the validity of their concerns by reviewing the published literature on effects of predators on rabbit abundance. In New Zealand, where rabbits and their predators are introduced, predators appear to have relatively little effect on rabbit numbers compared with other factors leading to mortality, such as disease, flooding of burrows and burrow collapse. Similarly, in Australia, rabbit numbers are driven primarily by climate and its effects on food abundance and quality, and by disease. However, where rabbit numbers are low following drought or major epizootics, predation can limit population recovery. In the Iberian Peninsula, where rabbits and their predators are indigenous, the effects of predators are unknown, as they are often confounded by other factors. Rabbit numbers are influenced mostly by habitat, food, disease and rainfall. Elsewhere in Europe, predators have their strongest effect when rabbit numbers have been reduced by other factors, but have little effect on high-density rabbit populations. In Australasia, abundance of predators (especially rabbit specialists) can usually be predicted from rabbit abundance, not vice versa. Although predation effects can be limiting under certain conditions, they are minor compared to the roles of climate, food, disease and habitat. A key unresolved question is whether those circumstances where predator control might lead to increases in rabbit populations can be identified with enough certainty to allow reliable predictions to be generated. One approach is to implement robust rabbit, predator and disease monitoring programmes at sites with predator control operations. Data on changes in rabbits, predators, and disease prevalence could be combined with local data on other key factors to facilitate reasonable inference about effects of predators on rabbits. The inclusion of carefully matched non-treatment areas is crucial if such programmes are to succeed. ¬© 2015 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.551293457,1,NA,May contain data on abundances,5,NA,1,NA

Forest dependent species, including arboreal mammals, are particularly sensitive to these changes due to their highly specific habitat requirements and inability or reluctance to cross the urban matrix. We addressed this problem using a case study of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in fragmented urban landscapes of southeast Queensland, Australia. We applied a mixed effect modeling approach clustered by patch to quantify the importance of site-level habitat factors relative to edge contrast and habitat patch size on squirrel glider abundance. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in glider age and sex in interior habitats compared to road and residential edges. We found that edge contrast had a strong negative effect on the abundance of squirrel gliders but is conditional on the presence of a low numbers of unreliable flowering overstorey trees and the availability of critical resources such as nest hollows at a site. We also found that older male gliders prefer forest fragment interiors over road and residential edge habitats. We conclude that although interior habitats are ideal to maintain large stable populations, the conservation value of low contrast edges containing key site-level resources should not be underestimated for arboreal mammals such as the squirrel glider. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The extent of these declines from forested areas of south-eastern Australia, however, remains poorly understood. In this paper we use sub-fossil deposits of the sooty owl (Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa) as a tool for understanding the diversity of the small mammal palaeocommunity. These results are compared to the contemporary sooty owl diet from the same geographical region to investigate the degree of small mammal decline following European settlement. Of 28 mammal species detected in sub-fossil deposits and considered prey items of the sooty owl at the time of European settlement, only 10 species were detected in the contemporary sooty owl diet. Numerous small mammal species have not only recently suffered severe declines in distribution and abundance but have also recently undergone niche contraction, as they occupied a greater diversity of regions and habitats at the time of European settlement. For some species our understanding of their true ecological niche and ecological potential is therefore limited. The species that underwent the greatest declines occupied open habitat types or were terrestrial. The severity of decline is also likely to have resulted in severe disruption of ecosystem functions, with wide scale ecosystem consequences. There is an urgent need to improve small mammal conservation, to maintain crucial ecosystem functions performed by small mammals. It is recommended that broad-scale exotic predator control programs are conducted which may also provide suitable conditions for the re-introduction of locally extinct species. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Aggressive behaviour of top predators may have strong effects on the distribution and abundance of mesopredator species. Such interactions between predator species can reduce the intensity of predation on vulnerable prey. Suppression of mesopredators by top predators is a potentially important process that could protect small prey species from unsustainable predation. 2. There is some evidence that in Australia, the dingo Canis lupus suppresses populations of the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This interaction could be significant to biodiversity conservation because while dingoes have been in Australia for several thousand years and coexist with a wide range of small mammals, the fox is a recent arrival which has caused declines and extinctions, and continues to threaten many prey species. 3. However the strength of the effect of dingoes on foxes is unclear, and some published data have been interpreted as demonstrating no relationship between abundance of the two species. These data come from forested habitats in eastern Australia, and may suggest that negative relationships of dingoes and foxes do not occur in complex habitats. 4. We re-analyse published data on fox vs. wild dog (i.e. dingoes plus, potentially, feral dogs and hybrids) abundance in eastern forests. These data reveal a triangular relationship of fox to wild dog density: when wild dogs are abundant, foxes are consistently rare, while when wild dogs are rare, foxes may be abundant but are not always so. This suggests that the abundance of wild dogs sets an upper limit on the abundance of foxes, but does not fully determine fox abundance. 5. Standard regression and correlation methods are not appropriate for analysing such triangular relationships. We apply two statistical methods that can be used to characterize the edges of data distributions, and use these to demonstrate a negative relationship of maximum fox abundance to the abundance of wild dogs. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis adds to evidence that dingoes may have negative effects on red foxes in a wide range of habitats, and therefore, that dingoes may be significant to conservation of mammal biodiversity in Australia. It also illustrates problems and solutions in the statistical analysis of abundance of one species as a function of the abundance of another species with which it has a strong interaction. ¬© 2008 British Ecological Society.",Article,Open Access,Scopus,0.673253808,1,NA,"Questionable, indicates time frame (uses the term 'when' rather than 'where')",5,NA,5,NA

In coastal habitats surrounding Jervis Bay in south-eastern Australia, R. rattus co-occurs with the native bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, and brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii. Relative distributions and abundances, and fine-scale space use suggest invasive and native rodents compete for use of space and habitat. Such competitive interactions were not evident between R. rattus and native A. stuartii, which was negatively influenced more by disturbance to habitat. Differences in rodent communities between spatially separate forests forming the northern and southern peninsulas of Jervis Bay potentially reflect symmetrical competition and differences in competitive outcomes. In southern forests, R. rattus was largely restricted to patches of disturbed forest associated with campgrounds. Competitive interference by native rodent populations inhabiting surrounding intact forests may have so far limited R. rattus colonization of these areas. In northern forests, R. rattus was the predominant rodent irrespective of disturbance, while populations of R. fuscipes were unusually low seemingly due to poor juvenile recruitment. Native individuals avoided areas frequented by adult R. rattus and given that species did not partition use of microhabitats, R. rattus most likely precluded R. fuscipes from suitable habitat and in doing so limited native populations. We discuss how natural disturbance of habitat and human activity have potentially facilitated successful invasion by R. rattus of the northern forests. Studies that manipulate rodent populations are required to support these interpretations of observed patterns. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.61742874,0,NA,NA,5,NA,6,NA

Eleven mammal and 14 bird species were recorded, but Australian possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) predominated, and pukekos (Porphyrio porphyrio), mynas (Acridotheres tristis), and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibiceri) were the most common birds.

We examined the impact of poisoning of foxes on the relative abundance of a group of medium-sized mammals in an experiment conducted in three large forest blocks in south-eastern Australia. The blocks consisted of paired sites, as follows: one site where poison baiting was used to control foxes (treatment site) and one where foxes were not controlled (non-treatment site). At all six sites, the population responses of a range of mammals were measured, and compared between treatment and non-treatment sites. The relative fox abundance, as indexed by bait-take, declined during the course of the study at treatment sites and to a lesser extent at non-treatment sites. The decline in bait-take at non-treatment sites was most likely due to treatment sites acting as ecological traps, so that reduced intra-specific competition attracted foxes from non-treatment to treatment sites, where they were subsequently poisoned. There was a significant treatment effect for the abundances of total mammals, long-nosed potoroos, southern brown bandicoots and common brushtail possums, with higher abundances at treatment sites than at non-treatment sites. Common ringtail possums increased in abundance during the course of the study, with no significant difference between treatment and non-treatment sites. There was no significant effect of time or treatment on the abundance of long-nosed bandicoots. The increase in the abundance of native mammals at treatment sites was most likely due to a lower predation pressure by foxes brought about by fox control, and the smaller increase in abundance in non-treatment blocks was likely due to the ecological-trap effect because of fox baiting at treatment sites. The present study demonstrated that broad-scale fox control can lead to increases in the abundance of native mammals in forested habitats, without recourse to aerial baiting or fences. The study also demonstrated that the influence of fox control on the fox abundance can extend well beyond the perimeter of the area baited. ¬© 2009 CSIRO.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.677840327,1,NA,"Fox populations were reduced, population responses of other species were recorded.

CWR extinctions have been attributed largely to the effects of introduced or invasive mammals; however, the impact of these threatening processes on smaller mammals and reptiles is less clear. The change in small mammal and reptile assemblages after the removal of rabbits, cats and foxes was studied over a 6-year period in a landscape-scale exclosure in the Australian arid zone. Rodents, particularly Notomys alexis and Pseudomys bolami, increased to 15 times higher inside the feral-proof Arid Recovery Reserve compared with outside sites, where rabbits, cats and foxes were still present. Predation by cats was thought to exert the greatest influence on rodent numbers owing to the maintenance of the disparity in rodent responses through dry years and the differences in dietary preferences between rabbits and P. bolami. The presence of introduced Mus domesticus or medium-sized re-introduced mammal species did not significantly affect resident small mammal or reptile abundance. Abundance of most dasyurids and small lizards did not change significantly after the removal of feral animals although reductions in gecko populations inside the reserve may be attributable to second order trophic interactions or subtle changes in vegetation structure and cover.

During this time, the study area burnt in an intense fire in December 1972 and was partially burnt in November 1980. Both fires were associated with prolonged drought. The mammals studied comprised two dasyurid marsupials, Antechinus agilis and A. swainsonii, two native murid rodents, Rattus fuscipes and R. lutreolus, and the introduced house mouse Mus musculus. After intensive sampling throughout the year from 1970 through 1972 to establish basic ecological and population parameters of the small mammal community, populations were sampled annually during late autumn and early winter before the onset of breeding. There were marked differences in the annual (autumn/winter) abundances of all species; numbers of A. agilis ranged from 4 to 142 individuals; A. swainsonii 0 to 43; R. fuscipes 4 to 54; R. lutreolus 0 to 11; M. musculus 0 to 23. Following the 1972 fire, numbers fell to the lowest level recorded during the study and each population subsequently disappeared from the plot between the 1973 and 1974 winter censuses. The less intense 1980 fire did not lead to extirpation, but numbers of A. agilis, A. swainsonii and R. fuscipes declined as drought conditions persisted through 1983. R. lutreolus occurred consistently only following the fires, when a grassy ground vegetation favoured by this species developed. Similarly, M. musculus colonised within two years of the fires and persisted on the plot for 3-4 years before disappearing. Following the fires, populations of the omnivorous R. fuscipes recovered first followed by the scansorial, insectivorous A. agilis and last by the fossorial, insectivorous A. swainsonii. Two primary conclusions emerged from this study. First, the intense fire of 1972 did not kill all the animals immediately, but led to the disappearance of each species from the plot over 18 months. Thus, intense fire had a delayed but catastrophic impact on small ground-dwelling mammals. The fluctuations in population levels, covering more than an order of magnitude, demonstrate that factors other than fire, such as rainfall and drought, drive the population dynamics of these small mammals. As stability and recovery are not features of local populations, long-term studies of benchmark populations are necessary to manage forest biodiversity. ¬© CSIRO 2009.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.778838719,1,1,"Disagreement, correct unranked to 1.

We made a preliminary survey of the distribution and relative abundance of pest mammals across three urban habitat types (gully, amenity park, residential) in Hamilton, New Zealand. Tracking tunnel and WaxTag¬Æ surveys showed that: (1) rats (Rattus rattus or R. norvegicus), mice (Mus musculus) and brushtail possums (Tricho‚Äêsurus vulpecula) were detected most often and in highest abundances in gullies, were relatively rare in amenity parks, and were not detected in residential areas; (2) hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were regularly detected in all habitats; and (3) mustelids were not detected in any habitat. Live trapping in areas where rats were detected captured 21 rats, of which 19 were R. rattus. Scat and animal sign surveys found evidence of lagomorphs in amenity parks and gullies but not in residential areas. Cats (Felis catus) were detected in all habitats. These data suggest that important mammalian pests other than cats are either absent (mustelids) or comparatively rare (rats) in urban Hamilton and largely confined to gully habitats.

Common dolphins are gregarious animals with high vagility and are expected to display limited genetic differentiation over large spatial scales. Here, we investigate population genetic structure of southern Australian common dolphins using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and seven microsatellite markers. We found unexpected levels of genetic differentiation for short-beaked common dolphins over a distance of ‚àº1500 km. Although no genetic structure was observed in common dolphins along the coast of SA, we detected marked differentiation between dolphins from SA and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting a minimum of two genetic populations in southern Australia. We hypothesize that the ephemeral distribution of small pelagic fish enhances movement and dispersal between dolphin groups at a local level. However, clear differences in water temperature, habitat features and fish abundance between SA and Tasmania may contribute to the contemporary isolation observed between dolphin populations. Our findings have important consequences for developing conservation management strategies, because SA has the largest purse-seine fishery by weight in Australia, and substantial numbers of fatal common dolphin interactions have occurred. In 2004/2005 alone, an estimated 1728 common dolphins were encircled and 377 died over a 7-month period. If these impacts lead to a reduction in population size, it is unlikely that dolphins from the adjacent south-eastern Tasmanian population will replace the lost individuals. Recommendations for assessing the impacts of the fishery are presented.

To determine the cause of this spatial variation in impact I investigated the abundance and condition (crown dieback and extent of possum browse cover) of two mistletoes (Alepis flavida, Peraxilla tetrapetala) and abundance and diet of possums in two mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forests in the central-eastern South Island of New Zealand. Mistletoe is common and there are long-established uncontrolled possum populations in both forests. Mistletoes were abundant (216-1359 per hectare) and important in possum diet (41-59% of total diet), but possum density was low (c. 2 per hectare) in both areas. Possum impacts were slight with low browse frequencies and intensities over much of the study sites. However, impacts were significantly greater at a forest margin, where possum abundance was highest, and at a high-altitude site where mistletoe density was lowest. Mistletoe crown dieback was inversely proportional to intensity of possum browsing. These results suggest that the persistence of abundant mistletoe populations at these sites is due to mistletoe productivity matching or exceeding consumption by possums in these forests of low possum-carrying capacity, rather than low possum preference for the local mistletoe populations. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.630228114,0,NA,NA,15,NA,13,NA

An endemic of arid/semi-arid Australia, the kite is sympatric with the barn owl, Tyto alba, throughout most of its range. Although the letter-winged kite is nocturnal, it seems to possess intermediate degrees of adaptation for nocturnal hunting, whereas the barn owl is specialized for nocturnal activity. We studied sympatric populations of both species during a rodent population outbreak in the north-west Simpson Desert to understand how their different nocturnal adaptations influenced diet and prey selection. The commonest rodents, in order of abundance, were Pseudomys australis (body mass: 40-75 g), P. hermannsburgensis (9-17 g), and Notomys alexis (27-45 g). Rodents dominated the diets of kites (96% of 225 prey items) and owls (98% of 303 prey items). Dietary niche breadth was relatively low for both kites (BA=0.16) and owls (BA=0.13), whereas niche overlap was extremely high (O=0.98). Barn owls exhibited greater prey choice, specifically; they selected the larger P. australis and avoided the small P. hermannsburgensis, whereas kites captured Pseudomys species in proportion to their availability. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore examined the effects of a typical road in an and ecosystem on kangaroo populations and communities, threatened small mammal species (Sminthopsis macroura and Leggadina forresti), and small mammal and lizard communities over two years. We determined which vertebrate populations and communities were negatively affected by the road, thereby informing management priorities for mitigating road effects. The study was conducted along the Silver City Highway on the UNSW Arid Zone Research Station, Fowlers Gap, in north-western New South Wales. We found that the road influenced the spatial distribution of kangaroos relative to the road, particularly those of Macropus rufus, and was associated with increased kangaroo mortality. Further, the road altered the composition of small mammal and lizard communities and reduced the abundance of S. macroura. However, roadkill of kangaroos did not significantly affect the population demographics or community composition of kangaroos. There were no changes in sex ratios (female dominance) which would threaten the sustainability of S. macroura and L. forresti populations near the road. Further, changes in the species composition of small mammal and lizard communities were likely to be localised near the road, rather than altered at larger scales, because the differences in resource availability driving community differences were restricted to a narrow band immediately adjacent to the road. Thus, none of the vertebrate taxa studied were significantly threatened by the presence of the road and its associated vehicle traffic. Even so, we recommend that management efforts focus on reducing the frequency of kangaroo roadkill (the most serious animal and human welfare issue) through encouraging the growth of shrubs and low vegetation unpalatable to kangaroos adjacent to arid-zone roads. Such a management strategy could also have positive flow-on effects for other vertebrate taxa, and could restore the natural integrity of and landscapes near roads.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.542398754,1,NA,NA,15,NA,15,NA

The goal of this three-year study was to assess the frequency and distribution of species killed on Tasmanian roads. Seasonal surveys were completed along five major routes, for a total of 154 trips. Over 15000km of road were surveyed and 5691 individuals in 54 taxa were recorded for an average roadkill density of 0.372km-1.

The 10 most common taxa accounted for 99% of the items observed. The seasonal occurrence, relationship with vehicle speed, and clustering in local hotspots for particular taxa all suggest that mitigation measures, such as vehicle speed reduction in specific areas, may be effective in reducing the number of animals killed.

An initial observer program revealed high rates of encirclement and mortality (1.78 and 0.39 dolphins per net-set, respectively) of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). This equated to an estimate of 1728 encirclements and 377 mortalities across the entire fleet over the same period. The average time taken for fishers to respond to encirclements was 135.93 ¬± 3.72 min and 21.3% of encircled animals subsequently died. During that time, fishers only reported 3.6% of encirclements and 1.9% of mortalities recorded by observers. A code of practice (CoP) was subsequently introduced aimed at mitigating operational interactions. A second observer program revealed a significant reductions in the observed rates of dolphin encirclement (0.22; down 87.3%) and mortality (0.01; down 97.1%) with an estimate of 169 and eight, respectively. The average time taken for fishers to respond to dolphin encirclements also reduced to 16.33 ¬± 4.67 min (down 76.9%) and the proportion of encircled animals that subsequently died reduced to 5.0%. Agreement between industry reports and observer records improved, with the fishery reporting 57.9% and 58.9% of the rate of encirclements and mortalities, respectively, recorded by observers. A number of avoidance and release strategies in the CoP may have been responsible for these improvements. In particular, fishers were required to delay or relocate their activities if dolphins were observed prior to fishing and to release encircled dolphins immediately or abort the fishing event if release procedures were unsuccessful. Future improvements to the CoP include: (i) improved response times when an encircled dolphin is detected; (ii) better use of behavioural cues for deciding when to abort a net-set; (iii) ceasing fishing during rough weather; and (iv) continuing to increase reporting accuracy by fishers.

New populations of some weta have been established in locations, particularly on islands, where these threats have been eliminated or severely reduced in order to reduce the risk of extinction.

Kites immigrated into the area within 6 months of the outbreak commencing, and remained while rodent abundance was high; however, all birds left the area after rodent populations crashed within a 6-week period. Dingoes and foxes were more abundant than cats and both species increased during the outbreak. All carnivores were resident. The letter-winged kite fed almost entirely on rodents. Rodents were the main prey of the 3 mammalian predators during the outbreak; however, all species had intermediate niche breadths.

However, such impacts have rarely been quantified. The present study examined the response of five species of arboreal folivorous marsupials to Severe Cyclone Larry at nine sites in upland rainforests of the Atherton Tableland, north-east Australia. Sites were originally surveyed for folivores in 1995-1997, and then resurveyed in 2006, 6-8 months after Cyclone Larry had traversed the region. All sites showed evidence of structural damage to vegetation, but overall damage levels (assessed in terms of canopy cover, damage to trees, basal area of dead trees and volume of woody debris) decreased from east to west across the study region. The detectability of rainforest possums increased after the cyclone. For the most commonly observed species, the proportion of individuals observed >5 m from survey transects was correlated with the amount of structural damage to vegetation. To avoid confounding changes in detectability with changes in abundance, only observations close (<5 m) to transects were used to estimate folivore abundance before and after the cyclone. On this basis, there were no significant differences between pre- and post-cyclone abundance estimates for any folivore species. Further, changes in folivore abundance after the cyclone were not correlated with damage to vegetation across sites. Cyclone Larry does not appear to have caused a catastrophic loss of key habitat resources for marsupial folivores at the sites surveyed. The high degree of folivory practiced by marsupial folivores may help make them resilient to cyclone impacts. These conclusions are more robust for three commonly observed folivore species (Hemibelideus lemuroides, Pseudochirulus herbertensis and Trichosurus vulpecula johnstonii) than for two less frequently encountered species (Pseudochirops archeri and Dendrolagus lumholtzi). ¬© 2008 The Authors.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.614028776,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21,0

Using both radiotracking and trapping data, movement patterns, dispersal and response to habitat edges of Rattus fuscipes were examined within forests, corridors, remnants and pastures in south-east Queensland, Australia. Rattus fuscipes has previously been shown to be robust to the effects of habitat fragmentation; however, contrary to expectations, R. fuscipes was found to be sensitive to edges, and no evidence of interremnant dispersal was detected, despite interremnant distances that were substantially smaller than the distances R. fuscipes was found to move in continuous habitat. Using only trapping data, the same factors were examined in relation to Melomys cervinipes, a species sensitive to fragmentation. Melomys cervinipes was found to utilize edge habitat, but no evidence of interremnant dispersal was detected, although the capacity to detect such movement was limited by low abundance in remnants where M. cervinipes was extant, and the species absence from many remnants. Movement patterns, interremnant dispersal capacity, and sensitivity to edges did not prove to be good predictors of these species responses to habitat fragmentation.

Understanding factors that influence this process allows resources for predator control to be applied with maximum effect. This study examines how predation of a secondary prey species (a relatively common but declining native plover, the banded dotterel Charadrius bicinctus) varied with reductions in abundance of a major prey source (rabbits), kill-trapping of predators, nest density and habitat complexity. Banded dotterels mostly nest in open braided riverbeds alongside a number of endemic threatened species. We measured the fate of 753 dotterel clutches exposed to predation by cats, ferrets and hedgehogs. We found key times and places of high predation risk. Immediately after widespread reduction in rabbit populations by rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), clutch predation rates were almost as high (mean, 50%) as those recorded during past rabbit poisoning programmes (mean, 57%). Both rates were significantly higher than the mean predation rate of 22% without rabbit control, suggesting a shift in predator diet immediately after rabbit population declines. Unlike after rabbit poisoning, clutch predation rate remained high in the years after RHD. Other patterns observed included higher clutch predation rate where nest density was lower, suggesting that predation can potentially cause local extinction. Clutch predation was also higher along riverbed margins where vegetation was dense. There was equivocal evidence for an effect of predator kill-trapping on clutch predation rate. Management strategies that could potentially reduce clutch predation risks include focusing predator mitigation measures during periods of rabbit decline, maintaining them for more than one breeding season if the rabbit declines are widespread (e.g. RHD epidemics), and applying greater effort at sites with relatively low nest density and along riverbed margins where predator use is more frequent. ¬© Journal compilation ¬© 2007 The Zoological Society of London.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.73623222,NA,0,NA,NA,15,23,NA

Pertinent data for 37 conspicuous vertebrate species (10 bird, 26 mammal and 1 snake species) were collated, analysed, and integrated with more recent scientific information. Much of the information discovered in colonial records and obtained from interviews with oldtimers has been neglected by zoologists and ecologists. The original distributional limits of many of the species studied were thus clarified and redetermined. Detailed information is also provided on the history of the introduction of 14 mammal species into south-west WA, in order to assess their potential contribution to the extinction of native vertebrate species. The introduction, spread and density in bushland of commensal and livestock species does not correlate with the chronology of declines of native species. Changes in geographical distrbution of species were assessed against an interpretive framework of 29 factors, and based on this analysis, a conceptual model (termed the 'fusion' model) of mammal declines and extinctions in south-west and adjacent parts of WA since European settlement is proposed. The reconstructed sequence of events commenced in the 1880s, with declines being caused by disease (10 species estimated to have become totally extinct in WA and 8 species abruptly reduced in abundance and distribution). Another 12 species subsequently reached near-extinction status, following establishment of the fox in the 1920s. Trapping of some species for their fur and accidental poisoning by rabbit baits contributed to local extinctions but were not finally decisive factors. The conceptual framework adopted, based on detailed examination of the information discovered, recognizes three tiers of relevant factors. Only one or two main factors operate at one time, with some of the remaining factors acting in a subsidiary way, and sometimes concurrently or sequentially. Dominant factors are not necessarily the same for each species. Factors usually affected species adversely. South-west WA, despite being settled by Europeans earlier than most other parts of Australia, experienced a stagnant economy, slow population growth and hence minimal clearance of the original vegetation until the 1890s. The anthropogenic factors identified as significant in the decline and depletion of the native fauna, together with an understanding of their correct sequence of operation, provide a historically appropriate conceptual model that may be applicable elsewhere in Australia.

We trialled the use of artificial cover objects (ACOs) for sampling small terrestrial lizards (the skinks Ofigosoma maccanni, o. nigriplantare polychroma and o. inconspicuum, and gecko Hoplodactylus maculatus) in three experimental mammal-management treatments: a mammal-proof fence, two sites in an intensive mammal-removal area, and an experimental control site with no mammal removal. These predator control regimes were established in 2005-2006 to protect endangered grand skinks (O. grande) and Otago skinks (O. otagense) at Macraes Flat, North Otago. We (1) counted skinks and geckos found under ACOs on a single day and compared these counts between treatments, and (2) estimated lizard population sizes (N) based on capture-mark-recapture (CNM) of lizards under ACOs in daily and weekly sampling sessions. Our results provide baseline data of the abundance of the small lizard species shortly after implementation of predator management. Single-day counts of skinks were significantly higher inside the mammal fence compared with the experimental control. No consistent differences were found between the other treatments. Significantly more skinks were counted in gully habitats than in ridge habitats. N, counts of skinks from the first day of CMR, and the total number of individuals caught were correlated, but these relationships must be validated with independent data. Few geckos were caught unless ACOs were placed near rock outcrops. Only two skinks but 25% of geckos moved between adjacent ACOs (5-m spacing). The recapture rate of skinks was low; captures declined when ACOs were checked daily but not when they were.checked weekly. Because of potential biases of these methods, we propose to compare counts in ACOs and N based on CMR in ACOs with N based on CNM in pitfall traps with 3-m spacing. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.658118258,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25,NA

In marine systems, the effects of predation danger on space use by large herbivores have received little attention, despite the possibility that predator-mediated alterations in patterns of grazing by these animals influence benthic community structure. We evaluated the relationship between habitat use by foraging dugongs (Dugong dugon) and the threat of tiger shark predation in an Australian embayment (Shark Bay) between 1997 and 2004. Dugong densities were quantified in shallow (putatively dangerous) and deep (putatively safe) habitats (seven survey zones allocated to each habitat), and predation hazard was indexed using catch rates of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier); seagrass volume provided a measure of food biomass within each zone. Overall, dugongs selected shallow habitats, where their food is concentrated. Foragers used shallow and deep habitats in proportion to food availability (input matching) when large tiger sharks were scarce and overused deep habitats when sharks were common. Furthermore, strong synchrony existed between daily measures of shark abundance and the extent to which deep habitats were overused. Thus, dugongs appear to adaptively manage their risk of death by allocating time to safe but impoverished foraging patches in proportion to the likelihood of encountering predators in profitable but more dangerous areas. This apparent food-safety trade-off has important implications for seagrass community structure in Shark Bay, as it may result in marked temporal variability in grazing pressure. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.522858779,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26,NA

The Powerful Owl, which was formerly reliant on these prey species, still persists in the region but at very low densities and uncertain viability. Previous research has shown that Powerful Owls select home-ranges with more large trees and hollows than the forest at large, but the amount of such habitat that is required remained undefined. Four adult Powerful Owls (two males and two females) from four pairs occupying geographically separate territories in box-ironbark forest were radio-tracked over 1-6 months. Home-range size was much greater than previously assumed for this species (minimum convex polygon of 4774, 2896, 1770 and 1382 ha). Range-length was 5.7-8.9 km, and on average 5-12% of each home-range was used during a single night. Core foraging areas comprised many, typically small, patches scattered across the entire home-range. Selection of roosting sites was flexible and did not constrain spatial use of home-range, with 96% of roosts in very small to medium-sized trees, which are widely distributed. The finding of unexpectedly large foraging ranges suggests that enhancement of habitat quality and mammalian prey abundance in currently occupied home-ranges is the foremost goal for forest managers if a viable population is to be sustained. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2007.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.689892986,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27,NA

Scats were variously collected from quoll latrines and live-trapped animals during winter for each of the three years and analysed to determine prey items. Estimates of abundance of key ground-dwelling and arboreal medium-sized mammals were simultaneously obtained using plot-based survey techniques and spotlighting. Over the duration of the study, quoll diet was dominated by medium-sized mammals, particularly brushtail possums (Trichosurus spp.) and lagomorphs (rabbit and hare), followed by small and large-sized mammals. After the fire there was a shift in utilisation of food resources in response to significant changes in prey availability. Monitoring revealed that brushtail possums, lagomorphs and bandicoots were all significantly less abundant in the winter following the fire, and populations of lagomorphs, but not possums, then increased in the second winter after the fire. Quolls adapted to this by taking significantly more lagomorphs in each of the two years after the fire and by taking advantage of a short-term increase in the availability of carrion. The results of this study reaffirm that the spotted-tailed quoll is adaptable in its utilisation of available food, and that fires are not necessarily detrimental to the species and its prey base. ¬© CSIRO 2007.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.70287297,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28,NA

Management of vulnerable populations often involves a lengthy sequence of 1) research to identify threats and recommend management strategies, 2) active management, and 3) results monitoring to assess effectiveness of management. The last mainland population of the large, endemic New Zealand skink (Whitaker's skink [Cyclodina whitakeri]) provides an opportunity to test this process in a system where the synergistic effects between invasive species (introduced rodents and grasses) have predicted outcomes. A low abundance of Whitaker's skink at the Pukerua Bay Scientific Reserve in the 1980s prompted management recommendations to remove grazing stock and revegetate the site to simultaneously restore habitat and provide protection against introduced mammalian predators. Since Whitaker's skink have low detectability, it was recommended that sympatric copper skink (C. aenea) be used an indicator species of management effectiveness. Grazing stock were removed in 1987, but efforts to revegetate the site were ineffective. Long-term monitoring (1984-2006) of the Whitaker's skink population and 4 other sympatric lizard species within a 336-m area at the site resulted in 1,693 lizard captures over 7,597 trap days. Whitaker's skink represented 2.8% of all captures in 1984-1988, but declined relative to other species to represent only 0.2% of captures in 2000-2006 (representing 2 individuals). Congeneric copper skink showed a similar decline with capture rates also approaching zero by 2006. Removing grazing stock did not result in an increased abundance of Whitaker's skink or copper skink through improved habitat quality, as was intended by the management recommendation. Instead, reduced grazing has allowed introduced seeding grasses to proliferate, which may have led to periodic rodent irruptions, supporting a guild of introduced mammalian predators and depleting populations of Whitaker's skink and copper skink. In this instance, attempted protection may have driven a vulnerable population towards extinction. We recommend investigating the feasibility of constructing a mammal-proof fence around the core Whitaker's skink habitat, as the last remaining management option to salvage the population.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.783080545,NA,1,Population trends are discussed but these are in the context of human interventions to aid conservation,NA,10,29,NA

At the time of European settlement the quokka was widespread and abundant and its distribution encompassed an area of approximately 41 200 km2 of south-west Western Australia inclusive of two offshore islands, Bald Island and Rottnest Island. Historical reports indicated an extensive population decline occurred in the 1930s. The decline continued, with a previously undocumented decline apparent in the period from 1980 to 1992. However, this decline may be an artefact of the time scales used for mapping and may well equate with a previously reported decline for a suite of south-west mammals in the 1970s. By 1992 the quokka's distribution had been reduced to an area of approximately 17 800 km2. An increased awareness of the presence of the quokka on the mainland has resulted in numerous rcportings of quokka presence since 1992, has confirmed the existence of several populations at the northern extent of the quokka's known geographic range and indicated the current, 2005, distribution to be similar to that in 1992. However, survey and population estimates at six of these mainland locations from the northern jarrah forest indicated low abundance. There have been no population estimates elsewhere on the mainland. Two populations have been reported from the Swan Coastal Plain, but neither has been confirmed extant. Predation by the introduced fox, Vulpes vulpes, is implicated as a major cause of the quokka's initial decline, while ongoing predation, habitat destruction and modification through altered fire regimes have contributed to the continued decline. Specific conservation management actions are recommended, namely: (i) Implementing an active adaptive management program in the northern jarrah forest to determine quokka population response to habitat manipulation through the use of fire, fox baiting and pig control; (ii) Surveying the Stirling Range and Green Range populations with emphasis placed on determining population size and population genetic structure; (iii) Surveying the reported occurrences from the Swan Coastal Plain, with emphasis on unambiguously determining presence. If confirmed, priority should be directed to assessing population size and determining the management requirements to ensure persistence of the population; (iv) Surveying southern forest and south coast populations to assess quokka population size, the extent of movement between subpopulations and assessment of the range of habitat types used by quokkas. The latter should be combined with spatial analyses of known extant populations and suitable and potentially suitable habitat; (v) Determining the role of fire in establishing and maintaining preferred habitat of southern forest and south coast populations; and (vi) Establishing a program to assess the potential effects from management operations.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.898420484,NA,1,Historical records used,NA,5,30,NA

Ovulation rates and litter size increased during spring and peaked in October/November. Ovulation rate was consistently higher than litter size by approximately 1.2 embryos (19%). None of the extrinsic parameters measured (food quality and quantity, mouse abundance) had an impact on reproductive performance. The addition of food did not prevent the mid summer decrease in ovulation rates nor did it alter the difference between ovulation rates and litter size. While the number of previous pregnancies did not affect reproductive performance, the age of mice did: older mice tended to have higher ovulation rates than younger mice. The effect of age-dependent changes in ovulation rates on population growth rates of house mice seemed to be of limited importance. We conclude that the reproductive output in wild house mice is determined by ovulation rates and not by litter size.

The yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes) is the only small, native, ground-dwelling/semi-arboreal mammal on most floodplains of south-eastern Australia, yet the effects of floods on its population dynamics largely are unknown.

A total of 48 species of native mammals are recorded from the region, including at least 10 species known only from the Blandowski expedition of 1856-57. Marked changes have occurred to the fauna over the last 150 years, including the regional loss of at least 13 species (with five taxa globally extinct), and a further 10 species have been introduced to the area and established wild populations. Species loss has been greatest among the bandicoots, rodents and dasyurids, despite historical reports that some of these species were widespread and common. Loss has been greatest among species of medium body-size (0.05 - 0.5 kg); 78% (7/9) of species in this range have disappeared compared with <30% in other size-classes. In contrast, there is no evidence of loss among the four families of bats present, which together comprise one-third of the known native fauna.

Those most closely associated with mallee vegetation in Victoria are the Mallee Ningaui, Little Pygmy Possum and Mitchell's Hopping Mouse. The future of the mammal fauna of the Mallee region over the next century, particularly of species regarded as 'threatened'or 'near threatened', depends on the choices made concerning human land-use in this region. Geographic areas particularly important to long-term conservation are the extensive vegetation blocks of the dunefields (Sunset Country, Big Desert), the Murray River corridor, and the plains of the far north-west where native vegetation links the dunefields with contiguous mallee ecosystems in South Australia and New South Wales. Reintroduction of mammal species to the Mallee region also offers potential benefits for conservation, ecosystem restoration and a greater community appreciation of mallee ecosystems. However, for effective conservation the knowledge base for the mammal fauna of the Mallee region must extend beyond inventory and survey to a greater understanding ofthe ecology of species and assemblages, and the processes that determine their distribution and abundance.",Conference Paper,NA,Scopus,0.644115033,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34,NA

We conducted a manipulative food addition experiment on the demography of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) across sites that varied in predator abundance, near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, over three consecutive breeding seasons. We previously showed that food and predators had interactive effects on annual reproductive success (young fledged per female). Here, we report the effects on egg production. Our results show that food limits the total number of eggs laid over the breeding season (""total egg production"") and that interactive food and predator effects, including food effects on nest predation, determine how those eggs are ""parceled out"" into different nests. Food addition alone significantly affected total egg production, and there was no significant interannual variability in this result. At the same time, both food and predators affected the two determinants of total egg production: ""clutch number"" (total number of clutches laid) and average clutch size. Both clutch number and size were affected by a food X predator X year interaction. Clutch number was lower at low-predator locations because there was less nest predation and thus less renesting. Food addition also significantly reduced nest predation, but there was significant interannual variation in this effect. This interannual variation was responsible for the food X predator X year interactions because the larger the effect of food on nest predation in a given year, the smaller was the effect of food on clutch number; and the smaller the effect of food on clutch number, the larger was the effect of food on clutch size.

However, our understanding of the process and our ability to predict its outcomes at a community scale are limited by the frequently large number of interactions associated with it. Here, we outline an approach to dealing with this complexity that reduces the number of unique interactions considered by classifying the participants according to their functional similarity. We derived a classification of dispersers based on the nature of the dispersal service they provide to plants. We described the quantities of fruit handled, the quality of handling and the diversity of plants to which the service is provided. We used ten broad disperser traits to group 26 detailed measures for each disperser. We then applied this approach to vertebrate dispersers in Australia's tropical forests. Using this we also develop a classification that may be more generally applicable. For each disperser, data relating to each trait was obtained either from the field or published literature. First, we identified dispersers whose service outcomes were so distinct that statistical analysis was not required and assigned them to functional groups. The remaining dispersers were assigned to functional groups using cluster analysis. The combined processes created 15 functional groups from 65 vertebrate dispersers in Australian tropical forests. Our approach-grouping dispersers on the basis of the type of dispersal service provided and the fruit types it is provided to-represents a means of reducing the complexity encountered in tropical seed dispersal systems and could be effectively applied in community level studies. It also represents a useful tool for exploring changes in dispersal services when the distribution and abundance of animal populations change due to human impacts. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.234589495,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37,NA

Foxes were removed from two areas around the perimeter of Lake Burrendong, and data were collected from these areas and a nearby untreated area before, during, and after the period of fox control. The arrival of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1996 provided an opportunity to examine the interactive effects of controlling foxes and rabbits. In this landscape, typical of central NSW, (a) the fox population was not affected by a large reduction in the abundance of rabbits, or vice versa; (b) the cat population declined in areas where foxes were removed after the large RHD-induced reduction in rabbit numbers, but there was no consistent response to the removal of foxes; (c) the abundance of some macropod species increased in response only to the combined removal of rabbits and foxes; (d) there were no consistent changes in the abundances of bird species in response to the removal of either foxes or rabbits, but there were clear habitat differences in bird species richness; and (e) there was likely to be an increase in woody plant species after the large reduction in rabbit populations by RHD. We conclude that (a) long-term field experiments (more than 3 years) are required to quantify the indirect consequences of controlling foxes and rabbits, and (b) single manipulations, such as fox control or rabbit control, are not necessarily sufficient for the conservation of remnant woodland communities in southeastern Australia. ¬© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.659311436,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38,NA

The internationally significant population of dugongs (Dugong dugon or seacow) in Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea supports an important indigenous fishery. The economic, socio-cultural and environmental factors that influenced hunting activity in 1998 and 1999 by the members of the community of Mabuiag Island were investigated to inform the sustainable management of the fishery. The landed catch during the eight months March to October of 145 dugongs in 1998 and 170 dugongs in 1999 potentially provided the community with an average of 290 g of dugong meat per person per day. Fifty-seven per cent of adult males on the island participated in dugong hunting, but more than half the catch in each year was caught by only two hunters. The probability of at least one person from the community going dugong hunting in 1998 and 1999 was 0.59 ¬± 0.02 per day. This probability was influenced by local environmental factors, including the abundance of dugongs in the traditional hunting grounds (affected by wind speed, year, season and lunar day) and the size of the commercial crayfish catch (which is influenced by the global market price, as well as local conditions). Although dugong hunting remains a very important part of the islanders' contemporary culture and customary economy, the capacity to hunt dugongs is facilitated by the ease with which some hunters move between the state, commercial and customary sectors of their local economy. The complexities of the economic, social and cultural environments need to be considered in planning for the sustainable harvesting of threatened species by remote indigenous communities. ¬© 2006 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.655954294,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39,NA

Increasingly, these eradications are contested by activists claiming moral, legal, cultural, historic or scientific reasons and poorly documented evidence of effects. We reviewed the global literature on the effects of rats on island flora and fauna. We then used New Zealand as a case study because of its four-decade history of rat eradications and many detailed and innovative studies of how rats affect native species. These include use of exclosures, local manipulations of rat populations, video surveillance, and measurements of responses following eradications. The most intensive studies have been on the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans), a small South-East Asian species spread by Polynesians throughout the Pacific. These and the more recently introduced Norway rat (R. norvegicus) and ship (roof) rat (R. rattus) suppress some forest plants, and are associated with extinctions or declines of flightless invertebrates, ground-dwelling reptiles, land birds, and burrowing seabirds. On islands off France, Norway rats are also implicated in declines of shrews. Globally, ship rats were associated with declines or extinctions of the largest number of indigenous vertebrate species (60), including small mammals such as deer mice and bats. Effects of rats on forest trees and seabird populations are sufficiently pervasive to affect ecosystem structure and function. However, the data are patchy. Deficiencies in our knowledge would be reduced by documenting distribution and abundance of indigenous species before and after eradications. Comprehensive measurements of the responses of indigenous species to rat eradications would enable the development of testable models of rat invasion effects. ¬© Springer 2006.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.629058535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40,NA

Medium-sized mammals (500-6999 g) formed the bulk of the faecal content, in terms of both volume and frequency of occurrence. The most frequently consumed vertebrates were the greater glider Petauroides volans, rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, bandicoots Perameles nasuta and/or Isoodon macrourus, red-necked pademelon Thylogale thetis, ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus, and brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula and/or T. caninus. Insects were also eaten frequently, but birds and reptiles occurred relatively infrequently in the diet. The seasonal variation in diet was marked, with insects and reptiles being consumed more frequently, and mammals less frequently, in summer than in winter. This seasonal pattern was also mirrored by the relative volumes of mammals and insects consumed. The results obtained here indicate that the spotted-tailed quoll is an opportunistic predator, consuming a wide variety of taxa and apparently varying its diet to take advantage of short-term fluctuations in prey abundance. The extremely high proportion of mammals in the diet identifies D. maculatus as a hypercarnivore, or meat specialist. The importance of tree hollow-nesting mammals in the diet indicates that the preservation of hollow-bearing trees should aid the conservation of D. maculatus. Future dietary studies of the species should sample over extensive time periods and involve concurrent monitoring of prey populations. ¬© 2006 The Authors.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.611018528,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41,NA

Many surveys only estimate the latter probability because modeling the availability process requires information collected external to the survey. We illustrate estimation of both probabilities in an application to aerial surveys of dugongs (Dugong dugon) in Northern Australian coastal waters where water clarity varies greatly over relatively small spatial scales. Using artificial dugong models and timed depth recorders deployed on 15 wild dugongs to obtain dive profiles, we carried out experiments to determine zones of detectability for dugongs at the range of depths, turbidities, and sea states that spanned the environmental heterogeneity encountered on dugong surveys. Resulting probability estimates were heterogeneous and dependent on the measured conditions. To estimate perception probability, we used a tandem team of 2 observers on either side of the aircraft. This permitted fitting generalized Lincoln-Petersen models with Program MARK. We then used the generalized Horvitz-Thompson estimator, based on the overall detection probability for each individual dugong, to generate population estimates. We also developed a new simulation-based method for estimating standard errors and confidence intervals. We contrast absolute abundance estimates of dugongs in the Torres Strait and Northern Great Barrier Reef regions using both the new and original approaches (Marsh and Sinclair 1989a). For Torres Strait, the new method produced a substantially smaller estimate (11,956 vs. 14,106 dugongs) and a very much smaller standard error (1,189 vs. 2,314 dugongs), whereas the new method produced slightly larger estimates (mean 9,855 vs. 9,193 dugongs, standard error 1,184 vs. 917 dugongs) for the Northern Great Barrier Reef survey.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.581894363,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,NA

Including such taxa may dramatically change our understanding of total biomass and energy flow in such systems. Dusky rats (Rattus colletti) are small (up to 210 g) native Australian mammals, and our 5-year mark-recapture study on a tropical flood plain (Adelaide River, Northern Territory) revealed that rat biomass can reach extraordinary levels (up to 4.7 t km-2). Because their small body size results in high mass-specific metabolic rates, a given biomass of rodents has a several-fold higher total energy requirement than the same mass of large-bodied herbivores. Accordingly, during some years dusky rat biomass can be double that estimated for large herbivores on the world's most productive savannas in eastern and southern Africa. The huge rodent biomass strongly suggests that the Adelaide River flood plain must be an incredibly productive habitat. Considering the immense biological importance of these productive ecosystems, flood plain conservation must be placed high on the priority list of habitats that require immediate protection. ¬© 2006 Ecological Society of Australia.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.619222933,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,43,NA

An aerial survey using a helicopter was considered more efficient than ground survey because of the size of the area, relatively high relief and dense tree cover, and the need for regular monitoring.

The species rapidly established populations throughout the region, and by the 1940s had increased to levels where it had become a significant agricultural pest. Potential wallaby-control techniques include the use of shooting teams with dogs and deployment of 1080 either from the air or as gel applied to foliage. For livestock graziers, shooting teams are probably the least cost-effective of these techniques (i.e. highest cost per unit reduction in average wallaby density), but are preferred to either form of 1080 poisoning because the latter require stock to be withheld from treated areas. In this study, we combine a simple model of wallaby population dynamics with empirically derived estimates of the density-dependent variation in wallaby-control costs to contrast the relative cost-effectiveness of these control techniques. Variation in wallaby density was predicted from a logistic population model modified for the positive effects of rainfall on rates of change in wallaby abundance. The model was fitted to estimates of density- and rainfall-dependent variation in the instantaneous rate of change in wallaby abundance (r), derived from catch-effort data recorded by shooting teams. Comparison of the control techniques demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of hunting with dogs was lower than that achieved by either poisoning technique, and increased exponentially as progressively lower wallaby densities were targeted. This increase reflected the higher variable cost of locating wallabies to shoot as their density declined. In contrast, because 1080 poisoning is dominated by the fixed costs of bait or gel deployment, overall costs increased linearly as lower wallaby densities were targeted, and the frequency of poisoning was increased. Of the two 1080 poisoning methods considered, deployment using gel applied to foliage was always more cost effective than aerial distribution of bait. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.561351911,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,45,NA

Monitoring is usually planned under the assumption that it must be carried out at fixed intervals in time, typically annually, before the harvest quota is set. However, monitoring can be very expensive, and we should weigh the cost of monitoring against the improvement that it makes in decision making. A less costly alternative to monitoring annually is to predict the population size using a population model and information from previous surveys. In this paper, the problem of monitoring frequency is posed within a decision-theory framework. We discover that a monitoring regime that varies according to the state of the system can outperform fixed-interval monitoring. This idea is illustrated using data for a red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) population in South Australia. Whether or not one should monitor in a given year is dependent on the estimated population density in the previous year, the uncertainty in that population estimate, and past rainfall. We discover that monitoring is important when a model-based prediction of population density is very uncertain. This may occur if monitoring has not taken place for several years, or if rainfall has been above average. Monitoring is also important when prior information suggests that the population is near a critical threshold in population abundance. However, monitoring is less important when the optimal management action would not be altered by new information. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.783828687,NA,1,"Builds a model to predict population sizes, demonstrated using red kangroo data, suggests abundance data is used.",NA,10,46,NA

Our abundance estimates indicate that less than a hundred individuals of each species inhabit this coastal area. Even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size are very high (>20% p.a.). Though both species are not permanent residents in Cleveland Bay, they both used the area regularly from year to year following a model of emigration and reimmigration. Individuals of both species spend periods of days to a month or more in coastal waters of Cleveland Bay before leaving, and periods of over a month outside the study area before entering the bay again. Because of their small population sizes and movement patterns, snubfin and humpback dolphins are particularly vulnerable to local extinction. Our results illustrate that: (1) detection of population trends should not be a necessary criterion for enacting conservation measures of both species in this region, and (2) efforts to maintain viable populations of both species in Cleveland Bay must include management strategies that integrate anthropogenic activities in surrounding areas. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the information discovered, the hypothesis is advanced that the early decline was caused by an exotic disease.The evidence available is suggestive of a first wave of mammal declines and extinctions in Western Australia (WA) commencing about 1875. From this single, contingent historical event, it is postulated that 33 species (about one third of the non-volant mammal fauna of WA) changed significantly in distribution and abundance. The pattern of the decline both geographically and over time is consistent with epizootic disease as the primary factor, but probably interacting with drought and predation by feral cats as secondary factors. Much of the decline occurred before food shortages or habitat destruction caused by sheep grazing, habitat destruction caused by wheat farming, and changes in Aboriginal fire regimes. Dated and localised records of disease affecting conspicuous (often pest) species, when integrated with other records of early declines, are suggestive of the epizootic spreading rapidly from the Shark Bay district in the 1880s.The lower south-west area was affected last, before 1920. Descriptions of clinical signs are imprecise but do refer to numerous dead or dying animals, mange, alopecia, eye disease, withered ears, and scabs on the nose. Plausible explanations of the source of the disease (south-east Asia), its transmission (mosquitoes), and the pattern and scale of its spread (exceptionally wet summers) are proposed. Other possible vectors are discussed but do not adequately explain the pattern and scale of the spread. Many other early declines of mammal species in WA that are difficult to explain convincingly may have been influenced by this epizootic. Disease as a primary factor is considered to provide a more satisfactory explanation of early declines in WA than predation by feral cats. Impacts of these declines on ecosystem processes were likely to have been profound. The applicability of the conceptual model developed is discussed in relation to the early decline of some mammal species in eastern Australia, The need for ongoing, vigilant quarantine to minimise the risk of animal diseases being introduced is emphasised.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.63233757,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,49,NA

The behavioural response of small mammals to reduced cover has been well documented. However, very little is known about the effect of cover on community and population dynamics. Australian small mammals generally inhabit extremely dynamic ecosystems, where cover and food supplies are greatly affected by fire. Species are described as early or late seral specialists, generally returning to a disturbed area once their habitat requirements are met. Habitat requirements have loosely been interpreted as cover and food supply, however, these factors are not mutually exclusive and few studies have attempted to determine the driving factors behind small mammal succession. In this study, we manipulated specific aspects of cover in the eucalypt forests of Fraser Island and show that the behaviour and population dynamics of small mammals were greatly affected. A reduction of cover from grass-trees (Xanthorrhoea johnsonii) did not affect small mammal species composition, however, the abundance and size structure distribution of the dominant species (Rattus fuscipes) decreased. Patch use by rodents also decreased after cover was reduced. Rattus fuscipes must trade-off remaining in an environment with increased risk of predation, or disperse to an area with greater cover but increased competition. Juveniles dominated (>60%) populations of R. fuscipes after cover was reduced, however, size distributions of control sites were relatively more even (<25% juvenile). While adult R. fuscipes are either killed by predators or disperse to other areas, juveniles that remained or immigrated to an area of reduced cover gained a selective advantage over those in control sites, because reduced competition with adults increased body condition of juvenile R. fuscipes.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.692513118,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51,NA

However, we also found apparently healthy populations of the same species in a fragmented region of the study area. Using a combination of remote sensing, GIS and generalised linear modeling, we found some evidence of relationships between fire regime, fire heterogeneity or vegetation heterogeneity and the distributions of mammal species in this area. However, there was a strong regional component of the distribution that is not explained by these variables. The cause of the lack of mammals in the intact region of the study area has not been revealed by this analysis.

More than 10,000 km2 of spinifex habitat were burned. In this study we examine a time series of climatic variables, and small mammal and predator dynamics in the desert in 1999-2002; and a before-after-control-impact study investigating the effects of the wildfire on small mammals. Rodents showed a delayed numerical increase in response to rainfall, whereas terrestrial predators showed a delayed numerical increase in response to rodent density. These delayed responses suggest the existence of bottom-up trophic pathways. However, a reduction in primary productivity and increase in predators appeared to suppress rodent numbers in 2001-2002, indicating that bottom-up effects can be temporarily reversed in this system. Wildfire had negative impacts on the abundance of the desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor) and the overall richness of small mammal species. Several other species of small mammals also appeared to show brief negative responses to wildfire. The impacts of wildfire on small mammals appear attributable to a loss of habitat for spinifex-dependent species and increased exposure to predation in burned habitats. Because extensive wildfires can be predicted from patterns of rainfall and fuel accumulation, we recommend that land managers be proactive in recognizing and reducing conditions of fire hazard. We recommend that small-scale prescribed burns should be carried out to reduce the extent of wildfires and also increase the chance of maintaining potential refuges from predators. In addition, control of introduced predators during and after irruptions of rodents will be crucial to prevent predator-driven crashes of their populations and those of secondary prey species. ENSO-related climatic forecasts appear to be useful cues that can be incorporated into fire and predator management strategies in arid Australia. ¬© 2005 American Society of Mammalogists.",Article,Open Access,Scopus,0.598019361,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,54,NA

A total of 40 species appeared to be significantly disadvantaged by logging, another 40 species appeared to be significantly favoured by logging, while the remainder (147 species) appeared to be relatively unaffected. Most species were widely distributed throughout both logged and unlogged landscapes, albeit at possibly quite different abundances. This may be due to the fine-scale complexity of the habitat mosaic for many species, resulting in the continued availability of essential resources within or near logged areas, or the lack of sufficient sensitivity in the analysis due to the need to use presence-absence data. A further 121 species were recorded so rarely in the study (based on 619 sites) that it was not possible to make any assessments of their sensitivity to logging. The study produced several unexpected results, including the failure to identify some species as sensitive to logging that had previously been identified as sensitive in experimental and other retrospective studies. Species disadvantaged by logging were often either dependent on large old trees and/or tree hollows for nesting, roosting and foraging, such as the Common Brushtail Possum, Red-browed Treecreeper, Satin Flycatcher and Crimson Rosella, or they were species that inhabit open forests and woodland, such as the Rufous Bettong, Buff-rumped Thornbill, White-throated Gerygone, White's Skink and Nobbi, that were probably disadvantaged by the increase in stem density and understorey and mid-canopy cover that usually follows logging. In contrast, species favoured by logging, such as the Eastern Whipbird, Brown Gerygone, Lewin's Honeyeater, Wonga Pigeon and Land Mullet, were often those species preferring wetter forest environments, particularly those with multi-layered foliage and a forest structure that includes fallen logs and a dense ground cover. No species displayed consistently strong preferences for selectively logged forest. Mammals were more likely to be disadvantaged by logging than birds, but reptiles contained the largest proportion of species sensitive to logging (39%). Frogs were inadequately sampled in this study; only nine species were recorded. While each taxonomic group had some species that were apparently sensitive to logging, the time frame to population recovery following logging disturbance may differ widely between groups depending on their habitat requirements. Fire history was also strongly correlated with the occurrences of many species, indicating the need to quantify species sensitivity to regular fuel-reduction burning. Three main assemblages of species were identified. One group consisted of rainforest or wet forest specialists, another group comprised open-forest generalists, including a number of open-country and woodland species, and a third group was made up of tall, eucalypt forest generalists, including all of the large forest owls and marsupial gliders. Each broad assemblage, and most of their sub-groups, were found to have at least one species that was apparently sensitive to logging. The study was unable to test whether these sensitive species can function effectively as indicators of the changing status of other species within each assemblage because sampling was undertaken only once at each site. This study has provided one of the few opportunities to date to critically evaluate some aspects of the indicator species concept and its potential as a management shortcut for assessing changes in biodiversity in managed forest landscapes. Qualified support for the concept has been shown, based on the identification of a set of species apparently sensitive to logging and their representation across a range of species assemblages. The choice of candidate species for monitoring will depend on the integration of results from other experimental and retrospective studies, and will be specific to each region depending on the composition of species assemblages and the goals of management. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The dominant fire management paradigm in these regions is the use of low-intensity prescribed fire early in the dry season, to reduce the incidence of higher-intensity, more extensive wildfire later in the year. This use of frequent prescribed fire to mitigate against high-intensity wildfire has parallels with fire management in temperate forests of southern Australia. However, unlike in southern Australia, the ecological implications of high fire frequency have received little attention in the north. CSIRO and collaborators recently completed a landscape-scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, and here we provide a synthesis of the effects of experimental fire regimes on biodiversity, with particular consideration of fire frequency and, more specifically, time-since-fire. Two recurring themes emerged from Kapalga. First, much of the savanna biota is remarkably resilient to fire, even of high intensity. Over the 5-year experimental period, the abundance of most invertebrate groups remained unaffected by fire treatment, as did the abundance of most vertebrate species, and we were unable to detect any effect of fire on floristic composition of the grass-layer. Riparian vegetation and associated stream biota, as well as small mammals, were notable exceptions to this general resilience. Second, the occurrence of fire, independent of its intensity, was often the major factor influencing fire-sensitive species. This was especially the case for extinction-prone small mammals, which have suffered serious population declines across northern Australia in recent decades. Results from Kapalga indicate that key components of the savanna biota of northern Australia favour habitat that has remained unburnt for at least several years. This raises a serious conservation concern, given that very little relatively long unburnt habitat currently occurs in conservation reserves, with most sites being burnt at least once every 2 years. We propose a conservation objective of increasing the area that remains relatively long unburnt. This could be achieved either by reducing the proportion of the landscape burnt each year, or by setting prescribed fires more strategically. The provision of appropriately long unburnt habitat is a conservation challenge for Australia's tropical savanna landscapes, just as it is for its temperate forests.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.522664581,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,57,NA

We evaluated this approach using 1990s aerial survey estimates of dugong abundance and an estimate of the decline in dugong numbers since the 1960s based on changes in the catch per unit effort of dugong bycatch in a government shark control program on the east coast of Queensland, Australia. This analysis indicated that the catch rate of dugongs caught in shark nets, at six locations between latitudes 16.5¬∞ S and 28¬∞ S, declined at an average of 8.7% per year between 1962 and 1999. This represents a decline to 3.1% of initial catch rates over the sampling period. If the changes in the populations sampled by the shark nets and aerial surveys were equivalent, this result suggests that the region supported 72 000 dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4220 dugongs in the mid-1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region is currently insufficient to support 72 000 dugongs, suggesting that our hindcast estimate may be an unrealistic target for recovery. Nonetheless, the evidence of serious dugong decline from the shark-net data and other sources has triggered significant conservation initiatives. This case study indicates that comparisons between historical and contemporary estimates of the abundance of large marine vertebrates can be powerful qualitative triggers for conservation action, but that quantitative targets for recovery require systematic testing of the assumptions underlying hindcast estimates, scientific evaluation of the current carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the target species, and consultation with a broad range of stakeholders.

Shortridge was struck particularly by the rich fauna of the mesic woodland and the lack of species in the semi-arid interior (he obtained 20 terrestrial native species at the former and only 3-5 species at the latter). However, since that time, several of the species Shortridge collected at the mesic woodland sites have become extinct on mainland Australia (Bettongia lesueur, Lagostrophus fasciatus, and Perameles bougainville) or are now extinct (Onchogalea lunata) and the region shows one of the highest losses of mammals within Australia. Shortridge's collections emphasise that the loss of mammals in Western Australia has been a two-step process, with an initial loss of mammals in the semi-arid interior, followed by a subsequent loss from mesic woodland and coastal sites. His collections preceded the arrival of foxes Vulpes vulpes to the State and largely preceded the spread of rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus. Shortridge speculated that disease, predation by feral cats Felis catus, competition from house mice Mus musculus, and bushfires were major factors in overall decline, and the impact of closer settlement was important in localised declines. These, and other factors commonly cited as reasons for mammal decline (grazing and land clearing), are evaluated. The factors suggested by Shortridge for overall decline are potentially interlinked: feral cats or house mice may spread disease, feral cats may be more effective as predators in the presence of abundant house mice populations and at sites where vegetation refuges are reduced by fire, and both may reach highest densities around farms and settlements. The pattern of loss to 1907 can be explained by the spread of feral cats only if their impact on native mammals is high in semi-arid pastoral and mining areas, low in mesic areas, and low in arid areas where European impact was minimal. Possible mechanisms for such a variable impact of feral cats include: i) greater density of vegetation at mesic sites providing refuge for prey species; ii) protection conferred to prey species by poison plants Gastrolobium in the understorey of mesic woodland leading to secondary poisoning of predators; and iii) Aboriginal hunting of feral cats being effective in limiting the density and impact of cats in remote areas beyond the frontier of European colonisation.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.677563218,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,61,NA

Over the last 200 years, 60% of the native mammals have become locally extinct in this area. Project Eden commenced on Peron Peninsula, Shark Bay in 1994. Its objectives were to a) control or eradicate the introduced fauna, b) reconstruct the native fauna of the peninsula, and c) to promote nature - based tourism based on the unique Shark Bay fauna. Control of sheep, goats and foxes has been successful. Feral cat control has been difficult in the presence of large numbers of rabbits and other prey, however significant advances in the development of an effective feral cat control method have been made. A better understanding of the factors influencing the uptake of baits by feral cats has also been achieved. A captive breeding centre was established to provide animals for translocation. This ensured that wild populations of species restricted to islands or small parts of the mainland were not detrimentally impacted by the removal of large numbers of founders for translocation. Between 1996 and 2002, nearly 70 malleefowl and 150 mammals were bred/reared in captivity and 155 have been released. Malleefowl and bilbies have been successfully reintroduced to Peron Peninsula. Mala and banded hare-wallabies did not persist due primarily to cat predation. Woylies were reintroduced from other wild populations and are persisting in low numbers. Extant small vertebrate population abundances appear to respond more to rainfall events, rather than cat predation, while larger extant vertebrates have increased since sheep, goat, fox and feral cat control has been implemented. While feral cat control has been demonstrated for short periods, additional work is required to reduce their numbers further, and for longer periods before additional native species can be translocated. In addition to the re-establishment of native fauna and the enhancement of the remnant native fauna, Project Eden has provided many benefits relating to the management of pest species and native fauna in the arid zone. In light of the findings to date, it is proposed that the objectives of this project be revised and that certain actions are necessary to ensure future success. These include a refinement of feral cat control methods, the development and use of models to predict optimum bait uptake times, a review of species suitable for translocation, and the adequacy of existing staff numbers and captive breeding facilities.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.692646594,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,62,NA

Not only do feral cats prey on native fauna and have the potential to spread diseases, but they have proven to be an obstacle to fauna reintroduction programs. Western Shield fox baiting strategies have been ineffective against feral cats largely because the standard fox/dog baits are not attractive to feral cats. Until the commencement of the research described in this review paper, there was no broad area control technique available for feral cats. Feral cat control research objectives and broad strategies The principal objective of the feral cat control research program, commenced by scientists of the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) in December 1993, is to design and develop an operationally feasible bait, and baiting regimes to provide effective and cost-efficient broadscale control of feral cats. Essentially, three strategies are being employed to achieve this. First, a comprehensive and carefully designed series of both cafeteria pen trials with stray cats and subsequent field trials with feral cats were conducted in an endeavour to develop a bait medium that was attractive to feral cats. The medium also had to have operational utility including a capacity to carry a toxin, be relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture, be easily and safely handled and transported and applicable to aerial deployment over large areas. Initially, a number of bait media, representing a broad range in physical form and type, were examined for acceptability by cats. A variety of flavour enhancers was then added to the most preferred bait medium to assess whether acceptability could be further improved. Second, field-based research and operational trials focussed on field testing and further development of effective broadscale aerial baiting strategies for feral cats. This initially involved examination of bait uptake in relation to the time of year (season) to enable baiting programs to be conducted when bait uptake is at its peak and therefore maximise efficiency. A key factor affecting bait uptake is the availability of live prey, the nature and abundance of which varies geographically and temporally. While a number of trials have been undertaken in a range of ecosystems, current and future investigations aim to examine the effects of season, baiting intensity (number of baits laid km-2) and baiting frequency (interval between baiting operations) needed to optimise sustained control. These baiting research and development programs are ahead of schedules outlined in the Western Shield Proposal and the Western Shield Strategic Plan 1999-2004. Finally, in addition to optimising the various parameters of baiting strategies, it will be essential that a comprehensive risk assessment of the potential impact of feral cat baiting programs on populations of non-target species be undertaken, and where necessary, methods devised to reduce this risk. This risk assessment is in part required to gain National Registration Authority registration of the new bait as well as assuring the protection of native fauna. While reliable techniques have been developed to assess the relative abundance of feral cats, it is also necessary to further develop techniques to efficiently and reliably census feral cat populations. This, together with an effective baiting strategy, will enable experimental determination of the level of feral cat control necessary to protect either extant fauna or reintroduced fauna across the State's semi-arid and arid bioregions. Achievements Investigations thus far have culminated in the development and patenting of a novel feral cat bait that is proving highly effective in experimental and operational baiting programs in arid and semi-arid regions of WA, as described in detail in this review. For example, the most recent large scale aerial baiting trial implemented under dry winter conditions in the Gibson Desert resulted in about a 95% reduction in the relative abundance of feral cats. The feral cat bait, which is also effective against foxes, has been used successfully in the eradication of feral cats from two islands off the Western Australian coast. Research into the relationships between season, live prey abundance and bait uptake are well advanced in a number of bioregions. Results to hand show temporal (seasonal) variability in live prey abundance and bait consumption. In areas that experience a Mediterranean-type climate and particularly where rabbits are abundant, the optimum baiting period occurs in the drier autumn/early winter months when young, predator-vulnerable prey are not present but before the onset of winter rains. As predator-vulnerable young prey become more abundant, which is a function of long-term weather conditions (season/rainfall), bait uptake is likely to decline. In the arid zone, where rainfall is unreliable, the time and intensity of rainfall events and season determines the overall abundance of prey. Research in the interior arid zone has suggested that the optimum time to conduct baiting programs and maximise their effectiveness is under cool dry conditions in winter. At this time, the abundance and activity of all prey types, in particular small mammals, reptiles and birds, is at its lowest and bait degradation due to ants and to hot, dry weather, is significantly reduced. The current series of trials is designed to investigate baiting efficacy at differing bait distribution rates (number of baits per unit area) to provide a cost-efficient control strategy. To-date, this series has demonstrated that a baiting density half that used in island eradications is equally efficacious in the control of feral cats in the arid interior. A highly effective toxic baiting of feral cats on the Gibson Desert Nature Reserve and Peron Peninsula this year has supported this evidence. The high level of bio-marking and good control of feral cats during these exercises suggests that further reductions in bait distribution may not reduce baiting efficacy. Difficulties There have been no extraordinary difficulties with a research project of this complexity and magnitude. Scientists commenced the project with little or no available background scientific information. There were commercial-in-confidence issues in accessing literature on cat food and the ramifications of patenting various aspects of the research. Other difficulties are associated with the temporal and spatial practical aspects of working on feral cats at an operational or large scale, and in remote areas. However, the main difficulty in such a project, and one which is universal to most research, that is gaining sufficient funding to enable the research to be carried out to a high standard and be completed within an acceptable time frame. To a large extent, this problem has been overcome with sponsorship being provided over a five-year period. The only other significant difficulty has arisen during the course of the collaborative research into the felid-specific toxin where development of the encapsulation system for the toxicant is taking a longer period of time than originally anticipated. Potential economies The step-wise approach to developing an optimal broadscale, aerial feral cat control strategy is being pursued to provide for effective and cost-efficient wildlife recovery. The focus is on optimising feral cat predation control through aerial baiting and providing a comprehensive evaluation of any impact on non-target species populations. The program is structured to enable analysis of the cost-benefit of various baiting regimes on both feral cats and non-target species and provide information essential to gaining registration of the feral cat bait. The development of a readily manufactured sausage-type bait will result in considerable savings in production, handling and delivery of the bait. The cost of feral cat baits is currently about 30¬∞ per bait at today's level of production. One third of this cost is for materials, and the remainder is associated with labour and production equipment. The future costs of baits will depend on economies of scale (level of production), degree of automation and the cost and depreciation rate of the manufacturing equipment, but it is anticipated that costs can be reduced when manufacture extends to an operational scale. Potential improvements Future research will focus on refinements to the bait medium, the development of a felid specific toxin, refinements to bait production and handling and designing bioregionally appropriate baiting regimes with respect to season, intensity and frequency of baiting. Further research on non-target issues is a high priority.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.498024229,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,63,NA

We report estimates of less than 200 for each of Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef and ‚àº14000 for Shark Bay. This is an apparent overall increase in the dugong population over this whole region, but with a distributional shift of animals to the south. The most plausible hypothesis to account for a large component of this apparent population shift is that animals in Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef moved to Shark Bay, most likely after Tropical Cyclone Vance impacted available dugong forage in the northern habitat. Bias associated with survey estimate methodology, and normal changes in population demographics may also have contributed to the change. The movement of large numbers of dugongs over the scale we suggest has important management implications. First, such habitat-driven shifts in regional abundance will need to be incorporated in assessing the effectiveness of marine protected areas that aim to protect dugongs and their habitat. Second, in circumstances where aerial surveys are used to estimate relative trends in abundance of dugongs, animal movements of the type we propose could lead to errors in interpretation.",Review,NA,Scopus,0.775613346,NA,1,NA,NA,10,64,NA

After pest control, counts of kukupa and some other bird species increased at Motatau compared with counts in a nearby non-treatment block, suggesting numbers of adult kukupa can be increased in small forest areas by intensive pest control. This increase is due at least partly to increased nest success.

Aerial surveys often are the only practical way of obtaining these estimates for large mammals ranging over a large area. Different aerial survey techniques are available. This paper reports on a study that estimated abundance and population density of wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Australian Alps using helicopter aerial surveys. Three frequently used techniques were compared simultaneously: strip counts, mark-recapture, and line transect. Using data on horse groups over a strip width of 200 m, estimates of horse abundance from mark-recapture analyses were higher (NÃÇ = 3,045 modified Petersen and NÃÇ = 3,298 Huggins estimators, respectively) than from strip counts (NÃÇ = 1,814 and NÃÇ = 2,242 for observers 1 and 2, respectively). Use of line-transect analysis yielded the highest estimates of abundance (NÃÇ = 5,200-5,830, population density DÃÇ = 1.86-2.09 km -2). The coefficient of variation (CV) of estimates varied from 22% for strip counts (0-50 m) to 28% for mark-recapture analysis (0-50 m) and 31-32% for line-transect analysis (0-200 m). Mark-recapture estimates of horse abundance from the modified Petersen estimator were substantially lower when the strip width was 200 m (NÃÇ = 2,061) compared with a strip width of 50 m (NÃÇ = 4,345). These results suggested that in aerial surveys using strip or mark-recapture analyses, the effect of wide strip width should be examined; otherwise estimates may be strongly negatively biased.

A mark-recapture study was conducted in the sole remaining L. krefftii population, based on microsatellite identification of individuals and their gender from DNA in remotely collected single hairs. Population size was estimated to be 113 (95% confidence interval of 96 to 150). This suggests an increase in population size over the previous estimate of 65 (95% CI 42-186) in 1993, although the estimates did not differ significantly. There was a significant male bias in the sex ratio (2.25 males: 1 female), in agreement with recent trapping surveys. The non-invasive approach used here is vital for estimating population size and trends, and hence it is the most important recent advance in the conservation management of the northern hairy-nosed wombat. ¬© 2003 The Zoological Society of London.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.819005402,NA,1,Comparing current estimate to previous/historical work,NA,5,72,NA

In some cases there are too many animals and in others there are too few. Genetic issues arise in both instances. The historical and genetic evidence for the number of mammals that were in the founder populations of successful colonizing species in Australia and New Zealand is reviewed here. Small numbers have often given rise to large populations, despite the concomitant loss of genetic variability. Restriction of the number of over-abundant and pest species by either physical or chemical methods frequently constitutes very strong artificial selection, which leads to rapid genetic change; an example of major importance in the two countries is sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080). Pathogenic agents, surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives and translocation have all been used with varying degrees of success. The strengths and weaknesses of these techniques are assessed. A method that has received much attention is immunocontraception. We argue that this attempt to use the animals' own immune system to modulate reproduction is incompatible with the basic biological function of protection against infectious disease. Immune function genes are highly variable in vertebrates, and so often genetic change in the population subjected to immunocontraception is likely to be even more rapid than is the case with lethal agents. Selection for failure to respond to the immunocontraceptive will occur, and will change immune function in general. Poor scientific description of ecosystem complexity makes it difficult to predict the consequences of immunocontraception on wildlife populations.",Article,NA,Scopus,0.489286958,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,73,NA

As many as 100 birds can occupy a roost in a small area of swamp. They start to assemble about one hour before dark and communal aerial displays in the vicinity of the roost are an integral part of the roosting behaviour. Roosts may be occupied all the year round, non‚Äêbreeding birds continuing to roost communally throughout the summer. In New Zealand the habit is neither connected with migration nor is it an anti‚Äêpredator device. It is considered that the abundance of food caused by the spread of introduced mammals and the large increase of habitat created by European settlement has built the harrier population up to such a size that the number required to elicit the response of communal roosting occurs at all times of year in most districts. Numbers within individual roosts fluctuate throughout the year and it is suggested that communal displays before roosting may provide the necessary feed‚Äêback for the initiation of population adjustments.
