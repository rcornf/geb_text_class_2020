It can also have practical applications in fisheries management and conservation. There are thought to be more than one thousand species of fish in the 40 or so major rivers of the Guinea-Congo rain forest region, with correspondingly high levels of endemicity. In the Congo or Za√Øre river basin alone, the proportion of endemic fish species may exceed 80% (from a total of >690), but many more taxonomic and distributional data remain to be gathered. Unlike terrestrial vertebrates, the diverse freshwater fishes of Guinea-Congo evidently have distributions which are closely confined by hydrography. Hence, fish distributions may be of particular help in corroborating or refuting postulated geological events, patterns and processes and in explaining associated aspects of rainforest evolution. From the 19th century until now, the ichthyogeography of Guinea-Congo has been diagnosed largely in terms of presumed post-Miocene geological sequences of fish taxa and their past and recent dispersal in relation to particular hydrological conditions: mainly riverine volume discharge, salinity and temperature. From this, the fish fauna is, by convention, divided into 'provinces' established on endemism, palaeogeography and supposed physical or ecological barriers to dispersal. However, in this paper it is argued that the traditional ichthyogeographical accounts which highlight endemism and dispersal are generally flawed. It is argued here that historical patterns of fish distribution can only be fully understood if phyletic (cladistic) data are taken into consideration. While Upper and Lower Guinea and the Za√Øre basin may be defined in part on the basis of endemism there is a lack of taxonomic and distributional evidence to show that Guinea-Congo is itself a cohesive ichthyogeographical unit. There is clearly a need for comparisons with fish distributions outside the rain forest zone of Guinea-Congo. African inter-provincial, trans-continental and inter-continental comparisons reveal distribution patterns which may relate more to pre-Miocene rather than post-Miocene geology or present-day rain forest ecology. Continental drift, notably between Africa and South America, probably led to the separation 85 million years ago of previously united fish populations. This may account for recent higher-level phyletic correspondences between the separate rain forest fish faunas of Africa and the neotropics. Last, the so-called 'marine intrusive' fishes - which are normally excluded from zoogeographical consideration - merit a careful re-evaluation. While they may be regarded as an inconvenience in developing scientific hypotheses, such intrusives can comprise a remarkable 30% or more of the riverine fish fauna in Guinea-Congo. It seems that the widely accepted ecological divisions between marine and 'primary freshwater' fishes are not as clear-cut as has been supposed. In addition, zoogeographically critical marine, trans-Atlantic, phyletic relationships apparently exist. These are probably best interpreted by using area cladograms in the context of ocean basin development, rather than by referring solely to marine fish dispersal and the traditional continental and provincial ichthyogeography of Guinea-Congo.","Article","Scopus",0.562677123508072,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,67,NA

The molariform morphs, specialized to feed on hard prey, are able to crack snail shells that are twice as hard as those cracked by the papilliform morphs. During ecological bottlenecks in food resources this ability should allow molariform morphs to exploit alternate, less preferred prey sources that are not available to papilliform morphs. Analysis of stomach contents revealed that molariform morphs feed significantly more often on hard snails than do papilliform morphs (Meyer 1989a). The performance advantage of the trophically specialized morphs when feeding on hard prey is countered by their less efficient performance on soft diets. The morphologically generalized papilliform morph feeds more efficiently on soft prey. The abundance of preferred soft prey, seasonal fluctuations in prey availability and the frequency of ecological bottlenecks may determine the relative abundance of these two morphs in natural populations in Nicaraguan lakes. ¬© 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Scopus",0.399679679841381,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,50,NA

The pharyngeal jaws are either gracile and bear slender, pointed teeth (papilliform) or robust with strong, rounded teeth (molariform). Molariform morphs have a ‚Äòbenthic‚Äô, and papilliform morphs a ‚Äòlimnetic‚Äô body form. Furthermore, this species is also polychromatic, with yellow and black morphs. The molariform morphology of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus adapts the fish for cracking and feeding on snails. Based on analysis of stomach contents, 94% of the molariform morph ate snails whereas only 19%, of the papilliform morph did so. This result suggests that the morphs occupy different ecological niches. The morphology of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus does not correlate significantly with sex, but it does with body colouration (P<0.005). Cichlasoma citrinellum mate assortatively with their own colour; therefore a mating preference for colour may lead to genetic isolation of trophic morphs. The frequency of the molariform morph differs strikingly among populations of five Nicaraguan lakes and its abundance is correlated with the abundance of snails, the fishes' principal prey item. Among populations the frequency of molariform morphs decreases in the dry season. Morphology possibly changes reversibly within particular individuals between seasons. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity and polymorphisms may be an adaptive characteristic of cichlid fishes. Patterns of intraspecific morphological variation match patterns of interspecific morphological diversification which suggests that universal developmental mechanisms canalize the possible expressions of morphology. The ability to respond morphologically to environmental shifts, in conjunction with genetically determined trophic polymorphisms and sexual selection via mate choice, could be the basis for speciation through intermediate stages of polymorphism of the impressive adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes.

When drift periodicty was examined along a gradient of predation regimes, activity was increasingly restricted to the nighttime hours as predation risk became more intense.

The potential impact of predation on armoured catfish was determined by combining laboratory measurements of predation rates on five early developmental stages of the armoured catfish H. thoracatum for 24 aquatic predators with field studies of the density of the predators in the swamps. The contribution of a particular predator to the total predation pressure on its prey was determined to a large extent by the density of the predator in the swamp. Seemingly innocuous predators with low or moderate predation rates in the laboratory may be extremely important in the swamps due to their high abundance. Small-sized omnivorous fishes and aquatic invertebrates were major predators of early developmental stages of armoured catfish. Both qualitative and quantitative ontogenetic changes in the predation pressure on armoured catfish were observed. Major predation on eggs, larvae and juveniles of H. thoracatum resulted from a different set of predators in each developmental stage of the prey. In all developmental stages of H. thoracatum the predation pressure involved several predator species and not a single, dominant predator. The potential predation pressure of the 24 predators taken together and the number of predators that were able to prey on H. thoracatum decreased sharply with increasing age (size) of the prey. Even if egg (nest) predation is prevented by the guarding male, the potential impact of the 24 predators on the populations of armoured catfish is large. Predation may account for the high mortality of H. thoracatum observed in the swamps. The high predation pressure on callichthyid catfishes may help to explain the coexistence of three closely related and morphologically quite similar armoured catfishes in Surinamese swamps.","Article","Scopus",0.572379779525277,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,62,NA

However, the available data seem to be insufficient to draw general conclusions regarding the transformation of fish communities. A hydroelectric dam was built on the Sinnamary River in French Guiana and closed in January 1994. From December 1991 to December 1996 fish collections were made from the downstream section. The results show a rapid decrease in fish abundance in the middle downstream course immediately after dam closure. This low abundance was observed until the end of the filling phase, when the flow was maintained at a minimum level. Afterwards, abundance returned to a level comparable with that prior to dam closure. Fish collection in different zones showed that the decrease in abundance was probably due to the escape of fish to shelter areas. Another marked effect was the reduction of sample diversity due to a decrease in species richness, as well as in the regularity of the distribution of species' relative abundance. Examination of biological traits of species suggests that under these conditions feeding strategies could have been the most important factor affecting the abundance of populations.","Article","Scopus",0.686967694642252,NA,1,"damn effect",NA,10,30,0

Field data from the Neotropics, where it is indigenous, are presented for the first time, charting the variation in abundance of M. tanajoa over several seasons. This was highly variable, with a characteristic trough mid-year and a peak at the turn of the year. This pattern corresponded positively with rainfall levels, appearing to fit a phenology also characteristic of African studies, where rainfall at the start of the wet season promotes a leaf flush and so growth in M. tanajoa populations. Analyses implied some impact of leaf-inhabiting predatory mites (predominantly Neoseiulus idaeus Denmark and Muma) and a considerable impact of the fungal pathogen Neozygites floridana Fisher on M. tanajoa populations. This pathogen was not observed in the host population for several (generally dry) periods implying survival outside the host, perhaps as resting spores. This is a particularly desirable characteristic of a biological control agent. It is therefore proposed that N. floridana might be of particular use in drier cassava-growing areas where rainfall at the outset of the wet season is not sufficiently intense to cause heavy M. tanajoa mortality but may be sufficient to stimulate epizootics of the fungal pathogen, protecting the flush of new cassava growth.","Article","Scopus",0.507533626627898,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33,NA

Lagoons, secondary channels and river channel was sampled with gillnet of different mesh size and standardized effort. Diversity, evenness indexes and number of species increased with the occurence of floods.

This project is being developed within Parque Nacional Palo Verde and Reserva Biol√≥gica Lomas Barbudal, both of which form part of the only remaining tropical dry forests in Mesoamerica. To determine the short-term effects of cattle grazing on the natural vegetation, we compared the floristic composition within Palo Verde in an area under intermittent cattle grazing with an area that has not been grazed. There were significantly fewer plant species in the area with intermittent cattle grazing compared to the area with no grazing. Floristic composition of these two habitats was different as reflected by both Fisher's alpha values and the Shannon index of diversity, both of which were significantly higher in the ungrazed site. The ungrazed area contained more plant species and was more similar to mature forest. The structure of the vegetation was significantly different between the intermittently grazed and ungrazed sites with more small stems (1-5 cm dbh) and fewer large stems (>5 cm dbh) in the intermittently grazed habitat. These results indicate that cattle grazing has an impact on the dry forest by reducing the relative abundance and density of larger tree species and by changing the species composition and structure of the community. The current management plan implemented in Palo Verde and Lomas Barbudal is not appropriate because of the impact that cattle have on the structure of the natural vegetation and should not be considered a viable alternative in other protected areas of dry forest in the Neotropics. We suggest that alternative fire prevention measures be evaluated including hand-cutting H. rufa, the creation of more frequent and larger fire breaks, and the development of green breaks.","Article","Scopus",0.528729566674434,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,NA

Two stream habitats, riffles and pools, were sampled monthly. Benthic assemblage composition was similar to that reported for other areas in Central America and was dominated by the orders Ephemeroptera (Tricorythodes, Leptohyphes, Thraulodes, Baetis?), Coleoptera (Elmidae), and Diptera (mainly Chironomidae). Collector-gatherers were the dominant functional-feeding group and very few shredders were found. Annual habitat-weighted secondary production was highest for Tricorythodes (87.07 mg ash-free dry mass [AFDM] m-2 y-1) and Chironomidae (74.47 mg AFDM m-2 y-1). Total habitat-weighted secondary production was 363.65 mg AFDM m-2 y-1. Riffles supported the highest abundance, biomass, and secondary production of benthic insects. This study provides the 1st estimates of secondary production for a neotropical stream. Abundance, biomass, and secondary production in the study stream were low in comparison to results obtained in subtropical and temperate regions. However, annual production to biomass (P/B) ratios were high (range 5-103), indicating rapid population turnover. Monthly assessment of assemblage structure showed that benthic abundance increased with the number of days since the last large rainstorm (&gt;50 mm/24 h). In addition, habitat-weighted abundance was negatively correlated with stream discharge. The abundance of macroconsumers (e.g., fishes and benthic shrimps) that potentially reduce food resources and prey upon insects might in part be responsible for the low abundance, production, and proportion of insect shredders in the study stream. Results suggest that other organisms (i.e., macroconsumers, microbes) are filling the functional roles that are normally assumed by benthic insects in temperate regions. Therefore, energy is potentially flowing through pathways other than insects from primary producers and detritus to upper trophic levels. In addition, precipitation and subsequent high discharge are major factors determining the structure of benthic communities in the study stream. Our results support the hypothesis that the structure and production of the benthic insect assemblage in this neotropical stream are the result of interactions between the physical environment (e.g., discharge and habitat type) and macroconsumers.","Article","Scopus",0.46694557107274,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,47,NA

Fishes were collected during day and night to estimate species density and relative abundances at each site. Twenty-two morphological variables were measured for each species. Principal components analysis (PCA) of physical habitat data yielded two axes that modeled > 80% of variation across sites.

Recent ecologic and demographic studies indicate that these fishes exist in large, stable populations with adult census numbers exceeding one million individuals. Abundance data present a stark contrast to very low levels of genetic diversity (Œò) and small effective population sizes (Ne) observed in a mitochondrial (mt) DNA dataset obtained for two species, Prochilodus mariae, and its putative sister taxon, Prochilodus rubrotaeniatus. Both species occupy major river drainages (Orinoco, Essequibo, and Negro) of northeastern South America. Disparity between expectations based on current abundance and life history information and observed genetic data in these lineages could result from historical demographic bottlenecks, or alternatively, natural selection (i.e., a mtDNA selective sweep). To ascertain underlying processes that affect mtDNA diversity in these species we compared Œò and N6 estimates obtained from two, unlinked nuclear loci (calmodulin intron-4 and elongation factor-1Œ± intron-6) using an approach based on coalescent theory. Genetic diversity and Ne estimated from mtDNA and nuclear sequences were uniformly low in P. rubrotaeniatus from the Rio Negro, suggesting that this population has encountered a historical bottleneck. For all P. mariae populations, Œò and Ne based on nuclear sequences were comparable to expectations based on current adult census numbers and were significantly greater than mtDNA estimates, suggesting that a selective mtDNA sweep has occurred in this species.

T. iheringi has been recorded from Mato Grosso (Brazil) to water bodies associated with the R√≠o de la Plata river (Argentina). During an extensive survey in the southern limit of the native area of P. canaliculata the presence of T. iheringi eggs was recorded in several apple snail populations, extending the known distribution of the commensal more than 400 km southwards. The aim of this study was to understand the factors affecting the distribution and abundance of T. iheringi among populations of P. canaliculata. Only 23% of the apple snail populations inhabiting streams harboured temnocephalans while the occurrence among lentic ones was 71%. T. iheringi was found mostly in populations of apple snails living in non-alkaline sites and where snails attaining sizes larger than 4 cm were very common. The prevalence of the temnocephalans in lentic populations was higher than 90%. The number of eggs on the shell (not including the umbilicus) ranged between 0 and 470 and was different among populations of P. canaliculata. The prevalence and number of eggs were lower in the lotic populations, except for a stream population immediately downstream of a lake with commensals. There was no difference between males and females of P. canaliculata neither in the prevalence nor in the number of eggs on the shell. The southernmost population of the world of P. canaliculata harbours commensals that tolerate cold winter water temperatures (4-5¬∞C) as well as its host. On the other hand, T. iheringi was found only in sites with bicarbonate concentrations lower than 6.6 meq l-1, suggesting that the tolerance of the commensal is very much lower than that of the apple snail (up to 9.95 meq l-1). The number of worms inside each snail or the life history variation of P. canaliculata could explain the influence of the size of the snails on the occurrence of T. iheringi. In the big-sized snails, where the number of commensals is higher, the probability of survival of at least one worm is also higher, specially during the hibernation period, when crawling and feeding are null and snails remain buried. On the other hand, P. canaliculata snails from lentic populations are generally bigger and mostly iteroparous, while those inhabiting streams are smaller and semelparous. In these populations the snails have access to mate only with snails of their same cohort, while in iteroparous populations they can copulate with individuals of other cohorts, allowing the inter-generation transmission of worms and the long term persistence of the population of commensals. ¬© Springer 2005.","Article","Scopus",0.709829377212196,0,0,NA,5,5,3,NA

Aquatic ecosystems represent one of the most affected environments and many fish species and/or populations have been increasingly fragmented distributed due to habitat degradation, predatory fishing, introduction of exotic species, river sedimentation, deforestation, pollution, reduction of food resource, and construction of hydroelectric dams. Actually, more than 150 Brazilian fish species, including freshwater, estuary and coastal species, can be considered threatened. Information on the diversity, conservation biology and population analysis on threatened species or populations, with several DNA markers, can be extremely useful for the success of fish species-recovery and maintenance programs. Although DNA analysis in Neotropical fish species are just beginning, they tend to increase with the widespread attention to the use of molecular approaches to minimize problems related to the risk of extinction. The accumulation of information on biology and pattern of genetic variation of fish species, associated with ecological and demographic data, and also education and respect to the nature, constitutes a crucial task to develop efficient conservation strategies in order to preserve the genetic diversity in aquatic environments.","Review","Scopus",0.573325071112763,0,NA,NA,10,NA,10,NA

Overfishing and other human influences are reducing the diversity and abundance of fish worldwide, but the ecosystem-level consequences of these changes have not been assessed quantitatively. Recycling of nutrients is one important ecosystem process that is directly influenced by fish. Fish species vary widely in the rates at which they excrete nitrogen and phosphorus; thus, altering fish communities could affect nutrient recycling. Here, we use extensive field data on nutrient recycling rates and population sizes of fish species in a Neotropical river and Lake Tanganyika, Africa, to evaluate the effects of simulated extinctions on nutrient recycling. In both of these species-rich ecosystems, recycling was dominated by relatively few species, but contributions of individual species differed between nitrogen and phosphorus. Alternative extinction scenarios produced widely divergent patterns. Loss of the species targeted by fishermen led to faster declines in nutrient recycling than extinctions in order of rarity, body size, or trophic position. However, when surviving species were allowed to increase after extinctions, these compensatory responses had strong moderating effects even after losing many species. Our results underscore the complexity of predicting the consequences of extinctions from species-rich animal communities. Nevertheless, the importance of exploited species in nutrient recycling suggests that overfishing could have particularly detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning. ¬© 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Article","Scopus",0.482024348227564,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,55,NA

In the Orinoco basin, riverine and floodplain habitats, including riparian forests, play key roles in the conservation of biodiversity and support commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries. The basin's three major floodplains regulate the amplitude and duration of floods, maintain fertile agricultural terrain, provide habitat for numerous terrestrial and aquatic species, and support the fishery. The fish fauna, which includes some 1,000 species, encompasses a great deal of ecological diversity in terms of geographic distributions, habitat affinities, functional morphology, and reproductive and feeding strategies. The Orinoco fishery is still multispecific, with around 80 different species found in the fish markets at different times of year. Current estimates indicate that annual sustainable yield is 40,000 - 45,000 metric tons. Fish culture in the region is underdeveloped despite decades of research and promotion. There is no serious commercial trade for ornamental fishes. Large regions of the Orinoco basin are still in a relatively pristine state, but aquatic resources are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction, overharvesting, pollution, and hydrological perturbation. Scientific understanding of diversity hotspots, critical habitats, and conservation status of fishes in the basin is currently insufficient to satisfy management needs. Compliance to fishery regulations is low and fishing is drastically modifying the relative abundance, population structure, and distribution of fish stocks. However, many sectors of the Orinoco basin are unexploited or only lightly exploited, and fish stocks can recover quickly if given the opportunity. Stricter enforcement of current fishery regulations would reduce the likelihood of stock collapses and other, possibly irreversible, changes in the fishery.

The abundance and species richness of Neotropical amphibian communities suggest that losses of this magnitude are likely to have strong effects at the ecosystem level. To improve understanding of the implications of their loss we used stable isotope analysis to examine trophic relationships in an ecosystem in which amphibians are dominant in a second-order forest stream at 750 m asl in Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama. We analysed Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and C:N ratios of major biotic components (basal resources, invertebrates, amphibians, fish and reptiles) in the stream and of the adjacent riparian food web. Tadpoles (mean Œ¥15N = 4.49‚Ä∞) and adult amphibians (mean Œ¥15N = 5.45‚Ä∞) were intermediate links in the aquatic and terrestrial food web respectively. High Œ¥15N signatures identified fish as top predators in the aquatic food web and snakes and the toad Bufo as top predators in the terrestrial food web. Isotopic signatures clearly distinguished between trophic groups of tadpoles: microbial feeders (Centrolenidae, Œ¥15N range = 0.91-3.05‚Ä∞), herbivores (Rana and Hyla, Œ¥15N range = 4.74-5.15‚Ä∞) and neuston feeders (Colostethus, Œ¥15N range = 5.31-6.40‚Ä∞). Dependence on autotrophic production was indicated by enriched signatures of carbon isotopes in pool dwellers versus those that reside in faster-flowing sections of the stream. High nitrogen concentrations in detrital matter (average 0.8%, C:N = 10.3) suggested that grazing tadpoles enhanced nitrogen fluxes and improved the quality of organic matter available to detritivores.

In total, 5,584 remains of prey items from 20 food types were found. Fish composed the bulk of the diet representing 99.9% by mass and 99.7% by number. The main food items were White croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) (73.7% by frequency of occurrence, 48.9% by mass and 41.2% by number), followed by Catfish (Ariidae) and anchovies (Engraulididae). In Lagoa dos Patos estuary the generalist Neotropic cormorant fed mainly on the two most abundant demersal fishes (White croaker and Catfish), which accounted for the low niche breadth calculated. The total length of all fish preyed varied from 27.2 to 318.3 mm (113.5 ¬± 48.0 mm), and preyed White croakers' size differed between months. Neotropic cormorants seem to prey on most abundant class sizes of White croaker instead of selecting similar prey size throughout the time. However, temporary changes in diet in terms of food items, abundance and prey size were detected, revealing a high ecological plasticity of the species. Individual daily food intake of Neotropic cormorants estimated by pellets and metabolic equations corresponded to 23.7 and 27.1% of their body mass, falling in the range of other cormorant species. Annual food consumption of the population estimated by both methods was 73.4 and 81.9 tonnes, comprising mainly immature and subadult White croaker and Catfish which are commercially important. Temporal variations in diet composition and fish size preyed by Neotropics cormorants, a widespread and generalist species, suggest shifts according to fluctuations in the abundance of prey. The plasticity of this cormorant is also revealed by their ability to adjust feeding behaviour in response to temporal or local changes in the environment, from a generalist at the species level to a specialist at the individual or local population level. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Scopus",0.690362254528709,0,0,NA,10,5,18,NA

Fish community structure varied more in space (longitudinal) than through time (seasonal). The community in the lower reach species was more diverse in comparison with the other reaches. Differences in the fish assemblage structure among the longitudinal river sections appear to have been influenced by the effects of damming, and seem to be partially consistent with the Serial Discontinuity Concept, which views dams as discontinuities within the river continuum.

It aimed to determine the importance of spatial and environmental factors on fish distributions and to assess the use of fish as indicators of the environmental conditions. A longitudinal pattern of chemical water quality was observed, with more disturbed conditions at the urban sites. Several opportunistic or tolerant and omnivorous species such as Astyanax altiparanae, Poecilia reticulata, and Astyanax fasciatus were numerically abundant at these urban sites, which resulted in a consistent increase in species density and biomass along the stream. Redundancy analysis extracted three axes, identifying a nutrient-productivity gradient associated with different species composition patterns, as also detected by the indicator species analysis. No species could be considered a potential indicator of the agricultural area in the dry season, whereas four different species were judged potential indicators of three urban sites. In order to explain species distribution, variation in species abundance was partitioned into spatial and environmental components. The latter was more important, explaining 25.4% of the variation. We concluded that the fish assemblage of the Guamium stream is undergoing the initial stages of disturbance, with pronounced effects at the urbanized area, but no detectable changes at the sugar cane sites. Therefore, fish assemblages might be used as ecological indicators to detect urban impacts in similar rivers. However, the potential use of fish to diagnose stressors in areas of sugar cane plantations should be complementary to more comprehensive studies aimed at understanding the influence of this crop on freshwater resources. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.521331119959406,0,NA,NA,15,NA,23,NA

The objectives of this study were to: 1) conduct a survey of the diversity of odonate larvae in southern Brazil wetlands, and 2) determine how much variation in odonate richness, abundance and composition is explained by wetland area, altitude, water conductivity and nitrate, hydroperiod, and dominant aquatic vegetation in 140 wetlands in an extensive area of the Neotropical region (‚àº280,000 km2, southern Brazil). A total of 4,039 individuals distributed among five families and 28 genera were collected. Libellulidae, Coenagrionidae and Aeshnidae were the families that showed the greatest richness. Erythrodiplax was observed in more than 70 of the sampled wetlands, and comprised 61 of individuals collected. Richness was negatively associated with wetland area and nitrate concentration. Odonate abundance was negatively associated with water conductivity and nitrate, and it was higher in aquatic beds than in emergent wetlands. Richness and abundance were higher in permanent than in intermittent wetlands. Variation in odonate composition was correlated with wetland altitude, area and water conductivity. Hydroperiod and dominant aquatic vegetation also influenced composition. Our results showed that southern Brazil wetlands are important habitats for 28 odonate genera, and that richness, abundance and composition are influenced mainly by hydroperiod, nitrate, and aquatic vegetation type. These results should be seen as important to determine the environmental factors that shape and maintain odonate diversity in southern Brazil wetlands. ¬© 2010 Kansas Entomological Society.","Review","Scopus",0.488313137270403,0,NA,NA,15,NA,22,NA

A species of Neotropical suckermouth armored catfish (family Loricariidae), tentatively identified as the Amazon sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys pardalis Castelnau 1855, is established in Thailand where it is becoming increasingly widespread and abundant. In March 2008, the local and national news reported that thousands of Pterygoplichthys were present in the Nong Yai Canal in eastern Thailand. Their report prompted us to investigate the abundance, diet, and habitat of this invasive species. Field sampling revealed that the average density Pterygoplichthys in the canal was 88 ¬± 93 individuals/100 m2. They were most abundant in the heavily urban downstream region of the canal. Over 70% of the total number of fishes taken in beach seine samples were Pterygoplichthys. The remaining 30% was a mix of native and non-native fish species. Linear regression of the abundance data indicates that native fishes will further decline and may eventually disappear in sites where Pterygoplichthys become established. Pterygoplichthys are known to thrive in disturbed habitats and the corresponding decline of natives in our study area may be the result interactions with the invasive fish or perhaps simply a reflection of their intolerance to a habitat that has become increasingly degraded (hyper-eutrophic). The existing canal has poor water quality as indicated by low dissolved oxygen levels (2.7 ¬± 2.1 mgL-1), and excessive concentrations of total phosphorus (3.8 ¬± 1.9 mgL -1), nitrogen (14 ¬± 2.8 mgL-1) and organic carbon (8.8 ¬± 2.6 mgL-1). Effective management and control of wild populations of Pterygoplichthys are urgently needed, before this species spreads further in Thailand.","Article","Scopus",0.643471805503279,0,0,NA,15,10,19,NA

The construction of fish passes has been one of the strategies adopted by Brazilian authorities and the energy sector to diminish the effects of these barriers on migratory fish communities. Despite the high investments and efforts involved, most facilities have been considered ineffective for conservation purposes. Decades of poor monitoring and the lack of specific studies have limited our knowledge on the real role of fish passes. Efficiency has been frequently defined as the proportion of fish that ascend a fish passage facility, compared to the shoal size that reaches the dam. Inspired by the notion that fishes accumulated below the dam need to migrate upstream, the quantity of fish passed upstream historically indicated successful management, as generally inferred by the fish abundance inside the fish pass. We propose a new concept for estimating fish pass efficiency for South American rivers, based on the capability of the fish pass to maintain viable populations. This broader approach is necessary because knowledge of fish habitats below and above the pass, plus the feasibility of downstream movements of eggs, larvae and adults through the reservoir and past the dam, is needed for assessing whether a fish pass is working as a conservation tool. ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.638545026485875,NA,0,NA,NA,10,54,NA

Marine-vagrant species were restricted to the sites under the influence of salinity intrusion, whereas estuarine-related and freshwater guilds were found along the entire estuarine-freshwater gradient. Primary- and secondary-freshwater fish guilds had the most widespread spatial distribution and comprised a major fraction of the total abundance and species richness. Abiotic factors correlated with fish abundance and composition along two main environmental axes, one related with variation in salinity, water transparency, and sediment granulometry and the other with the slope gradient. Species richness was significantly higher at the natural channel linking the estuarine- and freshwater-ecosystem, which probably was due to: (a) a steeper slope that favored the confluence of fish from the littoral (<2 m) and limnetic (>2 m) zones and (b) the sporadic inflow of saltwater that carried into this region several marine-related species. Although estuarine-freshwater ecotones are known to support few species, mainly salinity tolerant, our results suggest that habitat features and seasonal fish movement associated with salinity intrusion could lead to more diverse fish assemblages in this transitional zone. ¬© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.50755477522668,0,NA,NA,5,NA,2,NA

Our goal was to evaluate the occupation of the new habitat (Manso Reservoir), by this species, as well as to test the hypothesis that in the reservoir, unlike the natural environment, there are remarkable changes in diet between the periods. Fish were sampled monthly in the floodplain lake and in the reservoir during two annual periods using gillnets. To evaluate the differences in abundance of A. osteomystax we employed the Kruskal -Wallis test, and the diet analysis was carried out using frequency of occurrence and volumetric methods. Temporal differences in the diet were tested by Kruskal-Wallis test using the scores from a detrended correspondence analysis. A. osteomystax was significantly more abundant in the floodplain lake, where the captures were higher than in the reservoir in almost all months analyzed, and significant variations in abundance between the two periods were not recorded in either the reservoir or the floodplain lake. The diet variation between the two periods, which had a time lag of three years between them, was much less pronounced in the natural environment, where the resource availability is essentially regulated by seasonality. Thus, our hypothesis was accepted; that is, the interannual variations in the diet of A. osteomystax are more relevant in an artificial environment than in a natural one.","Article","Scopus",0.593132850491681,1,1,"effect of damns",10,15,14,NA

The genus Atlantirivulus includes 11 species distributed along coastal river basins and lagoons of eastern and southern Brazil. Most killifishes are threatened with extinction mostly due to their restricted distribution ranges, small population sizes, and habitat loss. Poor knowledge on ecological- and life history information further increases the threats. Atlantirivulus riograndensis (Costa et Lan√©s, 2009) is a non-annual, small-sized fish endemic in the Laguna dos Patos basin and adjacent coastal areas in southern Brazil. There is no information on the life history and ecology of the species. In this paper, we analyzed population traits of A. riograndensis to support conservation efforts. Materials and methods. The fish were captured with a D-shaped hand net in six sampling surveys carried out between 2008 (June, August, and October) and 2009 (March, August, and October) in the type locality of A. riograndensis. The variation of abundance, body size, and condition factor over time, sex ratio, and length-weight relations were analyzed. Results. The estimated abundance was 1.97 specimens per 1 m 2. The TL means increased along the year, and males were larger than females. Strong differences in proportions of sexes were detected, with high bias for females. The species showed allometric positive growth (b = 3.3), and the general condition factor (CF) was 0.258 ¬± 0.003. Conclusion. Atlantirivulus riograndensis inhabits small water bodies and apparently has a small population size. The population is female biased, and males are typically bigger than females. The species has an allometric positive growth. The body size variation is related to individual growth throughout each study year, and probably affected by high mortality of large individuals in dry season. This study presents new original data on basic traits of the natural history of A. riograndensis. The observed results may be used to assist the development of management strategies and conservation of the species and its habitat, mainly in a region where 90% of wetland systems were lost by agriculture, and the remaining areas are at high risk due to the expansion of exotic pine plantations.","Article","Scopus",0.778692839507215,1,1,NA,10,5,16,NA

Food availability depends on different factors such as discharge, channel morphology, physicochemical conditions and interactions with other species, as well as their food habits. On the other side, good food availability results in reproductive success. Because the study of those changes contributes to a better understanding of trophic interactions in fish populations, the present work describes and evaluates aspects of diet and reproduction of Farlowella vittata in Pringamosal Creek, G√ºejar River drainage, Orinoco River basin, Colombia. Five collecting expeditions were done during both high and low rain seasons of 2008 and 2009. Physical and chemical water parameters were measured, and fish were captured from several points along the total length of the 7km stream, to characterize their biometry and stomach contents. Our results showed that Pringamosal creek is a first order stream, about 3.5m wide and with an average depth of 1m in our study area. Dissolved oxygen values were 6.2mg/L during low water and 2.7mg/L during high water phase. The creek is classified as oligotrophic but with a tendency to eutrophication. A total of 130 fish samples were analyzed. Fishes were assigned to seven size range categories between 86.0 and 175.5mm standard length (SL). Stomach contents revealed that the diet of this species consisted mainly of algae (Bacillariophyceae) (84.6% Abundance Relative), but we observed a variation in the diet according to season; during low rainfall it feeds on phytoplankton (86.47% A.R.) and during high rainfall on zooplankton as well as plant material and organic material (0.685% A.R. and 18.83% A.R., respectively). A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA showed statistically significant differences in food items between sexes. The condition factor (K) indicated that the species was well fed. Size at sexual maturity was 154mm SL for males and 124mm SL for females. The gonadosomatic index (RGS) showed that this fish reproduced during high water (April-May) season, and females showed a fecundity of 1 819 ovocites, with an average diameter of 1.4mm. Although parental care was not observed during this study, it is well known that males protect their eggs and juveniles, making them easy to capture during the breeding periods identified in this study, and at the same time, vulnerable to overexploitation. We recommend an urgent management plan for the conservation of this species, since at this time, no fishing controls are enforced even though it is harvested as an ornamental species.","Article","Scopus",0.629764670581006,NA,0,NA,NA,15,65,NA

We collected 2,220 fish of 33 species; 901 in stretches of the Lope√≠ stream - circular culvert and 1,310 in stretches of the Pindorama stream - box culvert. Fish abundance was similar in upstream and downstream stretches of the circular culvert, whereas it was slightly higher in the upstream than downstream stretch for the box culvert. Characiformes predominated in the upstream stretch of both culverts. On the other hand, Siluriformes was abundant in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, with similar abundance in the stretches of the box culvert. Species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weiner Index) were higher in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, but they were similar in both stretches of the box culvert. The most abundant species were Astyanax altiparanae, A. paranae, A. fasciatus, Ancistrus sp., and Hypostomus sp. The last two species were more abundant in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, and similar in stretches of the box culvert. Our study indicated variations in the species abundance, richness, and diversity between upstream and downstream stretches in particular of the circular culvert in the Lope√≠ stream, suggesting that fish movements are restrained more intensively in this culvert, especially for Siluriformes. The drop in the circular culvert outlet probably created passage barriers especially for those fish that has no ability to jump, where downstream erosion could lead to culvert perching. Studies on appropriate road crossing design or installation are fundamental whereas improvements in these structures can restore the connectivity of fish populations and communities in streams. ¬© 2012 Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia.","Article","Scopus",0.56137752846883,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37,NA

Therefore, RAPD molecular markers and microsatellites were utilized to evaluate the diversity and genetic structure of the migratory species Leporinus elongatus (piapara) in the Canoas Complex - Paranapanema River - Brazil. Ten groups were sampled in the fish ladders of the hydroelectric dam Canoas I and Canoas II during the reproductive period in three consecutive years. Both markers showed a high level of genetic diversity within these groups. The microsatellite markers demonstrated a loss of heterozygosity and a considerable level of inbreeding in the species. The genetic differentiation found among the groups with both markers utilized is within a range from low to moderate. The data obtained with the parameter of genetic diversity among the groups led to the conclusion that the groups of L. elongatus of the Canoas Complex are structured as a single population composed of sub-populations with low genetic diversity among them.

At La Selva Biological Station in the Sarapiqu√≠ region of Costa Rica, shrimp population data were collected between 1988 and 1989, before massive land-use change occurred downstream that could potentially affect shrimp recruitment upstream. Using generalized linear models and a Bayesian inference framework, the relative abundance of Macrobrachium olfersi between recent (2008-2011) and historical time periods (1988-1989) was compared in three stream reaches. Shrimp relative abundance in two stream reaches within the protected area of La Selva was relatively constant yearly and between recent post-disturbance (2008-2011) and historical pre-disturbance (1988-89) time periods. In contrast, a stream reach bordered by pasture accessible to fishermen, showed an 87% decrease in relative abundance between recent and historical time periods suggesting site-level disturbance, possibly from fishing. The lack of change between historical and contemporary sampling periods within interior-forest stream reaches suggests that shrimp populations in protected forested reaches are resistant or resilient to certain land-use changes occurring downstream. ¬© 2012 Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus",0.64761510881297,0,0,NA,5,10,6,NA

Currently, cage fish farming systems are a new source of impact on aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to characterise the impact of freshwater fish farms on the feeding of five species of Neotropical freshwater fish. Specimens of Astyanax altiparanae, Galeocharax knerii, Iheringicthys labrosus, Pimelodus maculatus and Plagioscion squamosissimus were sampled in areas around two systems of cage fish farming (CF), and two control areas (CT) that were not influenced by this activity. Results show that there were significant changes in the diet of trophic generalist species (A. altiparanae, P. maculatus and I. labrosus) accompanied by a related increase in the condition factor values of these species in cage areas. Trophic specialist species, such as the carnivorous fish species G. knerii and P. squamosissimus, presented small differences between the CF and CT areas with regard to diet and showed no differences in other analyses performed. In conclusion, cage fish farms can affect the natural diet of trophic generalist fish species, directly affecting the nutritional status (condition factor), where food wastes was found to be one of the principal items consumed by this trophic guild. Results indicate that these species are responsible for recycling a great quantity of organic matter transferred by this type of activity, which, along with local fishery activities, contribute to mitigation of associated processes of eutrophication. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.495167246569846,0,NA,NA,5,NA,9,NA

In this study we examined the differences in the attributes of the fish community in four stretches of an urban stream, two inside and two outside the CU, without vegetation cover, and tested the hypothesis that the presence of riparian vegetation is positively reflected in the attributes of fish fauna. Five species were caught, distributed into four orders and five families. Attributes like richness, abundance, dominance, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and evenness were estimated and significant differences were detected for continuous stretches considering stream flow direction. The first stretches (URBI and UCI) presented a lower diversity that increased gradually until the last stretch, and an inverse result was found for dominance. These changes occurred regardless the location of the stretch, in- or outside the CU. The importance of Conservation Units within urban areas is severely affected by the lack of continuity of forested areas, especially riparian vegetation.

However, the empirical validity of this model depends on whether the data do not violate certain assumptions. Here, we test the predictions of MTE evaluating all of its assumptions simultaneously. We used Neotropical freshwater fish and tested whether the logarithm of species richness varied negatively and linearly with temperature, resulting in the slope value specified by the MTE. As we observed that the assumption of the energetic equivalence of populations was not achieved, we also analyzed whether the energetic nonequivalence of populations could be responsible for the possible lack of fit to the MTE predictions. Our results showed that the relationship between richness and the inverse of temperature was linear, negative and significant and included the slope value predicted by the MTE. With respect to the assumptions, we observed that there was no spatial variation in the average energy flux of populations or in the body size and abundance of species. However, the energetic equivalence of populations was not achieved and the violation of this assumption did not affect the predictive power of the model. We conclude that the validity of the assumptions (spatial invariance in the average flux energy of populations and spatial invariance in the body size and abundance, especially) is required for the correct interpretation of richness patterns. Furthermore, we conclude that MTE is robust in its explanation of diversity gradients for freshwater fish, proving to be a valuable tool in describing ecological complexity from individuals to ecosystems. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.397106297575718,0,NA,NA,10,NA,13,NA

Using Breeding Bird Survey data from 2005 to 2009, targeted point-count data from 2008 to 2009 and Division of Fish and Wildlife deer-density data from the same time periods, we compared avian species richness and relative abundance with deer density. We divided deer densities into low (‚â§10 deer/km 2), moderate (11-19 deer/km2), and high (‚â•20 deer/km2) categories. We placed birds into 6 deer-sensitive guilds: interior forest obligates, ground nesters, shrub nesters, ground gleaners, low-canopy foragers, and Neotropical migrants, as well as 1 ""guild"" that consisted of species found to be sensitive to deer density in past literature. The abundance or richness of most guilds and species did not differ by deer density. However, there were 1.08 more shrub nesters and 0.55 more species of shrub nesting birds in low-deer-density areas than in high-deer-density areas. Areas of moderate and low deer densities had ‚â•0.35 more species of low-canopy foragers than did areas of high deer densities. Low-deer-density areas had ‚â•0.59 more individual Neotropical migrants compared with moderate- or high-deer-density areas. Similarly, areas of low deer densities had ‚â•0.49 more migrant species than did areas of higher densities. Low-deerdensity areas had ‚â•0.17 more ovenbirds compared with high- and moderate-deer-density areas. Great crested flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) had 3 times greater odds of being found in low-deer-density areas than in high-deer-density areas. Chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), and red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus) all had 2 times greater odds of being found in low-deer-density areas than high-deer-density areas.

Data were collected quarterly at eight sampling locations on the reservoir between February 2010 and November 2011 using gillnets from 12-to 70-mm mesh that were left in the water for 12h00min during the night. We evaluated the composition, structure and assemblage descriptors (Shannon-Wiener diversity index and equitability, respectively) and catch per unit effort by the number (CPUEn) and biomass (CPUEb) of the ichthyofauna. The 6,047 individuals (399,211.6 g) captured represented three orders, ten families and 20 species, of which four belonged to introduced species. The family Characidae was the most abundant with a total of 2,772 (45.8%) individuals captured. The species-abundance curve fit the log-normal model. In the spatial analysis of diversity, there were significant differences between sampling sites in the lacustrine and fluvial regions, and the highest values were found in the lacustrine region. In the temporal analysis of diversity, significant differences were also observed between the rainy and dry seasons, and the higher values were found during the dry season. Equitability followed the same spatiotemporal pattern as diversity. The Spearman correlation was significantly negative between diversity and rainfall. A cluster analysis spatially separated the ichthyofauna into two groups: one group formed by sampling sites in the fluvial region and another group formed by the remainder of the points in the lacustrine region. Both the CPUEn and CPUEb values were higher at point 8 (fluvial region) and during the rainy season. A two-way ANOVA showed that the CPUEn and CPUEb values were spatially and temporally significant. We conclude that the spatial and temporal trends of diversity in the Santa Cruz reservoir differ from those of other Brazilian reservoirs but that the fish community composition and spatiotemporal patterns of abundance were similar.","Article","Scopus",0.571525289634504,1,NA,NA,5,NA,7,NA

Many tropical floodplain rivers have sustained seasonal flood pulses driven by precipitation patterns of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. These changes in flow alter concentrations of dissolved nutrients, aquatic primary productivity, and per-unit-area densities of aquatic organisms. Therefore, one would predict that the strength of top-down effects of animals on basal resources should shift as the annual flood pulse progresses. We conducted a series of field experiments in a Neotropical lowland river to test for effects of hydrologic phase, habitat (in-channel vs. floodplain aquatic habitat), and benthic-feeding fish and meiofauna on particulate organic matter, chlorophyll, and benthic microalgae. Net ecosystem productivity of this oligotrophic river is higher during the low phase of the annual flood cycle, which is also when resident fishes are at highest densities and there is a seasonal influx of migratory benthic-feeding fish. We therefore hypothesized that top-down effects of benthic-feeding fish would fluctuate temporally, with strongest effects during low water levels. We found that fish controlled the abundance of particulate organic matter and algae on solid substrates, but not on sand, during falling- and low-water phases within both channel and floodplain habitats. Except for diatom assemblages, which responded to fish exclusion, the taxonomic structure of algal and meiofauna assemblages was not significantly influenced by fish-exclusion treatments, but varied in relation to habitat type and hydrologic phase. Meiofauna densities were highest during the low-water period; experimental exclusion of meiofauna during this period had a significant effect on accumulation of particulate organic matter in sand. By controlling abundance of important basal resources, fishes and meiofauna have a large potential to influence other components of this tropical ecosystem. Our findings emphasize the predictable, gradual, changes in consumer-resource interactions associated with the seasonal flood pulse in tropical river systems. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.553140808676828,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41,NA

Fish data were collected using gillnets during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. A total of 69 343 individuals representing 260 species were recorded. Dam closure was associated with changes in the organization of fish communities at all sites. Species richness tended to increase immediately after dam closure while evenness decreased. Changes in taxonomic structure (richness and evenness) were accompanied by a change in the distribution of biomass with the proportionate contribution by smaller individuals significantly increased relative to larger individuals. Five years on, richness had fallen to below pre-closure levels at all sites, while the comparative stability of assemblages in the transformed habitats was reflected by biomass-abundance distribution patterns that approximated pre-disturbance ratios. This simplistic analysis provided a sensitive and informative assessment of ecological conditions, which highlights the impact to ecosystem process and ecological networks and has particular value in regions where a lack of detailed ecological knowledge precludes the application of traditional bioassessment methods.

To contribute with knowledge on the effects of damming on fish fauna, we assessed the response of fish assemblages to the construction of a run-of-the-river dam in an Amazonian river by selecting eight sampling sites along a longitudinal gradient in the vicinity of a new hydroelectric dam. Sites were sampled monthly through a 1-year period before dam closure (2004‚Äì2005), 1¬†year after closure (2006‚Äì2007), and 5¬†years after closure (2011‚Äì2012). Following dam closure, there was an initial overall increase in fish abundance and richness across sites. However, despite the initial upsurge, after 5¬†years, populations were reduced and communities contracted to a level of diversity below that observed prior to dam closure. Respective sites demonstrated distinct ecological responses that were related to the environmental characteristics of their transformed habitats. Important changes in fish assemblages were visible in a short-term period of 5¬†years after dam closure. Therefore, monitoring fish species assemblages in a longer term is important to assess the consequences of a decrease in diversity. ¬© 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Article","Scopus",0.677633147421399,NA,1,"damn effect",NA,10,31,NA

Nevertheless, as indicated by the temporal variations in the Coefficients of Variation (CV%), the fish assemblages were highly unstable at all sites over time. At all sites the CV% varied widely and increased significantly over the years.

We determined reference and impacted sites based on physical and chemical variables of the water. For the analysis and comparison of biological responses, we calculated 22 metrics and submitted them to a discriminant analysis. We selected from this analysis only six metrics, which showed that the two studied assemblages respond differently to environmental change. A larger number of metrics were selected for macroinvertebrates than for fish in the separate analysis. The metrics selected for macroinvertebrates in the pooled analysis (i.e., fish and macroinvertebrates together) were different from those selected in the separate analysis for macroinvertebrates alone. However, the metrics selected for fish in the pooled analysis were the same selected in the separate analysis for fish alone.

Anuran larvae are important prey in freshwater communities and spatiotemporal variation in risk can arise from changes in the number and identity of predators; however, our understanding of variation in abundance, identity, and foraging rates for natural predator assemblages in tropical pond communities is limited. We surveyed ponds near Gamboa, Panama in 2004 and 2010 to estimate variation in predator communities of tadpoles over space and time.We also conducted short-term predation trials with the 10 most common predators using hatchling tadpoles of two widespread Neotropical frog species, Red-Eyed Treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and Pantless Treefrogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Predator abundance varied nearly threefold across ponds within a single year and as much as 19-fold within a pond across years. Dominant taxa also varied, with backswimmers (Notonectidae), poeciliid fish, or libellulid dragonfly naiads being the most common depending upon pond and year. Predation trials revealed that prey-specific predation rates differed among predator taxa. Some presumed predators did not consume hatchlings, whereas others consumed >90% of prey. The smaller D. ebraccatus hatchlings generally experienced higher predation rates; however, large invertebrate predators like aeshnid dragonfly naiads, giant water bugs, and fishing spiders consumed more A. callidryas. These results suggest that strong but variable larval-stage risk may be an important selective factor shaping tadpole communities and phenotypes in Neotropical ponds. ¬© 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.","Article","Scopus",0.540339601953569,1,NA,NA,10,NA,15,NA

The study focused on three aquatic systems (river upstream, transition area, and reservoir) and different drowned habitats (dense/light forests and agricultural soils) associated or not with the presence of villages. The reservoir fish population was expected to follow three distinct phases, which should be respectively a rapid increase in biomass and abundance (trophic upsurge) followed by a decline and a stabilization of the population. This succession appeared to be different to the commonly observed scenario in terms of biomass, abundance and taxonomic richness compared to other temperate and tropical reservoirs. The indicator species (H. macrolepidota and P. carinatus) did not show changes in their size range since impoundment. The presence of structured habitats (e.g. inundated forest) favoured the fish population in terms of biomass and abundance. The fish population in the transition area and the river upstream improved quickly after the impoundment and presented higher taxonomic richness compared to the reservoir. Finally, the transition area appeared to be the most productive area within the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir especially if it remained outside of fishing activities. ¬© EDF, 2015.","Article","Scopus",0.739258205346137,NA,1,NA,NA,5,29,NA

However, studies of these patterns in human-modified systems from a macroecological perspective are lacking. Considering that fish assemblages in reservoirs reflect both long-term evolutionary responses of species and shorter term responses to anthropogenic stressors, we employed a multi-hypothesis approach using different magnitudes of predictors to analyse the processes that drive fish diversity in reservoirs at a broad spatial scale. Location: Brazil. Methods: We derived species richness from an extensive database of fish inhabiting Neotropical reservoirs, and using multiple regression analysis, we tested seven hypotheses that link species richness to continuous variables associated with regional, local and population components. We analysed the spatial structure using Moran's I autocorrelation coefficients and used spatial eigenvector mapping to explicitly account for the spatial component when testing the hypotheses by multiple regressions. Partial regressions were performed to map the relative contributions of the different components in explaining species richness. Results: Predictors related to six hypotheses were retained in the best-fit models, and our data supported the species‚Äìenergy, metabolic, species‚Äìarea, species‚Äìdistance from the source and time of habitat alteration hypotheses. However, the predictions of the population abundance hypothesis (PAH) were not supported by the data. The shared effects of the different components explained the greatest proportion of the variation in species richness, indicating that distinct mechanisms related to these alternative hypotheses interact or are not spatially independent. Main conclusions: Our findings indicate that the latitudinal diversity gradient typically displayed by freshwater fish is maintained in human-modified habitats, such as reservoirs, and that multiple mechanisms drive fish diversity in reservoirs over large spatial scales. The lack of support for the PAH implies that mechanisms structuring diversity patterns can be influenced by anthropogenic stressors. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Scopus",0.319941630938517,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32,NA

Comparative analyses, before and after the introduction, could not demonstrate significant changes in composition, richness, abundance, biomass, mean length and diversity of fish. Aquatic insects were the main feeding item of C. kelberi, followed by tetragonopterinae fish. Cannibalism was recorded during the whole study period. The results showed that Cichla cannot deeply affect the ichthyofauna assemblages of a large Neotropical reservoir, at least in a short or medium term period after its introduction. The results also allowed concluding that the introduction of C. kelberi in the reservoir is in the phase 3. In this phase, the specie can survive and reproduce in the new environment; however it is not totally established and disseminated. The reasons for the fact that Cichla is still not dominant in Rosana Reservoir could be related to feeding competition, high rate of cannibalism and the presence of large amount of aquatic macrophytes (refuge zones). In spite of the results, the continuous monitoring of the role of non-native species on the local fish fauna is absolutely necessary because the impacts caused by colonization of this undesirable species can be magnified by complex processes, usually correlated with other environmental disturb, especially the negative effects of damming.","Article","Scopus",0.596728913425858,NA,1,"other sp introduced",NA,15,44,NA

The selected reservoirs embody the productivity spectrum of reservoirs on the island. Median concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) for epilimnion waters (1 m) were as follows: Cerrillos, 10 Œºg/L; Cidra, 33Œºg/L; Guajataca, 10Œºg/L; La Plata, 49Œºg/L; Patillas, 6 Œºg/L; and Toa Vaca, 22Œºg/L. Likewise, median concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) were: Cerrillos, 0.22 mg/L; Cidra, 0.74 mg/L; Guajataca, 0.28 mg/L; La Plata, 0.55 mg/L; Patillas, 0.23 mg/L; and Toa Vaca, 0.34 mg/L. Strong positive correlations were observed between nutrients and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). Correlation coefficients were 0.74 for the relationship between TP and Chl-a, and 0.66 for TN vs. Chl-a. Increases in algal biomass (as measured by Chl-a) diminished the depth of light penetration into the water column (i.e., Secchi depth) (r = -0.70). A biological threshold indicative of designated use impairment was established at a Chl-a concentration of 24 pg/L based on evidence demonstrating that the extent of reduced light penetration at that Chl-a level (due to excessive phytoplankton biomass productivity) hindered the reservoirs' capacity to comply with the aquatic life criteria. Total phosphorus and TN concentrations associated with the Chl-a impairment threshold (i.e., 24 Œºg/L) were established based on a change-point analysis of the data. The resulting values, 0.035 mg/L for TP and 0.43 mg/L for TN, can be considered nutrient thresholds associated with impairment. To protect against impairment, a margin of safety was added based on concentrations defining the lower 5% confidence interval of the bootstrap distribution of values associated with the Chl-a impairment threshold (i.e., p<0.05-one tail probability). The resulting criteria, 0.026 mg/L for TP and 0.41 mg/L for TN, are proposed as basis for establishing the nutrient standards for reservoirs of Puerto Rico. Significant differences in the maximum depth of compliance with the USEPA aquatic life criteria (i.e., DO = 5.0 mg/L) were observed between data points below and above the proposed numeric criteria. These differences, which can be critical to the sustainability of fish populations in reservoirs on the island, attest to the importance of maintaining the nutritional status of waters in our reservoirs at levels below the specified thresholds. The zooplankton community was characterized by a mix of species already known under similar environmental conditions in the Neotropical region. Sixty-five zooplanktonic taxa were identified. Rotifera was the richest group with 37 taxa. Cladocerans were represented by 20 taxa; Copepoda by eight taxa. Absolute abundances of rotifers showed an increase with the increase of several eutrophication indexes. A segmented curved analysis was used to describe the relationship between Brachionus rotifers (#ind/L) and phosphorus (InTP). The relationship yielded a change-point value of 26.58 Œºg/L for total phosphorus, which coincides with the proposed numeric criteria value. In addition, a change-point of 1.16 meters was obtained for the relationship between Brachionus rotifers (#ind/L) and Secchi depth (m), which can be considered as another impairment index for reservoirs on the island.","Article","Scopus",0.365793121651025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,66,NA

The second section looks at the plant community in terms of composition, dynamics, and life-history processes. Next, the animal community is covered: butterfly and amphibian diversity; reptiles and birds; and the mammal fauna. A paper on population biology (life histories, abundance, demography, and predator-prey interactions) concludes this section. Section four outlines plant-herbivore interactions and frugivory. the final section reviews La Selva's human environment: land-use patterns, agricultural systems and forestry. Appendices include checklists of: vascular plants, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Sixteen chapters are individually abstracted in Ecological Abstracts. Other chapters are also covered in International Development Abstracts and Geographical Abstracts: Physical Geography. -S.R.Harris","Article","Scopus",0.395810584352373,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,63,NA

It is known that the Kelp Gull (Larus Dominicanus) is used to forage discards, and that in the area sampled these discards are abundant in trawling mode, with a large volume of demersal fish. The food habit of L. Dominicanus was analyzed in the State of Paran√°, Brazil. The food items of the pellets were identified in order to demonstrate the importance of demersal fish in the diet of this species. The pellets were sampled between August 2011 and July 2012 on the seaside of Barrancos. Based on the identification of the otoliths found in the pellets, length and mass of fishes were recalculated. In the 120 pellets collected, 228 fishes from 14 species and 3 families were identified, with emphasis on the Sciaenidae family with 11 species. Cathorops spixii, Larimus breviceps, Paralonchurus brasiliensis, and Stellifer rastrifer were most frequent. In the seasonal analyses, L. breviceps, Micropogonias furnieri, P. brasiliensis, and S. rastrifer were found in the diet of L. Dominicanus in all seasons. The canonical analysis showed significant seasonal differences in abundance, mass, and length of the teleosts identified in the diet of L. Dominicanus. This study demonstrated the frequent occurrence of demersal fish in the diet of L. Dominicanus, suggesting that discards are an important source of food for the local populations of this species. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.","Article","Scopus",0.610428882763439,NA,0,NA,NA,15,59,NA

The potential of native Neotropical piscivores to provide biotic resistance to alien fish invaders and its interaction with water turbidity was investigated through mesocosm experiments. Three invasive and two native fish species were offered as prey to three native piscivores of the Paran√° river in 1000 L tanks. After 48¬†h, prey survival was compared among trials with and without the piscivores and in turbid (~ more preserved systems) versus clear water (~ disturbed systems by damming) treatments. Prey survival, particularly of the invasive species, was significantly lower in turbid water in the presence of predators (~ 45.9% versus ~ 53.7% in clear water). Piscivores preyed more on smaller individuals in clear water and on larger preys in turbid water. Although vulnerability to predation was prey-specific, our results support the potential of native piscivores to provide biotic resistance against alien freshwater species. Water turbidity mediated the predator‚Äìprey interactions and our results confirm the hypothesis that decreased turbidity caused by dams‚Äô construction can affect predation efficiency of native piscivores and increase the abundance of alien fish. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus",0.496983021292914,0,NA,NA,10,NA,17,NA

Here, we examine size structures of the caddisfly, Phylloicus hansoni, in Trinidadian streams with two distinct fish assemblages: upstream reaches where the predatory killifish, Anablepsoides hartii, is the only fish species (Killifish-Only reaches), and downstream reaches where killifish and the omnivorous guppy, Poecilia reticulata, coexist (Killifish‚ÄìGuppy reaches). We asked: Do P. hansoni larvae exhibit differences in size structure between reaches with differing fish assemblages? We found that size distributions of larvae differed between reaches in the majority of replicate streams, with smaller median body lengths in Killifish-Only reaches. Killifish‚ÄìGuppy reaches had higher proportions of the largest instar, but we did not find differences in body length within an instar. No evidence of size-selective predation was found through analysis of killifish stomach contents, and environmental variables were largely similar between upstream and downstream reaches of the five study streams, aside from higher killifish abundances in upstream reaches. Our results, coupled with previous evidence of guppies altering killifish populations, suggest that the mediating effects of a third-party species (guppies) on predator‚Äìprey (killifish‚Äìcaddisfly) interactions can affect the population size structure of prey populations. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus",0.559889720502622,0,NA,NA,10,NA,12,NA

However, little is known about the conditions that explain its historical and current spatial distribution, both in its native habitat and where it is a successful invasive species. The aim of the present study was to explore the ecological information available for this species, to then critically examine ecological theories related to the conditions underpinning its success. To this end, an exhaustive literature search was conducted with the immediate aim of investigating whether the success of South American silver croaker was driven by species-climate or species‚Äìhuman interactions. The non-native populations were found to occupy climate niche spaces different from those observed in their native ranges. In addition, it was clear that humans played a role in facilitating the large-scale dispersion of silver croaker, and assisted as agents of impact driving the observed current and, probably, the future spatial distribution, which we can predict from our data and from the pattern of propagule pressure. Overall, the current biogeography of this species illustrates how the construction of dams, along with the introduction and stocking of non-native species, overfishing and other human activities can alter fish populations and assemblages. Such processes can reduce native species, increase the abundance and distribution of invasive species, as well as cause changes in life-history traits and genetic variability, all with long-term socioeconomic consequences. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Review","Scopus",0.48233031183347,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51,NA

We investigate how the waterbird community in a Neotropical river-floodplain system responds to environmental gradients, identifying how they affect waterbird species richness, functional diversity (measured as functional dispersion) and functional composition (specific functional traits). We sampled 22 lakes in the Upper Paran√° floodplain system in southern Brazil, and modelled avian functional diversity and species richness as a function of environmental variables. Then we used a unified RLQ and fourthcorner analysis to evaluate environment-trait relationships. Waterbird species richness and functional diversity varied according to different environmental variables. Lake area and diversity of aquatic vegetation were associated with avian species richness, while relative abundance of grass and emergent macrophytes and mean and variation of depth were related to functional diversity. Furthermore, changes in functional diversity seemed to be mainly driven by presence of species that depend on perches for foraging (e.g. kingfishers, cormorants, and kites), whose presence was mainly associated with deep water and emergent macrophytes. Nevertheless, changes in functional diversity and functional composition did not depend on exactly the same set of environmental variables, suggesting that trait combinations (e.g. below surface feeders who feed on fish), not only specific traits, are important drivers of the variation in functional diversity between lakes. Given the observed differences in responses of species richness and functional diversity, both these diversity metrics should be used as complementary tools in ecosystem management. Furthermore, our results show that functional diversity and composition are partially coupled, suggesting that although functional diversity is influenced by the environmental filtering of particular traits, it also reflects other ecological mechanisms (e.g. competitive interactions among species). ¬© 2018 Arruda Almeida et al.
