Adding diet as well as body mass significantly increased the proportion of variance explained. Magnitude of the effect of body mass on population density varied with dietary class. In general, larger-bodied species occur at lower densities than smaller-bodied species, and species with restricted diets and those at higher trophic levels occur at lower densities than species whose diet allows them access to a greater abundance of food resources.

Early in this period, small mammals irrupted and then declined markedly to a density 7% of that at peak. All four falconiforms (Buteo polyosoma, Falco sparverius, Geranoaetus melanoleucus, Parabuteo unicinctus) and one owl (Tyto alba) responded numerically to the decline in mammalian prey by virtually abandoning the study site. The three other owls (Athene cunicularia, Bubo virginianus, Glaucidium nanum) and the two foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus and P. griseus) remained. With few exceptions, throughout the study predators maintained species-specific preferences among small mammal species regardless of the absolute and proportional abundance of these prev. At no time did the two prey species most responsible for the irruption (the rodents Phyllotis darwini and Akodon olivaceus) occur in predators' diets out of proportion to their estimated relative abundance in the field. Predators were clearly unable to prevent the irruption from occurring. Given the absence of a clear functional response to the most irruptive species, predators seemed unlikely to have been responsible for the observed crash. At present, however, predators may be prolonging the crash and delaying the return of small-mammal populations to typical densities. ¬© 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.770228328845948,NA,"1",NA,NA,5,62,NA

Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.779302535819012,NA,"1","Discusses changes in prey populations",NA,5,61,NA

These five species were selected from a large tree flora on several criteria. All possess large (3-10 cm) well-protected seeds that might plausibly be attractive to mammalian seed predators. The reproductive biology of three of the species, or close congeners, had been studied elsewhere in the Neotropics (Astrocaryum, Dipteryx, Hymenaea); one is important to the economy of southeastern Peru (Bertholletia); and one, despite large and apparently edible seeds, appeared to suffer no pre-germination loss to predators (Calatola). We conducted the research in mature forests in the Manu National Park of southeastern Peru where mammal densities are unperturbed by human activities. Densities of adult trees of the five species in our area range from very high (>30 per ha: Astrocaryum) to very low (‚â™1 per ha: Hymenaea). Loss of seeds to all causes, and to mammalian seed predators in particular, was determined for seeds placed in 2-square meter mammal exclosures and in open controls located at 10 m (near) and 50 m (far) from a large mature individual of the target species (with minor variations in the design for Astrocaryum and Calatola). The exclosures were of two types: impermeable-designed to exclude all mammals, but not invertebrate seed predators, and semipermeable-designed to admit small (<500 g), but not large mammals. Experimental and control plots were stocked with apparently viable seeds during the dry-wet transition period (October-November) and scored one year later. A significant distance effect (higher predation near vs far from a large conspecific adult) was found in only one of the species (Astrocaryum), the only one to be attacked with high frequency by invertebrate seed predators. The absence of any detectable distance effect attributable to mammals suggests that mammals, over the course of a year, thoroughly search the forest floor for seeds. Invertebrates may thus be responsible for most pre-germination distance (density) effects. With respect to the treatments, we found three qualitatively distinct results: seeds of three species (Astrocaryum, Bertholletia, Dipteryx) were significantly protected by the impermeable, but not semipermeable exclosures, implicating small mammals in seed loss; the seeds of one species (Hymenaea) were significantly protected by exclosures of both types, implicating large mammals; and the seeds of one species (Calatola) exhibited 100% survival, whether or not protected by exclosures. The importance of large mammals as seed predators is generally underestimated in these experiments because semipermeable exclosures may serve as foraging reserves for small mammals. Finally, we noted no relationship between the intensity of mammalian seed predation (as suggested by the survival of unprotected seeds) and the abundance of adults of the five species in the environment. The diversity of results obtained for the five species reveals that large-seeded tropical trees may display a wide range of demographic patterns, and points to the likely importance of post-germination bottlenecks in the population biology of many species, even those that may experience severe pre-germination seed loss. ¬© 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.538631578249416,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,60,NA

To better understand the effect of habitat fragmentation on gene flow and genetic variation, and to uncover genetic units for conservation, we examined DNA sequences from the mitochondrial control region of 54 individuals from six localities distributed throughout the present geographical range of the Pampas deer. Our results suggest that the control region of the Pampas deer is one of the most polymorphic of any mammal. This remarkably high variability probably reflects large historic population sizes of millions of individuals in contrast to numbers of fewer than 80 000 today. Gene flow between populations is generally close to one migrant per generation and, with the exception of two populations from Argentina, all populations are significantly differentiated. The degree of gene flow was correlated with geographical distance between populations, a result consistent with limited dispersal being the primary determinant of genetic differentiation between populations. The molecular genetic results provide a mandate for habitat restoration and reintroduction of Pampas deer so that levels of genetic variation can be preserved and historic patterns of abundance can be reconstructed. However, the source of individuals for reintroduction generally should be from populations geographically closest to those now in danger of extinction.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.517075682387341,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,58,NA

In particular, few examinations of historical influences on patterns of species richness and relative abundances in tropical communities have been conducted. In part, that gap in our knowledge has been caused by a paucity of data on tropical communities, even for relatively well-studied taxa such as birds. In the Neotropics, only two sites, a 97-ha plot in lowland Peru and a 100-ha plot in French Guiana, have been inventoried on a spatial scale sufficient to estimate population densities for a majority of resident bird species. Results from those studies revealed extremely similar species richness, community biomass, and patterns of relative abundance. A third site in lowland Panama was originally censused in 1968-1969 and has often been compared with many other tropical and temperate sites. Results from Panama suggested an exceptionally different community structure from that observed at the Amazonian sites. Informative comparisons among sites have been hampered, however, by differences in sampling protocols. The Panama site was sampled on a much smaller spatial scale (2 ha) than the two Amazonian sites. To improve comparisons, we censused a 104-ha area (the Limbo plot) encompassing the original 2-ha Panama study area and used several census methods, including those used at the Amazonian sites. As expected, spatial scale had a strong effect on estimates of species richness. We detected 252 species on the Limbo plot, compared with 161 detected on the original 2-ha area. Estimates of total individual birds per 100 ha were similar, but estimates from the original study were based on densities measured for one-third fewer species than we measured on our larger study area. Of the 53 species for which both Panama studies estimated population densities, a significant number of estimates were higher in the original study. Thus, the small spatial scale of the original study apparently led to inflated density estimates. The primary cause of disparities appeared to result from undersampling in the smaller plot of many species with patchy distributions and large territory sizes. Compared with Amazonian communities, the Panama community had far fewer rare species. Although 33% of species in Amazonian sites had densities of ‚â§1 pair/100 ha, only 17% were equally rare in Panama. Furthermore, eight species in Panama were, by tropical standards, 'superabundant,' attaining densities as high as 212 breeding individuals/100 ha; the most abundant species in Amazonia barely reached one-third of that number. In total, those eight species accounted for 36% of all individuals at Limbo. The median abundance at Limbo was 7 pairs/100 ha, vs. 2.5 pairs/100 ha in Amazonia. Consequently, the total number of birds on the Limbo study area was nearly twice that found in Amazonia, despite species richness being only three-fourths as great. We conclude, first, that spatial scale has indeed had an important effect on the characterization of the Panama bird community. The intrinsically patchy distributions of most forest-dwelling bird species raise the need for large-scale censuses. Second, the Panama community, compared with the two Amazonian sites, has a fundamentally different organization; it hosts nearly twice as many individual birds and is distinctly less dominated by rarity. Similar patterns of community structure appear to be present within tree and mammal communities as well. Therefore, results from the Amazonian studies cannot be generalized to all lowland Neotropical communities. We attribute differences in community structure primarily to differing biogeographic histories. The lower species richness and the greater number of total birds present in Panama appear to derive, at least in part, from two important factors: an area effect linked to the location of Panama on a narrow isthmus, and the repeated history of disturbance on multiple temporal scales in Panama.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.658913540994902,NA,"0",NA,NA,15,53,NA

In this paper the concept of keystone plant resources is reviewed using potential candidates proposed in the literature for neotropical forest sites. A poorly known example of a potential keystone resource - the gums produced by mature pods of two emergent tree species (Parkia nitida and P. pendula, Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) - is described for primates and other arboreal vertebrates in Amazonian forests. In particular, the fruiting phenology, tree density, patterns of vertebrate consumption, and nutritional quality of Parkia gums in Amazonian terra firme forests are considered. Putative neotropical keystone resources are then divided into four intersecting ecological attributes defining their community-wide importance to vertebrate frugivores: (1) temporal redundancy, (2) degree of consumer specificity, (3) reliability, and (4) abundance. From a vertebrate perspective, keystone plants are here defined as those producing reliable, low-redundancy resources that are consumed by a large proportion of the bird and mammal assemblage with which they coexist. Plant populations proposed to date as keystone species range widely across two of these four variables, which may disqualify most putative taxa (including Parkia spp.) from a more formal definition of keystone resources. Other importance attributes, the context-dependent role, the taxonomic refinement, and removal effects of the keystone plant resource concept as applied to tropical forests are also discussed.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.318223547480055,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,52,NA

We investigated the distribution of non-flying mammals in five habitats of southern Costa Rica: relatively extensive forest (227 ha), coffee plantation, pasture, coffee with adjacent forest remnant (<35 ha), and pasture with adjacent forest remnant (<35 ha). Of the 26 native species recorded in our study plots, 9 (35%) were restricted to forest habitat, 14 (54%) occurred in both forest and agricultural habitats, and 3 (11%) were found only in agricultural habitats. Species richness and composition varied significantly with habitat type but not with distance from the extensive forest. Interestingly, small forest remnants (<35 ha) contiguous with coffee plantations did not differ from more extensive forest in species richness and were richer than other agricultural habitat types. Small remnants contiguous with pasture were species-poor. When clearing started, the study region likely supported about 60 species. Since then, at least 6 species (10%), one family (4%), and one order (11%) have gone extinct locally. The species that disappeared were the largest in their families and included carnivorous (e.g., jaguar [Panthera onca]), herbivorous (e.g., Baird's tapir, [Tapirus bairdii]), and arboreal (e.g., mantled howler monkey [Alouatta palliata]) species. Although there is no substitute for native forest habitat, the majority of native, nonflying mammal species use countryside habitats. The populations of many persist even > 5 km from relatively extensive forest, at least over the 40 years since forest clearance. Moreover, if hunting ceased, we expect that at least one of the locally extinct species could be reestablished in the existing landscape.

Two new breeding sites are reported for the Peruvian diving-petrel and nesting of the wedge-rumped storm-petrel is confirmed on the Chilean coast for the first time. Despite protective status, most of the islands showed human disturbance, derived mainly from guano harvesting, egging and tourism. On at least five of these islands we were able to confirm introduced mammals including rats, rabbits and cats.

Further comprehensive ornithological surveys in other areas are needed so as to improve the scarce knowledge that we currently have on the seabird populations along the Chilean coast.","Conference Paper","Open Access","Scopus",0.828436315185398,NA,"1",NA,NA,5,51,NA

The study used previously published data on 297 flea species parasitic on 197 species of small mammals from 34 different regions of the Holarctic and one region from the Neotropics. We used both simple linear and multiple regressions to evaluate the relationships between the four predictor variables and the year of flea description, on species values as well as on phylogenetically independent contrasts. Whether or not the analyses controlled for flea phylogeny, all predictor variables correlated significantly with year of flea description when tested separately. In multiple regressions, however, the number of exploited host species was the best predictor of the date of flea description, with the geographic range of the principal host species as well as the date of its description having a lesser, though significant, influence. Overall, our results indicate that a flea species is more likely to be discovered and described early if its biological characteristics (exploitation of many host species) and those of its hosts (long-known to science, broad geographic distributions) increase its chances of being included in a collection. Because the variables we investigated only explained about 10-11% of the variation in year of description among flea species, other factors must be important, such as temporal variability in the activity of flea taxonomists. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2005.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.369418564843543,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,NA

Previous studies reported higher food resource availability and fruit removal in treefall gaps than in the understorey. Therefore, gaps have been considered ""keystone habitat"" for Neotropical frugivore birds. Here we test if this prediction would also hold for terrestrial small mammals. In the Amazon, we quantified food resource availability in eleven treefall gaps and paired understorey habitats and used feeding experiments to test if two common terrestrial rodents (Oryzomys megacephalus and Proechimys spp.) would perceive differences between habitats. We live-trapped small mammals in eleven gaps and understorey sites for two years, and compared abundance, fitness components (survival and per capita recruitment) and dispersal of these two rodent species across gaps and understorey and seasons (rainy and dry). Our data indicated no differences in resource availability and consumption rate between habitats. Treefall gaps may represent a sink habitat for Oryzomys where individuals had lower fitness, apparently because of habitat-specific ant predation on early life stages, than in the understorey, the source habitat. Conversely, gaps may be source habitat for Proechimys where individuals had higher fitness, than in the understorey, the sink habitat. Our results suggest the presence of source-sink dynamics in a tropical gap-understorey landscape, where two rodent species perceive habitats differently. This may be a mechanism for their coexistence in a heterogeneous and species-diverse system.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.571723998052171,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,48,NA

The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative.

Populations of small mammals were sampled with live-trapping techniques in a series of nine sites of different successional age, ranging from 1 to 26 years after fire. Ten species of small mammals were captured through all the seral stages of succession. Species richness ranged from two to seven species by seral stage. The species were arranged in different groups with respect to abundance along the succession: the first was composed of early successional species that peaked <2 years after fire (Calomys callosus, C. tener, Thalpomys cerradensis, Mus musculus, Thylamys velutinus); the second occurred or peaked 2-3 years after fire (Necromys lasiurus, Gracilinanus sp., Oryzomys scotti).

Species richness of small mammals showed an abrupt decrease from an average of four species immediately after fire to two species 5-26 years after the last fire. We propose a simple graphical model to explain the pattern of species richness of small mammals after fire in the cerrado. This model assumes that the occurrence of species of small mammals is determined by habitat selection behavior by each species along a habitat gradient. The habitat gradient is defined as the ratio of cover of herbaceous to woody vegetation. The replacement of species results from a trade-off in habitat requirements for the two habitat variables. ¬© 2006 by Walter de Gruyter.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.599917061534581,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,45,NA

Many terrestrial rain forest mammals consume post-dispersal seeds and seedlings, often inflicting density-dependent mortality. In part because of density-dependent mortality, diversity often increases during seedling recruitment, making it a critical stage for species coexistence. We determined how mammalian predators, adult tree abundance, and seed mass interact to affect seedling recruitment in a western Amazonian rain forest. We used exclosures that were selectively permeable to three size classes of mammals: mice and spiny rats (weighing <1 kg), medium-sized rodents (1-12 kg), and large mammals (20-200 kg). Into each exclosure, we placed seeds of 13 tree species and one canopy liana, which varied by an order of magnitude in adult abundance and seed mass. We followed the fates of the seeds and resulting seedlings for at least 17 months. We assessed the effect of each mammalian size class on seed survival, seedling survival and growth, and the density and diversity of the seedlings that survived to the end of the experiment. Surprisingly, large mammals had no detectable effect at any stage of seedling recruitment. In contrast, small- and medium-sized mammals significantly reduced seed survival, seedling survival, and seedling density. Furthermore, predation by small mammals increased species richness on a per-stem basis. This increase in diversity resulted from their disproportionately intense predation on common species and large-seeded species. Small mammals thereby generated a rare-species advantage in seedling recruitment, the critical ingredient for frequency dependence. Predation by small (and to a lesser extent, medium-sized) mammals on seeds and seedlings significantly increases tree species diversity in tropical forests. This is the first long-term study to dissect the effects of various mammalian predators on the recruitment of a diverse set of tree species. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.520610490363982,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40,NA

Migratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea-regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range. Conclusions/Significance. We demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms. ¬© 2007 Martin et al.","Article","Open Access","Scopus",0.63136025720155,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,43,NA

Therefore, we investigated the numerical response of a small-mammal seed predator, Heteromys desmarestianus, to disturbance-induced changes in food availability and evaluated the degree to which removal and fate of seeds of eight tree species in a lowland tropical forest in Belize were related to the functional response of H. desmarestianus to varying seed densities. Mark-recapture trapping was used to estimate abundance of H. desmarestianus in six 0.5-ha grids from July 2000 to September 2002. Fruit availability and seed fate were estimated in each grid, and two experiments nested within the grids were used to determine (1) the form of the functional response for nine levels of fruit density (2-32 fruits/m 2), (2) the removal rate and handling times, and (3) the total proportion of fruits removed. The total proportion of fruits removed was determined primarily by the numerical response of H. desmarestianus to fruit availability, while removal rates and the proportion of seeds eaten or cached were related primarily to the form of the functional response. However, the numerical and functional responses interacted; H. desmarestianus showed strong spatial and temporal numerical responses to total fruit availability, and their density relative to fruit availability resulted in variation in the form of the functional response. Types I, II, and III functional responses were observed, as were density-independent responses, and these responses varied both among and within fruit species. The highest proportions of fruits were eaten when the Type III functional response was detected, which was when fruit availability was high relative to H. desmarestianus population density. Numerous idiosyncratic influences on seed fate have been documented, but our results indicate that shifts in the numerical and functional responses of seed predators to seasonal and interannual variation in seed availability potentially provide a general mechanistic explanation for patterns of removal and fate for vertebrate-dispersed seeds. ¬© 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.411682667964939,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35,NA

The peninsula has been occupied for millennia and is a heavily impacted landscape, and, unfortunately, its biotic diversity is among the most poorly studied in Central America. As part of multiyear studies of the flora and fauna of the region, we assess the changes in vegetation and the terrestrial mammal community from earlier times to the present day. Through historical records, interviews with long-term residents of the area, and our studies over the past decade, we document changes in forest cover, settlement, and land use, and assess the changes in species diversity and in mammal species' abundance. We then discuss the ecology of the mammal species on the peninsula, emphasizing the role that humans have played in influencing population levels. After 45 years of protection, the forest structure of the 3100 ha reserve differs markedly from that observed in the early 20th Century and it is quite heterogeneous. Species diversity of both the native vegetation and the mammals is substantial in the regenerating forest. The known mammal fauna included at least 37 species of non-flying mammals and 39 species of bats. Six species (Geoffroy's Spider Monkey, Giant Anteater, White-lipped Peccary, Central American Red Brocket Deer, Baird's Tapir, and Jaguar) have been extirpated from the reserve. Poaching of game species continues and will be difficult to eliminate completely. Nevertheless, with regenerating habitats, coupled with protection of wildlife, reestablishment of the reserve's native species has been dramatic both in terms of species diversity and abundance. The reserve is not in a defaunated condition. Many mammalian frugivores, seed dispersers, and/or seed predators are common and most top mammalian predators are present. We present several testable hypotheses regarding the significance of this mammalian community in the context of other Neotropical forest mammal and plant communities. Rapid expansion of tourism in this region has the potential to affect the reserve adversely. In recent years, the reserve has served as an important site for teaching tropical biology courses. Small reserves, such as Cabo Blanco, even if not connected to larger protected areas through corridors, provide critical habitat for native flora and fauna, a source of genetic stock, and valuable regional teaching and research sites. ¬© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Such disturbances affect recruitment of seedlings and ultimately the abundance and diversity of plants. Palm trees are one of the most abundant food resources in tropical forests and are therefore considered necessary for the survival of many mammal species. The present paper analysed the results of 74 studies in the Neotropical region (published until 2008) dealing with palm tree seed dispersal and predation by mammals. The most important seed dispersers were ungulates, primates and rodents. Most studies discussing the reduced participation of mammals in palm tree seed dispersal and recruitment found that the amount and distance of removed/carried seeds were smaller inside fragmented or impoverished forests, resulting in accumulation of seeds around the mother trees. In most cases this accumulation was followed by increased predation by bruchid beetles, pathogenic microorganisms, and small mammals. Given the complexity of the ecological interactions and processes leading to the establishment of new plants in the areas, the palm tree populations were affected in different ways by defaunation, with some species becoming scarcer in the forest fragments while others increased in abundance. There are clear morphological and ecological traits which enable sets of palm tree species to be prioritized with respect to their vulnerability to extinction. Effective recognition of vulnerable species, along with reliable predictions of the resulting scenarios of forest impoverishment and fragmentation can aid the implementation of more effective management strategies.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.422971720209689,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33,NA

In temperate zones mammals exhibit pronounced seasonal reproduction because of thermoregulation costs imposed by low winter temperatures and limited food availability. Even occupying burrows that buffer external ambient conditions, these restrictions also affect subterranean rodents inhabiting these latitudes. Tuco-tucos (genus Ctenomys) are subterranean herbivorous rodents that have a Neotropical distribution between 17 and 54¬∞ of latitude S. Ctenomys rionegrensis is one of the three species occurring in Uruguay and generated interest due to chromatic polymorphism in a restricted area (50√ó60 km). Here we describe the timing of breeding in C. rionegrensis based on the reproductive status of free-living females and the proportion of juveniles in the population, and describe the characteristics of the estrous cycle of the species using cytological techniques. As expected, the data showed a clear seasonality in female breeding and provided evidence of the occurrence of post-partum estrous. The reproductive activity began in late austral autumn and the highest proportion of pregnant females was observed in winter. At the beginning of the austral spring, the prevalence of lactating females increased as a consequence of the first births and remained high until early summer. This pattern of breeding seasonality was clearly correlated with the annual temperature variation. The estrous cycle showed four phases characterized by both different cellular types and the abundance and appearance of mucus, which allows a clear determination of female's reproductive status. ¬© 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr S√§ugetierkunde.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.595901952144399,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31,NA

We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9 m3 ha-1, equivalent to only 1.1 trees ha-1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we assess the species occupancy and abundance of midsized to large-bodied mammals within three neighbouring Amazonian forest landscapes varying widely in extent of forest cover. One of these consisted of forest fragments surrounded by semi-natural scrub savannahs that had been occupied by paleoindian populations for at least 7,000 years, whereas forest cover in the other two landscapes was either variegated or continuous. Data on species occurrence and abundance from diurnal and nocturnal line-transect surveys and local interviews in each landscape were used to examine the effects of forest cover and hunting pressure on mammal persistence within forest patches. The extent of forest cover was a key determinant of species persistence across the three landscapes, but populations of large-bodied species were either reduced or driven to local extinction by hunting even in the most forested and least fragmented landscape. Many game and non-game species persisted in forest isolates, even though, individually, these were likely too small to support viable populations. This study indicates that even small, long-term forest fragments may retain significant conservation value if they can be managed within the context of enhanced connectivity across wider fragmented landscapes. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.641290670546269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29,NA

Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (‚â•20. years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (‚â•0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (‚â§10. years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20. years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.738252732818643,NA,"1",NA,NA,5,32,NA

It is the first study of this kind in the afrotropics. To compare our results with previous studies conducted in the neotropics, we used the protocol proposed by Nu√±ez-Iturri and Howe. We compared animal relative abundances and seed length, density and diversity of seedlings at two sites with contrasting anthropogenic pressures: one with low hunting pressure (LH) and one with high hunting pressure (HH). Furthermore, we investigated how density and diversity of recruitment vary with seed length in the two sites. Both sites exhibit similar soil, climate and tree species composition, and have never been logged. Large mammals (frugivores and herbivores) were extirpated from HH and relative abundance of medium-sized frugivores drastically decreased in HH compared with LH. In HH, diversity of seedlings was reduced compared with LH, especially for large-seeded plant species dispersed by large game mammals. The approach used in this study shows promising perspectives to investigate the effects of human disturbances on the regeneration of tropical forests. Furthermore, in the afrotropical context of a lack of data on plant-animal ecological relationships, seed length appears to be a good predictor of the strength of the deficit of plant recruitment due to large mammal extirpation because of hunting. Thus, more efforts are needed to study the ecological roles of large-seeded plants in order to better understand the effects of their disappearance on tropical forest resilience.

However, few empirical investigations of this issue have been conducted on tropical or wide-ranging species that may be strongly influenced by changes in patch size and edge that occur with increasing fragmentation. We tested the relative influence of habitat loss and fragmentation by examining occupancy of forest patches by 20 mid- and large-sized Neotropical mammal species in a fragmented landscape of northern Guatemala. We related patch occupancy of mammals to measures of habitat loss and fragmentation and compared the influence of these two factors while controlling for patch-level variables. Species responded strongly to both fragmentation and loss, and response to fragmentation generally was negative.

This park has an intact terrestrial mammalian community, including small rodents and large mammalian seed predators, an essential condition to quantify the dynamics of seed predation. To measure seed predation, three exclosure treatments (1.2 m radius X 1.5 m tall) in two forest types (primary vs. secondary forest) were monitored: (1) fenced exclosures that excluded large mammals, (2) fenced exclosures that excluded both large and small mammals, and (3) open controls. Tethered seeds were added from nine common species of canopy trees and lianas (seven families), and seed removal was measured from February 2001 to July 2002. Small rodents had significant negative effects on four of the nine seed species tested, and the effects of small rodents on seed predation differed significantly from the effects of large mammals and insect/fungal pathogens. Small-rodent seed predation (both rates and total proportion destroyed) did not differ between secondary and primary forest habitats. Throughout the exclosure study, small-rodent populations were marked and recaptured to document their community composition and densities. Small-rodent population fluctuations were observed, and shifts in composition directly affected species-specific and community-wide seed predation. Fewer seeds were destroyed when small-rodent abundance was low. Small-rodent population fluctuations also had an indirect effect, reversing the relative importance of small rodents and large mammals and resulting in large mammals becoming the primary seed predators. This change did not only decrease total seed predation for some species; it had the additional effect of moving from a primarily negative interaction (seed predation from the small rodents) to the varied interactions of seed predation and seed dispersal (scatter-hoarding). This research illustrated that small-rodent community fluctuations are a mechanism responsible for variability in the process of Neotropical seedling regeneration.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.498326924044934,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,49,NA

Sugarcane plantations had the highest abundance, whereas pastures had the lowest species richness. Our results suggest that the loss of forest species can be related to the loss of native forest. The results also indicate that to improve the conservation value of agricultural landscapes, native forest fragments should be conserved, extensive monocultures should be avoided and agricultural impacts should be mitigated. ¬© 2012 by Walter de Gruyter.Berlin.Boston.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.571504386061136,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25,NA

We conducted a nest-predation experiment in southern Appalachian Mountain forests (North Carolina, U.S.A.) during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons to determine the effects of exurban development and temperature on predator presence and the average number of days until eggs in an artificial nest were disturbed by predators. We baited artificial nests with quail (Excalfactoria chinensi) eggs and monitored them for 18 days. We used clay eggs, track plates, and motion-triggered cameras to detect and identify nest predators. The average number of days a nest was undisturbed decreased as mean temperature increased and, to a lesser extent, as the density of buildings increased. Nests on the ground were more often depredated than those in trees, likely due to increased predation by opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and other carnivores. Raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums, corvids (Corvus brachyrhynchos and Cyanocitta cristata), chipmunks (Tamias striatus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and domestic cats (Felis catus) were the most commonly detected predators. Presence of these predators did not vary as a function of mean temperature. Domestic cats and corvids were detected more frequently in plots with high rather than low densities of buildings. Forest-interior specialists and Neotropical migrants often nest in cool, high-elevation areas with low housing density. These bird species, especially those that nest on the ground, may be most vulnerable to increased nest predation if temperature and exurban development increase at higher elevations as anticipated. ¬© 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.737607224941597,"0","0",NA,15,5,24,NA

Climate projections coupled to hydrological models were used to analyse variability in wetland water level throughout the current century. Two potential scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions were explored, both resulting in an increase in the inter-annual fluctuations of the water level. In the scenario with higher emissions, projections also showed a long-term negative trend in water-level. To explore the possible response of biota to such water-level changes, species-area relationships of flora and aerial censuses of macro-fauna were analysed during an extraordinary dry period. Plant species richness at the basin scale was found to be highly resistant to hydrological changes, as the large dimension of the wetland acts to buffer against the water-level variations. However, local diversity decreased significantly with low water levels, leading to the loss of ecosystem resilience to additional stressors. The analysis of macro-fauna populations suggested that wetland provides refuge, in low water periods, for the animals with high dispersal ability (aquatic and migratory birds). On the contrary, the abundance of animals with low dispersal ability (mainly herbivorous species) was negatively impacted in low water periods, probably because they are required to search for alternative resources beyond the wetland borders. This period of resource scarcity was also related to increased mortality of large mammals (e.g. marsh deer) around water bodies with high anthropogenic enrichment and cyanobacteria dominance. The synergy between recurrent climatic fluctuations and additional stressors (i.e. biological invasions, eutrophication) presents an important challenge to the conservation of neotropical wetlands in the coming decades. ¬© 2013 √öbeda et al.","Article","Open Access","Scopus",0.514039019660432,"1",NA,NA,15,NA,21,NA

In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, we conducted walking surveys for ‚àº2 years to study the behavior and population trends of collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), and found that peccaries are abundant at La Selva Biological Station and overall, detection rates were relatively constant through time. A stable estimate of detection rates was achieved only after 7-9 months of surveying. We found no habitat preferences between primary and secondary forest, yet there were some differences in group dynamics - group radius was larger and sighting distance was greater in primary forest, whereas the number of singletons was higher in secondary forest. More peccaries were seen closer to the laboratory clearing than at greater distances, for a variety of probable reasons: habituation to humans, lower predation and hunting pressure, and various environmental and habitat factors. Peccary groups had spatially clumped distributions across the landscape and were more active diurnally than nocturnally. Collared peccary densities are relatively high at La Selva compared to other Neotropical sites, with the exception of Barro Colorado Island. We combined our data with a review of the historical literature to assess changes in the populations of peccaries in the Caribbean lowlands. We found that collared peccaries have likely increased in abundance at La Selva, seemingly a few years after the extirpation of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari), which were abundant in the area 40-50 years ago. An understanding of the group dynamics, behavior, and habitat preference of collared peccaries is essential for management decisions and conservation efforts. Additionally, assessment of population changes should be carefully considered in a historical context, with a particular focus on how the populations of the 2 peccary species have changed, and how these species might differentially affect their environment. ¬© 2013 American Society of Mammalogists.","Article","Open Access","Scopus",0.688357458253128,"1","1","corrected unranked to 1",15,10,20,NA

We experimentally reduced the density of a granivorous small mammal (Heteromys desmarestianus) by 90 % to assess the degree to which its rates of seed predation and dispersal limit seed to seedling survival of nine species of trees in a Neotropical lowland forest. Overall, the proportion of seeds that germinated was influenced more by high rates of predation than by limited dispersal. Reduction in density of H. desmarestianus resulted in an order of magnitude decrease in fruit removal rates and an order of magnitude increase in both the absolute and relative numbers of seeds that germinated. However, the proportion of seeds that were cached remained relatively constant across all periods and between control grids and removal plots. In removal plots, H. desmarestianus dispersed and cached about 10 % of the fruits they handled, of which approximately 25 % germinated. This was 2 to 3 times greater than the germination rates of undispersed seeds, and for two species dispersed seeds were the only ones that germinated.

Their economic and social importance to landowners lies in the landowners' potential to derive substantially more income from leasing access for quail hunting than from raising livestock. Moreover, quail hunters have begun to purchase property that was formerly used for cattle or timber production, with the express purpose of maximizing quail production. A variety of habitat management techniques are being applied on these properties to create vegetation structure that provides usable habitat space for bobwhites. Land management for bobwhite production is fast becoming a reality throughout Texas. People who are interested in wildlife species that have habitat requirements similar to those of quails should embrace this development. Webb and Guthery (1983) and Gruver and Guthery (1986) concluded that bobwhite habitat management applied to Texas rangelands also improved habitat for nongame birds. The research cited in this chapter also provides reasonably strong evidence that habitat management performed for quail production benefi ts both small- and large-mammal populations. Therefore, carefully planned quail habitat management that is applied in the appropriate manner will probably benefi t native fl ora and fauna communities in most parts of Texas because quail management emphasizes maximizing habitat diversity. Self-sustaining nongame bird and small-mammal communities, as well as large wildmammal populations, should all fl ourish on rangelands managed for quails. Bobwhites are grassland birds that require habitats composed of about 65- 75 percent herbaceous habitat and 25- 35 percent woody cover. The herbaceous plant community should be composed of a diversity of forbs and grasses that provide suffi cient food as well as foraging, nesting, brooding, escape, and thermal cover. Similarly, the woody plant community should also be composed of a diversity of plants that provide additional food in the form of mast as well as thermal and escape cover. Woody cover should be interspersed throughout herbaceous plant communities in a manner that ensures that a quail does not have to move more than 60- 80 meters (54- 72 yards) to fi nd woody cover. These vegetation conditions will provide habitat that generally supports diverse and abundant native bird and small-mammal communities, as well as healthy populations of predators and popular game mammals such as white-tailed deer, javelinas, and feral hogs. Quail habitat requirements can be provided on rangelands by applying a number of habitat management techniques. Research has demonstrated that mechanical techniques such as roller-chopping and chaining, herbicide applications, and prescribed fi re, as well as grazing, can all be utilized to provide good quail habitat conditions on rangelands. In fact, a combination of these techniques, such as roller-chopping followed by prescribed burning, or herbicide treatment followed by prescribed burning, will usually create and maintain better habitat conditions for quails than a single technique. Ranchers and quail managers therefore have a great deal of fl exibility in choosing habitat management techniques that will provide the best quail habitat conditions for their individual operations. Fortunately, numerous research projects have indicated that most of the habitat improvement techniques utilized to improve landscapes for quails also benefi t nontarget wildlife populations. Grassland birds in particular represent a declining avian guild that could benefi t signifi cantly as quail habitat management continues to increase on Texas rangelands. Quail management in the forests of East Texas will also likely benefi t nontarget wildlife populations. Recent research has demonstrated that midstory hardwood-removal techniques, such as thinning and girdling and herbicide application followed by prescribed burns ignited in the spring two to three years posttreatment, can be used to restore longleaf pine forests in a manner that benefi ts native bird populations. Other studies have shown that native wildlife populations can also benefi t from eff orts to improve pine forest composed of fast-growing species, though the composition and abundance of bird communities remain diff erent from those of native bird communities of longleaf pine forests. Nevertheless, the commercial pine forests that dominate most of East Texas are capable of supporting diverse native fauna communities when they are managed for bobwhites. The local and regional abundance of numerous species of Neotropical migratory birds, which have been declining in recent years, could improve if more acreage in East Texas and the Southeast are managed for bobwhites. In addition, forest communities of small mammals, white-tailed deer, and feral hogs would also probably benefi t from bobwhite management of pinelands. Nontarget wildlife species that require woody cover would likely decline on rangelands and forests managed for quail production. Anytime that vegetation communities undergo dramatic alteration, populations of a few species suff er and decline. Trade-off s are inevitable and unavoidable. However, most of the bird and mammal species that decline as a result of quail management are species that responded positively to destructive land management practices that ruined the native rangeland and forest ecosystems in Texas. Restoring these ecosystems by applying habitat management that creates vegetation communities pre-ferred by quails simultaneously encourages restoration of native fauna populations, generally resulting in a more diverse and abundant vertebrate community. Most of the rangeland ecosystems in Texas that support or historically supported quail populations have deteriorated over the past 150 years as a result of overgrazing, exotic plant invasions, urbanization, and other disturbances. Similarly, the longleaf pine forests that once dominated the uplands of East Texas are now reduced to small, highly fragmented remnant stands. They have been replaced by commercial forests composed of fast-growing pine species managed in a manner that maximizes profi ts for timber companies at the expense of wildlife. Native bird and mammal abundance and diversity in these commercial forests are poor and generally remain in this condition as long as traditional silviculture is observed. Consequently, good quail management of rangelands and pinelands is a superior alternative to traditional land management practices because the vegetation communities created and maintained for quails support more abundant and diverse wildlife communities than do the overgrazed, brush- and exotic grass- infested pastures and intensively managed commercial pine plantations. The increasing popularity of quails in Texas represents a genuine benefi t to nontarget wildlife species. As more of Texas is improved for quails, more of Texas will be improved for native wildlife.

Additionally, we assessed how photo identification influenced density estimates by comparing estimates based on capture histories constructed by 3 independent investigators. We estimated the abundances of pumas using mark-resight models in program MARK and then estimated densities ad hoc. We also estimated densities directly using spatial mark-resight models implemented in a Bayesian framework. Puma densities did not vary substantially among observers but estimates generated from the 3 statistical techniques did differ. Density estimates (pumas/100 km2) from spatial mark-resight models were lower (0.22-7.92) and had increased precision compared to those from nonspatial capture-recapture (0.50-19.35) and mark-resight techniques (0.54-14.70). Our study is the 1st to estimate the density of a population of carnivores, where only a subset of the individuals are naturally marked, using camera-trapping surveys in combination with spatial mark-resight models. The development of spatial mark-resight and spatially explicit capture-recapture techniques creates the potential for using a single camera-trapping array to estimate the density of multiple, sympatric carnivores, including both partially marked and uniquely marked species. ¬© 2014 American Society of Mammalogists.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.647758783661838,"0",NA,NA,15,NA,18,NA

However, their distribution pattern inside the Eucalyptus plantations remains unknown. This study aimed at the identification of possible influence of distances from the remaining native revegetation areas and riparian systems, on spatial distribution and abundance of small-size mammals in Eucalyptus plantations. This study was carried at Eucalyptus stands recently planted (0-3 years) at the municipality of Angatuba, Sao Paulo state, Brazil between August 2007 and July 2009. The survey was carried out using pitfall traps at 14 sampling units inside Eucalyptus plantations 60-1130 m away from the borders. With a sampling effort of 2,449 bucket night, the experiment captured 680 individuals belonging to 12 species of small-size mammals (rodents and marsupials). The colonization process of Eucalyptus plantations was apparently initiated by generalist species from open Cerrado. In the present study, we did not find any clear correlation between specific richness and abundance of individuals and the distance from native revegetation areas or closer riparian systems. The study suggests that Eucalyptus plantations are permeable matrices to, at least, more generalist species present in the silvicultural landscapes (i.e. composed by an Eucalyptus plantation as the matrix and native vegetation patches). However, further studies must prioritize analyzing the influence of agricultural/sivilcultural practices (e.g., plantation structure and harvest frequency) on habitat quality and carrying capacity of agricultural/silvicultural landscape matrices, as well as implementing long-term monitoring programs to assess the impact of complete production cycles (some years) and along cycles of Eucalyptus plantations (some decades), on rodents population's diversity and dynamics patterns. ¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.556856531447424,"1",NA,"Corrected unranked to 1, discusses trapping over 2 years, although in a plantation",15,NA,17,NA

Using geometric morphometrics, morphological variation was examined with respect to: differences in intraspecific variation, morphological modularity and integration, and biogeographic patterns. Patterns of intraspecific variation were different for each species in both cranial and mandibular morphology, with functional differences apparent according to diet. Cranial modularity varied between species whereas mandibular modularity did not. High cranial and mandibular correlation reflects Cranium-Mandible integration as a functional unit. Similarity between the biogeographic patterns in C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata indicates that the Andes do not act as a barrier but rather as an independent region, isolating the morphology of Andean populations of larger-bodied species. The biogeographic pattern for C. castanea was not associated with the physiography of the Andes, suggesting that large body size does not benefit C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata in maintaining homogeneous morphologies among populations. ¬© 2015 L√≥pez-Aguirre et al.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.297545396417044,"0",NA,NA,10,NA,16,NA

Although palms provide useful ecosystem services, they also offer suitable habitat for triatomines and for Trypanosoma cruzi mammalian hosts. Wild triatomines often invade houses by flying from nearby palms, potentially leading to new cases of human Chagas disease. Understanding and predicting triatomine-palm associations and palm infestation probabilities is important for enhancing Chagas disease prevention in areas where palm-associated vectors transmit T. cruzi. We present a comprehensive overview of palminfestation by triatomines in the Americas, combining a thorough reanalysis of our published and unpublished records with an in-depth review of the literature. We use site-occupancy modeling (SOM) to examine infestation in 3590 palms sampled with non-destructive methods, and standard statistics to describe and compare infestation in 2940 palms sampled by felling-and-dissection. Thirty-eight palm species (18 genera) have been reported to be infested by ~39 triatomine species (10 genera) from the USA to Argentina. Overall infestation varied from 49.1-55.3% (SOM) to 62.6-66.1% (dissection), with important heterogeneities among sub-regions and particularly among palm species. Large palms with complex crowns (e.g., Attalea butyracea, Acrocomia aculeata) and some medium-crowned palms (e.g.,Copernicia, Butia) are often infested; in slender, small-crowned palms (e.g., Euterpe) triatomines associate with vertebrate nests. Palm infestation tends to be higher in rural settings, but urban palms can also be infested. Most Rhodnius species are probably true palm specialists, where as Psammolestes, Eratyrus, Cavernicola, Panstrongylus, Triatoma, Alberprosenia, and some Bolboderini seem to use palms opportunistically. Palms provide extensive habitat for enzootic T. cruzi cycles and a critical link between wild cycles. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Jaguarundis occupy and use a range of habitats with dense undergrowth from northern Mexico to central Argentina, but may be most abundant in seasonal dry, Atlantic, gallery, and mixed grassland/agricultural forest landscapes. Jaguarundis are principally predators of small (sigmodontine) rodents, although other mammals, birds, and squamate reptiles are taken regularly. The vast majority of jaguarundi camera-trap records occurred during daylight hours (0600h-1800h); jaguaurndis are also predominantly terrestrial, although they appear to be capable tree climbers. Home range sizes for jaguarundis vary greatly, but most are ‚â§25km2; females' territories may be much smaller than or similar in size to those of males. Males may concentrate movements in one area before shifting to another and, as with other felids, intersexual overlap in habitat use appears to be common. Interference competition may be important in influencing the distribution and ecology of jaguarundis, although their diurnal habits may somewhat mitigate its effect. Conflict between humans and jaguarundis over small livestock may be widespread among rural human communities and is likely to be underreported. Despite this conflict, jaguarundis can persist in agriculturally modified landscapes and small forest fragments. Additional research on local jaguarundi populations from more areas should be a priority to determine the true status of the species. ¬© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Review",NA,"Scopus",0.631959266146432,"0",NA,NA,10,NA,12,NA

Hunting management decisions should therefore rely on abundance and distribution data that are as representative as possible of true population sizes and dynamics. We simultaneously applied a commonly used encounterbased method and an infrequently used sign-based method to estimate hunted vertebrate abundance in a 48,000-km2 indigenous landscape in southern Guyana. Diurnal direct encounter data collected during three years along 216, four-kilometer -long transects consistently under-detected many diurnal and nocturnal mammal species readily detected through sign. Of 32 species analyzed, 31 were detected by both methods; however, encounters did not detect one and under-detected another 12 of the most heavily hunted species relative to sign, while sign under-detected 12 never or rarely collected species relative to encounters. The six most important game animals in the region, all ungulates, were not encountered at 11-40% of village and control sites or on 29-72% of transects where they were detected by sign. Using the sign methodology, we find that tapirs, one of the terrestrial vertebrates considered most sensitive to overexploitation, are present at many sites where they were never visually detected during distance sampling. We find that this is true for many other species as well. These high rates of under-detection suggest that behavioral changes in hunted populations may affect apparent occurrence and abundance of these populations. Accumulation curves (detection of species on transects) were much steeper for sign for 12 of 16 hunted species than for encounters, but that pattern was reversed for 12 of 16 species unhunted in our area. We conclude that collection of sign data is an efficient and effective method of monitoring hunted vertebrate populations that complements encounter and camera-trapping methods in areas impacted by hunting. Sign surveys may be the most viable method for large-scale, management-oriented studies in remote areas, particularly those focused on community-based wildlife management. ¬© 2016 Fragoso et al.

We found that secondary forests can hold complex mammalian communities and no species exhibited habitat preferences between primary and secondary forests. With few exceptions, behavioral and group dynamic characteristics of mammal species were similar between forest types. Our research allows us to address methodological questions and assess the effectiveness of transect sampling. Monthly detection rates vary widely by species and likely reflect short-term changes in behavior rather than population fluctuations. Air temperature and rainfall are the factors most associated with monthly detection rates for various species. Small-scale areas of higher and lower use are evident for several species. Neither time of morning for surveys nor number of observers per trail affects detection rate. We report current abundances for the most commonly observed species and note generally lower densities in the Caribbean lowlands than elsewhere in the Neotropics.

Using spool-and-line tracking devices, we estimated the tortuosity of fine-scale movements of 149 individuals by their fractal dimension D. We evaluated the relative importance of population size, reproductive or climatic seasons and reproductive maturity of individuals as determinants of movement tortuosity, using a model selection approach. Population size was the most important determinant of movement tortuosity, with season (climatic seasons for females, reproductive seasons for males) and reproductive maturity as secondary but also important variables. We detected a positive density-dependent effect on movement tortuosity, resulting in more intensive use of areas by individuals during periods of high population size. This positive association between movement tortuosity and population size is more likely to result from intraspecific competition, which forces individuals to explore their environment more intensively during high-density periods. Therefore, despite being density dependent, movements in D.aurita apparently do not contribute to population regulation mechanisms. ¬© 2015 Ecological Society of Australia.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.668577525367559,"0","0",NA,10,15,13,NA

Dogs have been shown to impact wildlife populations negatively, and their occurrence can alter the abundance, behavior, and activity patterns of native species. However, little is known about abundance and density of the free-ranging dogs that use protected areas. Here, we used camera trap data with an open-robust design mark-recapture model to estimate the number of dogs that used protected areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We estimated the time period these dogs used the protected areas, and explored factors that influenced the probability of continued use (e.g., season, mammal richness, proportion of forest), while accounting for variation in detection probability. Dogs in the studied system were categorized as rural free-ranging, and their abundance varied widely across protected areas (0-73 individuals). Dogs used protected areas near human houses for longer periods (e.g., >50% of sampling occasions) compared to more distant areas. We found no evidence that their probability of continued use varied with season or mammal richness. Dog detection probability decreased linearly among occasions, possibly due to the owners confining their dogs after becoming aware of our presence. Comparing our estimates to those for native carnivoran, we found that dogs were three to 85 times more abundant than ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), two to 25 times more abundant than puma (Puma concolor), and approximately five times more abundant than the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). Combining camera trapping data with modern mark-recapture methods provides important demographic information on free-ranging dogs that can guide management strategies to directly control dogs' abundance and ranging behavior.

This study explored the conservation status of a large predator, the jaguar, considered an indicator of the maintenance of how well ecological processes are maintained. We implemented an original integrative approach, exploring successive ecosystem status proxies, from habitats and responses to threats of predators and their prey, to canopy structure and forest biomass. Niche modeling allowed identification of more suitable habitats, significantly related to canopy height and forest biomass. Capture/recapture methods showed that jaguar density was higher in habitats identified as more suitable by the niche model. Surveys of ungulates, large rodents and birds also showed higher density where jaguars were more abundant. Although jaguar density does not allow early detection of overall vertebrate community collapse, a decrease in the abundance of large terrestrial birds was noted as good first evidence of disturbance. The most promising tool comes from easily acquired LiDAR data and radar images: a decrease in canopy roughness was closely associated with the disturbance of forests and associated decreasing vertebrate biomass. This mixed approach, focusing on an apex predator, ecological modeling and remote-sensing information, not only helps detect early population declines in large mammals, but is also useful to discuss the relevance of large predators as indicators and the efficiency of conservation measures. It can also be easily extrapolated and adapted in a timely manner, since important open-source data are increasingly available and relevant for large-scale and real-time monitoring of biodiversity. ¬© 2016 de Thoisy et al.

Therefore, some aspects of its distribution, habitat requirements, and abundance are mostly unknown; which makes a proper determination of its conservation status difficult. Considering that new techniques known as species distribution models (SDMs) allow us to estimate the suitable areas and the most important variables for the distribution of a species, we compiled water opossum occurrences and modeled its potential distribution on a continental scale. We performed a SDM for the water opossum using MaxEnt and assessed the extent of habitat loss (km2) and the importance of Protected Areas (PAs). We compared the suitability values within and outside PAs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to evaluate the efficiency of PAs. The results obtained were compared with the IUCN historical water opossum's map. Additionally, we identified gaps in the potential distribution where for future surveys should be focused. We obtained models that describe the distribution of this species based on 292 occurrences with new information for 16 countries. Deforestation reduced the area of suitable habitat by ‚àº40 % and only ‚àº18 % corresponds to natural forest within PAs. Areas inside PAs showed higher suitability values (0.351 ¬± 0.276; P &lt; 0.001) than areas outside them. We identified gaps within the distribution that need attention during future surveys such as the frontier between Venezuela and Guyana, the Amazonian region, and central-eastern Brazil. Our results showed areas absent in the IUCN's distribution map, indicating that it needs to be updated. Thus, we proposed a new tentative extent of the water opossum distribution information here obtained. We demonstrated that PAs included areas with high habitat suitability values for C. minimus, which could protect the water opossum in the medium and long-term. Modifications to the physicochemical characteristics of the habitat due to forest loss and fragmentation can considerably affect water opossum populations and reduce local diversity. Thus, the preservation of river ecosystems and surrounding areas represents a necessary step for the conservation of C. minimus. ¬© 2017 Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Mastozoolog√≠a, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.578131939980885,"0",NA,"Corrected unranked to 0",5,NA,6,NA

La Selva consists of a research station and 1500+ ha reserve of premontane rain forest. After an introduction to the volume and La Selva Biological Station, the first section outlines the abiotic environment comprising: climate; geomorphology; aquatic systems; and soils. The second section looks at the plant community in terms of composition, dynamics, and life-history processes. Next, the animal community is covered: butterfly and amphibian diversity; reptiles and birds; and the mammal fauna. A paper on population biology (life histories, abundance, demography, and predator-prey interactions) concludes this section. Section four outlines plant-herbivore interactions and frugivory. the final section reviews La Selva's human environment: land-use patterns, agricultural systems and forestry. Appendices include checklists of: vascular plants, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Sixteen chapters are individually abstracted in Ecological Abstracts. Other chapters are also covered in International Development Abstracts and Geographical Abstracts: Physical Geography. -S.R.Harris","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.395810584352373,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,59,NA

In particular, host species resilient to changes in their natural habitat may increase in numbers, which in turn can affect the prevalence of directly transmitted viruses. We have carried out a survey of small mammal communities in three tropical landscapes differing in their degree of environmental change in Central Panama and investigated the effects of community changes on Hepacivirus prevalence. The modification of continuous habitat into partly connected or isolated habitat patches during the past century was linked to changes in species diversity and species assemblages, which was further associated with shifts in the abundance of generalist marsupial (Didelphis marsupialis, Philander opossum) and rodent (Proechimys semispinosus) species. The latter has become dominant in isolated habitat patches and was the only identified Hepacivirus host in our study system. Our analyses suggest that, in addition to the effects of host age and sex, host population density in interaction with sex ratio is a crucial predictor of infection probability. Although we found no significant relationships between species diversity per se and infection probability, the lowest prevalence detected in the landscape with the highest species diversity indicates that shifts in species assemblages (e.g. changes in the presence and abundance of marsupial predators) impact the host‚Äôs intraspecific contact rates, the probability of virus transmission and, thus, the virus prevalence. Our study additionally provides important data on the influence of human-induced landscape changes on infection probability and, therefore, on virus prevalence in wildlife and emphasizes the importance of a landscape-scale approach with concomitant consideration of the complex interactions between ecological factors. ¬© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Article",NA,"Scopus",0.417653075611835,"1",NA,"Mentions changes in abundance of species",5,NA,2,NA

Although density may influence movement patterns, the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in animal movements are still unclear, particularly whether it may vary among populations of a species, or across time within a population. Here, we evaluate the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in the movements of a Neotropical marsupial, the Grey four-eyed opossum Philander frenatus (Didelphidae, Didelphimorphia). We quantified fine-scale path tortuosity of individuals inhabiting continuous forest areas and forest fragments, in different climatic seasons (humid vs. super-humid). We also determined the relative importance of population size compared to sex and body mass on movements, using a model-selection approach. In forest fragments, path tortuosity increased with population size in the super-humid season, but decreased in the humid season. In the continuous forest, path tortuosity was affected only by sex and body mass, being slightly higher in males and negatively related to body mass. The occurrence of density-dependence on movements only in forest fragments is likely to reflect the higher overall density of P.¬†frenatus in small forest fragments. The variation in the nature of density-dependence between climatic seasons is likely to reflect a trade off between foraging over large areas (humid season, low resource availability) versus avoiding agonistic encounters (super-humid season, high resource availability). Our results show that (i) density-dependence in movements may be context-dependent occurring only in areas of relatively high overall population density; and (ii) density may affect movements in different ways at different climatic seasons. ¬© 2018 Ecological Society of Australia","Article in Press",NA,"Scopus",0.651680373007663,"0",NA,NA,5,NA,3,NA
