Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from ""Vulnerable"" to ""Endangered."" Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years. For this population to recover to a status under which it could be ""delisted,"" a 10% increase in survival of all age classes would be needed. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.886828932,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,47,NA

Mortality of the population was calculated from length-class abundance of fish sampled by trammel nets, and the population size estimated using a mark and recapture technique. Instantaneous natural mortality in the nearshore population was high (M=0.78) although other author's estimate for the mortality in the offshore population was only 0.35. Therefore it is likely that no single estimate of mortality will apply to fish of all ages. The population density of juvenile N. rossii was about 11 g m-2 nearshore. The size of the offshore population was estimated by calculating survival from the nearshore age classes. The data suggest that the population around South Georgia has been reduced by overfishing to about one tenth of its previous unexploited level. Yield could have been increased by fishing less intensively, and the population maintained at or near its initial level if recruitment remained constant. ¬© 1984 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.883955661,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,117,NA

The species breeds widely throughout the Antarctic and on peri-Antarctic islands. From breeding population data collated from 73 of these localities, we estimated the minimum global population to be about 400,000 breeding pairs. After adjusting for seasonal variation in numbers of breeding pairs based on studies at Ardery Island, East Antarctica, the total global population is estimated to be at least one million breeding pairs. Of this, 72% nest on islands of the Scotia Sea arc and the South Atlantic Ocean. The precision of the estimate on the total number of breeding pairs is low, as several colony estimates were only available as orders of magnitude. Furthermore, different timing of the surveys and the difficulties of censusing colonial cliff-nesting birds reduced the count accuracy. Currently, there are no known threats to the global population, although the effects of fishery activities are not fully known. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Review,Scopus,0.88102345,?,?,Changed to ?

We estimated the size of this population by calculating the area of suitable habitat and the density of occupied burrows within it. Some 670,000 occupied nests were estimated for the island at mid-incubation, representing 0.9 million pairs of breeding-age birds associated with South Georgia in the survey seasons (2005/06 and 06/07). This is 40-45% of the previous estimate, but still represents well over half of the global population.

The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933.

However, a significant population decline reported at Ross Island after 2006 has been linked to a commercial fishery that began in the Ross Sea in 1996‚Äì1997 and targets large Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni)‚Äîthe presumed primary prey of RSKW. We assessed RSKW population abundance and trends using photo-identification data collected in McM during seven summers from 2001‚Äì2002 to 2014‚Äì2015. We identified 352 individual RSKWs and estimated an average annual population of 470 distinctly marked whales. Using a Bayesian mark‚Äìrecapture model, we identified two population clusters: ‚Äòregulars‚Äô showed strong inter- and intra-annual site fidelity and an average annual abundance of 73 distinctive individuals (95% probability: 57‚Äì88); ‚Äòirregulars‚Äô were less frequently encountered but comprised a larger population with an annual estimate of 397 distinctive individuals (287‚Äì609). The number of seasonally resident regulars appeared to be stable over the period of purported RSKW decline, with the estimated annual number of deaths (6; 95% probability: 1‚Äì22) offset by the number of recruits (6; 2‚Äì19).

It addresses correspondence between long-term population trends of inshore demersal fish and inshore-feeding Antarctic shags of this area, where an intensive commercial fishery for shag prey once operated. The analysis also includes comparable information on diet (by examination of regurgitated pellets), foraging patterns, and breeding output of shags from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, an area where no commercial finfish fishery has ever existed. Integral study of these parameters there showed that, in Antarctic shags, low breeding success and high foraging effort might imply low recruitment and high adult mortality, respectively, with both factors adversely affecting the population trends of this bird. In line with these premises, the declining trend observed in shag colonies on the South Shetland Islands appears to have been influenced by the concomitant decrease in abundance of two of their main prey, the nototheniids Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons, due to intensive industrial fishing in the area in the late 1970s.

The decrease in recruitment to the inshore sub-populations of N. rossii and G. gibberifrons over the last 16 years was most probably caused by the offshore commercial fishery in the area in the late 1970s.

The population at South Georgia is currently exploited by pelagic trawlers fishing close to the seabed. Annual catches peaked at 150,000 t in 1983 and have declined since the mid-to-late 1980s. Bottom-trawl surveys have been conducted since 1987, providing a time series of abundance and size distribution for use in assessing the status of the stock and setting quotas. Food web models suggest that estimates of the biomass from survey data are substantially lower than the amount of icefish required by the local ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the uncertainty around current estimates of density and variance, using alternative nonparametric stratified bootstrapping methods. The stratified rescaling bootstrap estimator was identified as the most appropriate method of those tested: in comparison with the existing method, confidence intervals and the inter-annual variability of the estimates were reduced. Numbers-at-age were estimated from mixture distribution models fitted to length-disaggregated density data in order to determine whether individual cohorts were consistently detected by the surveys. Estimates of numbers-at-age could not consistently delineate cohorts in successive years indicating that survey-based estimates of density were biased. These biases may have arisen because the trawl gear did not select individuals of all sizes equally, or because sampling was restricted to the demersal component of the stock. Estimates of abundance of the pelagic component of the stock should be derived from acoustic data to improve the assessment. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.83601677,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,38,NA

High angle oblique aerial photographic surveys of colonies were acquired and penguins counted for the breeding seasons 1981-2012. In the last four years the numbers of Ad√©lie penguins in the Ross and Beaufort Island colonies (southern Ross Sea metapopulation) reached their highest levels since aerial counts began in 1981. Results indicated that 855,625 pairs of Ad√©lie penguins established breeding territories in the western Ross Sea, with just over a quarter (28%) of those in the southern portion, constituting a semi-isolated metapopulation (three colonies on Ross Island, one on nearby Beaufort Island). The southern population had a negative per capita growth rate of -0.019 during 1981-2000, followed by a positive per capita growth rate of 0.067 for 2001-2012. Colony growth rates for this metapopulation showed striking synchrony through time, indicating that large-scale factors influenced their annual growth. In contrast to the increased colony sizes in the southern population, the patterns of change among colonies of the northern Ross Sea were difficult to characterize. Trends were similar to southern colonies until the mid-1990s, after which the signal was lost owing to significantly reduced frequency of surveys. Both climate factors and recovery of whale populations likely played roles in the trends among southern colonies until 2000, after which depletion of another trophic competitor, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni), may explain the sharp increasing trend evident since then. ¬© 2014 Lyver et al.",Article,Scopus,0.835592282,1,1,NA,15,5,1,15,30,NA

Forty radiocarbon dates on penguin bones and eggshells from 13 of these sites indicate a near continuous occupation by breeding penguins in this region for over 9000 years. These dates refine the recent geological record in this region and indicate that deglaciation of the northern islands occurred much earlier than previously suggested. Dietary remains from these sites include at least 23 taxa of cephalopods and teleost fish. Quantification of these remains indicates significant fluctuations in the relative abundance of two of the more common major prey taxa. The Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum Boulenger) was the most common teleost prey during all time periods represented by the ages of the sites, but preservational factors may explain a gradual decrease in the remains of this species in increasingly older sites. The most common cephalopod in the sediments was the squid, Psychroteuthis glacialis Thiele, which occurred in low numbers in most sites except one (Site 75). An unusually high number of squid beaks preserved in Site 75, dating to approximately 5700-6100 cal. yr BP, does not correlate with a decrease in fish prey at that time. The high number of abandoned penguin colonies (> 200) in the Windmill Islands may be due to population cycles in the past in association with low nest-site fidelity and movement by breeding penguins to new sites within this region. ¬© Antarctic Science Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.834685344,NA,0,NA,NA,5,,,156,NA

White-chinned petrel burrows are largely confined to deep, muddy soils, usually on slopes below 200 m, but locally up to 420 m. After correcting for count bias, Marion Island has an estimated 29,900 nests (95 % CI 27,700-32,400). Burrow occupancy rates at the start of the incubation period were 65 % during one-off surveys, but repeat surveys found that at least 73 % of burrows were occupied and 87 % of burrows showed signs of occupancy. This suggests that there were roughly 24,000 occupied nests on Marion Island (95 % CI 20,000-28,000). A more cursory survey on Prince Edward Island yielded 14,700 burrows, suggesting that there are 9,000-15,000 occupied nests.

Signals from this key group of species can indicate broad scale impacts or response to environmental change. Recent studies of penguin populations, the most commonly abundant Antarctic seabirds in the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea, have demonstrated that physical changes in Antarctic marine environments have profound effects on biota at high trophic levels. Large populations of the circumpolar-breeding Ad√©lie penguin occur in East Antarctica, but direct, standardized population data across much of this vast coastline have been more limited than in other Antarctic regions. We combine extensive new population survey data, new population estimation methods, and re-interpreted historical survey data to assess decadal-scale change in East Antarctic Ad√©lie penguin breeding populations. We show that, in contrast to the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea where breeding populations have decreased or shown variable trends over the last 30 years, East Antarctic regional populations have almost doubled in abundance since the 1980's and have been increasing since the earliest counts in the 1960's. The population changes are associated with five-year lagged changes in the physical environment, suggesting that the changing environment impacts primarily on the pre-breeding age classes. East Antarctic marine ecosystems have been subject to a number of changes over the last 50 years which may have influenced Ad√©lie penguin population growth, including decadal-scale climate variation, an inferred mid-20th century sea-ice contraction, and early-to-mid 20th century exploitation of fish and whale populations. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",Article,Scopus,0.822641497,NA,1,NA,NA,10,,,100,NA

Antarctic seabirds are vulnerable to all these threats because they depend on terrestrial and marine environments to breed and forage. We assess the current distribution and total abundance of Ad√©lie penguins in East Antarctica and find there are 3.5 (95% CI 2.9‚Äì4.2) million individuals of breeding age along the East Antarctic coastline and 5.9 (4.2‚Äì7.7) million individuals foraging in the adjacent ocean after the breeding season. One third of the breeding population numbering over 1 million individuals breed within 10 km of research stations, highlighting the potential for human activities to impact Ad√©lie penguin populations despite their current high abundance. The 16 Antarctic Specially Protected Areas currently designated in East Antarctica offer protection to breeding populations close to stations in four of six regional populations. The East Antarctic breeding population consumes an average of 193 500 tonnes of krill and 18 800 tonnes of fish during a breeding season, with consumption peaking at the end of the breeding season. These findings can inform future conservation management decisions in the terrestrial environment under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to develop a systematic network of protected areas, and in the marine environment under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to allow the consumption needs of Ad√©lie penguins to be taken into account when setting fishery catch limits. Extending this work to other penguin, flying seabird, seal and whale species is a priority for conservation management in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. ¬© 2016 The Authors",Article,Scopus,0.818720065,NA,0,NA,NA,10,,,50,NA

Pup production was estimated during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons from mark-recapture studies at the two largest sea lion rookeries, at the Auckland Islands (Sandy Bay and Dundas Island), which account for almost 90% of total pup production for the species.

Total pup production estimates for all sites during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons are 2640 and 2807 respectively. During the four-week pupping season, pup mortality at most sites was estimated to be about 10%.

This region is also among the fastestwarming areas on the planet, with 5-6 ¬∞C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the ""sea-ice hypothesis,"" proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in ""ice-loving"" species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of ""ice-avoiding"" species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Ad√©lie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.",Article,Scopus,0.808668603,NA,1,NA,NA,10,,,98,NA

Several albatross species, including the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, have shown marked declines in abundance throughout their range. These seabirds are frequently taken as by-catch in longline fisheries and this mortality has been implicated in the population declines. 2. We developed a deterministic, density-dependent, age-structured model for assessing the effects of longlining on wandering albatross populations. We used demographic data from field studies at South Georgia and the Crozet Islands, data on albatross abundance from 1960 to 1995, and reported effort data from the tuna longline fisheries south of 30¬∞S, to model estimated by-catch levels and other population parameters in the model. 3. The model used two alternative assumptions about patterns of at-sea distribution of wandering albatross (uniform between 30¬∞S-60¬∞S; proportional to the distribution of longline fishing effort between these latitudes). 4. Our model was able to predict reasonably closely the observed data from the Crozet Islands wandering albatross population, but the fit to the South Georgia population was substantially poorer. This probably reflects: (i) greater overlap in the Indian Ocean than in the Atlantic Ocean between the main areas of tuna longline fishing and the foraging ranges of wandering albatrosses from the Crozet Islands and South Georgia, respectively; and (ii) greater impact of poorly documented longline fisheries, especially the tuna fisheries in the south Atlantic and the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fishery, within the foraging range of wandering albatrosses from South Georgia. 5. The model results suggest that the marked decline in both populations, and subsequent recovery of the Crozet Islands population (but not the continued decline of the South Georgia population), can be explained by the tuna longline by-catch. They further indicate that populations may be able to sustain some level of incidental take. However, the likely under-reporting of fishing effort (especially in non-tuna longline fisheries) and the delicate balance between a sustainable and unsustainable level of by-catch for these long-lived populations suggest great caution in any application of such findings.",Article,Scopus,0.807519707,1,1,NA,15,10,1,15,28,NA

These surveys are conducted under the assumption that the target fish species are more or less evenly distributed over the area at the time of the survey. This assumption is violated in the case of N. rossii, which is non-randomly distributed such that a large proportion of the population tends to aggregate in small areas, leaving most of the survey area only thinly populated.

This has led to wide fluctuations of some fish harvests and concern over the conservation status of some top predators. Research over the past 20 years into the causes of population changes of some abundant fish species, some southern pinnipeds and the most important guano-producing seabirds is briefly reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to populations off south-western Africa. Fish populations have been influenced in a complex manner by a variety of factors, including fishing, biological interactions and environmental change. Climate, operating at a basin scale, is probably an important cause of large and long-term changes in the abundance of some sardine populations. The impact of anticipated climate change on sardine-rich ecosystems is expected to receive emphasis in the future. The populations of some pinnipeds and seabirds were drastically reduced by former excessive harvests. Whereas pinnipeds have tended to recover under regimes of controlled exploitation, the numbers of some seabirds have continued to decrease even in the absence of exploitation. Various factors have contributed to the ongoing decreases, including competition with fisheries for prey resources and competition with pinnipeds for breeding space. The 1980s saw the introduction of legislation specifying conservation of marine ecosystems as a management objective in Antarctica and South Africa. Means of achieving this objective, given the biological interactions at the upper end of the trophic pathway, are expected to provide another focus for future research. ¬© 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus,0.802352978,NA,1,NA,NA,10,,,119,NA

The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals. These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf. 2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the east to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle. 3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species. 4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered. 5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators. ¬© 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.801142872,NA,0,NA,NA,15,,,174,NA

Except for Elephant Island, the state of fish stocks of the southern Scotia Arc region has been accorded little attention until 1998, despite substantial catches in the first four years of the fishery and ample opportunity to sample these catches. The only scientific surveys of these stocks during these years were conducted by Germany in 1985, and by Spain in 1987 and 1991. More recently, the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (US AMLR) Program carried out two extensive surveys around Elephant Island and the lower South Shetland Islands in March 1998 and around the South Orkney Islands in March 1999. In this paper, the authors present new data on species composition, species groups, length compositions, length-weight relationships, length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning, gonadosomatic indices and oocyte diameter. Lesser Antarctic or peri-Antarctic species predominated in the fish fauna. Species groups differed by up to 55-60% from one shelf area to the other, mostly due to differences in the abundance of the predominant species on each shelf area and the increase in the number of high-Antarctic species in the South Orkney Islands. Length compositions and the proportion of large (= old) specimens in the populations provided no evidence of illegal fishing since the closure of the region some 10 years ago. Differences in length-weight relationships between areas were primarily due to differences in length compositions of the fish caught, but did not suggest geographical differences in length-to-weight growth. Differences in estimates of length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning indicate that in some species final maturation of the gonads takes one year or more, whereas in others gonad maturation was completed within one season. Length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning in Champsocephalus gunnari was one year later on the southerly grounds than at South Georgia. The distribution of gonadosomatic indices in March suggested that Lepidonotothen squamifrons was spawning while Trematomus hansoni was already coming to the end of its reproductive season. Chionodraco rastrospinosus and Trematomus eulepidotus were close to spawning. Other species, such as Notothenia rossii and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, spawn at least one to two months later than at South Georgia. Channichthyids (except C. gunnari), Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps have egg diameters of 4.3-5.2 mm at spawning. The Trematomus species investigated have egg diameters of 2.8-3.2 mm while in species of the genera Gobionotothen and Lepidonotothen, egg diameters rarely exceeded 2.0 mm. Measurements of oocyte diameters confirmed the findings on spawning time estimated from gonadosomatic indices.",Article,Scopus,0.798233295,NA,0,NA,NA,15,,,163,NA

Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early cr√®che stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years. Oceanographically, the two summers differed; in 2003 the mixed layer was fresher and shallower, indicating a delayed melting of sea-ice in the study area when compared to 2001.

Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site.Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii.Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system. ¬© 2015.",Article,Scopus,0.791013896,NA,0,NA,NA,15,,,112,NA

Significant seasonal and interannual differences in the larval fish assemblage were revealed by multivariate analyses. Estimates of larval growth are provided for five abundant species. Considerable inter-specific differences in relative larval growth rate were recorded but interannual variability within species was small. However, in the commercially important C. gunnari, multiple larval cohorts, representing a protracted spawning season, were observed to grow at different rates, and this may be related to temperature and/or food availability. A comparison with historical growth data from South Georgia suggests there has been little change in growth rate for the main species over the last three decades. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.779677338,?,?,fish larvae?,5,15,?,5,10,NA

The ability to monitor the population size of species potentially affected by Southern Ocean fisheries, i.e., the Ad√©lie penguin, is critical for effective management of those resources. However, for several reasons, direct estimates of population size are not possible in many locations around Antarctica. In this study, we combine high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery with spectral analysis in a supervised classification to estimate the sizes of Ad√©lie penguin breeding colonies along Victoria Land in the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using satellite images paired with concurrent ground counts, we fit a generalized linear mixed model with Poisson errors to predict the abundance of breeding pairs as a function of the area of current-year guano staining identified in the satellite imagery. Guano-covered area proved to be an effective proxy for the number of penguins residing within. Our model provides a robust, quantitative mechanism for estimating the breeding population size of colonies captured in imagery and identifies terrain slope as a significant component influencing apparent nesting density. While our high-resolution satellite imagery technique was developed for the Ad√©lie penguin, these principles are directly transferrable to other colonially nesting seabirds and other species that aggregate in fixed localities. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.74682551,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,56,NA

Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km2) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with the autumn-winter krill fishery. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.745451224,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,52,NA

Abundance patterns of 3 species of pelagic secondary producers were analyzed for trends, cycles, range extensions or shifts in the location of highest density, and for changes in population dynamics over a 16 yr period (1993-2008). Species analyzed represented different hydrographic regimes and are known to have contrasting responses to seasonal sea ice dynamics: krill Euphausia superba, seasonal sea ice zone; tunicates Salpa thompsoni, warmer waters with minimal sea ice; and larval Antarctic silver-fish Pleuragramma antarcticum, cold continental shelf waters. Cycles were observed in grid-wide abundance and recruitment for E. superba. Maximum grid-wide densities did not decrease, but the location of highest densities shifted southward 200 km, away from Ad√©lie penguin rookeries at the northern end. A distinct change post-1999 was apparent in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of S. thompsoni. Mixtures of krill and salps became common, but neither peak densities nor the frequency of peak years for salps increased. As with Antarctic krill, highest salp densities shifted southward alongshore. Larval P. antarcticum were abundant in the northern coastal region in the early 1990s, but virtually disappeared in that region after 1999/2000. Possible mechanisms underlying these observations include the southerly movement of the sea ice edge during spring, changes in proximity of source populations (salps), and changes in transport pathways (larval P. antarcticum).

Using existing techniques it is possible to estimate the quantity and size‚Äêclasses of each fish or invertebrate species consumed by seals and to compare this with the commercial catch. If fishing mortality is known, these estimates can be used to calculate the level of mortality imposed by the seals. However, a realistic evaluation requires information on the distribution and movements of the fish, the seals' feeding effort, and the fisheries effort in time and space. At present it is difficult or impossible to obtain this information, but recent technological developments in telemetry equipment will soon make it feasible. To assess the economic effects of changes in seal numbers on the fishery, or the ecological effects of changes in fisheries effort on seal populations, requires additional information on the responses of the fishery and the seals to changes in fish abundance, and of the commercial market to changes in the supply of fish.

The shelf catch has been taken mainly in depths greater than 800 m from three localised fishing grounds of deep water off Terra Nova Bay, Ross Island, and in the south of small-scale research unit (SSRU) 881L (adjacent to the Ross Ice Shelf). The catch rates from the exploratory longline fishery typically show high temporal and spatial variability, even between consecutive sets within the main fishing grounds. Most toothfish caught in the southern Ross Sea were sub-adult and maturing fish, typically ranging from 60-130 cm in length, with some evidence for an ontogenetic migration from east to west as they grow. From the fisheries data available, there is no evidence for a northward contraction in the range of D. mawsoni over the course of the fishery.

Antarctic krill also predominated by reconstructed mass, except during 1994 and 1998 when penguins were the most important prey, and during 1995 when fish dominated.

This requires modelling the uncertainty in such processes as predator life history, seasonal abundance and movement, size-based predation, energetic requirements, and prey vulnerability. We combined these uncertainties to evaluate the predatory impact of transient leopard seals on a community of mesopredators (seals and penguins) and their prey at South Georgia, and assess the implications for an ecosystem-based management. The mesopredators are highly dependent on Antarctic krill and icefish, which are targeted by regional fisheries. We used a state-space formulation to combine (1) a mark-recapture open-population model and individual identification data to assess seasonally variable leopard seal arrival and departure dates, numbers, and residency times; (2) a size-based bioenergetic model; and (3) a size-based prey choice model from a diet analysis. Our models indicated that prey choice and consumption reflected seasonal changes in leopard seal population size and structure, size-selective predation and prey vulnerability. A population of 104 (90-125) leopard seals, of which 64% were juveniles, consumed less than 2% of the Antarctic fur seal pup production of the area (50% of total ingested energy, IE), but ca. 12-16% of the local gentoo penguin population (20% IE). Antarctic krill (28% IE) were the only observed food of leopard seal pups and supplemented the diet of older individuals. Direct impacts on krill and fish were negligible, but the ""escapement"" due to leopard seal predation on fur seal pups and penguins could be significant for the mackerel icefish fishery at South Georgia. These results suggest that: (1) rare apex predators like leopard seals may control, and may depend on, populations of mesopredators dependent on prey species targeted by fisheries; and (2) predatory impacts and community control may vary throughout the predator's geographic range, and differ across ecosystems and management areas, depending on the seasonal abundance of the prey and the predator's dispersal movements. This understanding is important to integrate the predator needs as natural mortality of its prey in models to set prey catch limits for fisheries. Reliable estimates of the variability of these needs are essential for a precautionary interpretation in the context of an ecosystem-based management. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.736209327,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,67,NA

Nearly 1 month was devoted to bottom trawling for fishes on the shelf and upper slope (to 1,000 m) areas around Shag Rocks, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet√∏ya. The focus was on the latter two locations, because their faunas are more poorly known. Eight species were collected at Shag Rocks with Patagonotothen guntheri most abundant; 17 at South Georgia with Lepidonotothen nudifrons, L. larseni and Gobionotothen gibberifrons most abundant; 13 at the South Sandwich Islands with L. larseni, L. nudifrons and G. gibberifrons most abundant; and 11 at Bouvet√∏ya with L. larseni, Macrourus holotrachys and L. squamifrons most abundant. Ten new locality records were established: Shag Rocks (1), South Georgia (1), South Sandwich Islands (5), South Sandwich Trench at 5,350 m (1) and Bouvet√∏ya (2). Total known demersal fish diversity on the shelf and upper slope at Shag Rocks/South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet√∏ya is 42, 31 and 17 species, respectively. To examine population structure in the four most abundant notothenioids at Bouvet√∏ya (L. larseni, L. squamifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and Chaenocephalus aceratus), we examined the ND2 portion of mitochondrial DNA. Chaenocephalus aceratus, N. coriiceps and L. larseni exhibited no significant genetic differentiation in comparison with samples from localities in the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, L. squamifrons showed significant genetic differentiation between the South Shetlands and Bouvet√∏ya populations (F ST = 0.189, P = 0.015). Thus, these data combined with previous studies of two other notothenioids suggest that five of the six notothenioid species at Bouvet√∏ya are not genetically differentiated from other localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The location of Bouvet√∏ya within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the long (1-2 years) pelagic stages of the notothenioids at Bouvet√∏ya may be at least partly responsible for this genetic homogeneity. ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.728592161,0,NA,NA,5,NA,0,5,1,NA

One view ascribes it to an increase in availability of their prey brought on by the decrease in baleen whale stocks. The contrary opinion, attributes it to environmental warming. This causes a gradual decrease in the frequency of cold years with extensive winter sea ice cover. A number of penguin monitoring programs are in progress and are expected to provide some answers to these questions. Unfortunately, it is not easy to distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic change since penguins are easily accessible predators of krill and the feeding range of the penguins has almost overlapped with the krill fishery in time and space in the last four decades. Therefore it is important to reconstruct the change of ancient penguin abundance and distribution in the absence of human activity. Many efforts have focused on surveying the abandoned penguin rookeries, but this method has not been able to give a continuous historical record of penguin populations. In several recent studies, ancient penguin excreta was scooped from the penguin relics in the sediments of the lake on penguin rookery, Ardley Island, maritime Antarctica. In these studies, penguin droppings or guano soil deposited in the lake and changes in sediment geochemistry have been used to calculate penguin population changes based upon the geochemical composition of the sediment core. The results suggest that climate change has a significant impact on penguin populations.",Article,Scopus,0.728037947,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,102,NA

Data from 13 demersal trawl surveys conducted over a 20-year period were analysed. Abundance of the 1+ juvenile fish cohort (13-15 month old dependent on survey date) was found to vary inter-annually and was found to be inversely correlated with the sea surface temperature (SST) conditions experienced by adults prior to spawning. Environmental temperatures experienced by toothfish eggs and larvae were not significantly correlated with juvenile density. The mean length of 1+ fish attained after 13-15 months was higher in years of high juvenile abundance and was significantly inversely correlated with SST in the summer prior to adult spawning. Trends in toothfish recruitment variability mirrored those previously observed in a range of krill-dependent land-based predators at South Georgia for whom non-seasonal, large-scale climatic events such as El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are considered the most likely underlying drivers of variability in breeding success. The drivers of recruitment variability in toothfish are not fully understood but a range of possible mechanisms are considered.

Two survey areas were sampled focussed on Marguerite Bay in the south, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the north. Data from 177 stations showed that the highest concentrations of krill were found in the southern sampling area. Differences between areas were associated with a few large catches of one year old krill found in anomalously warm and productive waters in Marguerite Bay, and small krill catches in the less-productive, offshore waters in the north. Estimated krill density across the survey area was 3.4krillm-2, and was low compared to the long-term average of 45krillm-2 for the Elephant Island area. Overall recruitment between the two survey regions was similar, but per capita recruitment was about 60% lower than historical mean recruitment levels measured at Elephant Island since the late 1970s. Demographic patterns showed small krill concentrated near the coast, and large krill concentrated offshore on the shelf and slope all along the survey area. The offshore distribution of adult krill was delineated by the warm (~1¬∞C), low salinity (33.8) water at 30m, suggesting that most krill were present shoreward of the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Distributions of larvae indicated that three hotspot areas were important for the production of krill: slope areas outside Marguerite Bay and north of the South Shetland Islands, and near the coast around Antarctic Sound. Successful spawning, as inferred from larval abundance, was roughly coincident with the shelf break and not with inshore waters. Given the rapid changes in climate along the Antarctic Peninsula and the lower per capita recruitment observed in recent years, studies comparing and contrasting production, growth, and recruitment across the Peninsula will be critical to better understand how climate change will impact krill populations and their dependent predators in the Scotia Sea. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.726992971,0,NA,NA,5,NA,0,5,3,NA

Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Vald√©s, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. ¬© 2005 Mammal Society.",Review,Scopus,0.726245649,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,54,NA

The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change. ¬© 2010 Inter-Research.",Article,Scopus,0.724651653,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,32,NA

Published data on field metabolic rate, population size, diet, prey energy content, and metabolic efficiency were used to estimate prey requirements of these breeding, adult, land-based predators and their dependent offspring.

However, the effects of these factors on species distribution and abundance at sea are still poorly understood, particularly in marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Using a unique long-term data set of at-sea observations, we tested for interdecadal (1980s vs. 2000s) changes in summer abundance and distribution of 12 species of Albatrosses and Petrels along a 30¬∞ latitudinal gradient between tropical and Antarctic waters of the southern Indian Ocean. There were contrasting effects of climate change on subantarctic seabird distribution and abundance at sea. While subtropical waters showed the highest rate of warming, the species that visited this water mass showed the greatest changes in distribution and abundance. The abundance of Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) and Giant Petrels (Macronectes sp.) declined markedly, whereas the other species showed contrasting trends or did not change. With the exception of the White-chinned Petrel, these decreases were at least partly related to regional increase in sea surface temperature. The southward shift of Wandering Albatross and Prions (Pachyptila spp.) distributions could be ascribed to species redistribution or decrease in abundance due to warming of the subtropical waters. Surprisingly, White-chinned Petrel distribution shifted northward, suggesting more complex mechanisms. This study is the first to document a shift in species range in the Southern Ocean related to climate change and contrasting abundance changes. It suggests that some species might experience more severe impacts from climate change depending on the water masses they visit. As climate changes are predicted to continue in the next decades, understanding species responses to climate change is crucial for conservation management, especially when their conservation status is critical or unknown. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.716317044,1,NA,NA,5,NA,1,5,11,NA

Marion Island (southern Indian Ocean) hosts the largest sympatric breeding populations of these two species. Environmental and population changes here over two decades may have influenced their diet and trophic interactions. To quantify diet, we analysed prey remains in scat samples from Antarctic (661 scats) and Subantarctic (750 scats) fur seals collected at Marion Island (2006‚Äì2010). We assessed diet composition over time and calculated dietary overlap. The diet of both species was dominated by fish prey (98.2% and 99.4% of prey items), mainly myctophids. Antarctic fur seals consumed small numbers of penguins, cephalopods and crustaceans. In Subantarctic fur seal scats, crustaceans and cephalopods were rare and penguin remains were absent. The diets of the two species overlapped substantially (Pianka‚Äôs index¬†=¬†0.98), however, small but significant differences in the relative proportions of prey were evident. Seasonal and annual diet changes suggest that their diet is similarly influenced by patterns of local prey availability and abundance.

Data on total length, condition and catch per unit effort (CPUE) were derived from the¬†>¬†5500 fish caught, the large majority of which were measured, tagged and released. Contrary to expectation, the length frequency of the McMurdo Sound catch was dominated by fish in the upper two-thirds of the overall distribution exhibited in the industrial catch for the Ross Sea shelf. Fish length and condition increased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s and then decreased. Fish length positively correlated with Ross Sea ice extent in early spring, a relationship possibly caused by more ice encouraging larger fish to move farther south over the shelf and into the study area. Fish condition positively correlated with the amount of open water in the Ross Sea during the previous summer (Feb), perhaps reflecting greater availability of prey with the higher productivity that more open water brings. Decreasing fish size corresponds to the onset of the fishery, which targets the large individuals. CPUE was constant through 2001 and then decreased dramatically. We hypothesize that this decrease is related to the industrial fishery, which began in the 1996-97 austral summer, and concentrates effort over the ice-free Ross Sea continental slope. As a result of limited prey choices and close coupling among mesopredators of the region, Antarctic toothfish included, the fishery appears to be dramatically altering the trophic structure of the Ross Sea. ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.709241083,1,NA,NA,5,NA,,,7,1

N. delesserti is the most abundant macro-invertebrate on the shores of Marion Island. Mean densities in the intertidal boulder fields and in the subtidal zone are 936 and 158¬∑m-2, respectively, with an overall mean of 209¬∑m-2 and peak densities of 3866 and 1700¬∑m-2 in the intertidal and subtidal zones. In subtidal areas where it exceeds ‚âà500¬∑m-2 N. delesserti forms stacks or towers throughout the year, up to 42 being found one on top of the other. Mean biomass was 86.7g¬∑m-2 and production 96.5g¬∑m-2¬∑yr-1, both an order of magnitude higher than previously described for any Antarctic or sub-Antarctic limpet. The main diet of N. delesserti is algal spores and sporelings, although it also grazes on the fronds of attached macroalgae. Loose fronds of the kelp Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso in Choris) Hariot and other algae are also eaten and are probably important in sustaining the dense limpet populations. Both diet and habitat are very broad and unspecialized, probably related to the fact that Nacella delesserti is the only large invertebrate grazer on the shores of the island. Limpets held in cages and fed kelp fronds provided data on grazing rates, growth, and assimilation efficiency. Assimilation efficiency ranged from 0.14 in small limpets to 0.06 in large animals. N. delesserti is estimated to consume 779 g dry algal material¬∑m-2¬∑yr-1, and plays a major r√¥le in controlling algal distribution and abundance. Growth of free-living animals was calculated from the Von Bertalanffy equation. N. delesserti reaches ‚âà35 mm in the first year of growth, attaining 60 mm after ‚âà5 yr and living for a maximum of 8 to 10 yr. In the nearshore region mortality is ‚âà75% per annum in the first 1.5 yr, dropping to 40% in animals of 1.5 to 5 yr old and 15% in older limpets. The rolling of boulders is a major but unquantified source of mortality in the intertidal and shallow inshore areas. Size-specific predation by the fish Notothenia coriiceps (Richardson), starfish Anasterias rupicola (Verrill) and kelp gull Larus dominicus (Lichtenstein) accounts for, respectively, 15 to 30, 40, and 20% mortality per annum, and Nacella delesserti constitutes 27, 90, and 45% of their respective diets. Limpets with shell lengths between 25 and 50 mm are particularly vulnerable, those „Äâ50 mm attaining a relative refuge from predation. As a herbivore and prey species, N. delesserti is clearly a key species in the nearshore and intertidal zone of Marion Island. ¬© 1985.",Article,Scopus,0.703815842,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,165,NA

Protomyctophum bolini was the most abundant species of the genus encountered throughout the Scotia Sea with the greatest concentrations occurring around the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). This species had a life cycle of 2+years, but spatial differences in population structure were apparent as the I-group was absent from all regions south of the APF, suggesting that the species does not recruit in the Scotia Sea. Protomyctophum tenisoni occurred mostly in waters characteristic of the APF and was absent from the southern Scotia Sea. It had a limited size range, but there was clear size-related sexual dimorphism with males significantly larger than females. The species had a life cycle of c. 2years, but the I-group (c. 1year old, 1 November to 31 October the next year) occurred only in regions close to the APF suggesting that recruitment is restricted to these waters. A seasonal southward migration for P. choriodon is likely as the species occurred mostly to the south-west of South Georgia in summer, but extended to the sea-ice sectors in autumn. Protomyctophum choriodon had a life cycle of 4+years in the Scotia Sea and the population was dominated by age classes >3years old. Larval stages were absent during the surveys for all species. Diurnal variations in vertical distribution were apparent for all three species.

Several migratory types were revealed for species belonging to either temperate or sub-Antarctic faunas. Despite high productivity, only a few large nektonic predators spend their entire life cycle on the eastern Patagonian Shelf and use only a small proportion of the meso-nektonic resource. Most of the resource is exploited by non-resident nektonic migrants, which move to the area from distant spawning grounds. Pelagic and demersal sharks and skates, the squid Illex argentinus, tunas and gadoids migrate to the eastern part of the Patagonian Shelf to feed at different times of the year; arriving in seasonal waves according to their life cycle and spawning seasonality. Some deepwater fishes and squid migrate onto the shelf as juveniles to harvest the resource, and then return to deepwater habitat as adults. It is hypothesized that the large biomass of meso-planktonic and meso-nektonic consumers prevents most higher-trophic level predators from establishing spawning populations in this area, as their larvae and fry would be overwhelmed by predation. Instead, the higher-trophic level predators establish spawning and nursery grounds elsewhere and arrive to feed on the meso-planktonic and meso-nektonic resources after they have outgrown their own stages of predation vulnerability. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

A total of 62 trawls were completed during four separate cruises in the austral fall (April-June) and winter (July-September) of 2001 and 2002. Crustaceans dominated the system in both seasons, accounting for 32 of the 55 species captured in the fall and 30 of the 48 species captured in winter. In both seasons, a very few species made up the majority of the catch. In the fall, the euphausiids Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia superba, and Thysanoessa macrura, and the mysid Antarctomysis ohlinii numerically dominated the assemblage, contributing over 85% of the total. In the winter, the same three euphausiids and the chaetognath Pseudosagitta gazellae were the numerical dominants, comprising over 90% of the catch. A significant increase in total abundance and biomass was observed from 2001 to 2002. The invertebrate micronekton/macrozooplankton communities found in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP were a mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna: a direct result of local hydrographic conditions. Near the shelf break and in the outer reaches of the Marguerite Trough, a deep canyon transecting the shelf in a south-southeast direction, the communities were more diverse, dominated by oceanic species such as Euphausia triacantha, Salpa thompsoni, and Themisto gaudichaudi. The assemblages present in the nearshore fjords exhibited lower diversity and were dominated by neritic species such as E. crystallorophias and A. ohlinii. At the mid-shelf and mid-trough locations, the assemblages were composed of a variable mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna. The faunal mixing and overall species composition in those areas is the result of episodic Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions onto the shelf via deep bathymetric features such as the Marguerite Trough. Species diversity and integrated abundance for the upper 200. m of the water column were similar between seasons in the WAP study region, but integrated biomass was nearly three times greater in fall than in winter. Integrated estimates from the WAP study region were similar to those from other studies conducted in the Scotia and Weddell Seas, but were orders of magnitude lower than estimates from a study in Croker Passage, primarily due to a large catch of E. superba. In contrast, species diversity in the WAP was higher than recorded in any of the previously mentioned studies, which is due to the mixing of typical oceanic fauna with endemic nearshore fauna. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.699533636,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,85,NA

Four survey methods were employed as part of a multi-species research programme to develop methods for surveying marine mammals and seabird populations in aquaculture management areas. Two of the techniques, involving continuous timelapse photography of mussel farms and boat-based surveys through coastal farms were developed for this study. Timelapse cameras showed that mussel farms buoys were used by king shags as temporary resting sites only. King shags were recorded on 36% of the farms (n = 44) from 13 surveys within inner Admiralty Bay. The low number of sightings within mussel farms suggests that farms are not important foraging or resting areas for king shags, at least in Admiralty Bay. The foraging range and density of king shags was not known before farms were developed, so no direct comparison or impact assessment can be made. Boat-based surveys were used to estimate the density of foraging shags, which showed that daily locations of foraging birds at sea can vary considerably on consecutive days and over the season. Previous environmental surveys to assess impacts of mussel farms on foraging areas are therefore unlikely to adequately represent the entire foraging range or most important feeding areas. The number of breeding pairs, chicks and nests was also found to vary considerably at colonies, dependent on when counts were undertaken during their protracted breeding season. Open water mid-bay aquaculture (shellfish and finfish) potentially poses a greater threat to king shags than 'coastal ribbon development', in terms of loss of open water habitat from farm structures, and loss of foraging habitat through modification to the water column (e.g., turbidity) and seabed. Given the lack of knowledge about the king shag population dynamics, diet and prey availability, there is an urgent requirement for more research to fill these gaps and also understand how we can conserve important shag feeding areas and associated marine environment through sustainable management of aquaculture. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.696126615,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,59,NA

Studies on the relationship between seabirds and this activity are fundamental for the ecology and conservation biology of these birds. This study examined the composition and structure of the seasonal seabird assemblages attending the artisanal longline fishing activities in channels of the Southeast Pacific, Chile. Fieldwork was carried-out during summer (Cook Bay), winter (Felix Lighthouse), and spring (Gulf Xaultegua) of 2008. Ten species were associated with fishing activities. The most common seabird species observed during the year were the Black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys and the Southern giant-petrel Macronectes giganteus. The seasonal structure of the assemblages presented differences between summer and winter. In terms of abundance, Black-browed albatrosses presented the highest contribution to the assemblage in summer (87.5%). During winter the Kelp gull Larus dominicanus showed the highest contribution (47.7%) while the Black-browed albatross abundance decreased to 9.1%. Black-browed albatross was the species with the highest index of relative importance within the assemblies, but is also a species with the conservation status 'endangered'. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain constant monitoring of the interaction between seabirds and artisanal longline fishing activities of sub-Antarctic environments.",Article,Scopus,0.695106049,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,73,NA

At a large spatial scale, most relevant differences between the scallop populations are linked to their depth distributions. The McMurdo and Wood Bay populations show a shallower bathymetric distribution with maximum abundance between 5 and 15 m depth. In contrast, inside Terra Nova Bay, at sites with similar near-shore bathymetric profiles, the maximum biomass is found between 40 and 70 m. This difference can be related to the different ice-cover persistency characterising these two areas, being less at Terra Nova Bay than in the other localities. Differences arise also in the reproductive period: at McMurdo, it seems to occur early in the austral spring, while at Terra Nova Bay, mature females are observed at the beginning of February. Also at a small scale, in sites only a few miles from each other, the population structures inside Terra Nova Bay and Wood Bay vary in terms of abundance and size frequency distribution, suggesting various environmental and biological constraints. Among environmental factors, bottom features (slope, sediment grain size, organic content) and water-column food supply during the summer months may be considered. In addition, as Adamussium is preyed upon by starfishes and fishes, its abundance and population structure may be affected by predators and their abundance.",Review,Scopus,0.691577595,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,96,NA

We suggest ways to reduce errors in age determination and to improve methods of obtaining and presenting growth data. Generalized von Bertalanffy growth equations are promoted as a basis for analysing species differences and intra‚Äêpopulation variation in body lengths. Indices other than blubber thickness may be better for following body condition. Catch‚Äêeffort and survival‚Äêindex methods of estimating abundances have limited applicability, total counts are only locally useful, and sample counts may only be accurate for scattered, ice‚Äêbreeding species. Some new techniques for population indices are promising. Pre‚Äêadult mortality remains difficult to assess. Although not always recognized, adult mortality rates do increase with age, as well described by Gompertz functions. Existing estimates of lifespans are unreliable, and a new approach is outlined. There are methodological problems in estimating ages of maturity. Corpora albicantia should not be used for back‚Äêextrapolation, and more study is needed of use of teeth annuli as indicators of maturity. Age‚Äêspecific proportions of females parous based on reproductive tracts may disagree with proportions recruited in breeding groups, suggesting that the former may often be in error. Allometric relationships among body sizes and life‚Äêhistory variables need more reliable data, especially since the residuals of such relationships are of greatest interest. Brain size may be a better scalar. Direct evidence of density dependence in population growth of seals is sparse. Early survival has been more widely shown to be density‚Äêdependent, but only among polygynous species where crowding on land may be a byproduct of sexual selection; there is as yet no good evidence of trophic restraints. Evidence of density dependence of ages of maturity is generally unconvincing. Predation, especially by sharks, may be critical in some species. Characteristics of equilibrium populations might profitably be sought in mass remains in middens and historic kill sites. More attention should be paid to the search for density‚Äêindependent influences. Supposed impacts of fisheries and pollutions are not wholly convincing. Natural epidemics may keep some populations below resource or space saturation, and some high‚Äêlatitude species may show large year‚Äêto‚Äêyear variations in recruitment and abundances. Evidence for such density‚Äêindependent effects should be sought in residuals of growth curves and in teeth layers. Although surplus yield and production/biomass models have been tried, realistic pinniped models must be completely age‚Äêstructured and time‚Äêdependent. Simple models have questionably assumed stationarity to derive life‚Äêhistory parameters. The best available estimates of density dependence of such parameters give no resolution when extrapolated toward equilibrium, and only limited efforts have been made to introduce stochasticity. Better data, not improved model structures, are needed for better understanding. Recent work has contradicted the assumed voraciousness of seals, but their system impacts and dependencies are not well understood. Extended Lotka‚ÄêVolterra equations used to model Antarctic food webs, including seals, are merely heuristic. Fixed seal biomasses enter as top‚Äêdown, driving functions in a Bering Sea model, which accordingly cannot be used to analyse or manage their populations. Some Soviet models are tantalizing but ill‚Äêspecified. The introduction of harbor seals in well‚Äêchosen lakes might give mote insights into system roles than would more elaborate modelling. We wonder if pinniped ecology is well served by too many enthusiasts operating under too many restraints. Copyright ¬© 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

To date there is little known about larvaceans in the Southern Ocean and their ecological role. This paper details a Larvacean survey conducted during the BROKE-West voyage (Jan-Mar 2006) to the southwest Indian Ocean sector of the East Antarctic margin between 30 and 80¬∞E and 60 and 70¬∞S. Larvacean abundances were quantified from three sampling devices: a ring net with 150-Œºm mesh and cross-sectional area of 0.8 m2; a Rectangular Mid-Water Trawl (RMT1) with 300-Œºm mesh and a nominal cross-sectional area of 1 m2; and a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) with a 270-Œºm mesh and a 1.6-cm2 cross-sectional area. The samples collected from the ring net were identified to the species level using stereo dissecting microscopes and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The survey revealed two species: Oikopleura gaussica and Fritillaria drygalski. The abundance of both species increased from &lt;1 ind. m-3 to 5.8 ind. m-3 as the survey progressed from west to east and decreased from 5.8 ind. m-3 in the north to 2 ind. m-3 in the south until the shelf region and marginal sea-ice zone where abundances increased to 4 ind. m-3. Statistically significant relationships were identified between abundance and latitude in samples from the RMT1 and Ring net. There was also a relationship between the larvacean abundance from the RMT1 and longitude. Although larvacean distribution and abundance patterns appeared to agree with the large-scale oceanographic boundaries of the survey area, there were no statistically significant relationships between larvacean abundance and any physical oceanography parameters. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

CPUE underestimates variations in relative abundance when gross effort data are only measured in total operating days. Gross effort includes both searching time and handling time, but only searching time is useful for an index of abundance. A method is developed for estimating searching time by subtracting a maximum likelihood estimate of handling time from the gross effort. An expectation maximization (E-M) algorithm is used to combine maximum likelihood estimates of the handling time with the expected additional operating time due to handling the last catch of each day. Simulation tests show that the estimates of catch per unit of searching time (C/CSW) are much closer to proportionally related to local density than gross CPUE. Estimates of handling time are not unbiased, and some nonlinearity between local density and C/CSW may persist.

They have made large investments in this enterprise since the so-called moratorium on commercial whaling was adopted by the International Whaling Commission in 1982. These include, but are not confined to, state subsidizing of an expanding and diversifying 20-year programme of commercial whaling under provisions in all relevant international agreements since 1937 that permit unlimited and unilaterally decreed whaling, supposedly for scientific purposes, provided that the commodities from the whales killed are fully utilized. The context of this is the monopoly of technical knowledge, special skills and the market for valuable whale-meat that Japanese enterprises acquired in the post-world war II period, having broken - in 1937 - the strongly defended de facto Anglo-Norwegian monopoly of technology, skills, access to Antarctic whaling grounds and the market for whale-oil that had existed until then. The attraction of 'scientific whaling' is not only that it by-passes any internationally agreed catch-limits but that it also circumvents all other rules - many dating fr/om the League of Nations whaling convention of 1931 - regarding protected species, closed areas, killing of juveniles, less inhumane killing methods, etc. The groundwork is being laid to justify that resumed whaling on partially recovered whale stocks will be at the unsustainable levels that will be profitable again. This justification is based on spurious assertions that numerous and hungry whales threaten the world's fisheries, and that the abundance and possible increase in some whale species is impeding the recovery of other, severely depleted, and potentially more valuable species such as the blue whale. If the scenario presented here is correct it has important implications for attempts by the international community either to bring a negotiated end to commercial whaling or to bring all whaling back under international control, as the international law of the sea requires, and to ensure that any permitted exploitation of recovered whale populations will be sustainable, under a precautionary regime. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An initial survey was carried out around South Georgia during December 1926 and January 1927 to describe the distribution of plankton during the summer, and to serve as a baseline against which to compare future surveys. We have reanalysed phytoplankton and zooplankton data from this survey and elucidated patterns of community distribution and compared them with our recent understanding of the ecosystem based on contemporary data. Analysis of Discovery data identified five groups of stations with characteristic phytoplankton communities which were almost entirely consistent with the original analysis conducted by [Hardy A.C., Gunther, E.R., 1935. The plankton of the South Georgia whaling grounds and adjacent waters 1926-1927. Discovery Report 11, 1-456]. Major groupings were located at the western end of the island and over the northern shelf where Corethron spp. were dominant, and to the south and east where a more diverse flora included high abundances of Nitzschia seriata. Major zooplankton-station groupings were located over the inner shelf which was characterised by a high abundance of Drepanopus forcipatus and in oceanic water &gt;500 m deep that were dominated by Foraminifera, Oithona spp., Ctenocalanus vanus, and Calanoides acutus. Stations along the middle and outer shelf regions to the north and west, were characterised by low overall abundance. There was some evidence that groupings of stations to the north of the island originated in different water masses on either side of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, the major frontal system in the deep ocean close to South Georgia. However, transect lines during 1926/1927 did not extend far enough offshore to sample this frontal region adequately. Interannual variability of zooplankton abundance was assessed from stations which were sampled repeatedly during seven recent British Antarctic Survey cruises (1995-2005) to the region and following taxonomic harmonization and numerical standardization (ind. m-3), a subset of 45 taxonomic categories of zooplankton (species and higher taxa) from 1926/1927, were compared with similar data obtained during the BAS cruises using a linear model. Initially comparisons were restricted to BAS stations that lay within 40 km of Discovery stations although a comparison was also made using all available data. Despite low abundance values in 1926/1927, in neither comparison did Discovery data differ significantly from BAS data. Calculation of the percentage similarity index across cruises did not reveal any systematic differences in species composition between 1926 and 1927 and the present. In the light of ocean warming trends, the existence of more subtle changes in species composition is not ruled out, but an absence of finely resolved time-series data make this impossible to determine. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Two analysis strategies simulated the effects of historic baleen and odontocete whale abundances across all trophic levels: food web structure scenarios and time-dynamic scenarios. Direct competition between whales and commercial fisheries is small at current whale abundances; whales and fisheries each take similar proportions of annual pelagic fish production (4-7%). Scenarios show that as whale populations grow, indirect competition between whales and fish for zooplankton would more likely impact fishery production than would direct competition for fish between whales and commercial fisheries. Increased baleen whale abundance would have greater and broader indirect effects on upper trophic levels and fisheries than a similar increase in odontocete abundance. Time-dynamic scenarios, which allow for the evolution of compensatory mechanisms, showed more modest impacts than structural scenarios, which show the immediate impacts of altered energy pathways.Structural scenarios show that in terms of energy availability, there is potential for large increases in whale abundance without major changes to existing food web structures and without substantial reduction of fishery production. For each ecosystem, a five-fold increase in baleen whale abundance could be supported with minor disruptions to existing energy flow pathways. However, such an increase would remain below historical population levels for many cetaceans. A larger expansion (20X) could be accommodated only with large reductions in energy flow to competitor groups. The scope for odontocete expansion varies between ecosystems but may be more restricted than the scope for baleen expansion because they feed at higher, less productive trophic levels. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.677427771,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,64,NA

The background to the hypothesis of a krill surplus in the mid-20th century is described, and the information on population and trend levels that has become available since the postulate was first advanced is discussed. The objective of the study is to determine whether predator-prey interactions alone can broadly explain observed population trends without the need for recourse to environmental change hypotheses. A model is developed including krill, four baleen whale (blue, fin, humpback and minke) and two seal (Antarctic fur and crabeater) species. The model commences in 1780 (the onset of fur seal harvests) and distinguishes the Atlantic/Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean in view of the much larger past harvests in the former. A reference case and six sensitivities are fitted to available data on predator abundances and trends, and the plausibility of the results and the assumptions on which they are based is discussed, together with suggested further areas for investigation. Amongst the key inferences of the study are that: (i) species interaction effects alone can explain observed predator abundance trends, though not without some difficulty; (ii) it is necessary to consider other species, in addition to baleen whales and krill, to explain observed trends - crabeater seals seemingly play an important role and constitute a particular priority for improved abundance and trend information; (iii) the Atlantic/Indian Ocean sector shows major changes in species abundances, in contrast to the Pacific Ocean sector, which is much more stable; (iv) baleen whales have to be able to achieve relatively high growth rates to explain observed trends; and (v) Laws' (1977) estimate of some 150 million tonnes for the krill surplus may be appreciably too high as a result of his calculations omitting consideration of density-dependent effects in feeding rates.",Article,Scopus,0.671234642,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,137,NA

Inshore, the ecological role of demersal fish is more important than that of krill. There, demersal fish are major consumers of benthos and also feed on zooplankton (mainly krill in summer). They are links between lower and upper levels of the food web and are common prey of other fish, birds and seals. Offshore, demersal fish depend less on benthos and feed more on zooplankton (mainly krill) and nekton, and are less accessible as prey of birds and seals. There, pelagic fish (especially lantern fish) are more abundant than inshore and play an important role in the energy flow from macrozooplankton to higher trophic levels (seabirds and seals). Through the higher fish predators, energy is transferred to land in the form of fish remains, pellets (birds), regurgitation and faeces (birds and seals). However, in the general context of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, krill (Euphausia superba) plays the central role in the food web because it is the main food source in terms of biomass for most of the high level predators from demersal fish up to whales. This has no obvious equivalent in other marine ecosystems. In Antarctic offshore coastal and oceanic waters the greatest proportion of energy from the ecosystem is transferred to land directly through krill consumers, such as flying birds, penguins, and seals. Beside krill, the populations of fish in the Antarctic Ocean are the second most important element for higher predators, in particular the energy-rich pelagic Myctophidae in open waters and the pelagic Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the high Antarctic zone. Although the occurrence of these pelagic fish inshore has been poorly documented, their abundance in neritic waters could be higher than previously believed.",Review,Scopus,0.67079463,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,148,NA

Three different artificial collectors were evaluated: smooth-surface panels, panels covered with synthetic lawn and ballasted plastic boxes filled with remains of fishing nets. In addition, plankton samples were taken monthly and water salinity and temperature were recorded. Between July 2006 and June 2007, the collectors were deployed monthly in the subtidal zone of two nearby localities and collected two months later. The recovered crabs were classified into four stages: settlers, recruits, advanced juveniles and mature crabs. There were differences in the presence of stages among collector types and seasons but not between localities. Settlers and recruits were abundant on the panels with synthetic lawn, while late juvenile and mature females were more frequent in the boxes. Larval stages occur between July and February, and only zoeas I and II were found. The males, which were only represented by early juveniles, were exclusively found on the panels with synthetic lawn, from where they would subsequently migrate to cryptic habitats such as the holdfast of Macrocystis pyrifera. Settlement occurs between September and April. Settlers showed a peak in abundance during November-December, while the recruits showed two peaks, one in December and the other in February-March. For late juveniles, the maximum abundance was recorded in April-May. Ovigerous females were found between May and September, when the experiment ended. Settlement and recruitment of H. planatus in Golfo San Jorge occur over a prolonged period. Individuals may undergo shifts in microhabitat use during this period, probably related to the search for food and shelter, and avoidance of predation and cannibalism. ¬© 2010 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",Article,Scopus,0.666526306,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,91,NA

Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.661831378,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,145,NA

Estimates of penguin abundance are important for developing marine ecosystem models and assessing potential competition between penguins and fisheries operations. 2. Most shipboard surveys of penguins use strip transect (ST) or conventional distance sampling (CDS) methods to estimate abundance, but the assumptions of these methods are largely untested. To test their validity for surveys of Ad√©lie penguins in the Antarctic pack-ice, we recorded mark-recapture line-transect data and estimated detectability using a point-independence (PI) analysis. 3. Contrary to ST assumptions, detectability declined markedly with distance from the transect line and varied with group size, substrate and observer position. Estimated detection probabilities across a 300-m strip width, which has frequently been used in shipboard surveys, ranged from 0.09 for single penguins in water to 0.91 for groups of > 5 penguins on ice floes. 4. Contrary to CDS assumptions, only two-thirds of detections close to the transect line by one observer team were detected by the second team. Estimated detection probabilities on the transect line ranged from 0.30 for single penguins in water to 0.92 for large groups of penguins on ice. 5. Synthesis and applications. Most shipboard surveys have not accounted for incomplete detection, potentially resulting in large negative biases that may vary between surveys. Recent theoretical improvements provide the potential for these biases to be addressed, but this requires application of more sophisticated and rigorous survey protocols. Application of PI analysis to mark-recapture line transect data demonstrated that substantial improvement to abundance estimates could be achieved for penguins compared with previously used methods. The protocols required for PI estimation can be applied to shipboard surveys of slow-moving species such as penguins and seals, but may be difficult to apply to species moving faster than the survey platform, such as flying seabirds. The benefits of multiple observers are maximized only if they operate independently. For multi-species surveys, it would be beneficial to have multiple teams of observers, each focussing on a species group. Improved estimation of marine predator abundance will facilitate the development of more realistic ecosystem models and allow improved management of the impact of fisheries operations on non-target species. ¬© 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.661432537,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,79,NA

Recently, circumpolar krill databases, combined with growth models and revisions in acoustics have made it possible to refine previous estimates. Net-based databases of density and length frequency (KRILLBASE) yield a summer distributional range of ‚àº19√ó10 6km 2 and a mean total abundance of 8√ó10 14 post-larvae with biomass of 379 million tonnes (Mt). These values are based on a standardised net sampling method but they average over the period 1926-2004, during which krill abundance has fluctuated. To estimate krill biomass at the end of last century we combined the KRILLBASE map of relative krill density around Antarctica with an acoustics-derived biomass estimate of 37.3Mt derived for the Scotia Sea area in 2000 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Thus the CCAMLR 2000 survey area contains 28% of the total stock, with total biomass of ‚àº133Mt in January-February 2000. Gross postlarval production is estimated conservatively at 342-536Mtyr -1, based on three independent methods. These are high values, within the upper range of recent estimates, but consistent with the concept of high energy throughput for a species of this size. The similarity between the three production estimates reflects a broad agreement between the three growth models used, plus the fact that, for a given population size, production is relatively insensitive to the size distribution of krill at the start of the growth season. These production values lie within the envelope of what can be supported from the Southern Ocean primary production system and what is required to support an estimated predator consumption of 128-470Mtyr -1. Given the range of recent acoustics estimates, plus the need for precautionary management of the developing krill fishery, our net-based data provide an alternative estimate of total krill biomass. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.658550923,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,70,NA

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a significant component of diet for penguins breeding in this region and, consequently, uncertainties regarding penguin population abundances contribute to uncertainties in krill predation estimates. We use a comprehensive database of Antarctic penguin abundances to identify 14 breeding colonies that contribute most significantly to uncertainty regarding the total number of pygoscelid penguins breeding in this region. We find that a high quality survey of Zavodovski Island alone would decrease uncertainty in total population by 24.8%, whereas high quality surveys of all 14 high-influence locations would decrease uncertainty by almost 72%. Updated population estimates at these sites should be considered top priority for future fieldwork in the region. Our results are based on a robust quantitative method for assessing data priorities in estimating krill consumption that is easily extended to other groups of krill predators. ¬© 2012 Antarctic Science Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.657338354,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,114,NA

In spite of their abundance and important role in Antarctic food chains, very little is known of many ecological and biological aspects of this species. A combined trawl and acoustic survey of silverfish was carried out on the western Ross Sea shelf during the New Zealand International Polar Year Census of Antarctic Marine Life research voyage on R.V. Tangaroa in February-March 2008. Multi-frequency acoustic data (12, 38, 70, and 120. kHz) allowed discrimination of silverfish marks from those of krill and other associated species. Mark identification was achieved using targeted midwater trawls. Additional midwater and demersal trawls were carried out at randomly selected locations over the shelf as part of the core biodiversity survey. Silverfish were widely distributed over the Ross Sea shelf. Adult silverfish tended to form layers at 100-400. m depth and were sometimes present close to the bottom, where they were frequently caught in demersal trawls shallower than 500. m. A weak layer at about 80. m depth was associated with juvenile silverfish of 50-80. mm standard length. Acoustic backscatter strength from both silverfish and krill marks increased with increasing frequency (i.e., was highest at 120. kHz), which is characteristic of species without an air-filled swimbladder. Acoustic target strengths (TS) for silverfish at 12, 18, 38, 70, and 120. kHz were estimated from anatomically detailed scattering models based on computed tomography (CT) scans of frozen specimens. The relationship between TS and fish length at 38. kHz was sensitive to estimates of density and sound speed contrast within the fish, especially for small specimens (less than 110. mm SL). Our best estimate of the acoustic biomass of silverfish in the study area was 592. 000. t (95% confidence interval 326. 000-866. 000. t). However, the biomass of juvenile silverfish was highly uncertain due to large differences between TS model results. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.656260345,0,NA,NA,10,NA,0,10,22,NA

In some areas, typically associated with bathymetric features such as shelf edges and canyons, they may aggregate densely to form hotspots. Despite the importance of such hotspots, their development over time in demographic composition and spatial distribution is not well understood. A fishing vessel during regular operation was used for collection of krill demographic and acoustic data on the shelf northwest of South Orkney Islands. Results show a decrease in the proportion of subadult males, partly reflected in an increase in mature adult males. Concurrently, there was a change in the proportion of males in the sampled population from 0.8 to 0.3, indicating immigration or emigration of krill through the hotspot. A clear trend was observed in the diurnal vertical distribution with deeper and more vertically compact swarms during the day. However, some days displayed very small differences between the day and night distribution and considerable variability in the daytime depth distribution. It was noted that although fishing was carried out during the entire period of the study, there was no obvious trend in the acoustic backscatter, suggesting that the overall krill density was not changing during this period.

Evidence for such migrations arises from seasonality of historic whaling catches by latitude, Discovery and natural mark returns, and results of satellite tagging studies. Feeding is generally believed to be limited to the southern polar region, where Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been identified as the primary prey item. Non-migrations and / or suspended migrations to the polar feeding grounds have previously been reported from a summer presence of whales in the Benguela System, where feeding on euphausiids (E. lucens), hyperiid amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii), mantis shrimp (Pterygosquilla armata capensis) and clupeid fish has been described. Three recent research cruises (in October/November 2011, October/November 2014 and October/November 2015) identified large tightly-spaced groups (20 to 200 individuals) of feeding humpback whales aggregated over at least a one-month period across a 220 nautical mile region of the southern Benguela System. Feeding behaviour was identified by lunges, strong milling and repetitive and consecutive diving behaviours, associated bird and seal feeding, defecations and the pungent ""fishy"" smell of whale blows. Although no dedicated prey sampling could be carried out within the tightly spaced feeding aggregations, observations of E. lucens in the region of groups and the full stomach contents of mantis shrimp from both a co-occurring predatory fish species (Thyrsites atun) and one entangled humpback whale mortality suggest these may be the primary prey items of at least some of the feeding aggregations. Reasons for this recent novel behaviour pattern remain speculative, but may relate to increasing summer humpback whale abundance in the region.

We examined interannual changes in the foraging strategies and diet of gentoo penguins in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over 5 years with variable prey abundance. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the primary diet item, and fish the secondary, though the importance of these items varied among years. Diving behavior also varied over time: different dive depth distributions were observed among years. Nonetheless, chick-rearing success remained relatively constant, indicating that gentoo penguins were able to maintain chick provisioning by altering their foraging strategy among years. Variable abundance of krill in the region did not have observable impacts on the diet, foraging behaviors or chick-rearing success of gentoo penguins. We suggest that foraging plasticity may be one reason that gentoo penguin populations have remained stable in the region, while their congeners (P. antarctica and P. adeliae) with less flexible foraging strategies have declined. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.645473628,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,113,NA

Traditionally, population estimates have involved direct counts, but remote sensing and digital mapping methodologies can provide us with alternative techniques for assessing the size and distribution of penguin populations. Here, we demonstrate the use of a field-based digital mapping system (DMS), combining a handheld geographic information system with integrated geographical positioning system as a method for: (a) assessing penguin colony area and (b) ground-truthing colony area as derived from satellite imagery. Work took place at Signy Island, South Orkneys, where colonies of the three congeneric pygoscelid penguins: Ad√©lie Pygoscelis adeliae, chinstrap P. antarctica and gentoo P. papua were surveyed. Colony areas were derived by mapping colony boundaries using the DMS with visual counts of the number of nesting birds made concurrently. Area was found to be a good predictor for number of nests for all three species of penguin. Using a maximum likelihood multivariate classification of remotely sensed satellite imagery (QuickBird2, 18 January 2010; Digital Globe ID: 01001000B90AD00), we were able to identify penguin colonies from the spectral signature of guano and differentiate between colonies of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins. The area classified (all species combined) from satellite imagery versus area from DMS data was closely related (R2¬†=¬†0.88). Combining these techniques gives a simple and transferrable methodology for examining penguin distribution and abundance at local and regional scales. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.644180111,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,116,NA

Discovery samples were obtained using an N70V closing net fished vertically through three depth horizons encompassing the top 250¬†m of the water column, whereas contemporary samples were obtained using a Bongo net fished vertically through 200‚Äì0¬†m. Data from a previous study comparing catch efficiencies of the two nets were used to generate calibration factors which were applied to the N70V abundances. Following further corrections for net depth differences and seasonal biases in sampling frequency, three of the four species, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus simillimus, were found to be between ~ 20‚Äì55% more abundant in contemporary times than they were 70¬†years ago. Calanus propinquus was marginally more abundant in the Discovery era. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses for the net calibration factor, seasonal bias and net depth corrections. Although near-surface ocean temperatures within the Scotia Sea have increased by up to 1.5¬†¬∞C during the last 70¬†years, we conclude that the most likely causes of increased copepod abundances are linked to changes in the food-web. In particular, we discuss the reported decrease in krill abundance in the South Atlantic that has potentially increased the amount of food available to copepods while at the same time decreasing predator pressure. ¬© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus,0.643654763,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,69,NA

To investigate penguins' seasonally changing FTD as a function of foraging-population size-previously investigated indirectly-we used bio-logging to determine the penguins' 3-dimensional foraging volume, while an autonomous glider quantified the depth, abundance, and distribution of potential prey. As numbers of foraging penguins and cetaceans increased, penguins spent more time on foraging trips, traveling farther and deeper, and their diet included more fish, as average maximum depth of krill increased from 45 to 65 m, and that of small fish also deepened, but only from 51 to 57 m. With a need to forage at greater depths for in creasingly over lapping prey, the penguins consumed more of the energydense fish. Krill depth was negatively correlated with chlorophyll (a proxy for krill food), indi cating an uncoupling between the two and the overwhelming importance of predation avoidance by the krill relative to food acquisition. Results support the hypotheses that (1) predators remove the grazers from Ross Sea surface waters, controlling their ver - tical distributions; and (2) the food web has a 'waspwaist' structure, in which middle- and upper-trophic levels are controlled top-down, whereas phytoplank - ton production and accumulation are regulated bottom-up, largely independent of grazer control.

G. braueri was the most abundant species (0.07‚Äì0.17 ind. 1,000¬†m‚àí3) throughout the Scotia Sea. G. fraseri was absent from the sea-ice sectors and occurred mostly around the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), comprising densities of 0.01‚Äì0.04 ind. 1,000¬†m‚àí3. G. nicholsi occurred in low abundance (&lt;0.01 ind. 1,000¬†m‚àí3) throughout the region.

The biomass estimates fall between 60 and 155 million tonnes -at the low end of values that have been suggested in the past. The differences between our estimates and others can be explained by a number of factors such as: an underestimation of the range or the acoustic biomass estimates; the possibility of a large, undetected krill population; and the overestimation of the demand for krill by predators. Even if these low krill biomass estimates are correct, regional and total precautionary limits are still likely to rise as a result of new surveys because the method used to calculate precautionary limits uses a value of 11% of the estimated pre-exploitation biomass. Additionally, the current precautionary catch limits in the South Atlantic are set using a superseded acoustic target strength which has effectively underestimated the krill biomass by a factor of three, so the new survey of the South Atlantic in January 2000 may result in an effective biomass which is greater than the value used in the past.

The recovery of these populations will be affected by the availability of krill, a major dietary component, in the Southern Ocean. We combine a novel energetics model for baleen whales with a state dependent foraging model to explore the impacts of an expanding krill fishery on baleen whales. We parameterize the model for blue whales, but with simple modifications it could be applied to most baleen whales. We predict that an expanding fishery will have a small but significant impact on the blue whale population through decreased birth rates. However, spreading the catch limit throughout the range of krill can reduce these effects. In addition, whales may be able to reduce these impacts through adaptive changes in foraging behavior. The relationship between krill abundance and blue whale foraging and reproductive success is nonlinear, such that larger reductions in krill biomass, potentially following a loss of sea ice due to climate change, could have a much larger negative impact on the recovery of blue whales. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.632375205,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,48,NA

Depredation can also create additional unrecorded fishing mortality of a stock and has the potential to introduce bias to stock assessments. Here we aim to characterise depredation in the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery around South Georgia focusing on the spatio-temporal component of these interactions. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and orcas (Orcinus orca ) frequently feed on fish hooked on longlines around South Georgia. A third of longlines encounter sperm whales, but loss of catch due to sperm whales is insignificant when compared to that due to orcas, which interact with only 5% of longlines but can take more than half of the catch in some cases. Orca depredation around South Georgia is spatially limited and focused in areas of putative migration routes, and the impact is compounded as a result of the fishery also concentrating in those areas at those times. Understanding the seasonal behaviour of orcas and the spatial and temporal distribution of ""depredation hot spots"" can reduce marine mammal interactions, will improve assessment and management of the stock and contribute to increased operational efficiency of the fishery. Such information is valuable in the effort to resolve the human-mammal conflict for resources. ¬© 2015 S√∂ffker et al.",Article,Scopus,0.628680309,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,62,NA

Previous work has shown a general in-shore migration of krill in winter in this region; however, the very near-shore has not often been sampled as part of these surveys. We investigated distribution, abundance, and size structure of krill in 3 fjordic bays along the peninsula, and in the adjacent Gerlache Strait area using vertically stratified MOCNESS net tows and ADCP acoustic biomass estimates. Krill abundance was high within bays, with net estimated densities exceeding 60 krill m-3, while acoustic estimates were an order of magnitude higher. Krill within bays were larger than krill in the Gerlache Strait. Within bays, krill aggregations were observed near the seafloor during the day with aggregations extending to the sediment interface, and exhibited diel vertical migration higher into the water column at night. We suggest these high winter krill abundances within fjords are indicative of an active seasonal migration by krill in the peninsula region. Potential drivers for such a migration include reduced advective losses and costs, and availability of sediment food resources within fjords. Seasonally near-shore krill may also affect stock and recruitment assessments and may have implications for managing the krill fishery in this area. ¬© 2016 Inter-Research.",Article,Scopus,0.627041873,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,34,NA

To test this, we compared the chemistry of otolith nuclei from Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), presently managed as spatially discrete populations corresponding to fishing management areas along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which transports water eastward around the Southern Ocean. The chemistry of otolith nuclei, laid down during early life, differed significantly between fishing areas off South America and the Antarctic and between some Antarctic areas. However, we found significant discrepancies from expectation for a population structure corresponding to fishing areas. We also found evidence of four groups of fish with different early life chemistry: one associated with South America and three Antarctic groups showing mixing consistent with advective transport along the ACC. These results suggest that toothfish populations are structured by their physical environment; population abundance and persistence may rely on a restricted number of breeding members with access to spawning grounds, whereas fisheries may rely substantially on nonbreeding vagrants transported from fishing areas upstream. ¬© 2008 NRC.",Article,Scopus,0.625724543,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,39,NA

In this study, meso-scale differences in the assemblages, spatial and seasonal distributions of skates are revealed among six habitat zones of the eastern Patagonian Shelf characterized by distinctive oceanographic conditions. Most skates belonged to temperate fauna, and their abundance was much greater in habitats occupied by temperate waters (north-western outer shelf) or mixed waters (northern slope) than in habitats occupied by sub-Antarctic waters (SASW) (south-eastern outer shelf and southern slope). Sub-Antarctic skates were not abundant on the shelf even in habitats occupied by SASW, occurring mainly in deep areas of the lower continental slope. The majority of temperate skates migrated seasonally, shifting northward in winter and spreading southward with warming waters in summer. Most temperate species had two peaks in female maturity (mainly spring and autumn) and spawned in the same habitats where they fed. It is hypothesized that the high biodiversity and abundance of skates on the Patagonian Shelf and Slope are due to the practical absence of their natural competitors, flatfishes, which occupy similar eco-niches elsewhere. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

We examined the diet of the Antarctic fur seal population at Bouvet√∏ya, Southern Ocean, to assess intersexual differences. This was made possible by the analysis of prey remains extracted from scats and regurgitations collected in areas used primarily by one or the other sex. The results indicate that both males and females feed primarily on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba with several species of fish and squid being taken, likely opportunistically given their prevalence. Significant differences were identified in the frequency of occurrence of otoliths in scats and the percentage numerical abundance of the major fish prey species in the diet. Adult males ate a smaller quantity of fish overall, but ate significantly more of the larger fish species. The greater diving capabilities of males and the fact that they are not limited in the extent of their foraging area by having to return regularly to feed dependant offspring may play a role in the differences found between the diets of males and females. Additionally, females might be more selective, favouring myctophids because they are richer in energy than krill. The absence of major differences in the diet between the sexes at this location is likely due to the high overall abundance of prey at Bouvet√∏ya. ¬© 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.624828357,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,121,NA

A total of 141 non-target net hauls were undertaken during three cruises (Nov 2006, Jan 2008 and Mar 2009), with 7852 teleost fish captured, representing 43 species in 17 families. A further 1517 fish were caught in targeted net hauls. The dominant families were the Myctophidae (6961 specimens; 21 species) and Bathylagidae (1467 specimens; 4 species). Few fish were caught in the upper 400. m during daylight, which was attributed to a combination of net avoidance and diurnal vertical migration. Species composition was linked to depth and location and was closely associated with oceanographic features. Diversity was lowest in cold water at the most southerly stations, which were dominated by Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Bathylagus antarcticus. Further north, diversity increased with the addition of species such as Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum bolini and Electrona carlsbergi. The depth integrated biomass of myctophids was similar across the latitudinal transect and produced an estimate of 4.5 million tonnes in the Scotia Sea. Bathylagids were patchily distributed, but were abundant in the lower mesopelagic zone (>400. m) and are potentially significant zooplankton consumers. Given the biomass of the myctophids and bathylagids coupled with the vertical migrations of many species, these fish are likely to play a significant role in carbon export from the surface waters to the deep ocean. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.623902672,1,NA,NA,10,NA,1,10,21,NA

The upper 200 m of the water column were sampled with an 8 m2 rectangular midwater trawl at 93 stations. The larval species community clustered in a diverse coastal community with high densities of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum larvae and a less diverse offshore community dominated by Antarctic jonasfish Notolepis coatsi and the lanternfish Electrona antarctica. No postlarval fish were caught in coastal areas. The offshore community of postlarval fishes consisted of the deep-sea smelt Bathylagus antarcticus, and the lanternfishes Gymnoscopelus braueri, C. nicholsi and E. antarctica. The latter species clearly dominated, occurring at mean individual and wet mass densities of 0.17 individuals nr2 and 0.26 g m-2, respectively. A generalized additive model significantly related the density of postlarval E. antarctica to the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, ocean depth and sea surface temperature. The diet of E. antarctica was dominated by copepods and euphausiid larvae. Mean energy density of E. antarctica in the upper 200 m was 2.8 kJ m-2, which is equivalent to 36% of the energy stored in Antarctic krill stocks and probably would be considerably higher if a greater depth range were considered. This suggests that E. antarctica is a major energy transmitter in the food web of the Lazarev Sea, challenging the classical krill-dominated food web paradigm of the Southern Ocean. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.617769187,0,NA,NA,5,NA,0,5,4,NA

In the Ross Sea, aggregations of eggs and larvae occur under fast ice in Terra Nova Bay, and the hypothesis predicted that dispersing larvae encounter outflow along the western side of Drygalski Trough. The outflow advects larvae towards the shelf-break, and mixing with trough inflow facilitates return toward the inner shelf. To examine the hypothesis, we compared samples of P.¬†antarctica collected near Coulman Island in the outflow, along Crary Bank in the inflow, and a third set taken over the rest of the Ross Sea. We ruled out misidentification using an innovative genetic validation. Silverfish larvae comprised 99.5% of the catch, and the highest population densities were found in Drygalski Trough. The results provided no evidence to reject the population hypothesis. Abundance indices, back-calculated hatching dates, length distributions and growth were congruent with a unified early life history in the western Ross Sea, constrained by cryopelagic early stages in Terra Nova Bay. By contrast, a sample in the Bay of Whales revealed much smaller larvae, suggesting either a geographically separate population in the eastern Ross Sea, or westward connectivity with larvae spawned nearby by fish sourced from troughs upstream in the Amundsen Sea. These results illustrate how hypotheses that integrate population structure with life history can provide precise spatial predictions for subsequent testing. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.612514127,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,109,NA

Modern krill stocks have been estimated directly by net hauls and acoustic surveys; the historical krill density especially the long-term one in the Southern Ocean, however, is unknown. Here we inferred the relative krill population changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) over the 20th century from the trophic level change of Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella using stable carbon (Œ¥ 13C) and nitrogen (Œ¥ 15N) isotopes of archival seal hairs. Since Antarctic fur seals feed preferentially on krill, the variation of Œ¥ 15N in seal hair indicates a change in the proportion of krill in the seal's diets and thus the krill availability in local seawater. For the past century, enriching fur seal Œ¥ 15N values indicated decreasing krill availability. This is agreement with direct observation for the past ~30 years and suggests that the recently documented decline in krill populations began in the early parts of the 20th century. This novel method makes it possible to infer past krill population changes from ancient tissues of krill predators. ¬© 2011 Huang et al.",Article,Scopus,0.610512212,0,NA,NA,10,NA,0,10,16,NA

It provides a theoretical foundation for considering the scales of management units involving the integration of local populations of harvested species, foraging areas of predators, fishing grounds and the potential influences of the environment, including oceanography and metapopulation structure of the harvested species. The integration of these components involves two different types of unit: the 'harvesting unit', which is at the scale of the metapopulation of the harvested species, and the 'predator unit', which does not have to be a relatively self-contained ecosystem but should be sufficiently independent for fishing in that unit not to inadvertently affect predators being monitored in other units. The South Atlantic region (Area 48) is used to illustrate how to define predator units. The derived conceptual model is then used to formulate an approach for developing fisheries on prey species, notably krill, in other harvesting units. The manner in which predator units can be used to help the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) provide strategic advice on the effects of fishing is discussed. In general, the early acquisition of information on the distribution of local populations of krill and the potential foraging densities of predators from within a harvesting unit (i.e. abundance of predators, distribution of colonies and foraging range) will provide a means of circumscribing predator units as well as undertaking an assessment of long-term annual yield. It is proposed that the early development of the fishery could be concentrated in a small number of units in such a way that the relative fishing intensities in those units are equivalent, although not necessarily equal, to the intensity expected across all units once the catch limit had been reached. Other units in which fishing was not occurring could be monitored as well. This process could help determine whether or not the catch limit is likely to cause undesirable effects on predators in any of the predator units. In this way, it is possible to determine, well in advance of the catch limit being reached, whether or not local restrictions on harvesting are necessary, as well as the overall requirements for the monitoring program.",Article,Scopus,0.605224906,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,154,NA

In particular, we compared life history strategies between fish caught during surveys undertaken off the South Orkney Islands (SOI) and South Shetland Islands (SSI). Results corroborated regional separation after settlement and suggested distinct life history strategies, in which fish from SOI invested much less in reproduction, and somewhat more in somatic growth earlier in their life history. Compared to SSI, body weight increased faster with length and absolute fecundity was 46¬†% lower and increased more slowly with size for SOI population. In addition, the proportion of spawning cohorts and L‚àû was lower and k higher for SOI.

Species-specific models were developed for the tropical reef fishes the black tip grouper (Epinephelus fasciatus) and moray eel (Gymnothorax spp.) and the Antarctic scavengers; the asteroid (Odontaster validus) and the nemertean worm (Parbolasia corrugatus). A sensitivity analysis explored the impact of input parameters on the arrival patterns (Max<inf>N</inf>, time to the arrival of the first individual and the time to reach Max<inf>N</inf>) for each species generated by the model. Sensitivity analysis showed a particularly strong link between Max<inf>N</inf> and abundance indicating that this model could be used to generate absolute abundances from existing or future Max<inf>N</inf> data. It in effect allows the slope of the Max<inf>N</inf> vs. abundance relationship to be estimated. Arrival patterns generated by each model were used to estimate population abundance for the focal species and these estimates were compared to data from underwater visual census transects. Using a Bland-Altman analysis, baited underwater camera data processed using this model were shown to generate absolute abundance estimates that were comparable to underwater visual census data. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.601670927,0,NA,NA,5,NA,0,5,9,NA

A single species yield model is currently being used by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to recommend an annual krill catch limit which is expressed as a proportion (Œ≥ = 0.116) of a survey biomass estimate. This approach takes the needs of predators into account in only a crude way by assuming that a median krill escapement of 75% of its unexploited biomass would be sufficient to meet the needs of predators. A krill-predator modeling procedure is presented that could be used to directly assess the impact of krill harvesting on krill predator populations and therefore to revise this recommended harvesting level (Œ≥) for Antarctic krill. Application of a deterministic form of this model to an Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) data set from Bird Island South Georgia Antarctica indicates that the level of krill fishing intensity (Œ≥) that would reduce this population to half the equilibrium size in the absence of krill fishing (Œ≥(half)) lies between 0.03 and 0.18, which includes the level recommended by CCAMLR. This large range results primarily from the sensitivity of the model to the maximum growth rate parameter, for which a range of 5-15%/yr is investigated. A plausible range of values for this parameter (5-15%/yr) results in estimated Œ≥(half) values from 0.04 to 0.23. Stochastic calculations (which take account of interannual fluctuations in the abundance of the krill population due to recruitment variability) yield higher estimated Œ≥(half) values than the less realistic deterministic calculations. However, simulation tests indicate that the estimated Œ≥(half) values are biased upward; this modeling approach is therefore likely to yield Œ≥(half) values that would lead to a depletion of the Antarctic fur seal population to more than half its pristine size.",Article,Scopus,0.601585081,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,152,NA

We reviewed research published from 2007 to 2014 that incorporated very high-resolution satellite imagery to assess distribution, abundance, and effects of climate and other anthropogenic changes on populations of predators in polar regions. Very high-resolution imagery has been used to study 7 species of polar animals in 13 papers, many of which provide methods through which further research can be conducted. Use of very high-resolution imagery in the Southern Ocean can provide a broader understanding of climate and anthropogenic forces on populations and inform management and conservation recommendations.

Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m-2) compared to summer (0.25 krill m-2), and this pattern was observed in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher (‚àº5 500 000 metric tons [t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krilldependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Bransfield Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently icefree. While long-term projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions, alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the impacts of long-term climate change. ¬© 2017 Inter-Research.",Article,Scopus,0.600565203,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,139,NA

Without mark-recapture studies, understanding how colonies form and, by extension, how ranges shift is challenging. Genetic studies, particularly focused on newly established colonies, provide a snapshot of colonization and can reveal the extent to which shifts in abundance and occupancy result from changes in demographic rates (e.g., reproduction and survival) or migration among suitable patches of habitat. Here, we describe the population structure of a colonial seabird breeding across a large latitudinal range in the Southern Ocean. Using multilocus microsatellite genotype data from 510 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) individuals from 14 colonies along the Scotia Arc and Antarctic Peninsula, together with mitochondrial DNA data, we find strong genetic differentiation between colonies north and south of the Polar Front, that coincides geographically with the taxonomic boundary separating the subspecies P. p. papua and P. p. ellsworthii. Using a discrete Bayesian phylogeographic approach, we show that southern Gentoos expanded from a possible glacial refuge in the center of their current range, colonizing regions to the north and south through rare, long-distance dispersal. Our findings show that this dispersal is important for new colony foundation and range expansion in a seabird species that ordinarily exhibits high levels of natal philopatry, though persistent oceanographic features serve as barriers to movement. ¬© 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.600108944,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,107,NA

They are sensitive to changes in hydrodynamics through effects on transport and food availability, particularly in the case of filter-feeding species. This gives them the potential to act as sentinels of environmental change. The rafting kelp-associated Gaimardia trapesina is one such species, widely distributed in the Southern Ocean. In 2015 and 2016, the size structure, diet, and distribution of G. trapesina were examined around the Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEI) to establish benchmark data and explore their potential use for monitoring long-term change. Gaimardia trapesina and its potential food sources were collected and analysed for size structure, attachment strength, and diet, using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. The populations examined were dominated by relatively small individuals. The strength of attachment to kelp blades was low and the byssal threads showed high elasticity. The PEI lie in the path of the west‚Äìeast flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the highest abundances of G. trapesina were found on the downstream sides of both islands, while the species was absent from the western, upstream coasts. Both diet analyses and SIAR mixing models indicated that G. trapesina feeds on suspended particulate matter, while kelp particles contribute minimally to the diet. Considering the wide distribution of G. trapesina, its importance as food for birds and fish, and its sensitivity to environmental conditions, there is good potential to use this species as an indicator of environmental change in the Southern Ocean. ¬© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus,0.595884254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,173,NA

Density estimates based on belt transects averaged collectively 0.46 individuals m-2 at three study sites between depths of 6 and 30 m in November 1996. At two of the sites, population densities increased linearly between 18 and 30 m depth (up to 0.7 and 1.15 individuals m-2 at 30 m depth). Individuals at all sites were rare or absent at depths shallower than 12 m. Size frequencies of individuals at the sites were similar. and a pooled analysis revealed a unimodal distribution skewed highly towards juvenile size classes. This suggests both recent recruitment and constant rates of mortality across size classes. The relationship between foot length and wet weight best fits an exponential growth equation, indicative of an allometric growth pattern. Distribution of T. belli in the field suggests that it is a habitat and diet generalist. Potential invertebrate predators include sea anemones and seastars, both of which co-occur in abundance in McMurdo Sound. Laboratory experiments indicate that the sea anemone Isotealia antarctica can capture and ingest T. belli. However, 70% of T. belli that are captured escape from the tentacles or, following ingestion, are rejected from the gastrovascular cavity. The seastars Odontaster validus, Perknaster fuscus, and Acodontaster conspicuus, avoid contact with T. belli, but if forced into contact with mantle tissues, retract their tube-feet. Mucus secreted from the mantle tissues, coated on to the tips of glass rods, and presented to seastar tube-feet, causes significantly longer tube-foot retraction times than control rods. Moreover, pieces of freeze-dried krill coated with mantle mucus are consumed significantly less often than untreated control pieces of krill by a benthic scavenging fish (Pseudotrematomas bernacchi). Employing seastar tube-foot retractions as a bioassay, we found the bioactive compound(s) are soluble in ethyl acetate, indicating they are lipophilic or moderately hydrophilic in nature.

We used a minimally realistic ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a ‚â•40% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future. ¬© This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Despite studies dating from the beginning of the last century, the causes of the high productivity remain unclear. The island lies within the Antarctic Zone of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, to the south of the Polar Front. The offshore waters to its north and east are affected by a northwards deflection of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, together with waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence. Despite a retentive circulation over the shelf, the high productivity of phytoplankton and copepods is widespread, occurring far downstream and possibly extending to the Polar Front. High phytoplankton concentrations (&gt; 20 mg chlorophyll a m-3) may be linked to enhanced supply of iron or reduced forms of nitrogen (up to ‚àº3 mmol ammonium m-3). Although macronutrients are generally not limiting in the Antarctic Zone, silicate concentrations of &lt; 1 mmol m-3 are growth-limiting at South Georgia in some summers. The growth season is long and blooms of &gt;2 mg chl a m-3 occur for 4 to 5 mo. Biomass of krill plus net-caught zooplankton in summer is around 15 to 20 g dry mass m-2, equally dominated by krill and copepods. This greatly exceeds typical values for Antarctica, and is high compared to productive northern shelves. Zooplankton, and in particular krill, appear to have a pivotal role in regulating energy flow in this food web, through selective grazing and possibly also through nutrient regeneration. Abundances of krill and copepods are negatively related across a wide range of scales, suggesting direct interaction through competition or predation. Evidence suggests that when phytoplankton stocks are low, energy flow through krill is maintained by their feeding on the large populations of small copepods. Metazoans and higher predators at South Georgia can feed across several trophic levels according to prey abundance, and they regenerate substantial quantities of reduced nitrogen. Therefore we suggest that these groups have a controlling influence on lower trophic levels, both stabilising population sizes and maintaining high rates of energy flow. Hydrography, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton, copepod, and krill biomasses fluctuate between years. Periodically (once or twice a decade), shortages of krill in summer result in breeding failures among many of their predators. This appears to be a downstream effect from wider scale, Scotia Sea phenomena, although the processes involved are unclear. The elevated biomass and energy flows at South Georgia appear to be caused by locally enhanced growth rates; there is no evidence so far for any physical concentration mechanism. Even for krill, which do not breed there, local growth rates are probably of a similar order to the biomass removed by their main land-based predators in summer. Thus the transfer of energy to higher predators depends on local enhancement of fluxes through the food web as well as the supply of plankton to the island by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",Review,Scopus,0.571990674,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,162,NA

However, species abundance and environmental variables are often spatially correlated and the strength of environmental effects may exhibit spatial non-stationarity on the species distribution. We applied local models, such as season-, sex-, and size-specific geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, on American lobster to explore non-stationary environmental effects on the presence and density of lobsters in the inshore Gulf of Maine (GOM). This species and its fishery have undergone a dramatic increase in abundance over the past two decades. Model results showed that the strength of the estimated relationships in the western GOM were different with the relationships in the eastern GOM during 2000-2014. Bottom water temperature had a more significant positive impact on the increase of lobsters in the eastern GOM, while the influence of temperature was less significant in the west and the more distinguishable drivers of distribution needed to be identified. The estimation of locally varied relationships can further improve regionally informed management plans. The modeling approach can be widely applied to many other species or study areas. ¬© International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018.

Moreover, the reproductive potential of P. granulosa is reduced because an important proportion of the largest and more prolific females of the population do not carry eggs. In other terms, in one generation time of P. granulosa, two complete generations of L. santolla are produced, and compared to other Subantarctic lithodids L. santolla is the most prolific species.

Understanding the foraging ecology of these species in the Southern Ocean is important for monitoring and ecosystem conservation and management. Methodology/Principal Findings: Tracking data from sooty and short-tailed shearwaters from three regions of New Zealand and Australia were combined with at-sea observations of shearwaters in the Southern Ocean, physical oceanography, nearsurface copepod distributions, pelagic trawl data, and synoptic near-surface winds. Shearwaters from all three regions foraged in the Polar Front zone, and showed particular overlap in the region around 140¬∞E. Short-tailed shearwaters from South Australia also foraged in Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front. The spatial distribution of shearwater foraging effort in the Polar Front zone was matched by patterns in large-scale upwelling, primary production, and abundances of copepods and myctophid fish. Oceanic winds were found to be broad determinants of foraging distribution, and of the flight paths taken by the birds on long foraging trips to Antarctic waters. Conclusions/Significance: The shearwaters displayed foraging site fidelity and overlap of foraging habitat between species and populations that may enhance their utility as indicators of Southern Ocean ecosystems. The results highlight the importance of upwellings due to interactions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with large-scale bottom topography, and the corresponding localised increases in the productivity of the Polar Front ecosystem. ¬© 2010 Raymond et al.",Article,Scopus,0.569686661,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,149,NA

Of the 102 fish species, 86 harboured at least 1 parasite species, and only in Antarctica and the deepsea were large proportions of fish species found to be free of ectoparasites. The mean prevalence of infection was 30.1%, the average of abundances was 6.7 parasites per fish, due to very heavy intensities of some parasite species (mean median abundance 4.31). Most parasite species exhibited a clustered distribution in the host populations, as measured by variance to mean raties, i.e. some fish were more, and others less, heavily infected than if infection were random. Core and satellite species cannot be distinguished unambiguously, because numbers of parasites on almost all hosts are too small for any bimodality to become apparent. On average, the most dominant species represeated 90% of all parasite individuals of a particular fish; different parasite species were often dominant on different fish individuals of a particular host species. Both abundances and maximum intensities of infection were positively correlsted with prevalence of infection. Community richness varies greatly at and between localities, with the lewest richness found in Antarctic and deepsea fish and the highest richness in tropical fish. Species richness, abundance and prevalence of infection.in many fish groups (with different ecological characteristics) are strongly correlated with temperature. If fish from all localities were pooled, pelagic fish had fewer intensites and (jointly with benthopelagic fishes) fewer species than benthic fish, and planktivorous fish had lower abundances and prevalences of infection than predatory and omnivorous fish. Prevalences of infection, abundance and parasite species richness were significantly correlated with host length. Fifteen positive and 1 negative anaciations among species were found. This and the generally low prevalences and abundances of infection indicate that competitive interactions are probably scarce. Overall, the findings indicate that most (if not all) metazoan ectoparasite communities of marine fish live in non-saturated, little-ordered assemblages. ¬© 1995.",Article,Scopus,0.5682966,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,138,NA

We investigated the distribution, abundance and feeding behaviour of seabirds in the Mozambique Channel in relation to physical and biological environmental variables, with a specific interest in mesoscale features. Seabird censuses were conducted in summer and winter during 7 cruises in the southern and northern Mozambique Channel. Tropical species accounted for 49% of the 37 species identified and 97% of the individuals, and species from the sub-Antarctic region constituted 30% of the identifications. The typically tropical sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscata) was the dominant species during all cruises, and overall accounted for 74% of the species observations and 85% of counted birds. Outputs of Generalised Linear Models at the scale of the Mozambique Channel suggested that higher densities of flying and feeding birds occurred in areas with lower sea surface temperatures and lower surface chlorophyll a concentrations. Most of the flocks of feeding birds did not associate with surface schools of fish or marine mammals, but when they did, these flocks were larger, especially when associated with tuna. While tropical species seemed to favour cyclonic eddies, frontal and divergence zones, non-tropical species were more frequently recorded over shelf waters. Sooty terns foraged preferentially in cyclonic eddies where zooplankton, micronekton and tuna schools were abundant. Among other major tropical species, frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) predominated in frontal zones between eddies, where tuna schools also frequently occurred and where geostrophic currents were the strongest. Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) concentrated in divergence zones characterised by low sea level anomalies, low geostrophic currents, and high zooplankton biomass close to the surface. Our results highlight the importance of mescoscale features in structuring the tropical seabird community in the Mozambique Channel, in addition to segregating tropical and non-tropical species. The mechanisms underlying the segregation of tropical seabirds seem to partially differ from that of other tropical regions, and this may be a consequence of the strong local mesoscale activity, affecting prey size and availability schemes. Beyond characterising the foraging habitats of the seabird community of the Mozambique Channel, this study highlights the importance of this region as a hot spot for seabirds; especially the southern part, where several endangered sub-Antarctic species over-winter. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.566237441,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,61,NA

The SSI area is surveyed each austral summer by the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program, and the acoustic data are used to examine trends in krill biomass and to assess the potential impact of fishing to the reproductive success of land-based predators (seals and penguins). The time-series of recomputed biomass densities varies greatly from that computed using an empirical log-linear TS-model and fixed-ranges of differences in volume-backscattering strengths (ŒîSv), conventionally used to identify krill acoustically. The new acoustic estimates of biomass are significantly correlated with both proportional recruitment and krill abundance estimated from zooplankton samples. Two distinct peaks in biomass (1996 and 2003) are in accord with recruitment events shown by net-based krill time-series. The foundation for the new TS-model and the associated krill-discrimination algorithm, coupled with the agreement between acoustic- and net-survey results, provides strong support for the use of the new analytical technique. Variable biases in the re-estimated krill biomass have been greatly reduced. However, survey variability increased as a result of the increased rejection of acoustic backscatter previously attributed to krill. Management of Southern Ocean krill stocks based on a precautionary approach may therefore result in decreased allocations of krill, given its dependence on the variability of survey estimates. ¬© 2008 US Government and the Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Marine Fisheries Service/Southwest Fisheries Science Center.",Article,Scopus,0.558464709,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,131,NA

Implementing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management requires an effective ecosystem monitoring programme, the utility of which depends upon its ability (measured by the statistical power) to detect effects that trigger management action. 2. Using data from a long-term ecosystem monitoring programme of the predators of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia together with a krill population model to simulate natural and fisheries induced variability in krill abundance, the power to detect the effects of different levels of fishing was examined. 3. The power to detect the effects of fishing using either the krill population or a combined predator response index was low (20-40% power after 20 years with the probability of a type I error (Œ±) = 0.05). The power increased to > 50% when Œ± was increased to 0.2 when the ability to detect change was greater with the predator response index than using the krill population itself. 4. The results indicate that although this monitoring programme has a proven ability to detect the effects of natural variability in krill abundance, its ability to detect the effects of fishing may be limited if there is a requirement for statistical significance at the 95% level. A situation where changing Œ± produces a marked increase in statistical power, and the difference in the relative ecological costs of making type I and type II errors is likely to be high, may require a more flexible approach to choosing significance levels required to trigger management action. 5. Although long-term monitoring provides a wealth of basic ecological information it is essential to evaluate, the ability to detect specific changes in order that management action is not delayed because of an inability to detect an effect rather than the lack of an effect of the fishery.

Mixed trophic impact analysis was applied to a model of the Ross Sea foodweb and used to calculate the relative trophic importances of species and trophic groups in the system. The trophic impact of toothfish on medium-sized demersal fish was identified as the strongest top-down interaction in the system based on multiple-step analysis. This suggests a potential for a strong predation-release effect on some piscine prey of toothfish (especially grenadiers and ice-fish on the Ross Sea slope). However, Antarctic toothfish had moderate trophic importance in the Ross Sea foodweb as a whole, and the analysis did not support the hypothesis that changes to toothfish will cascade through the ecosystem by simple trophic effects. Because of limitations of this kind of analysis, cascading effects on the Ross Sea ecosystem due to changes in the abundance of toothfish cannot be ruled out, but for such changes to occur a mechanism other than simple trophic interactions is likely to be involved. Trophic importances were highest in the middle of the foodweb where silverfish and krill are known to have a key role in ecosystem structure and function. The six groups with the highest indices of trophic importance were (in decreasing order): phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, Antarctic silverfish, small demersal fish, Antarctic krill and cephalopods. Crystal krill and small pelagic fish also had high trophic importance in some analyses. Strengths and limitations of this kind of analysis are presented. In particular, it is noted that the analysis only considers trophic interactions at the spatial, temporal and ecological scale of the whole Ross Sea shelf and slope area, averaged over a typical year and in 35 trophic groups. Interference and density-dependent effects were not included in this analysis. Effects at smaller spatial and temporal scales, and effects concerning only parts of populations, were not resolved by the analysis, and this is likely to underestimate the potential risks of fishing to Weddell seals and type-C killer whales. ¬© International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

A shelf assemblage mainly distributed above the 150. m depth strata, a shelf-break/upper-slope assemblage mainly between the 150-350. m depth strata, a deep/upper-slope assemblage between the 300-600. m depth strata, and a mid- deep/mid-slope assemblage mainly distributed below the 600. m. Species abundances and diversity found below 200. m is relatively low compared with shallow waters. The observed depth zonation of the slope assemblages, roughly agrees with the expected occurrence or influence of different water masses: shelf and surface mixing and seasonal thermocline depth zone, the depth range of occurrence of the intermediate waters (North Atlantic Central Water-NACW), the South Atlantic Central Water-SACW), and Atlantic Equatorial Water-AEW), a mixing or overlapping zone of previous intermediate water masses with the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), and the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), and a deeper zone where the AAIW predominate. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.539260837,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,83,NA

We use acoustic data collected from 1997 to 2011 around the South Shetland Islands near the northern Antarctic Peninsula to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in krill biomass, distribution, and patchiness both within and across years. Moreover, we evaluate potential climate drivers of krill biomass and spatial organization through comparison with seasonally lagged climate indices. Krill abundance varied by an order of magnitude throughout the study period, with mean biomass ranging from a high of 171.9¬†g¬†m‚àí2 in 1997 to a low of 9.4¬†g¬†m‚àí2 in 2002. We find that across years, krill abundance and variability are correlated with seasonally averaged measures of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation at lags of approximately 2‚Äì2.5¬†years, which may correspond to strong reproduction and recruitment events. Krill biomass shows generally weak to moderate spatial autocorrelation and high aggregation, with measures of spatial organization correlated with abundance in some habitats. Within years, there was an overall trend of declining krill abundance and/or detectability and contracted spatial distribution between midsummer and late summer, but this pattern was not consistent across all years. This synthesis provides the background to model krill prey landscapes in order to better understand regional foraging ecology of krill predators and fishery performance. ¬© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,0.532431504,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,55,NA

This review aims to summarise these data and show where it resides, to assist SO food-web modellers or those with limited specialist knowledge of SO zooplankton. First, a brief overview is provided of the diversity and basic biology of SO zooplankton, with an emphasis on abundance, distribution and feeding. Second, advice is provided on the uses, strengths and limitations of zooplankton data as inputs to SO data compilations or food-web models. Copepods overall comprise &gt;75% of the SO zooplankton biomass (excluding Euphausia superba). Total mesozooplankton biomass density differs little between the Antarctic sectors, but latitudinally it is maximal in the Polar Frontal Zone and declines to the north and south. Those compiling data on numerical density (no. m-2 or no. m-3) need to allow for differences in the extent of identification of early larval stages. Likewise, the time of year, depth of sampling and mesh size of sampler greatly influence the recorded abundance, since the populations can make seasonal vertical migrations and their pulsed reproduction causes great seasonal changes in size structure and abundance. Other issues are specific to polar environments, for example, lipid storage which leads to significantly different length-mass and mass-rate relationships than are reported in global literature compilations. Likewise, stenothermy (narrow temperature tolerance) means that fixed (Q10-type) temperature relationships based on global literature compilations must be applied with great caution in SO-specific studies. Protozoa/micrometazoa (&lt;200 Œºm) are the main grazers in the SO, since mesozooplankton typically remove &lt;30% of primary production. This emphasises the dominant role of microbial food chains involving small metazoans, relative to the classic short diatom-krill-whale type food chains. Even within regions of abundant krill, copepod production in summer roughly triples that of postlarval E. superba. This fact reflects a large flow of energy through multiple trophic levels, via copepods and their major invertebrate predators such as other predatory copepods, chaetognaths, small omnivorous euphausiids, amphipods up to myctophid fish and birds.",Article,Scopus,0.529342212,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,81,NA

Therefore, managers increasingly need better economic data to help them prioritize their management strategies and distribute their increasingly limited resources to those strategies. Despite frequent pronouncements about the substantial ecological and economic impacts of invasive species, there have been few if any rigorous analyses of the economic impacts of invasive species in coastal systems. Here we present a bioeconomic analysis of the impacts of the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, on commercial shellfisheries along the West Coast of the United States. Green crabs are among the most comprehensively studied and widely distributed invasive species in coastal systems, with established populations on every continent except Antarctica. Their impacts on commercial bivalve fisheries have been alleged or substantiated to varying degrees, but no formal analysis of the economic impacts of the green crab has been conducted. We assess economic impacts using a combination of ecological and economic models. The ecological models incorporate green crab dispersal and description of estuarine habitat and the relationship between green crab abundance and predation on prey populations. The economic analysis focuses on the green crab impacts on commercial shellfisheries, including both historical and present impacts of green crabs on several important shellfisheries, including soft-shell clams, blue mussels, scallops, hard-shell clams, and Manila clams. We conclude that the past and present economic impacts on the West Coast shellfisheries are minor, although losses could increase significantly if densities increase or with northward range expansion into Alaska. ¬© 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.528548947,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,57,NA

We used modeled spatial distribution data for nearly 12,500 species to quantify global patterns of species richness and two measures of endemism. By combining these data with spatial information on cumulative human impacts, we identified priority areas where marine biodiversity is most and least impacted by human activities, both within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Our analyses highlighted places that are both accepted priorities for marine conservation like the Coral Triangle, as well as less well-known locations in the southwest Indian Ocean, western Pacific Ocean, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans, and within semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. Within highly impacted priority areas, climate and fishing were the biggest stressors.

Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are typically identified through a combination of expert scrutiny of echograms and analysis of differences in mean volume backscattering strengths (SV; dB re 1 m-1) measured at two or more echosounder frequencies. For commonly used frequencies, however, the differences for krill are similar to those for many co-occurring fish species that do not possess swimbladders. At South Georgia, South Atlantic, one species in particular, mackerel icefish, Champsocephalus gunnari, forms pelagic aggregations, which can be difficult to distinguish acoustically from large krill layers. Mackerel icefish are currently surveyed using bottom-trawls, but the resultant estimates of abundance may be biased because of the species' semi-pelagic distribution. An acoustic estimate of the pelagic component of the population could indicate the magnitude of this bias, but first a reliable target identification method is required. To address this, random forests (RFs) were generated using acoustic and net sample data collected during surveys. The final RF classified as krill, icefish, and mixed aggregations of weak scattering fish species with an overall estimated accuracy of 95%. Minimum SV, mean aggregation depth (m), mean distance from the seabed (m), and geographic positional data were most important to the accuracy of the RF. Time-of-day and the difference between SV at 120 kHz (SV 120) and that at 38 kHz (SV 38) were also important. The RF classification resulted in significantly higher estimates of backscatter apportioned to krill when compared with widely applied identification methods based on fixed and variable ranges of SV 120-SV 38. These results suggest that krill density is underestimated when those SV-differencing methods are used for target identification. RFs are an objective means for target identification and could enhance the utility of incidentally collected acoustic data. ¬© 2016 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Many seamounts are isolated features, occurring in the high seas, where access is limited and thus biological data scarce. There are numerous seamounts within the Drake Passage (Southern Ocean), yet high winds, frequent storms and strong currents make seafloor sampling particularly difficult. As a result, few attempts to collect biological data have been made, leading to a paucity of information on benthic habitats or fauna in this area, particularly those on primarily hard-bottom seamounts and ridges. During a research cruise in 2008 six locations were examined (two on the Antarctic margin, one on the Shackleton Fracture Zone, and three on seamounts within the Drake Passage), using a towed camera with onboard instruments to measure conductivity, temperature, depth and turbidity. Dominant fauna and bottom type were categorized from 200 randomized photos from each location. Coldwater corals were present in high numbers in habitats both on the Antarctic margin and on the current swept seamounts of the Drake Passage, though the diversity of orders varied. Though the Scleractinia (hard corals) were abundant on the sedimented margin, they were poorly represented in the primarily hard-bottom areas of the central Drake Passage. The two seamount sites and the Shackleton Fracture Zone showed high numbers of stylasterid (lace) and alcyonacean (soft) corals, as well as large numbers of sponges. Though data are preliminary, the geological and environmental variability (particularly in temperature) between sample sites may be influencing cold-water coral biogeography in this region.

The distribution of the two dominant pteropods collected in the Sub-Antarctic Zone, L. retroversa australis and C. pyramidata forma antarctica, is strongly related to latitude and depth.

The species composition of larval fish assemblages has been described in detail in previous surveys carried out in the area, but the role of environmental parameters influencing the spatial distribution of early life stages was poorly known. By applying generalized additive models and multivariate analyses, we evaluated the role of environmental variables in shaping the small-scale distribution of larval fish and investigated the spatial structure of the larval assemblage. It consisted of a few dominant notothenioid species, such as Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen squamifrons, Lepidonotothen larseni, Pleuragramma antarctica and Trematomus scotti, and several other rarely caught species. Sea water temperature, salinity and sampling depth were the most important factors determining the spatial distribution of fish with different relative contributions, together explaining more than 80% of total deviance observed. Species richness was mostly affected by salinity, probably due to the narrow range of salinity preference by the species. Cluster analysis of abundance and presence data identified six and five distinct groups, respectively, each of them with substantial contributions of single or rarely two species. Differences in reproductive strategies of adult populations and spatial distribution of early life stages driven by different larval behaviour in response to environmental factors contribute to maintaining a well-structured larval fish assemblage, ensuring spatial and food niche partitioning. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.518583802,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,153,NA

The Southern Ocean hosts some of the most rapidly warming regions on earth and Antarctic organisms are reported to be especially temperature sensitive. While cellular and molecular organismic levels appear, at least partially, to compensate for elevated temperatures, the consequences of acclimation to elevated temperature for the whole organism are often less clear. Growth and reproduction are the driving factors for population structure and abundance. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term acclimation to elevated temperature on energy budget parameters in the high- Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii.

During recent years, harvesting of krill has in - creased, possibly enhancing stress on krill and Antarctic ecosystems. Here we review the overall impact of climate change on krill and Antarctic ecosystems, discuss implications for an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach and identify critical knowledge gaps. Sea ice decline, ocean warming and other environmental stressors act in concert to modify the abundance, distribution and life cycle of krill. Although some of these changes can have positive effects on krill, their cumulative impact is most likely negative. Recruitment, driven largely by the winter survival of larval krill, is probably the population parameter most susceptible to climate change. Predicting changes to krill populations is urgent, because they will seriously impact Antarctic eco - systems. Such predictions, however, are complicated by an intense inter-annual variability in recruitment success and krill abundance. To improve the responsiveness of the ecosystem-based management ap - proach adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), critical knowledge gaps need to be filled. In addition to a better understanding of the factors influencing recruitment, management will require a better un - derstanding of the resilience and the genetic plasticity of krill life stages, and a quantitative understanding of under-ice and benthic habitat use. Current precautionary management measures of CCAMLR should be maintained until a better understanding of these processes has been achieved. ¬© Inter-Research 2012.",Review,Scopus,0.500847776,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,46,NA

Seventy-eight species of demersal fish were obtained from 12 depth-stratified trawls along, and to either side, of the central canyon axis. Distributional patterns in species richness and biomass were highly correlated. Three fish assemblage groupings, characterised by small suites of species with narrow depth distributions, were identified on the shelf, upper slope and mid slope.

Here we investigate the hypothesis that there is also spatial structure in the krill population composition, finding differences in length-frequency histograms between the eastern and western ends of the island. Between 1981 and 1997 the British Antarctic Survey carried out 6 major cruises where krill were taken from both ends of South Georgia. Cluster analysis revealed that the length-frequency histograms could be grouped into 4 main types with relatively simple biological characteristics: Cluster 1 contained small krill (mean size 23.9 mm) up to 2 yr old (1 + yr class); Cluster 2 (mean size 31.1 mm) contained a mixture of 1+ with some 2+ and 3+ yr classes; Cluster 3 contained medium-sized krill (mean size 41.4 mm) probably 2+ and 3+ yr classes; Cluster 4 contained large krill (mean size 50.3 mm) likely to be 3+ or older. Principal components analysis (PCA) provided good separation of these clusters using the first 2 axes (80% of the total variance). There were no obvious differences in the length composition of krill sampled from different water depths, although there were some indications that differences did occur between different water masses. Detailed inspection of the individual cruises revealed that the length-frequency histograms at the western end of the island contained more large krill than those from the eastern end of the island and also that when Weddell Sea water was found within a cruise then this contained the smallest krill. We consider that such differences may arise not only because krill may experience different conditions at each end of the island but also may originate from 2 separate sources which may have different population structures.",Article,Scopus,0.500130761,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,124,NA

Chondrichthyans seemingly were dominant elements in the Antarctic Paleogene fish fauna, but decreased in abundance from middle to late Eocene, during which time remains of bony fishes increase. This decline of chondrichthyans at the end of the Eocene generally is related to sudden cooling of seawater, reduction in shelf area, and increasing shelf depth due to the onset of the Antarctic thermal isolation. The last chondrichthyan records known so far include a chimeroid tooth plate from TELM 6 (Lutetian) and a single pristiophorid rostral spine from TELM 7 (Priabonian). Here, we present new chondrichthyan records of Squalus, Squatina, Pristiophorus, Striatolamia, Palaeohypotodus, Carcharocles, and Ischyodus from the upper parts of TELM 7 (Priabonian), including the first record of Carcharocles sokolovi from Antarctica. This assemblage suggests that chondrichthyans persisted much longer in Antarctic waters despite rather cool sea surface temperatures of approximately 5¬∞C. The final disappearance of chondrichthyans at the Eocene‚ÄìOligocene boundary concurs with abrupt ice sheet formation in Antarctica. Diversity patterns of chondrichthyans throughout the La Meseta Formation appear to be related to climatic conditions rather than plate tectonics.

Such rules need to specifically link management responses to the values of the indicators available for the fishery and their trends. Prior simulation testing is needed to confirm that the application of any rules suggested is likely to achieve the objectives sought for the fishery. The management procedure (MP) approach (also called management strategy evaluation), which provides a framework for such testing, is summarized briefly. How this approach could be used to develop a decision rule for a fishery for which the only indicator available is the mean length of the catch is presented as an example. The extent to which the ability to meet management objectives could be improved if an unbiased index of relative abundance were available, and an MP based on a fitted population model applied, is illustrated. An MP developed for the fishery for Patagonian toothfish Dissotichus eleginoides off the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands is summarized. This illustrates how the MP testing framework can be used in circumstances in which the available indicators conflict, leading to considerable uncertainty about the present resource status. The information content of indicators is closely related to the extent to which they vary about trends in the underlying resource attributes (e.g., catch per unit effort and underlying abundance). The compilation of lists of the statistical properties (such as the coefficients of variation and autocorrelations) of the residuals about detrended time series of the indicators, together with their likely relationships to the underlying attribute, for fisheries worldwide is suggested. This would provide a sound basis for specifying error structure in the simulation tests advocated for both generic and case-specific decision rules for data-poor fisheries. ¬© American Fisheries Society 2010.",Article,Scopus,0.495698186,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,159,NA

Changes in species' abundance and distributions caused by human disturbances can have indirect effects on other species in a community. Although ecosystem approaches to management are becoming increasingly prevalent, they require a fuller understanding of how individual behaviour determines interactions within and between species. 2. Ecological interactions involving krill are of major importance to many species within the Antarctic. Despite extensive knowledge of the ecosystem that they occupy, there is still incomplete understanding of the links between species and the effect of environmental conditions on these interactions. In this study, we extended a behavioural model used previously to understand the interactions between penguins and krill to determine the indirect effect of krill fisheries on penguin foraging success and behaviour in adjacent breeding sites. 3. Increased fishing pressure offshore is predicted to reduce penguin food intake. Given the documented links between krill and penguins, this also leads to a prediction of decreased penguin survival and reproduction. Krill behaviour is predicted to cause stronger effects of krill fisheries than explained solely by the percentage of biomass removed. Environmental conditions that decrease krill growth rates or cause krill to spend time in deeper water are also predicted to increase the magnitude of the effect of fishing on penguin success. We show that changes in penguin foraging behaviour can be used to assess the impact of local fisheries on penguin reproductive success. 4. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that an understanding of predator-prey interactions, indirect effects between species, and individual behaviour is imperative to our ability to manage populations. We describe a general method to use what is known about ecological and evolutionary processes with species-specific information to predict the response of organisms to novel situations. We further show how individual behaviour can be used to assess the impact of human disturbance on ecosystems.",Article,Scopus,0.485567796,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,147,NA

In marine communities, studies of trophic interactions have generally focused on the effects of herbivorous and predatory invertebrates on benthic algae and mussel populations. However, large mobile consumers that move across habitats, such as fishes, can strongly affect community dynamics through consumption of habitat-dominating species, but their effects often vary over environmental gradients. On temperate rocky shores, herbivorous fishes are generally a small part of the fish fauna compared to the tropics, and there is sparse evidence that they play a major direct role in algal community dynamics, particularly of large brown algae that dominate many reefs. In New Zealand, however, a wide-ranging herbivorous fish, Odax pullus, feeds exclusively on macroalgae, including Durvillaea antarctica, a large low-intertidal fucoid reaching 10 m in length and 70 kg in mass. In four experiments we tested the extent of fish herbivory and how it was affected by algal canopy structure across a gradient of wave exposure at multiple sites. Exclusion experiments showed that fish impacts greatly reduced the cover and biomass of Durvillaea and that these effects decreased with increasing wave stress and algal canopy cover, effectively restricting the alga to exposed conditions. Almost all plants were entirely removed by fish where there was a sparse algal canopy in sheltered and semi-exposed sites, but there was significantly less grazing in exposed sites. Recruit Durvillaea beneath canopies were less affected by fish grazing, but they grew slowly. Successful natural recruitment, therefore, occurred almost exclusively on exposed shores outside canopies where many plants escaped severe grazing, and growth to maturity was far greater than elsewhere. Such large and direct impacts on the local and regional distribution of large brown algal populations by mobile vertebrate consumers are rare and were mediated by an environmental gradient and plant density, both of which interact with algal demographics. The study highlights that, even though herbivorous fish diversity may be low, the impacts of particular species may still be high, even in cool temperate waters where fish herbivory is usually considered to be minimal. ¬© 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.48427952,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,104,NA

It was hypothesized that community structure would (H1) significantly differ by water mass, (H2) show significant regional differences and (H3) differ significantly between interior and exterior of each canyon. Five hundred and thirty-one species of macrofauna 1 mm were captured at 27 stations situated in depth stratified transects inside and outside the canyons from 100 to1500 m depth. The macrofauna showed a positive relationship to depth in abundance, biomass, species richness and community composition while taxonomic distinctness and evenness remained high at all depths. Biotic variation on the shelf was best defined by variation in bottom water primary production while sediment characteristics and bottom water oxygen, temperature and nutrients defined biotic variation at greater depth. Community structure differed significantly (p<0.01) among the three water masses (shelf-flowing South Australian current, upper slope Flinders current and lower slope Antarctic Intermediate Water) (H1). Although community differences between the du Couedic and Bonney regions were marginally above significance at p = 0.05 (H2), over half of the species captured were unique to each region. This supports the evidence from fish and megafaunal distributions that the du Couedic and Bonney areas are in different bioregions. Overall, the canyon interiors were not significantly different in community composition from the exterior (H3). However, both canyons had higher abundance and/or biomass, increased species dominance, different species composition and coarser sediments near the canyon heads compared to outside the canyons at the same depth (500 m), suggestive of heightened currents within the canyons that influence community composition there. At 1000-1500 m, the canyon interiors were depauperate, typical of V-shaped canyons elsewhere. The large number of species captured, given the relatively low sampling effort and focus on the larger macrofauna, support previous studies that identify the South Australian coast as a high biodiversity area. ¬© 2015 Conlan et al.

The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises-usually in summer-to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species.

Therefore, we review some examples of exploited fishery stocks in which environmental control is a major contributor to structuring the abundance and distribution of the stock. Four examples, taken from studies of northern cod (Gadus morhua), cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), are given that clearly illustrate environmental control on the fishery. From these examples, we argue that future management strategies for exploited fisheries must include effects of environmental variability. In particular, management strategies must be flexible enough to include delayed responses to environmental variations that result from the transfer of perturbations from larger to smaller scales and vice versa. This capability requires an understanding of where linkages between the physical environment and the species of interest occur.

Such characteristics have resulted from evolution in isolation in an increasingly extreme environment over the last 100 Myr. Studies on Antarctic species represent some of the best examples of natural selection at the molecular, structural and physiological levels. Analyses of molecular genetics data are consistent with the diversity and distribution of marine and terrestrial taxa having been strongly influenced by geological and climatic cooling events over the last 70 Myr. Such events have resulted in vicariance driven by continental drift and thermal isolation of the Antarctic, and in pulses of species range contraction into refugia and subsequent expansion and secondary contact of genetically distinct populations or sister species during cycles of glaciation. Limited habitat availability has played a major role in structuring populations of species both in the past and in the present day. For these reasons, despite the apparent simplicity or homogeneity of Antarctic terrestrial and marine environments, populations of species are often geographically structured into genetically distinct lineages. In some cases, genetic studies have revealed that species defined by morphological characters are complexes of cryptic or sibling species. Climate change will cause changes in the distribution of many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic species through affecting population-level processes such as life history and dispersal. ¬© 2007 The Royal Society.",Article,Scopus,0.426106804,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,53,NA

These animals typically undertake a seasonal vertical migration into the deep sea, where they remain dormant for periods of between three and nine months. Descending copepods are subject to low temperatures and increased hydrostatic pressures. Nothing is known about how these organisms adapt their membranes to these environmental stressors. We collected copepods (Calanoides acutus) from the Southern Ocean at depth horizons ranging from surface waters down to 1000 m. Temperature and/or pressure both had significant, additive effects on the overall composition of the membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in C. acutus. The most prominent constituent of the PLFAs, the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexanoic acid [DHA - 22:6(n-3)], was affected by a significant interaction between temperature and pressure. This moiety increased with pressure, with the rate of increase being greater at colder temperatures. We suggest that DHA is key to the physiological adaptations of vertically migrating zooplankton, most likely because the biophysical properties of this compound are suited to maintaining membrane order in the cold, high pressure conditions that persist in the deep sea. As copepods cannot synthesise DHA and do not feed during dormancy, sufficient DHA must be accumulated through ingestion before migration is initiated. Climatedriven changes in the timing and abundance of the flagellated microplankton that supply DHA to copepods have major implications for the capacity of these animals to undertake their seasonal life cycle successfully.

With the aim of assessing the value of larval Anisakis as zoogeographical indicators in a transitional zone between subtropical and sub-Antarctic marine currents, larvae obtained from Zenopsis conchifer were genetically identified. Larvae from Pagrus pagrus and Merluccius hubbsi from two adjacent zoogeographical provinces were also sequenced. Results: Four species were genetically identified in the whole sample, including Anisakis typica, A. pegreffii, A. berlandi and a probably new species related to A. paggiae. Anisakis typica and A. pegreffii were identified as indicators of tropical/subtropical and sub-Antarctic waters, respectively, and their presence evidenced the transitional conditions of the region. Multivariate analyses on prevalence and mean abundance of Anisakis spp. of 18 samples represented by 9 fish species caught south of 35¬∞S determined that host trophic level and locality of capture were the main drivers of the distribution of parasites across zoogeographical units in the South-West Atlantic. Conclusions: Most samples followed a clear zoogeographical pattern, but the sample of Z. conchifer, composed mostly of A. typica, was an exception. This finding suggests that population parameters of A. typica and A. pegreffii could differ enough to be considered as a surrogates of the identity of larvae parasitizing a given host population and, therefore, a step forward the validation of the use of larval Anisakis as biological indicators for studies on host zoogeography. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,0.415263617,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,167,NA

The genus Trematomus (suborder Notothenioidei) is regarded primarily as a high latitude group because of its abundance there, they also inhabit the warmer regions in smaller numbers. Freeze avoidance in the notothenioids is linked to the presence of two antifreeze proteins (AFPs); the antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) and antifreeze potentiating protein (AFPP), both of which adsorb to internal ice crystals inhibiting growth. Both high and low latitude trematomids possess sufficient AFP to lower their blood freezing point below that of seawater (- 1.9. ¬∞C). We investigated the contributions of AFGPs and AFPP to the blood freezing point depression to determine how they varied with depth, water temperature, and the presence of ice. High latitude trematomids had lower blood freezing points than those inhabiting lower latitude waters indicating differences in their freeze avoidance capacities. Lower freezing points were associated with higher levels of antifreeze activity due to higher levels of both AFGP and AFPP. Populations of Trematomus hansoni and Trematomus bernacchii from shallow depths appear more freeze avoidant than populations inhabiting deep, ice-free water based on their lower freezing points and higher antifreeze activities.

Special attention was given to helminth infracommunities and effect of host sex on its structure. A total of 21 taxa including 5 ecto-parasites and 16 endo-parasites were identified. The number of ecto and endo-parasite species per individual host ranged from 1 to 3 and 3 to 10, respectively, while the mean numbers of parasite specimens per individual host were 4.7 and 1309.7, respectively. The rich abundance of infection suggests a rich concentration of helminth intermediate/paratenic hosts in the coastal waters of Terra Nova Bay. Chionodraco hamatus serves as a definitive host for 10 helminth taxa, while it acts as an intermediate/paratenic host for 6 helminth taxa. Larvae of 6 helminth taxa for which C. hamatus serves as intermediate/paratenic host represented 98.7% of all specimens found. Of these, the tetraphyllidean and diphyllobothridean cestodes and the nematode Contracaecum osculatum s.l. were the most prevalent and abundant. 'Larval' infracommunities had significantly higher species richness, total abundance and diversity than 'adult' infracommunities, suggesting the important role of C. hamatus in supporting the life cycles of those parasites in the study area as a paratenic/intermediate host. Significant differences in the pattern of helminth infracommunities of larval forms between male and female fish were found. These differences could be caused by physiological, and most probably by behavioral differences between sexes suggesting that sex is an important factor influencing parasite burden in C. hamatus during reproductive season. ¬© 2014 Santoro et al.",Article,Scopus,0.40038029,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,78,NA

The energetic composition of adult body tissues (kJ¬∑g-1 dry wt) is comprised primarily of energy derived from protein (11.4 kJ NaOH-insoluble, 6 kJ NaOH-soluble). Energy units associated with lipid (4.3 kJ) and carbohydrate (0.2 kJ) are much lower. Based on calculations of the energetic composition of whole body tissues, and a density of 0.3 ind¬∑m-2, mean population energetic density is estimated to be 65 kJ¬∑m-2. These values are often significantly higher as P. corrugatus aggregates when feeding. Despite their high abundance, nemerteans are not preyed upon and appear to be chemically defended. Sperm of the antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumeyeri (Meissner) were killed when exposed to a 3% aqueous extract of whole nemertean body tissues. In laboratory feeding experiments, two common species of antarctic fish showed significant rejection of nemerteans. Its toxic and feeding-deterrent characteristics are probably the result of the epithelial production of copious acidic mucus (pH = 3.5), although other toxic or noxious metabolites may be present. These results indicate that P. corrugatus, an important scavenger in antarctic benthic systems, is abundant, high in nutrients and energy content, and could be judged on this basis as a high-quality prey item. Nonetheless, due to its chemical defense, potential predators may avoid ingestion of this species. ¬© 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Recently discovered vent fields on the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) in the Southern Ocean represent a new province of vent biogeography, but the spatial dynamics of their distinct fauna have yet to be elucidated. This study determines patterns of faunal zonation, species associations, and relationships between faunal microdistribution and hydrothermal activity in a vent field at a depth of 2,400 m on the ESR. Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives obtained high-definition imagery of three chimney structures with varying levels of hydrothermal activity, and a mosaic image of &gt;250 m2 of seafloor co-registered with temperature measurements. Analysis of faunal microdistribution within the mosaiced seafloor reveals a consistent pattern of faunal zonation with increasing distance from vent sources and peak temperatures. Assemblages closest to vent sources are visibly dominated by a new species of anomuran crab, Kiwa n. sp. (abundance &gt;700 individuals m-2), followed by a peltospiroid gastropod (&gt;1,500 individuals m-2), eolepadid barnacle (&gt;1,500 individuals m-2), and carnivorous actinostolid anemone (&gt;30 individuals m-2). Peripheral fauna are not dominated by a single taxon, but include predatory and scavenger taxa such as stichasterid seastars, pycnogonids and octopus. Variation in faunal microdistribution on chimneys with differing levels of activity suggests a possible successional sequence for vent fauna in this new biogeographic province. An increase in Œ¥34S values of primary consumers with distance from vent sources, and variation in their Œ¥13C values also indicate possible zonation of nutritional modes of the vent fauna. By using ROV videography to obtain a high-resolution representation of a vent environment over a greater extent than previous studies, these results provide a baseline for determining temporal change and investigations of processes structuring faunal assemblages at Southern Ocean vents. ¬© 2012 Marsh et al.",Article,Scopus,0.386034594,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,94,NA

For marine ectotherms such as fish, temperature is a key abiotic factor, influencing metabolic processes. Species distribution and abundance are driven by reproduction and growth, which depend on available energy exceeding baseline maintenance costs. These routine metabolic costs make up a large part of the energy expenditure. Thermal stress can increase routine metabolism, affecting an organism‚Äôs fitness. Data of routine metabolic rates of Antarctic fish are scarce, and comparability of existing data sets is often problematic due to ecological differences between species and in experimental protocols. Our objective was to compare routine metabolism and thermal sensitivity of species with similar ecotypes but different thermal environments to assess possible ecological implications of warming waters on energy expenditure in Antarctic fish, a fauna characterised by geographic isolation, endemism and putative thermal adaptation. We measured routine metabolic rates of three benthic Antarctic fish species from low- and high-Antarctic regions at habitat temperature and during acute temperature increase. Our analysis revealed differences in metabolic rates at the same temperature suggesting local adaptation to habitat temperature. Acute thermal stress induced a comparable response of metabolic rates to increasing temperature. We conclude that higher metabolic rates and thus higher energetic costs could be associated with narrower thermal windows, a potential disadvantage to the endemic high-Antarctic fish fauna facing the challenge of climate change. ¬© 2016, The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,0.372866008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,75,NA

The abundance of the Ant4D3 subgroup, detected by a new FISH probe, was 10% of the total community and half of the gammaproteobacterial population. The Ant4D3, Polaribacter, and SAR11 subgroups accounted for the majority of the Gammaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteria-Flavobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria, respectively. Approximately 40% of the total microbial community actively incorporated leucine (added at 20 nmol L-1), while a smaller fraction (12-22%) used protein and an amino acid mixture (added at tracer concentrations). The fractions of SAR11, Polaribacter, and Ant4D3 that were active differed from each other and varied among substrates. SAR11 had the largest fraction of active cells incorporating leucine, while Polaribacter dominated the community using protein. The fraction of Ant4D3 using different compounds did not vary, but this group dominated the incorporation of amino acids, and was an abundant and active component of the bacterial community. Bacteria in the WAP region were as active as bacteria in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, even though total bacterial production was lower in the WAP. Though persistently cold (0-1¬∞C) and dominated by different bacterial taxa, the single-cell activity of this summertime Antarctic bacterial community was comparable to that of temperate communities. ¬© 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.325824287,0,NA,NA,15,NA,0,15,35,NA

Given that evolutionary adaptation has led to finely tuned traits with narrow physiological limits in these organisms, this system provides a unique opportunity to examine physiological trade-offs and limits of adaptive responses to environmental perturbation. As such, notothenioids have a rich history with respect to studies attempting to understand the vulnerability of polar ecosystems to the negative impacts associated with global climate change. Unfortunately, despite being a model system for understanding physiological adaptations to extreme environments, we still lack fundamental molecular tools for much of the Nototheniidae family.Results: Specimens of the emerald notothen, Trematomus bernacchii, were acclimated for 28 days in flow-through seawater tanks maintained near ambient seawater temperatures (-1.5¬∞C) or at +4¬∞C. Following acclimation, tissue specific cDNA libraries for liver, gill and brain were created by pooling RNA from n = 5 individuals per temperature treatment. The tissue specific libraries were bar-coded and used for 454 pyrosequencing, which yielded over 700 thousand sequencing reads. A de novo assembly and annotation of these reads produced a functional transcriptome library of T. bernacchii containing 30,107 unigenes, 13,003 of which possessed significant homology to a known protein product. Digital gene expression analysis of these extremely cold adapted fish reinforced the loss of an inducible heat shock response and allowed the preliminary exploration into other elements of the cellular stress response.Conclusions: Preliminary exploration of the transcriptome of T. bernacchii under elevated temperatures enabled a semi-quantitative comparison to prior studies aimed at characterizing the thermal response of this endemic fish whose size, abundance and distribution has established it as a pivotal species in polar research spanning several decades.The comparison of these findings to previous studies demonstrates the efficacy of transcriptomics and digital gene expression analysis as tools in future studies of polar organisms and has greatly increased the available genomic resources for the suborder Notothenioidei, particularly in the Trematominae subfamily. ¬© 2013 Huth and Place; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.252604672,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,51,NA

These permanently frozen environments harbor diverse, viable and metabolically active microbial populations that represent almost all the major phylogenetic groups. In this study, we investigated the microbial diversity in the surface snow surrounding the Concordia Research Station on the High Antarctic Plateau through a polyphasic approach, including direct prokaryotic quantification by flow cytometry and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), and phylogenetic identification by 16S RNA gene clone library sequencing and 454 16S amplicon pyrosequencing. Although the microbial abundance was low (&lt;103 cells/ml of snowmelt), concordant results were obtained with the different techniques. The microbial community was mainly composed of members of the Alpha-proteobacteria class (e.g. Kiloniellaceae and Rhodobacteraceae ), which is one of the most well-represented bacterial groups in marine habitats, Bacteroidetes (e.g. Cryomorphaceae and Flavobacteriaceae ) and Cyanobacteria. Based on our results, polar microorganisms could not only be considered as deposited airborne particles, but as an active component of the snowpack ecology of the High Antarctic Plateau. ¬© 2014 Michaud et al.",Article,Scopus,0.245545651,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,77,NA
