With the reduction of this threat in many areas, coupled with other conservation actions, some populations have demonstrated encouraging recovery, although remaining below their previous levels and undergone additional modern threats such as incidental capture in fisheries and pollution. Trends in sea turtle populations have usually been assessed through monitoring of females or nests on nesting beaches. Here we present data from a 22-year monitoring period for a juvenile green sea turtle Chelonia mydas mixed-stock in southeastern Brazil that were incidentally captured in passive non-lethal pound nets. A total of 3639 green turtles were captured in 5323 fishing days.pound‚àí1 with mortality rate of 2%. Captures occurred in all months, but bycatch rates, excluding recapture events, were higher in September and October, probably due to the recruitment of turtles migrating from southern areas, as well as recruits from the oceanic zone. Capture rates increased by 9.2% per year in the period from 1995 to 2016, in line with increasing source populations, particularly the main source contributor at Ascension Island, but also Trindade Island (Brazil) and Aves Island (Venezuela). Mean Curved Carapace Length of green turtles was higher during austral summer/early autumn and decreased markedly in May, probably due to the small-sized individuals that recruited to the study site. We show that the incidental capture of sea turtles in non-lethal fisheries, such as Brazilian pound nets, could also provide data on trends of populations nesting in distant places, and can contribute to the assessment of population status of sea turtles within Regional Management Units throughout the Atlantic Ocean. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.920929569,1,1,NA,10,5,1,10,1,5,14,NA

The total population was estimated at ‚âà260 adults. Most birds were resident on Rangatira Island in spring, summer and autumn but moved to Pitt Island during the winter. In spring birds commuted between the two islands but became resident on Rangatira when breeding commenced. Radio transmitters were attached to adult tui to monitor breeding. No radio-tagged female bred (n = 13) but at least two of three radio-tagged males raised young. Adult tui were intolerant of disturbance during nesting so estimation of productivity was made by mapping the number of fledgling groups. Flax (Phormium tenax) nectar appeared to be the most important food for breeding tui and birds travelled long distances to visit flowering plants. Fruits of ngaio (Myoporum laetum), matipo (Myrsine chathamica), karamu (Coprosma chathamica), mahoe (Melicytus chathamicus) and muehlenbeckia (Muehlenbeekia australis) were also important foods. Invertebrates were most important when females were feeding their young. The amount of breeding that occurred each season was directly related to the abundance of flax flowers in spring, and in good flax flowering years tui were able to rear two broods. In poor flax flowering years many birds did not breed. Control of feral cats on Pitt Island would most likely result in a significant increase in this breeding population; however planting of flax adjacent to the the forest areas on Chatham Island along with predator control may be necessary before tui can re-establish there. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc. 2004.",Article,Scopus,0.865944672,NA,1,NA,NA,5,,,1,5,42,NA

This study includes new data on the biological diversity and abundance of the region and research and management recommendations. We conducted surveys and over 300 research SCUBA dives among the remote Phoenix Islands: Nikumaroro (Gardner), McKean, Manra (Sydney), Kanton (Aba-Riringa), Enderbury, Orona (Hull) and Rawaki (Phoenix), only excluding Birnie Island due to time limitations. Corals, benthic and mobile invertebrates, fishes, algae, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals were surveyed at each site. Deep-sea life was sampled during seven deployments of an autonomous digital video camera system to 1,000 m depth at Kanton, Manra, and Orona. Coral reef and fish communities were surveyed using rapid assessment methods, small benthic fishes were collected using rotenone as a stunning agent, marine algae were collected by hand primarily during SCUBA dives, and a deepdrop collecting net was deployed to sample deep-sea animals. The reefs show evidence of the extreme isolation of these islands, pounded on three sides by the large ocean swells of the Pacific with only a narrow protected side to the west providing protection for anchorage. Coral species diversity of the islands was moderately high. While lacking in some corals dominant in other major reef areas, the reefs have interesting species assemblages, with prolific growth of some species normally subdominant in other reef areas. The reefs were in an excellent state of health, at the time of these surveys free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific recently and with no evidence of any coral diseases. Our data include new distribution records for species of algae, coral and fishes. Fish communities were abundant and diverse and included pelagic fishes such as tuna and oceanic mackerels. Significant populations of grey reef, whitetip reef, and blacktip reef sharks were also observed indicating a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Reef macropredators (trevally, Napoleon wrasse) were also abundant. The deep-sea camera recorded images of deep-water sharks including six-gilled and Pacific sleeper sharks. Marine mammal sightings include bottlenose dolphins, Pacific spinner dolphins, beaked whales (Mesoplodon spp.), and unidentified whales. Sea birds observed on Rawaki, McKean, Enderbury, and Orona Islands included tens of thousands of nesting spectacled terns (grey-backed), sooty terns, white fairy-terns, brown noddies, blue-grey noddies, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-footed boobies, red-tailed tropic birds, great frigate birds and lesser frigate birds. Green sea turtle nesting sites were identified on Nikumaroro, McKean and Phoenix Islands.

The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding population trends were stable. Given that seabird populations can provide valuable information on the conditions of their feeding and nesting environments, this study highlights the need to maintain basics monitoring studies. ¬© 2013 D.

Recent advances in telemetry have provided considerable information on seabird ecology, but still exclude small species, non-breeding birds and individuals from inaccessible colonies from any scientific survey. To overcome this issue and investigate seabird distribution and abundance in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA), large-scale aerial surveys were conducted in winter 2011-12 and summer 2012 over a 375,000¬†km2 area encompassing the English Channel (EC) and the Bay of Biscay (BoB). Seabird sightings, from 15 taxonomic groups, added up to 17,506 and 8263 sightings in winter and summer respectively, along 66,307¬†km. Using geostatistical methods, density maps were provided for both seasons. Abundance was estimated by strip transect sampling. Most taxa showed marked seasonal variations in their density and distribution. The highest densities were recorded during winter for most groups except shearwaters, storm-petrels, terns and large-sized gulls. Subsequently, the abundance in winter nearly reached one million individuals and was 2.5 times larger than in summer. The continental shelf and the slope in the BoB and the EC were identified as key areas for seabird conservation, especially during winter, as birds from northern Europe migrate southward after breeding. This large-scale study provided a synoptic view of the seabird community in the ENA, over two contrasting seasons. Our results highlight that oceanic areas harbour an abundant avifauna. Since most of the existing marine protected areas are restricted to the coastal fringe, the importance of oceanic areas in winter should be considered in future conservation plans. Our work will provide a baseline for the monitoring of seabird distribution at sea, and could inform the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.826886112,0,0,NA,10,5,0,10,0,5,18,NA

Other breeding populations exist in New Zealand, south-western Western Australia and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. Tagging and banding studies indicate that breeding birds of the Lord Howe Island population inhabit waters mainly to the west of the Island during October to May. Birds then migrate north to waters surrounding Japan during the Austral winter. Seabirds are attracted to the baited hooks of longline vessels and can become snagged and drown as the line sinks into the water. Observations of flesh-footed shearwater (FFS) bycatch in Australian waters have been recorded on both Japanese and domestic longline fishing vessels. Increased observer coverage between 2002 and 2004 on Australian longline vessels, in order to monitor the effectiveness of an under-water setting chute and various line-weighting regimes, showed large bycatch rates of seabirds, and in particular flesh-footed shearwaters (Baker and Wise, 2005). In addition, substantial reductions in colony size have occurred on the island due to housing development. As a consequence of these sources of additional mortality, concerns have been expressed about the population's sustainability. Australia has international and national obligations to ensure that fishery interactions with seabird populations are not deleterious to their populations. The ""incidental catch (or by-catch) of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations"" has been listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as a key threatening process for seabirds (Environment Australia, 1998). Flesh-footed shearwaters were nominated as being at risk from longline fishing. This paper presents a quantitative impact assessment that fully integrates information on the biology, foraging distributions, links to oceanography, fishing interactions (Northern and Southern Hemisphere), and potential impacts from housing on Lord Howe Island. A discrete age-, sex- and colony-structured model is developed that accounts for natural and fishing mortality, together with potential consequences from the loss of nesting habitat on Lord Howe Island. The model is able to fit to tagging data on breeding foraging distributions. These data assist the model in predicting where the birds might be when at sea. The birds' position is assumed to be a function of time of year, sea surface temperature and longitude. Using the predicted positions, the model fits to data on the observed bycatch from the Australian domestic longline fishery. These data enable the model to predict the probability of catching a bird, given various operational characteristics (e.g. setting at night). The model also fits to data from the two surveys of breeding abundance that have occurred on Lord Howe Island.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.806503312,NA,1,two surveys of abundance?,NA,5,,,1,5,63,NA

We recorded 12 species, whose ranked abundances were consistent between winter (January-February) and spring (March-April). However, five of the six commonest species were more abundant in winter than spring. Among beaches, we detected a mean of 2.6 ¬± 2.3 (SD; range: 0-9) species and 12.0 ¬± 14.1 (range: 0-62) individuals. Number of species correlated positively with total shorebird abundance. Most species' abundances varied greatlv among sites; nine taxa had aggregated spatial distributions, one species was hyper-dispersed, and two species were randomly distributed among beaches. Species composition of the shorebird community was highly nested, partly because abundant species were more widespread in their occurrence than less-numerous taxa. More species and individuals occurred at sites near Humboldt Bay, probably because high tides forced birds off their principal feeding areas within the bay to adjacent beaches. Variation in shorebird use of beaches suggests that some areas are more important to wintering and migrating shorebirds than other locations.

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.",Article,Scopus,0.761818988,NA,0,NA,NA,5,,,0,5,38,NA

Altered prey assemblages resulting from fluctuations in oceanographic conditions may be mirrored by shifts in seabird diet. Long-term studies of dietary change in seabirds therefore provide valuable insight into the nature of environmental shifts within the systems in which they forage. In recent decades, the Agulhas region in South Africa has undergone significant oceanographic change related to warming and intensification of the Agulhas current. Concurrent with this change, the population ofCape gannets Morus capensis at Bird Island, Algoa Bay, has grownrapidly, probably as a result of an increased availability of its dominant prey items, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus.Using one of the longest andmost complete time-series available on diet of a seabird (spanning 34 years), we tested for changes in composition and the abundance of dominant prey species of this population. These observed changeswere also comparedwith acoustic survey estimates of their biomass, and annual catch data. Since 1979, the prey composition has remained similar, but the dietary contribution of sardine and anchovy, which fluctuated inversely to each other, increased over the study period. These shifts seemto be reflective of fluctuations in the stock size of sardine and anchovy. Conversely, a third species, saury Scomberesox saurus, dominant in the non-breedingdiet of the 1980s, decreased significantly in dietary abundance over the following two decades. It is likely that dietary shifts of Cape gannets at Bird Island were related to climate-mediated oceanographic change. The implications of such changes are discussed. ¬© International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus,0.756822619,NA,1,NA,NA,10,1,15,1,5,29,NA

Cod, once an abundant fish species that had been commercially exploited for many decades, declined precipitously during the mid-1980s onwards. This decline was attributed to climatic changes that affected the entire food chain from zooplankton to fish, sea birds and marine mammals. A monitoring programme was introduced, sampling cod by otter trawling using research vessels. The fish, after capture, were frozen at - 20¬∞C, subsequently thawed and the digestive tract removed and examined for the parasite in 2006. Data from samples taken in 1976, 1980-81, 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2003 were compared statistically with those collected in 2006. The results indicate a decline in the prevalence and mean abundance of E. gadi in 1986 with a minimum in 2000 but increasing gradually in 2003 and 2006. These changes were coincident initially with a decline of oceanic temperature and the entire food web, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), a preferred prey of cod and primary source of E. gadi. The increase in prevalence and mean abundance of the parasite in 2006 were associated with an increase of oceanic temperature and the return of small schools of capelin to offshore areas. Cod older than 4 years harboured a greater abundance of E. gadi than younger fish, while no difference was observed between the sexes. The results suggest that the abundance of E. gadi can be useful as a bioindicator of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic. ¬© 2008 Cambridge University Press.",Article,Scopus,0.754835992,1,1,"?? abundance trends mentioned, not clear if focus but corrected unranked class to 1",15,10,1,15,1,10,24,NA

Species richness decreased most markedly with island size in the smallest islands and in open habitat species. The rarest forest species were the most extinction prone with decreasing island size. Specific habitat selection was the most prominent ecological correlate of inter island species distribution. Observed species distribution patterns did not fit the random species placement or equiprobable occurrence hypotheses. Raptors were primarily forest species, two of them restricted to forest interior, two more tolerant of fragmentation and one naturally associated with mangroves. Unexpectedly, the two rarest and most area sensitive raptors were the two smallest species with a strong active flight, whereas the most abundant and widespread species was the most forest interior and endemic taxon. Both raptor species richness, species frequency of occurrence and abundance indices decreased with island area, which was consistently tile most significant determinant of every species' occurrence and abundance. There was a significant correlation between abundance or frequency of occurrence of every raptor species and the proportion of their preferred habitat type. No relationship was found between habitat niche breadth or local abundance of any species and their distribution range among islands. The hypothesis of random composition of species assemblages on islands was not supported because of species specific habitat selection. Any evidence of interspecific competitive exclusion was limited to the striking habitat segregation of the two congeneric serpent eagles.

We found all expected 22 resident species in abundances whose rank order was very similar to results from surveys in the early 1980s. Most-common species were White Tern, Plain White-eye, Micronesian Starling, Micronesian Myzomela, and Yap Monarch. All five species were common in all three major habitats, mangroves, upland forest, and savannah, although terns nested primarily in forests. Least commonly encountered resident species were Common Cicadabird, Micronesian Pigeon, and White-throated Ground-Dove. We found one to six individuals of each of those species. We also encountered 27 species of migratory birds, including the first record for Yap of Greater Scaup. Populations of birds appeared to be about 50% lower across all resident species than estimates from 1983-1984, suggesting the possibility that Typhoon Sudall caused widespread mortality.

Compared to other sites within the region, this area showed high species richness, reflected by a total of 22 species recorded within a relatively short time frame. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by the use of estuarine mudflats and oceanic sandy beaches as feeding habitats. During low tide, more species used estuarine environments, achieving the highest total densities. Abundance patterns and assemblage composition also changed seasonally. Maximum total abundance occurred during the austral summer, and minimum total abundance during the austral winter. During the austral summer, the assemblage was dominated by Nearctic migrants such as American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica) and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). In addition, Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus) and American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) were abundant during the austral autumn. The Red Knot (Calidris canutus), a shorebird that dominated the austral autumn assemblage 25 years ago, was recorded in relatively small numbers during this study, probably reflecting the global population trend of a subspecies of the Red Knot (C. c. rufa) in the past two decades. During the austral winter, resident birds largely dominated the assemblage. However, it is noteworthy that some individuals of nine Nearctic migrant species remained in the area.

EN 1982-83 exceeded all these earlier events in strength and duration, and was the first to be investigated in more detail, both on a latitudinal gradient and including, for the first time, the benthic subsystem of the Humboldt Current upwelling area off the west coast of South America. Despite the fact that the coverage of the area of major impact (over 4,000 km of coastline) was by no means complete, and that most of the causes and mechanisms behind the observed changes remained unclear due to the lack of experimental (e.g. tolerance) studies, the observational evidence and the fluctuations observed in the landing statistics have contributed a great deal to our understanding of the way in which a major EN event affects the upwelling system as a whole. In the pelagic subsystem, a surface temperature increase of up to 11¬∞C, the effects of which could be traced down to at least 1,000 m depth, led to a tropicalization of the ecosystem, the disruption of the normal food web, and induced changes in species composition and migrations of a large number of fish and invertebrate species populations. This resulted in a general impoverishment of this system. The consequences for some commercially important species, which had already been damaged by former EN events and the impact of overfishing, were severe off Peru and Ecuador although there were certain positive effects due to the inshore migration of various oceanic mackerels and the southward migration of (sub)tropical fish species such as dolphinfish and skipjack tuna. These beneficial effects were, however, only of minor importance for the fisheries, which were not equipped to deal with the new target species. In the benthic subsystem, a factor of major importance, besides the increase in temperature, was the marked increase of dissolved oxygen at the seafloor during and after the event. Despite mass mortalities of many of the cold-water adapted invertebrate species on sandy beaches, shallow soft bottoms and in the rocky intertidal zone, the overall effect on fisheries was rather positive. In the case of commercially exploited shellfish (‚Äúmariscos‚Äù), this was due to an increased immigration of subtropical species, mostly crustaceans, as well as increases in abundance of some local species more tolerant of warm water such as the Peruvian scallop. This led to an unprecedented boom of some fisheries on the northern and central Peruvian coast. For the demersal fisheries and the artisanal finfish fishery, the immediate effects of EN were detrimental due to a general dispersal and downslope migration of many species, but the long-term effects appeared to have been beneficial: improved feeding conditions at the seafloor and decreased fishing pressure caused a major recruitment success of some species such as Pacific hake, and this may provide increased catches several years after EN. The primary EN effects described in this review apparently induced many secondary effects. The disruption of the pelagic food web caused mortalities and reproductive failures of guano birds and seals; mortalities (including marine algae) and increases in population abundance in shallow water led to temporary changes in species composition and successional processes that remain to be studied in more detail. On the whole, however, recovery of most species occurred rapidly, and relatively few long-term effects have remained, demonstrating the remarkable resilience of the upwelling ecosystem. ¬© 1990, Elsevier B.V.

Of 15 common birds, four were significantly more abundant in primary forest (blue-tailed imperial pigeon Ducula concinna, northern fantail Rhipidura rufiventris, golden whistler Pachycephala pectoralis and red-chested flowerpecker Dicaeum maugei) and one (scaly-breasted honeyeater Lichmera squamata) was more abundant in garden habitat. Incidental observations provided further evidence that many forest specialists (including the island endemic Damar flycatcher Ficedula henrici) rarely, if ever, used garden habitats notwithstanding its relative proximity. The number of resident birds recorded in 2001 (39) was similar to the 1890s (38), but six forest-dependent passerines were extirpated between samples. These losses are associated with the conversion of 25% of the primary forest to modified habitat since the 1890s, but given the sparse species and environmental change data available it is impossible to definitively pinpoint this as the only cause underlying the species losses. This study demonstrates that remote and relatively well-forested islands are not immune to the threatening processes impacting bird populations elsewhere in South-East Asia. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Muttonbirders concerned at ensuring that the hunt remains viable for coming generations have provided catch records to help ascertain historic trends in hunt success. Analysis of eight catch diaries for a 67-year period demonstrates considerable consistency across diaries in the variability of hunt success, as measured by annualized mean daily hunt tallies. A conservative estimate of the overall annual decline in hunt success is-1.89% (95% CI:-1.14% to-2.65%). Birders' observations of a changing relationship between chick quality and hunt success was evidenced across diaries. Reduced hunt success from the 1990s indicates that possible adult ""knockdowns"" and/or sustained substantial reductions in breeding proportions have occurred. Chick size has remained constant, suggesting little change in the provisioning environment. Catch per unit effort data, provided by a single diary, confirms a link between variability in annual hunt success and chick abundance. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are correlated with hunt success and chick size, respectively. Interannual PDO+ (or PDO-) values are correlated with higher (or lower) tallies, whereas SAM+ (or SAM -) values are associated with larger (or smaller) chick size. Uncertainty in the relationship between the breeding Sooty Shearwater population, chick catch, and environmental perturbation in their feeding grounds could be reduced with the inclusion of hunt time in all diary records. Ongoing prolonged decline in a top-trophic-level predator such as the Sooty Shearwater raises serious concern that long-term oceanic changes have been occurring and that long-term sustainability of muttonbirding is in doubt. ¬© 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.707019582,NA,1,NA,NA,15,,,1,15,60,NA

We tested this hypothesis by modeling nitrate input through upwelling to the upper layers of the ocean off Peru between 6¬∞ and 14¬∞S using data on wind stress and sea surface temperature. The model predicted the amount of carbon fixed by primary production each year from 1925 to 2000, which was then apportioned to the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass and ultimately to the seabird population and the anchovy fishery, the largest single-species fishery on Earth. The model predicted a marked increase in primary production as a consequence of increasing wind stress. It overestimated the anchovy biomass after the collapse of the fishery in 1972, but closely predicted the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to the mid-1960s, and their decline thereafter, explaining about 94% of the variation in seabird numbers from 1925 to 2000. The model indicates the seabirds consumed 14.4% of the available anchovies and, thus, that seabirds consumed 2.3% of the new production, before the development of the anchovy fishery, and only 2.2% of the available anchovies and 0.3% of the new production after the development of the fishery. The model results clarify the roles that environmental and anthropogenic factors may have had in regulating the guano-producing seabird populations. It indicates that the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to 1955 was likely a response to increased productivity of the Peruvian upwelling system and that the subsequent drastic decline in seabird abundance was likely due to competition for food with the fishery, which caught ‚àº85% of the anchovies, which otherwise would have been available for the seabirds.

Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4. Other factors may interact with the availability of food for nestlings to limit the populations of resident birds below carrying capacities set by non-breeding season arthropod abundance, thereby creating a set of resources available to non-breeding migrants. ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.696474003,0,0,NA,5,15,0,5,0,15,4,NA

Intense exploitation over the past 65 years by a rapidly expanding high-seas fishing fleet has left many populations depleted, with consequences at the ecosystem level due to top-down control and trophic cascades. Despite increases in both CITES and IUCN Red Listings, the demographic trajectories of oceanic sharks and billfish are poorly quantified and resolved at geographic and population levels. Amongst MOFS trajectories, those of tunas are generally considered better understood, yet several populations remain either overfished or of unknown status. MOFS population trends and declines therefore remain contentious, partly due to challenges in deriving accurate abundance and biomass indices. Two major management strategies are currently recognised to address conservation issues surrounding MOFS: (i) internationally ratified legal frameworks and their associated regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs); and (ii) spatio-temporal fishery closures, including no-take marine protected areas (MPAs). In this context, we first review fishery-dependent studies relying on data derived from catch records and from material accessible through fishing extraction, under the umbrella of RFMO-administrated management. Challenges in interpreting catch statistics notwithstanding, we find that fishery-dependent studies have enhanced the accuracy of biomass indices and the management strategies they inform, by addressing biases in reporting and non-random effort, and predicting drivers of spatial variability across meso- and oceanic scales in order to inform stock assessments. By contrast and motivated by the increase in global MPA coverage restricting extractive activities, we then detail ways in which fishery-independent methods are increasingly improving and steering management by exploring facets of MOFS ecology thus far poorly grasped. Advances in telemetry are increasingly used to explore ontogenic and seasonal movements, and provide means to consider MOFS migration corridors and residency patterns. The characterisation of trophic relationships and prey distribution through biochemical analysis and hydro-acoustics surveys has enabled the tracking of dietary shifts and mapping of high-quality foraging grounds. We conclude that while a scientific framework is available to inform initial design and subsequent implementation of MPAs, there is a shortage in the capacity to answer basic but critical questions about MOFS ecology (who, when, where?) required to track populations non-extractively, thereby presenting a barrier to assessing empirically the performance of MPA-based management for MOFS. This sampling gap is exacerbated by the increased establishment of large (&gt;10000 km2) and very large MPAs (VLMPAs, &gt;100000 km2) - great expanses of ocean lacking effective monitoring strategies and survey regimes appropriate to those scales. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate the use of a non-extractive protocol to measure MOFS population recovery and MPA efficiency. We further identify technological avenues for monitoring at the VLMPA scale, through the use of spotter planes, drones, satellite technology, and horizontal acoustics, and highlight their relevance to the ecosystem-based framework of MOFS management. ¬© 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",Article,Scopus,0.692280096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,1,15,61,NA

We describe the ecological studies and the conservation actions taken between 1985 and 1992 on Cousin Island (29 ha, Seychelles) to safeguard the future of the highly threatened Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), which until 1988 only occurred on this island. A detailed field study was designed to (1) identify the key processes influencing warbler demography, (2) identify appropriate management techniques to increase the warbler population, and (3), assess the influence of the resulting habitat management. Since 1980 the island has been saturated with c. 115 territories and c. 320 birds. The warbler is purely insectivorous. Morinda (Morinda citrifolia), the most insect rich tree, is preferred for foraging. The higher the insect abundance (and Morinda cover) in territories the higher the reproductive success and survival of warblers. Insect numbers were highest in the central part of Cousin and decreased towards the coast. Coastal territories protected by a salt tolerant hedge of Scaevola (Scaevola taccada) had more insects and higher reproductive success than unprotected territories. Between 1990 and 1992 Morinda trees were planted on the island and Scaevola along the coast. Although these habitat restoration measures have not resulted in higher numbers of adult warblers and territories due to habitat saturation, they have been successful in terms of improving the quality of existing breeding territories and with that the reproductive success of breeding birds (including the number of territories producing recruits), and the exchange of individuals (genetic material) between territories. We provide evidence that the high reproductive potential of this species is likely to improve the resilience of the species to catastrophic events. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Near-surface temperature (5 m depth) fluctuated considerably from year to year, in part due to the timing of the survey, with an early survey in 1996 and a late survey in 2002. Many species were observed across the entire gradient, particularly procellariiform (tubenose) seabirds and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). We observed peaks in abundance in the oceanic zone in 1998, 2001, and 2002, owing primarily to influxes of dark shearwaters (Puffinus spp.) and Leach's storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leuchora). Rank correlations indicated similar year-to-year changes in density between species, and species-specific responses to temperature and ocean productivity as indexed by nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations. We developed topographic/bathymetric models of habitat selection for the coastal zone. Although we found some distinct habitat preferences in this zone, overall we observed a continuum in the marine bird and mammal community across the entire eastern GOA. The strength of the coupling between coastal and oceanic environments as provided by variation in top predator dispersion appears related to large-scale variations in oceanography, though we have yet to fully investigate causal mechanisms. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Location: The seven main islands of the Canary archipelago. Methods: We obtained field data on population density, habitat breadth and landscape distribution in Tenerife, Fuerteventura and La Palma, aiming to sample all available habitats and the gradient of altitudes. In total, 1715 line transects of 0.5 km were carried out during the breeding season. We also reviewed the literature for data on occupancy, the distance between the Canary Islands and the nearest distribution border on the mainland, body size and endemicity of the 48 terrestrial bird species studied. Phylogenetic eigenvector regression was used to quantify (and to control for) the amount of phylogenetic signal. Results: The two measurements of occupancy (number of occupied islands or 10 x 10 km UTM squares) were tightly correlated and produced very similar results. The occupancy of the terrestrial birds of the Canary Islands during the breeding season had a very low phylogenetic effect. Species with broader habitat breadth, stronger preferences for urban environments, smaller body size, and a lower degree of endemicity had a broader geographical distribution in the archipelago, occupying a larger number of islands and 10 x 10 UTM squares. Main conclusions: The habitat-generalist species with a tolerance for novel urban environments tend to be present on more islands and to occupy a greater area, whereas large-sized species that are genetically differentiated within the islands are less widespread. Therefore, some properties of the ranges of these species are explicable from basic biological features. A positive relationship of range size with local abundance, previously shown in continental studies, was not found, probably because it relies on free dispersal on continuous landmasses, which may not be applicable on oceanic islands. ¬© 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.670918387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,35,NA

Inshore, the ecological role of demersal fish is more important than that of krill. There, demersal fish are major consumers of benthos and also feed on zooplankton (mainly krill in summer). They are links between lower and upper levels of the food web and are common prey of other fish, birds and seals. Offshore, demersal fish depend less on benthos and feed more on zooplankton (mainly krill) and nekton, and are less accessible as prey of birds and seals. There, pelagic fish (especially lantern fish) are more abundant than inshore and play an important role in the energy flow from macrozooplankton to higher trophic levels (seabirds and seals). Through the higher fish predators, energy is transferred to land in the form of fish remains, pellets (birds), regurgitation and faeces (birds and seals). However, in the general context of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, krill (Euphausia superba) plays the central role in the food web because it is the main food source in terms of biomass for most of the high level predators from demersal fish up to whales. This has no obvious equivalent in other marine ecosystems. In Antarctic offshore coastal and oceanic waters the greatest proportion of energy from the ecosystem is transferred to land directly through krill consumers, such as flying birds, penguins, and seals. Beside krill, the populations of fish in the Antarctic Ocean are the second most important element for higher predators, in particular the energy-rich pelagic Myctophidae in open waters and the pelagic Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the high Antarctic zone. Although the occurrence of these pelagic fish inshore has been poorly documented, their abundance in neritic waters could be higher than previously believed.",Review,Scopus,0.67079463,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,47,NA

In spite of the tentative nature of such an estimate, the difference with the colony-derived figure strongly suggests the existence of large, currently undiscovered colonies, particularly in western Antarctica and Victoria Land, where a complete mismatch exists between bird observations at sea and known colonies. In eastern Antarctica, in addition to undiscovered colonies, some known ones could be considerably larger than currently documented.",Review,Scopus,0.654176601,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,41,NA

Numerical dominance is often cited as key to the ability of exotic ants to displace native ant species, reduce the abundance of invertebrates and negatively impact upon bird, land crab and other vertebrate populations. On Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, the yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes (Jerdon), forms supercolonies, where extremely high densities of foraging ants have contributed to 'invasional meltdown' in rainforest areas. Densities of up to 2254 foraging ants per m2 and a biomass of 1.85 g per m2 were recorded, and nest densities reached 10.5 nest entrances per m2. Populations of A. gracilipes can overcome and kill red endemic land crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis) over 100 times their own biomass. This is the highest recorded density of foraging ants, and adds another element to the definition of 'supercolony' of unicolonial ants. This paper documents one extreme in a continuum of densities of unicolonial, invasive ant species and highlights the need to incorporate forager densities into invasive ant research. ¬© Birkh√§user Verlag, 2005.",Article,Scopus,0.653710583,0,NA,NA,10,NA,0,10,,,16,NA

The Gal√°pagos Rail Laterallus spilonotus, endemic to the Gal√°pagos Archipelago, is presently known to occur on just four of its seven previously occupied islands and is facing multiple threats to its persistence. In this study, we compared the rail's occurrence and abundance at 193 survey points between 2000 and 2007 on Santa Cruz Island and examined the influence of an invasion of the habitat of the species by the exotic Red-barked Quinine Tree Cinchona pubescens. We detected a 13% reduction in rail occurrence and a 31% reduction in abundance between 2000 and 2007. Rail abundance declined more in low elevation areas (< 719 m) and outside of Cinchona pubescens removal areas but not in areas where Cinchona pubescens was removed.

During the non-upwelling period, auklets fed on the small, energetically interior, oceanic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica, but following the spring transition, the auklets switched to small, juvenile fish (mostly Sebastes spp.) until these had grown too large for capture. Thereafter, the auklets switched to the larger and energetically more valuable euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera, which had become available upon the onset of upwelling. This general pattern was repeated each year, although some between-year variability among ancillary prey was evident. Auklet foraging locality, however, varied only slightly throughout the year; auklets were most dispersed during El Nino. It was apparent that the availability of T. spinifera was linked to upwelling, the decrease in the prevalence of T. spinifera in the diet fed to chicks from 1971 to 1991 is consisted with decreased intensity of upwelling in the region, as is the reduction in numbers of auklets in the region over the same period.

We assessed this possibility in the Seattle, WA, USA region by correlating 10 years of bird richness and relative abundance of nine guilds indicative of their tolerance of human development, migration, diet and use of human food subsidies with an annual index of forest productivity (vegetation greenness derived from a 250 m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product from the MODIS satellite) and weather (variation in the Oceanic Ni√±o Index, which estimates the strength of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, a major driver of local temperature and precipitation). We found that variation in NDVI exerted a strong influence on the richness of the avian community and the abundance of guilds in landscapes undergoing active development, but was less influential in areas of established housing development or forested reserves. Relative to NDVI, weather was much less influential on the abundance of guilds at actively changing sites, and slightly more influential in forest reserves and established developments. Following the warm winter and during the dry summer associated with a strong El Ni√±o, migrants and herbivores declined in changing landscapes, insectivores declined in established developments, and herbivores declined while synanthropic species increased in reserves. These changes may presage the effects of climate change in the Pacific Northwest, which are expected to be similar to El Ni√±o conditions.

In this study, we combined tracking data and dietary data from individual Cory's shearwaters Calonectris borealis (n = 68) breeding in Selvagens archipelago, Madeira, Portugal, during the chick-rearing periods of 2011 and 2016, in order to infer prey origin within shearwaters‚Äô main foraging areas. The digestion state of each prey item in the diet was assessed and classified; and compared to digestion states from known prey items fed to captive birds. In a novel approach, we combined tracking data with information on the prey digestion duration and data on the transit times from foraging grounds to the colony to estimate the location of prey capture. We found a consistent heterogeneity in prey distribution across four different marine domains: Selvagens, deep-sea, seamounts, and continental shelf. In oceanic areas, the chub mackerel Scomber colias, the main prey of Cory's shearwaters, was strongly associated with seamounts and insular shelves, whereas oceanic species like pilot-fish, flying-squid, flying-fish were clearly associated with deep-sea waters. Sardines Sardina pilchardus, anchovies Engraulis encrasicolus and other coastal species were associated with the African shelf. Prey origin assignment was robust across three different sets of assumptions, and was also supported by information on the digestion state of prey collected over a large independent sampling period (671 samples, collected in 2008‚Äì2010).

Evidence was collected which showed that the two westerly islands of Java and Bali share a relatively similar bird fauna, but this differs noticeably from the bird life found more to the east. The conspicuous faunal break which occurs between Bali and Lombok appears to represent a transition from a rich fauna associated with the large continental island of Java, to a somewhat impoverished fauna of the outlying oceanic islands. Marked differences in habitat on the four islands were considered to be primarily important in dictating this change. Using frequency and abundance estimates for the different bird families it was shown that Java and Bali have a preponderance of Oriental (Asian) birds while Lombok and Sumbawa have more conspicuous Australian elements. However, when the presence or absence of species or families alone are considered all four islands have more Oriental types. It seems that a small range of Australian species including honey eaters, wood swallows, zebra finches and parrots are relatively abundant on Lombok and Sumbawa, and are a sufficiently conspicuous feature of the fauna east of Wallace's Line to impress the visitor that he has entered Australasia.

Determining the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems requires understanding the direct effects on all trophic levels as well as indirect effects mediated by trophic coupling. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of climate change on the pelagic food web in the Celtic Sea, a productive shelf region in the Northeast Atlantic. Using long-term data, we examined possible direct and indirect 'bottom-up' climate effects across four trophic levels: phytoplankton, zooplankton, mid-trophic level fish and seabirds. During the period 1986-2007, although there was no temporal trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), the decadal mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Celtic Sea increased by 0.66¬±0.02¬∞C. Despite this, there was only a weak signal of climate change in the Celtic Sea food web. Changes in plankton community structure were found, however this was not related to SST or NAO. A negative relationship occurred between herring abundance (0- and 1-group) and spring SST (0-group: p = 0.02, slope = -0.305¬±0.125; 1-group: p = 0.04, slope = -0.410¬±0.193). Seabird demographics showed complex species-specific responses. There was evidence of direct effects of spring NAO (on black-legged kittiwake population growth rate: p = 0.03, slope = 0.0314¬±0.014) as well as indirect bottom-up effects of lagged spring SST (on razorbill breeding success: p = 0.01, slope = -0.144¬±0.05). Negative relationships between breeding success and population growth rate of razorbills and common guillemots may be explained by interactions between mid-trophic level fish. Our findings show that the impacts of climate change on the Celtic Sea ecosystem is not as marked as in nearby regions (e.g. the North Sea), emphasizing the need for more research at regional scales. ¬© 2012 Lauria et al.",Article,Scopus,0.615410298,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,59,NA

High trophic-level organisms are influenced by fluctuations of prey quality and abundance, which themselves may depend on climate oscillations. Modeling effects of such fluctuations is challenging because prey populations may vary with multiple climate oscillations occurring at different time scales. The analysis of a 28-yr time series of capture‚Äìrecapture data of a tropical seabird, the Nazca Booby (Sula granti), in the Gal√°pagos, Ecuador, allowed us to test for demographic effects of two major ocean oscillations occurring at distinct time-scales: the inter-annual El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and inter-decadal oscillations. As expected for a tropical seabird, survival of fledgling birds was highly affected by extreme ENSO events; by contrast, neither recruitment nor breeding participation were affected by either ENSO or decadal oscillations. More interesting, adult survival, a demographic trait that canalizes response to environmental variations, was unaffected by inter-annual ENSO oscillations yet was shaped by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and small pelagic fish regime. Adult survival decreased during oceanic conditions associated with higher breeding success, an association probably mediated in this species by costs of reproduction that reduce survival when breeding attempts end later. To our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that survival of a vertebrate can be vulnerable to a natural multidecadal oscillation. ¬© 2018 by the Ecological Society of America",Article,Scopus,0.615236944,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,31,NA

Off the coast of British Columbia, warm SSTs have persisted through the last two decades. Based on 16 years of reproductive data collected between 1975 and 2002, we show that the extreme variation in reproductive performance exhibited by tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) was related to changes in SST both within and among seasons. Especially warm SSTs corresponded with drastically decreased growth rates and fledging success of puffin nestlings. Puffins may partially compensate for within-season changes associated with SST by adjusting their breeding phenology, yet our data also suggest that they are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change at this site and may serve as a valuable indicator of biological change in the North Pacific.

We deployed data loggers to track foraging movements and feeding locations, and collected blood and diet samples from each individual after each foraging excursion. We also measured the isotopic signatures of the main prey species for each population. Analysis of stomach regurgitations showed that Trachurus picturatus was the main prey for populations exploiting oceanic environments (Azores and Desertas); Sardina pilchardus and Belone belone dominated the diet of birds feeding in neritic areas (Berlengas); and Trachurus trachurus, Scomber sp. and Exocoetus volitans were important for birds exploiting both neritic and oceanic areas (Selvagens).

Even the signatures of geographically different populations that fed in the same oceanic regions were similar. The Œ¥15N signature was negatively correlated with the abundance of cephalopods in the diet. Results from a stable isotopic mixing model estimated higher proportions of cephalopods in the birds' diet than proportions obtained by direct diet inferences, presumably due to the advanced digestion stage of cephalopods in the regurgitations. Our findings should have broader relevance to the study of foraging ecology of other top marine predators in the north Atlantic region.

Feral cats are generally believed to vary their diet according to prey availability; however, no previous studies of diet have tested this hypothesis on insular ecosystems with a limited range of available prey. Because domestic cats kill prey independently of hunger, the spatial extent of their impact on wildlife will be influenced by home-range size. In this study, we combined dietary information with cat movements to assess the impacts of feral and domestic cats on island biodiversity. We quantified the diet of cats from scat samples collected across one year and tested whether diet varies by season. The abundance of main prey categories was also estimated to document seasonal variation in prey availability for cats. Finally, we tracked domestic cats by global positioning system units in all four seasons to examine whether home-range patterns varied seasonally. The diet of cats constituted three prey groups (rodents, birds and invertebrates), and the seasonal variation in consumption of each taxon matched the seasonal variation in prey availability, thus supporting the generalist behaviour of cats on oceanic islands. Roaming behaviour varied among individuals and across seasons, but could not be explained by availability of prey. Unconfined cats had larger home-ranges than confined cats, but most domestic cats strayed <1km from home. Thus, confinement of domestic cats might reduce the spatial extent of cat impact on native prey populations on oceanic islands. ¬© 2013 The Zoological Society of London.",Article,Scopus,0.589121745,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,32,NA

Northern and middle latitude populations had lower mean back-calculated lengths at age 1, lower growth coefficients, and greater longevity than southern and Kansas populations.

Fifteen out of the 19 study areas are managed as Natural Forest Reserves and the remaining four were included due to their importance as indigenous forest cover. Four of the 19 areas are not included in the European Conservation network, NATURA 2000. Two sampling replicates were run per study area, and a total of 191 species were collected; 43 of those species (23%) are endemic to the archipelago and 12 have yet to be described. To produce an unbiased multiple-criteria index (importance value for conservation, IV-C) incorporating diversity and rarity based indices, an iterative partial multiple regression analysis was performed. In addition, an irreplaceability index and the complementarity method (using both optimisation and heuristic methods) were used for priority-reserves analyses. It was concluded that at least one well-managed reserve per island is absolutely necessary to have a good fraction of the endemic arthropods preserved. We found that for presence/absence data the suboptimal complementarity algorithm provides solutions as good as the optimal algorithm. For abundance data, optimal solutions indicate that most reserves are needed if we want that at least 50% of endemic arthropod populations are represented in a minimum set of reserves. Consistently, two of the four areas not included in the NATURA 2000 framework were considered of high priority, indicating that vascular plants and bird species used to determine NATURA 2000 sites are not good surrogates of arthropod diversity in the Azores. The most irreplaceable reserves are those located in older islands, which indicates that geological history plays an important role in explaining faunal diversity of arthropods in the Azores. Based both on the uniqueness of species composition and high species richness, conservation efforts should be focused on the unmanaged Pico Alto region in the archipelago's oldest island, Santa Maria. ¬© Springer 2005.",Article,Scopus,0.578133725,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,46,NA

The eastern tropical Pacific supports on the order of 50 species of seabirds and 30 species of cetaceans as regular residents; these include four endemic species, the world's largest populations for several others, three endemic sub-species, and a multi-species community that is relatively unique to this ecosystem. Three of the meso-scale physical features of the region are particularly significant to seabirds and cetaceans: the Costa Rica Dome for blue whales and short-beaked common dolphins, the Equatorial Front for planktivorous seabirds, and the countercurrent thermocline ridge for flocking seabirds that associate with mixed-species schools of spotted and spinner dolphins and yellowfin tuna. A few qualitative studies of meso- to macro-scale distribution patterns have indicated that some seabirds and cetaceans have species-specific preferences for surface currents. More common are associations with distinct water masses; these relationships have been quantified for a number of species using several different analytical methods. The mechanisms underlying tropical species-habitat relationships are not well understood, in contrast to a number of higher-latitude systems. This may be due to the fact that physical variables have been used as proxies for prey abundance and distribution in species-habitat research in the eastern tropical Pacific. Though seasonal and interannual patterns tend to be complex, species-habitat relationships appear to remain relatively stable over time, and distribution patterns co-vary with patterns of preferred habitat for a number of species. The interactions between seasonal and interannual variation in oceanographic conditions with seasonal patterns in the biology of seabirds and cetaceans may account for some of the complexity in species-habitat relationship patterns. Little work has been done to investigate effects of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation cycles on cetaceans, and results of the few studies focusing on oceanic seabirds are complex and not easy to interpret. Although much has been made of the detrimental effects of El Ni√±o events on apex predators, more research is needed to understand the magnitude, and even direction, of these effects on seabirds and cetaceans in space and time. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated variation in the √§ 13C and √§ 15N ratios of a sedentary, rocky shore predator, the African black oystercatcher Haematopus moquini, over ~2000 km of the southern African coastline, which is characterized by strong biogeographic patterns in primary productivity and intertidal communities. Blood and feathers from breeding adults and chicks and muscle tissues from primary prey items (mussels and limpets) were sampled between southern Namibia and the southeast coast of South Africa. 15N enrichment was observed between the southeast and west coasts in oystercatcher tissues and their prey, mirroring an isotope shift between the oligotrophic Agulhas Current on the east coast and the eutrophic Benguela upwelling system on the west coast. Oystercatcher blood showed √§13C values that varied between those of the carbon-depleted mussels and the carbon-enriched limpets along the coastline, which reflected changes in the proportion of grazers and filter feeders in the oystercatcher diet across the sampling range. The geographic shift in diet, dominated by mussels on the west coast and composed of mixed proportions of mussels and limpets on the southeast coasts, strongly reflected regionally high abundances of the invasive Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Finally, isotope signatures of blood and feathers displayed a strong correlation throughout the study area, indicating seasonal stability in environmental conditions and feeding habits of the adults. There were, however, local discrepancies on the south coast that indicated movement of adults occurred outside the breeding season possibly in response to a lower abundance of food in this region. Overall, the results indicate that the influence of regional oceanic conditions on the base of the food web can penetrate to the predator level, but that local effects can be incorporated within this pattern. ¬© Inter-Research 2011.",Article,Scopus,0.571155297,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,45,NA

Understanding the foraging ecology of these species in the Southern Ocean is important for monitoring and ecosystem conservation and management. Methodology/Principal Findings: Tracking data from sooty and short-tailed shearwaters from three regions of New Zealand and Australia were combined with at-sea observations of shearwaters in the Southern Ocean, physical oceanography, nearsurface copepod distributions, pelagic trawl data, and synoptic near-surface winds. Shearwaters from all three regions foraged in the Polar Front zone, and showed particular overlap in the region around 140¬∞E. Short-tailed shearwaters from South Australia also foraged in Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front. The spatial distribution of shearwater foraging effort in the Polar Front zone was matched by patterns in large-scale upwelling, primary production, and abundances of copepods and myctophid fish. Oceanic winds were found to be broad determinants of foraging distribution, and of the flight paths taken by the birds on long foraging trips to Antarctic waters. Conclusions/Significance: The shearwaters displayed foraging site fidelity and overlap of foraging habitat between species and populations that may enhance their utility as indicators of Southern Ocean ecosystems. The results highlight the importance of upwellings due to interactions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with large-scale bottom topography, and the corresponding localised increases in the productivity of the Polar Front ecosystem. ¬© 2010 Raymond et al.",Article,Scopus,0.569686661,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,37,NA

Landscape ecologists expect similar relations with habitat patches in a terrestrial matrix. Yet in neither situation is there adequate empirical information to permit conclusions about the prevalence of such effects. To test the hypothesis that intercept-related patch variables influence community structure on the landscape scale, we studied relations between the richness and abundance of cavity-nesting birds and patch shape, size, and orientation relative to a northerly migration path. The influences of other patch features on nest abundances were removed analytically. Multiple regression indicated that the mean and total number of nesting species, and nest abundances for migrants were significantly associated with patch orientation or a patch area x orientation interaction, but not patch shape. Nest abundances for permanent residents were not associated with patch shape or orientation, although area effects, possibly reflecting dispersal interception, were evident. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that stochastic interception of migrating or dispersing organisms influences patch community structure. In addition to richness and abundance effects apparent in this analysis, the sex ratio, age structure, growth rate, social structure, and genetic features of patch populations may also be influenced. The interception of moving organisms by patches may thus be a key factor influencing population and community persistence in reserves. If so, landscape structure could be manipulated to maximize the interception of dispersing or migrating organisms, or minimize it if the effects are undesirable. ¬© 1992 SPB Academic Publishing bv.",Article,Scopus,0.568742174,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,49,NA

Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Friugilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively.

If island restoration is to be attempted, the way island biota originate and the precise effects of introduced organisms must be identified. Plants introduced to the New Zealand archipelago may have transitory effects, but others may modify forest structure and disrupt succession. Goats have been the most destructive introduced herbivore on islands. Among introduced predators, cats have extirpated colonies of seabirds, and rats (depending on species) affect invertebrates, lizards, and birds. Ecological theories and concepts that may help with island restoration projects include: the keystone species concept, in which the effects of one species on others is disproportionate relative to its abundance; the ""intermediate predator"" hypothesis, where removal of the top introduced predator may lead to rebound effects of intermediate predators; and ecological chain reactions, where local extinction of some species can cause complicated multiple effects. Problems with restoration of islands may be encountered because of meagre data on the previous effects of pests (such as predators), use of non-seral species in revegetation projects, proliferations of indigenous or introduced species that have unforeseen community effects, and inexplicable difficulties with some translocations. A restoration case study in the continental Mercury Islands and on Cuvier Island showed success with removal of introduced mammals and demonstrates the various effects of introduced browsers, grazers, and predators. A contrasting case study is provided by oceanic Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands where 22 species of avifauna have been lost, seven as permanent extinctions. Restoration targets for some New Zealand islands can be clarified by palaeoecological studies of Maori (Polynesian) middens and natural deposits. Understanding the role of disturbance in island systems may also help clarify restoration targets. When exotic keystone species are introduced, physical disturbance may be overridden by biotic disturbance. This replacement in turn has implications for trophic structure. With high levels of biotic disturbance, continental islands may be changed from relatively species-rich bottom-up food webs to species-poor top-down trophic cascades. These possibilities can be tested with an experimental approach to restoration, although such experiments may be hard to interpret because of difficulties with replicates and controls. Ecological restoration en New Zealand islands has potential to replace damaged or lost communities, expand the ranges of relict populations, reduce the selective influence of exotic (keystone) species on indigenous species, help in understanding how the systems are formed, provide opportunities for educational and scientific investigation, and act as a testing ground for new technologies against pests.",Article,Scopus,0.54576499,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,73,NA

We introduce a robust modeling approach to link Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) abundance and distribution to large-scale and local oceanic and atmospheric conditions and relate these patterns to similarly modeled distributions of an important prey resource, krill. We carried out at-sea strip transect bird surveys and hydroacoustic assessments of euphausiids (2004-2013). Data informed separate, spatially-explicit predictive models of Cassin's auklet abundance (zero-inflated negative binomial regression) and krill biomass (two-part model) based on these surveys. We established the type of prey responsible for acoustic backscatter by conducting net tows of the upper 50 m during surveys. We determined the types of prey fed to Cassin's auklet chicks by collecting diet samples from provisioning adults. Using time-depth-recorders, we found Cassin's auklets utilized consistent areas in the upper water column, less than 30 m, where krill could be found (99.5% of dives were less than 30 m). Birds primarily preyed upon two species of euphausiids, Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, which were available in the upper water column. Cassin's auklet abundance was best predicted by both large scale and localized oceanic processes (upwelling) while krill biomass was best predicted by local factors (temperature, salinity, and fluorescence) and both large scale and localized oceanic processes (upwelling). Models predicted varying krill and bird distribution by month and year. Our work informs the use of Cassin's auklet as a valuable indicator or krill abundance and distribution and strengthens our understanding of the link between Cassin's auklet and its primary prey. We expect future increases in frequency and magnitude of anomalous ocean conditions will result in decreased availability of krill leading to declines in the Farallon Islands population of Cassin's auklets. ¬© 2015 Manugianet al.

Iceland is located in the North Atlantic Ocean with subpolar oceanic climate. During the past 3-4 decades, average temperature has increased, supporting more favourable conditions for ticks. Reports of I. ricinus have increased in recent years. If these ticks were able to establish in a changing climate, Iceland may face new threats posed by tick-borne diseases. Methods: Active field surveillance by tick flagging was conducted at 111 sites around Iceland from August 2015 to September 2016. Longworth mammal traps were used to trap Apodemus sylvaticus in southwestern and southern Iceland. Surveillance on tick importation by migratory birds was conducted in southeastern Iceland, using bird nets and a Heligoland trap. Vulpes lagopus carcasses from all regions of the country were inspected for ticks. In addition, existing and new passive surveillance data from two institutes have been merged and are presented. Continental probability of presence models were produced. Boosted Regression Trees spatial modelling methods and its predictions were assessed against reported presence. Results: By field sampling 26 questing I. ricinus ticks (7 males, 3 females and 16 nymphs) were collected from vegetation from three locations in southern and southeastern Iceland. Four ticks were found on migratory birds at their arrival in May 2016. A total of 52 A. sylvaticus were live-trapped but no ticks were found nor on 315 V. lagopus carcasses. Passive surveillance data collected since 1976, reports further 214 I. ricinus ticks from 202 records, with an increase of submissions in recent years. The continental probability of presence model correctly predicts approximately 75% of the recorded presences, but fails to predict a fairly specific category of recorded presence in areas where the records are probably opportunistic and not likely to lead to establishment. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first finding of questing I. ricinus ticks in Iceland. The species could possibly be established locally in Iceland in low abundance, although no questing larvae have yet been detected to confirm established populations. Submitted tick records have increased recently, which may reflect an increase in exposure, or in interest in ticks. Furthermore, the amount of records on dogs, cats and humans indicate that ticks were acquired locally, presenting a local biting risk. Tick findings on migratory birds highlight a possible route of importation. Obtaining questing larvae is now a priority to confirm that I. ricinus populations are established in Iceland. Further surveys on wild mammals (e.g. Rangifer tarandus), livestock and migratory birds are recommended to better understand their role as potential hosts for I. ricinus. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,0.515851262,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,72,NA

In contrast, ecology has not discovered the pattern of stability with the complement of richness, which is evenness of species abundances. The job has been more difficult because many measures of species diversity combine richness with evenness. Questions: Does the correlation of richness with stability occur in natural systems? What is the relationship of evenness to stability? Does diversity increase or decrease the stability of individual species populations? What mechanisms explain the relationships, if any, between diversity and stability? Data: The 1966-2009 results of 1676 North American Breeding Bird (BBS) survey routes across the USA and Canada. Altogether, 617 bird species were registered with an average of 105 species observed per route. Climate variables were taken from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Climate Services Canada databases. Analytical methods: Disentangle richness from evenness and study their separate effects on stability. Perform statistical analysis of biological variables developed from the BBS data. Control for biological and climatic influences. Results: Both the number of bird species and the evenness of their distributions positively affect the stability of entire bird communities. But richness and evenness do so through a contrasting set of mechanisms. Also, richness and evenness both positively affect the stability of individual populations. The link between evenness and mean population stability can be partly, but not completely, explained in terms of a previously established relationship between the mean and variance of abundance known as Taylor's Law. ¬© 2011.",Article,Scopus,0.513535748,1,NA,NA,15,NA,1,15,,,22,NA

We assessed variation in bird communities near (‚â§25 m) and far (>100 m) from forest roads dividing laurel and pine forests on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Line transects were used as the census technique. We compared community structure and species responses between both forests, and among forest interior and edges of paved and unpaved roads. We analysed richness and diversity of species in these different situations, and tested for significance in bird community descriptors and species abundance responses to road proximity. The bird community of the laurel forest showed significantly higher average population density, richness, diversity and evenness than that of the pine forest. None of the two forests showed significant differences in community descriptors between edge and interior, except for a higher evenness along unpaved roads in the laurel forest. However, the bird community showed more overall abundances, richness and diversity on unpaved than on asphalt road edges in laurel forest. Excepting two passerines (Turdus merula in laurel forest and Phylloscopus canariensis in pine forest), all species had similar abundances on road edges and forest interior regardless of forest type. Most species might be regarded as forest generalists. Changes detected between edge and interior on road-fragmented forests were, overall, small at the bird community level. Managers should consider the effects of road edge and road type on the more sensitive species in present and future road planning.

One of the siliciclastic formations of the Bird's Head is the Tipuma Formation. Its age has been estimated as Triassic to Jurassic and is a potentially important hydrocarbon reservoir. New fieldwork was carried out, complemented by analysis of light and heavy minerals, U-Pb zircon geochronology, and quartz CL luminescence study. The Tipuma Formation was previously dated only by its stratigraphic position and was suggested to have been deposited in a continental passive margin. This study shows sandstones and conglomerates were sourced from acid volcanic, metamorphic, and recycled sedimentary rocks to the north, and from the North Australian Craton. Cathodoluminescence study on detrital quartz supports the importance of the important of volcanic quartz. The quartz provenance of sandstones from the Lower, Middle and Upper Members of the Tipuma Formation are dominated by low-T metamorphic and volcanic with little plutonic origin and there is some variation with stratigraphic position and in the Middle Member the abundance of volcanic quartz declines. The youngest zircon ages indicate it was deposited in the Triassic. Permo-Triassic (205-275 Ma), Neoproterozoic (c. 975 Ma), Early Mesoproterozoic (1.4-1.6 Ga), and Paleopro-terozoic (1.8-2.0 Ga) populations, with a few grains of Archaean age (2.8-3.2 Ga) characterized most Tipuma Formation sandstones. The Tipuma Formation was probably not deposited in a simple continental block setting and was influenced by volcanic activity in the Bird's Head during its deposition. The long-lived Palaeozoic volcanic activity interpreted to indicate subduction of the palaeo-Pacific oceanic plate under the Australian continent associated with an Andean-type active margin. The decline of the abundance of volcanic quartz, Permo-Triassic zircons, and increase in Carboniferous and Proterozoic zircons within the Middle Member indicate a reduced contribution of sediment from the arc and an increased contribution of sediment from northern Australia.

Here we have examined the ecosystem structure and oceanography spanning 3,500 km of the east Antarctic coastline, linking the scales of local surveys and global observations. Between 80¬∞and 150¬∞E there is a threefold variation in the extent of annual sea-ice cover, enabling us to examine the regional effects of sea ice and ocean circulation on biological productivity. Phytoplankton, primary productivity, Antarctic krill, whales and seabirds were concentrated where winter sea-ice extent is maximal, whereas salps were located where the sea-ice extent is minimal.

With very limited human activities, the Arctic is distant from major sources of microplastics. However, microplastic ingestions have been found in several Arctic marine predators, confirming their presence in this region. Nonetheless, existing information for this area remains scarce, thus there is an urgent need to quantify the contamination of Arctic marine waters. In this context, we studied microplastic abundance and composition within the zooplankton community off East Greenland. For the same area, we concurrently evaluated microplastic contamination of little auks (Alle alle), an Arctic seabird feeding on zooplankton while diving between 0 and 50 m. The study took place off East Greenland in July 2005 and 2014, under strongly contrasted sea-ice conditions. Among all samples, 97.2% of the debris found were filaments. Despite the remoteness of our study area, microplastic abundances were comparable to those of other oceans, with 0.99 ¬± 0.62 m‚àí3 in the presence of sea-ice (2005), and 2.38 ¬± 1.11 m‚àí3 in the nearby absence of sea-ice (2014). Microplastic rise between 2005 and 2014 might be linked to an increase in plastic production worldwide or to lower sea-ice extents in 2014, as sea-ice can represent a sink for microplastic particles, which are subsequently released to the water column upon melting. Crucially, all birds had eaten plastic filaments, and they collected high levels of microplastics compared to background levels with 9.99 and 8.99 pieces per chick meal in 2005 and 2014, respectively. Importantly, we also demonstrated that little auks took more often light colored microplastics, rather than darker ones, strongly suggesting an active contamination with birds mistaking microplastics for their natural prey. Overall, our study stresses the great vulnerability of Arctic marine species to microplastic pollution in a warming Arctic, where sea-ice melting is expected to release vast volumes of trapped debris. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.500629404,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,44,NA

These models combine population dynamics with stochastic variation in extinction and immigration parameters associated with local populations. One of the predictions of metapopulation models is a bimodal distribution of species frequency of occurrence, a pattern that led to the development of the core-satellite species hypothesis. The spatial scale and taxonomic classification of past core-satellite studies has often been undefined. In our study, we have integrated metapopulation dynamics with the roles that differential dispersal ability and history play in the shaping of communities. The differences in distribution patterns between landbridge islands and oceanic islands, and among various taxa (birds, mammals, herptiles, arthropods, fish, and plants) are analyzed. The majority of landbridge islands comprised locally and regionally abundant species (core species), whereas the majority of oceanic islands had a uniform distribution (or no end-peak in their distribution). The patterns of distribution among the taxonomic groups also showed differences. Birds (good dispersers) consistently showed bimodal- and core-distribution patterns. The bimodal prediction of species distribution is best exemplified in the landbridge islands and in birds, and least in oceanic islands and in organisms other than birds. These results illustrate the importance of testing models with various taxonomic groups and at different spatial scales and defining these scales before formally testing the predictions of the models.",Article,Scopus,0.498170926,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,57,NA

I examine the roles played by a variety of hydrographic features, including steep flow gradients (fronts) and water column stratification, in determining the abundance or availability of avian prey. The ice edge/marginal ice zone is a frontal area of particular interest in polar regions. In most oceanic systems we have examples of avian use of a feature, hut only poor information on the importance of the feature for supporting the population as a whole. I review recent studies of the spatial and numerical concordance of marine birds and their prey, and find that these studies have yielded mixed results, with correlations stronger for piscivorous birds, particularly murres foraging on capelin, than for planktivores. Review of investigations of multispecies interactions during foraging shows that flock foraging has both beneficial and negative aspects. Interspecific facilitation of foraging occurs in numerous interactions involving both other species of birds and marine mammals. However, co‚Äêoccurrence of predators may occur because both seek the same prey, and caution must be used in assessing mutualistic interactions between predatory species.

On oceanic islands, the ecology of IAV could be affected by the relative diversity, abundance and density of seabirds and ducks. Seabirds are the most abundant and widespread avifauna in the Western Indian Ocean and, in this region, oceanic islands represent major breeding sites for a large diversity of potential IAV host species. Based on serological assays, we assessed the host range of IAV and the virus subtype diversity in terns of the islands of the Western Indian Ocean. We further investigated the spatial variation in virus transmission patterns between islands and identified the origin of circulating viruses using a molecular approach. Our findings indicate that terns represent a major host for IAV on oceanic islands, not only for seabird-related virus subtypes such as H16, but also for those commonly isolated in wild and domestic ducks (H3, H6, H9, H12 subtypes). We also identified strong species-associated variation in virus exposure that may be associated to differences in the ecology and behaviour of terns. We discuss the role of tern migrations in the spread of viruses to and between oceanic islands, in particular for the H2 and H9 IAV subtypes. ¬© 2015 Lebarbenchon et al.",Article,Scopus,0.436722685,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,68,NA

To date, most studies on mutualistic networks assert that interaction properties such as species' degree (k) and strength (s) are strongly influenced by species abundances. We evaluated how species' degree and strength change as a function of temporal variation not only in species abundance, but also in species persistence (i.e., phenology length). In a two-year study, we collected community-wide data on seed dispersal by birds and examined the seasonal dynamics of the above-mentioned interaction properties. Our analyses revealed that species abundance is an important predictor for plant strength within a given sub-network. However, our analyses also reveal that species' degree can often be best explained by the length of fruiting phenology (for plants degree) or by the number of fruiting species (for dispersers degree), which are factors that can be decoupled from the relative abundance of the species participating in the network. Moreover, our results suggest that generalist dispersers (when total study period is considered) act as temporal generalists, with degree constrained by the number of plant species displaying fruits in each span. Along with species identity, our findings underscore the need for a temporal perspective, given that seasonality is an inherent property of many mutualistic networks. ¬© 2012 Gonz√°lez-Castro et al.",Article,Scopus,0.381473884,0,NA,NA,10,NA,0,10,,,15,NA

Marine yeasts were first discovered from the Atlantic Ocean and following this discovery, yeasts were isolated from different sources, viz. seawater, marine deposits, seaweeds, fish, marine mammals and sea birds. Nearshore environments are usually inhabited by tens to thousands of cells per litre of water, whereas low organic surface to deep-sea oceanic regions contain 10 or fewer cells/litre. Aerobic forms are found more in clean waters and fermentative forms in polluted waters. Yeasts are more abundant in silty muds than in sandy sediments. The isolation frequency of yeasts fell as the depth of the sampling site is increased. Major genera isolated in this study were Candida, Cryptococcus, Debaryomyces and Rhodotorula. For biomass estimation ergosterol method was used. Classification and identification of yeasts were performed using different criteria, i.e. morphology, sexual reproduction and physiological/biochemical characteristics.

However, support for the role of competition on niche partitioning remains controversial. Here, we tested for spatial and trophic partitioning in feather mites, a diverse and abundant group of arthropods. We focused on the two dominant mite species, Microspalax brevipes and Zachvatkinia ovata, inhabiting flight feathers of the Cory's shearwater, Calonectris borealis. We performed mite counts across and within primary and tail feathers on free-living shearwaters breeding on an oceanic island (Gran Canaria, Canary Islands). We then investigated trophic relationships between the two mite species and the host using stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen on mite tissues and potential host food sources. The distribution of the two mite species showed clear spatial segregation among feathers; M. brevipes showed high preference for the central wing primary feathers, whereas Z. ovata was restricted to the two outermost primaries. Morphological differences between M. brevipes and Z. ovata support an adaptive basis for the spatial segregation of the two mite species. However, the two mites overlap in some central primaries and statistical modeling showed that Z. ovata tends to outcompete M. brevipes. Isotopic analyses indicated similar isotopic values for the two mite species and a strong correlation in carbon signatures between mites inhabiting the same individual host suggesting that diet is mainly based on shared hostassociated resources. Among the four candidate tissues examined (blood, feather remains, skin remains and preen gland oil), we conclude that the diet is most likely dominated by preen gland oil, while the contribution of exogenous material to mite diets is less marked. Our results indicate that ongoing competition for space and resources plays a central role in structuring feather mite communities. They also illustrate that symbiotic infracommunities are excellent model systems to study trophic ecology, and can improve our understanding of mechanisms of niche differentiation and species coexistence. ¬© 2015 Stefan et al.
