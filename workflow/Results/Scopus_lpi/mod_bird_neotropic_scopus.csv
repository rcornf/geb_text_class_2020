Abundance declined at an average rate of 4% per year over the period 1978 through 1987, equalling the national decline found by the Breeding Bird Survey for those years, but recovered by 1990 to pre-decline levels. Abundance of previous residents followed a similar pattern, the only population component to do so. Abundance of new immigrants and of returning, locally produced young was generally stable. Throughout the study, reproductive rates were high enough to maintain the population at the return rates observed early and late in the study. However, a sustained episode of reduced production per female and of an increased percentage of adults failing to produce any young generally coincided with the decline in abundance. When the failure rate later dropped, return rate and abundance subsequently increased. [The authors] conclude that a period of elevated, predation-caused failure prompted greater emigration by an ever-young, less-site-faithful population. High emigration coupled with stable immigration, stable recruitment of local young, and even normal mortality of residents would yield a declining population. A regional predation episode could cause a broader decline in abundance through several mechanisms that could reduce the number of available immigrants.",Report,Scopus,0.897719829,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,115,NA

Total numbers of birds (all species combined) declined from 210-220 individuals/10 ha in the early 1970s to 70-90/10 ha in the 1990s. Of the 24 regularly occurring species, 12 decreased significantly (four to local extinction), three increased significantly, and nine remained relatively constant in abundance. Nine of the 12 declining species were Neotropical migrants. Most species exhibited similar trends on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in New Hampshire during the same 30 year period and on three replicate study sites in nearby sections of the White Mountains from 1986-1998. Probable causes of trends were diverse and differed among species. Most could be accounted for by individual species' responses to events occurring primarily in the local breeding area. The most important local factor affecting bird abundance was temporal change in forest vegetation structure, resulting from natural forest succession and local disturbances. Four species that declined markedly and in some cases disappeared completely from the study plot (Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus; Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina; Philadelphia Vireo, Vireo philadelphicus; and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) appear to attain peak abundance in early or mid successional forests. Species preferring more mature forests, such as Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), increased significantly in abundance over the 30 year study. Other important factors influencing bird abundances were food availability and events in the migratory and winter periods. Nest-predation rates, although varying among years, showed no long-term pattern that would account for population declines, and brood parasites were absent from this forest. Findings from this study demonstrate that major changes in bird abundances occur over time even in undisturbed and relatively mature forests, and illustrate the need for considering habitat requirements of individual species and how habitat suitability changes over time when trying to assess the causes of their long-term population trends. The results also imply that any conclusions about the effects of other factors affecting forest bird abundances, such as increased nest predation or brood parasitism associated with habitat fragmentation, must also account for successional changes that may be affecting habitat suitability.",Article,Scopus,0.878662638,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,33,NA

The results of the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and other long-term surveys show that the populations of most species of grassland and shrubland specialists have declined during the past 25 years. These declines are primarily due to land-use changes, particularly the growth of forest on abandoned farmland and pasture, and the intensification of agriculture on the remaining farmland. Many grassland and shrubland bird species are dependent on ephemeral habitats that quickly become unsuitable due to vegetation change. Only continual disturbance, such as fire, mowing, grazing, or logging, will maintain habitats for these species. Populations of forest migrants have also declined at particular sites, but the evidence for overall population declines throughout eastern North America is not conclusive. Results of the BBS indicate, in fact, that populations of most species of forest migrants have shown an overall increase during the past 25 years. Long-term trends are difficult to discern, however, because the abundance of forest migrants has fluctuated greatly, generally increasing between 1966 and 1979, and decreasing after 1978. Regardless of past trends in populations of forest migrants, there is cause for concern for their future. Both the breeding habitat (large areas of uninterrupted forest) and winter habitat (tropical forests and other natural or seminatural tropical habitats) needed by many species of forest migrants are threatened with degradation or destruction. The future of both early-succession and forest birds depends on careful management of regional landscapes to maintain a diversity of habitat types, with relatively large areas of continuous grassland, shrubland, and forest.",Article,Scopus,0.85962881,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,177,NA

In this study, long-term data are presented on the occurrence of shorebirds at one such site on the coast of the state of Sergipe in northeastem Brazil. A 5-km long stretch of Atalaia Beach was surveyed each month between July 2003 and May 2006 (1-6 surveys per month, total = 101). The surveys resulted in records of three resident shorebird species (Vanellus chilensis, Charadrius collaris and Charadrius wilsonia) and ten Nearctic migrants (Charadriidae and Scolopacidae). The local abundance of these migrants followed a predictable pattern, with the main influx starting at the end of September, during the boreal autumn (with Charadrius semipalmatus arriving slightly earlier). The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and the Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) were the most abundant species throughout the study period, peaking at 1200 and 700 birds, respectively, in November-February. Some sanderlings (Calidris alba). Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), and Semipalmated plovers (C. semipalmatus) almost certainly overwinter at the site, and remained in the study area throughout the year, whereas the bimodal distribution of the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) indicates the use of the beach as a stopover during migration to wintering sites further south. Whilst more species were recorded during the first year, counts were lower than in subsequent years, possibly reflecting natural fluctuations in abundance or migration patterns. Overall, the data indicate that the site may be an important stopover or wintering site for populations of at least five species of Nearctic migrants, while it may be visited periodically by a number of other species. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.857401897,NA,1,NA,NA,5,1,5,61,NA

Using Distance program we estimated the population density on this site in 2.1 individuals per ha. Cardinal abundance was lower in the dense forest than in the border and open forest. Cardinal group size and juvenile abundance were also lower in the dense forest than in the open and border forest. The seasonal distribution of Cardinal abundance was different between habitats. The dense forest showed a slight increase during the breeding season, but there were no definite trends in other habitats. Results of this study indicate that habitat characteristics on a small scale are important in determining the abundance of Red-crested Cardinals. Since Cardinals intensively used pastures adjacent to forests, this is likely the cause of the lower abundance in the dense forest.

Declines in abundance were steepest in the eastern breeding region, followed by the western region. Breeding productivity did not decline in any region. In contrast, we observed declining recruitment in all regions, low apparent survival in the east and west, and a decline in apparent survival in the east. Abundance declined with increasing disturbance around MAPS stations.

Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ¬± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ¬± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ¬± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ¬± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ¬± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ¬± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ¬± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ¬± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6. Additional data from multiple species, especially measures of habitat-specific demography and dispersal, will improve our understanding of the relative impacts of the breeding, migratory, and winter periods on population dynamics of migratory birds and thus enhance future conservation efforts.",Article,Scopus,0.84251267,NA,?,Survival estimates,NA,5,?,5,141,NA

Priority should be put on controlling illegal timber extraction, bird hunting and chick collecting, as well as on sensitization of local people to avoid introducing alien species. ¬© Senckenberg Gesellschaft f√ºr Naturforschung, 2016.",Article,Scopus,0.826980713,NA,0,NA,NA,10,0,10,171,NA

These declines have been attributed to habitat destruction and fragmentation on the breeding grounds, in strategic migratory stopover sites, and on the wintering grounds. Using BBS data from the 1967-1989 period and universal kriging, we produced maps of abundance change for two declining species of wood warblers to test hypothetical spatial scenarios of decline over entire breeding ranges. These species were the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) and the Prairie Warbler (D. discolor). We found considerable variability in the location of areas of decline when comparing successive 5-yr periods. In some comparisons, areas of decline were concentrated in the centers of abundance of these species, and in others, they were scattered throughout their range. We also found that the direction and intensity of population trends was quite sensitive to the methods used for calculating abundance. Our results indicate that, even for species where significant longterm declines have been reported, considerable variation exists in the direction of abundance change, both geographically and temporally. Although most of the long-term declines reported in particular species at local and regional scales are undeniable, gaps in our knowledge still prevent us from incorporating these trends into a global model of the annual cycle of Neotropical migrants.",Article,Scopus,0.824104064,NA,1,NA,NA,10,1,10,38,NA

Although the three intensively studied woodlots were small (14-65 ha), they contained several species that are considered area-sensitive elsewhere in their range, including the worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). Populations of six Neotropical migrants declined by at least 50% and none increased by more than 10% during the five years (1985-1989) of the study. Mist-net data suggest very low (ca. 15%) return rates of adults between years with only a small core of adults returning year after year. Data on nesting success indicate that most nests fail because of high predation rates (ca. 80% of open cup nests) and brood parasitism (ca. 76% of nests of Neotropical migrants) by the omnipresent, abundant brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Parasitized nests with more than one cowbird egg were the rule rather than the exception, and contained an average of 3.3 cowbird eggs for Neotropical migrants. Wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nests averaged nearly four times as many cowbird eggs as host eggs (4.6 vs. 1.2). Ground-nesting species such as the ovenbird and Kentucky warbler (Oporornis formosus) appear to be less susceptible to brood parasitism than shrub-nesting species. Midsummer mist-net data also showed little evidence of reproduction by Neotropical migrants as hatching year:adult ratios averaged 0.1 compared with ratios of >1.0 for many year-round residents and short-distance migrants.

Identifying such effects for migratory birds requires the integration of population models with knowledge of migratory connectivity between breeding and nonbreeding areas. We used Bayesian hierarchical models with 26 years of Breeding Bird Survey data (1982-2007) to investigate the impacts of breeding- and nonbreeding-season climate on abundance of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) across the species range. We focused on 15 populations defined by Bird Conservation Regions, and we included variation across routes and observers as well as temporal trends and climate effects. American Redstart populations that breed in eastern North America showed increased abundance following winters with higher plant productivity in the Caribbean where they are expected to overwinter. In contrast, western breeding populations showed little response to conditions in their expected wintering areas in west Mexico, perhaps reflecting lower migratory connectivity or differential effects of winter rainfall on individuals across the species range. Unlike the case with winter climate, we found few effects of temperature prior to arrival in spring (March-April) or during the nesting period (May-June) on abundance the following year. Eight populations showed significant changes in abundance, with the steepest declines in the Atlantic Northern Forest (3.4%/yr) and the greatest increases in the Prairie Hardwood Transition (4%/yr). This study emphasizes how the effects of climate on populations of migratory birds are context dependent and can vary depending on geographic location and the period of the annual cycle. Such knowledge is essential for predicting regional variation in how populations of a species might vary in their response to climate change. ¬© 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.816065649,1,1,NA,15,10,1,10,21,NA

Yet, data limitations often restrict our ability to interpret the numerical response of species to habitat alteration and climatic change adds to this challenge. In this study, we used habitat-specific demographic information from an individually-marked population of Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and a forest timber supply model to project population trends over an 80-year horizon. We modelled changes in Ovenbird abundance, productivity, and population growth rate as a function of harvesting scenarios (no harvest, forestry-as-usual, and increased [10% or 20%] harvesting intensity) and projected impacts of climate change (0%, 10%, and 50% reductions in population size over the 80-year period), as well as contrasting assumptions about population dynamics (i.e. open vs. closed population). Among the many effects of climate change, it has been hypothesized that reductions in annual snow cover will occur, causing deeper and more frequent frost penetration into the soil and, in turn, a reduction in invertebrate (food) abundance during the following breeding season. Our models suggest that the study area currently is a demographic sink (Œª=. 0.920) for Ovenbirds, although some habitat types still act as demographic sources. Over the first 7. years, a large decline in abundance of territorial males (~25%) is projected, unless population levels are maintained through immigration. Interestingly, when we allowed for immigration from outside the study area, population growth rate remained <1 because a larger proportion of the population occupied habitat types acting as sinks. Over an 80-year period, the climate change scenarios we simulated were more likely to have negative impacts (5-49%) than forestry activities, whether we applied the current management plan or more intensive harvesting scenarios. To our knowledge, this study used some of the most detailed habitat-specific demographic information available for a North American forest songbird to model the relative influence of land use, climate, and population dynamics on population trends. Future studies should examine the possibility of synergistic effects between harvesting and climate change, to model their influence on Ovenbird or other species foraging on litter invertebrates. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.811698981,NA,?,Mentions habitat specific demogrephic info but not clear if population trends would be present,NA,10,?,10,79,NA

We used capture‚Äìrecapture data for the Grey Pileated Finch from a Neotropical dry forest to evaluate the hypothesis that intra- and inter-annual survival, individuals entrance and population abundance, are related to local rainfall. Sampling occurred across 3¬†years, with individuals captured, tagged and evaluated for age and presence of brood patch every 14¬†days. Using the POPAN formulation, we generated demographic models to evaluate study population temporal dynamics. Best-fit models indicated a low apparent annual survival in the first year (16%) compared to other years (between 47 and 62%), with this low value associated with an extreme drought. The abundance of juveniles at each capture occasion was significantly dependent on the accumulated precipitation in the previous 14¬†days, and the juvenile covariate was a strong predictor of the intra-annual entrance probability (natality). Individuals entrance during the reproductive period corresponded to 53, 52 and 75% of total ingress for each year, respectively. The trend in sampled population size indicated positive exponential growth (Ninitial = 50, Nlast = 600), with intra-annual fluctuations becoming progressively more intense. Low survival was relevant during population decline at study onset, while at study end intense Individuals entrance promoted rapid population growth. Thus, the indirect effects of rainfall and the combined effect of two demographic rates operated synergistically on the immediate population abundance of Grey Pileated Finch, an abundant bird in a Neotropical dry forest. ¬© 2018, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus,0.807722749,1,1,NA,5,10,1,10,1,NA

Five species, all tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae) made up SATT, whereas only two of the seven species of SACT were tyrannids. Densities of both SATT and SACT were higher in open woodland than in shrubland. SATT density did not differ among years, but SACT density did, having lower values in 1994 in both habitats. In subsequent years, SACT densities increased but did not reach values similar to those previous to 1994. The decline in 1994 coincided with a two-year drought period that began in 1993, but lower density in the following years did not appear to be related to climatic conditions in the study area, suggesting a low capacity of SACT species to recover population abundance after periods of stress. In contrast, SATT density was not associated with local climatic conditions, possibly because several SATT species used the study area only as a stopover site. During the breeding season, birds of both migratory systems disproportionately use the open woodland, which offers more sites to nest and feed than does the shrubland. Although most SATT and SACT species are abundant and not currently of conservation concern, human activities in the central Monte desert promote the structural simplification of the habitat, which could threaten future populations of Neotropical austral migrant landbirds in this ecosystem. ¬© The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.",Article,Scopus,0.805455517,NA,1,NA,NA,10,1,10,112,NA

Due to the seasonality of the northern hemisphere, counts take place during two clearly defined moments in time: the breeding season (resident birds) and winter (after migration). Depending on location, Neotropical birds may breed at any time of year, may or may not migrate, and those patterns are not necessarily synchronous among species. Also in contrast to the northern hemisphere, population trends and the impact of rapid urbanization and deforestation are unknown and unmonitored. Throughout one year, we used point counts to better understand temporal patterns of bird species richness and relative abundance in the state of S√£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil, to examine how to implement similar bird counts in tropical America. We counted birds twice each day on 10 point transects (20 points day-1), separated by 200 m, with a 100 m limited detection radius in a semideciduous tropical forest. Both species richness and bird abundance were greater in the morning, but accumulation curves suggest that longer-duration afternoon counts would reach the same total species as in morning counts. Species richness and bird abundance did not vary seasonally and unique species were counted every month; relatively few species (20%) were present in all months. Most (84%) known forest species in the area were encountered. We suggest that point counts can work here as they do in the northern hemisphere. We recommend that transects include at least 20 points and that the simplest timing of bird counts would also be seasonal, using timing of migration of austral migrants (and six months later) to coordinate counts. We propose that bird counts in Brazil, and elsewhere in Latin America, would provide data to help understand population trends, but would require greater effort than in temperate latitudes due to greater species richness and different dynamics of reproduction and migration. With collaboration among ornithologists and coordinated bird surveys, we may develop a technique for the tropics that would yield information for population trends and conservation of birds, similar to counts in temperate latitudes.",Article,Scopus,0.804074392,NA,0,NA,NA,10,0,10,179,NA

We used the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as a model for evaluating the role Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the largest national park in the eastern United States) may play in maintaining regional songbird populations. We estimated the annual productivity of Wood Thrushes in the park by combining observations on the birds' distribution, abundance, and productivity with estimates of habitat availability. We estimated a breeding population of approximately 10,000 nesting pairs using habitat models developed from over 2500 point-count censuses conducted across the park. Data from 426 nests monitored from 1992 to 1997 produced a daily nest survival rate of 0.96. We estimated an annual fecundity of 2.76 fledglings per breeding pair, based on a model that incorporated the re-nesting behavior of Wood Thrushes. Results indicate that the park is producing approximately 3000 surplus female young each year. Daily nest survival rates were below those reported in other studies of Wood Thrushes in large forest tracts. The relatively high productivity of 3.31 nestlings per successful nest suggests that, in the absence of predation, the park provides high-quality nesting habitat for Wood Thrushes, but that it may also support a more diverse and abundant predator community than more disturbed or less contiguous sites. The difficulties of estimating the size of continental breeding bird populations make assessing the significance of the park within a regional landscape context problematic, but our estimates suggest that, although the park is functioning as a substantial population source on a local scale, its potential to sustain regional or continental Wood Thrush populations is limited.

Since 1969, my colleagues and I have been studying migratory songbird populations in their breeding quarters at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire, USA, and since 1986, in their winter quarters in the Greater Antilles (Jamaica). Long-term data on the abundance and demography of these populations, coupled with experimental tests of mechanisms, indicate that processes operating in the breeding area (e.g. density-dependent fecundity, food limitation) are sufficient to limit and regulate the local abundance of these species. At the same time, limiting factors operating in the non-breeding season (e.g. climate-induced food limitation in winter quarters and especially mortality during migration) also have important impacts on migrant populations. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that limiting processes during the winter period can carry over into the breeding season and affect reproductive output. These findings clearly demonstrate that to understand changes in abundance of long-distance migrant species requires knowledge of events operating throughout the annual cycle, which presents a challenge to researchers, managers and others concerned with the welfare of these species. ¬© 2007 The Author.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.800972076,1,1,NA,15,15,1,15,16,NA

Greatest avian diversity was found in 2 young forest types (6-20 yr following harvesting). Young, even-aged regeneration had the greatest abundance of individual birds per unit area, whereas mature hardwood had the lowest total abundance. Ten of 37 Neotropical migrant species had their highest abundance in the 2 youngest stages of forest (clearcuts and regeneration) whereas 13 of 37 species had their highest abundance in the 3 mature forest types.

This result indicates there might be important subregional differences in landbird population trends. Current timber harvest rates likely will result in a decrease in abundance of mature forest in Maine's industrial forest.

However, the mechanisms by which local individuals and immigrants interact and the subsequent effects of immigrants on productivity are poorly known. We developed an integrated population model (IPM) to study the extent and consequences of immigration on the dynamics of a neotropical migrant (American redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) over an 11-year period in Ontario, Canada. New immigrants represented the majority of the study population each year with higher immigration rates for males than females and for first-year breeders than breeders in their second year or older. Immigration was negatively density dependent, with immigrants replacing previously established breeders in a compensatory manner following their death or emigration. Because of the tradeoff between immigration and apparent survival, neither had a strong influence on population growth and reproductive output was most strongly correlated with a change in abundance between years. However, if immigration ceased, the study population would become locally extinct within 7¬†years and thus immigrants were essential for local population persistence. We found no evidence for reduced breeding success when immigrants represented a higher proportion of the study population. Our research highlights the importance of movement in the stability of open populations and the strong correlation between the fates of local breeders and the number of immigrants entering the population. We recommend the use of IPMs to address the spatial scale over which immigration occurs and how different scales influence its contribution to population dynamics. ¬© 2017, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.",Article,Scopus,0.793071706,1,1,NA,10,15,1,15,11,NA

The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative. Populations of all species combined declined across greater differences in hunting pressure by up to 74.8 percent from their numeric abundance in less intensively hunted sites, but harvest-sensitive species faired far worse. Of the 30 species examined, 22 declined significantly at high levels of hunting. Body size significantly affected the direction and magnitude of abundance changes, with large-bodied species declining faster in overhunted sites. Frugivorous species showed more marked declines in abundance in heavily hunted sites than seed predators and browsers, regardless of the effects of body size.

For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds.

Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self-sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source-sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism.

I used spot-map registrations and radiotagged birds to estimate territory size and density on the plot for 13 species. As in the few previous studies of Amazonian birds, territory sizes were large (mean = 13.0 ha) and densities were low (mean = 3.4 pairs per 100 ha). The most common species, Formicarius colma, was the only species with >10 pairs per 100 ha, and one of four species (with Myrmeciza ferruginea, Conopophaga aurita, and Corythopis torquaius) to have territories of <7.0 ha. On average, each species occupied 34% of the plot, with only four species (F. colma, Grallaria varia, F. analis, and M. ferruginea) ever occupying >50% in any year. Territories appeared and disappeared between surveys; ‚àº71% of territories detected in a given survey were present in the next survey. The two rarest species, Myrmothera campanisona and Hylopezus macularius, were absent from the plot in some years. Across species, territory stability was positively correlated with abundance; more common species had more stable density among years than rare species. Although past research has shown territory stability for the most common species of Neotropical rainforest birds, my results suggest that rarer species, which constitute the bulk of the avifauna, may show greater fluctuation in abundance. I compared my results to similar data from lowland rainforests in Panama, French Guiana, Ecuador, and Peru. Species richness was lowest in Panama, but comparable among the Amazonian sites. Panama also had the highest biomass and smallest territory sizes. Interestingly, relative abundances of species shared among sites were not necessarily similar. With the exception of Conopophaga spp., all species or replacement species shared among sites were at least twice as abundant at one site as at another. Relative abundance within genera also differed among sites for Sclerurus and Formicarius. The sparse data available so far suggest that individual species show considerable spatial variation in abundance across Amazonia, though the mechanisms and the texture of the patterns remain unknown. ¬© The American Ornithologists' Union, 2007.",Article,Scopus,0.773579034,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,89,NA

From October 2001 to September 2003, we visited the colony weekly and counted the birds every 3 h from sunrise to sunset.

However, the number of birds attending the colony at noon was higher during the spring than during the fall. The colony attendance pattern indicates that cormorants remain at the colony site through the year and suggests that post-breeding migration of adults is rare. Our results support the hypothesis that cormorants exploit a predictable and low seasonally food source located at the proximity of the colony during the whole year.

We first identified a suite of 28 forest-interior bird species (FIA species), based on correlations between bird abundance (in 2003-2007) and extent of interior forest (in 2005) along BBS routes. From this group, we eliminated 13 species whose breeding habitats were described in the literature as including forest edge or second growth, resulting in a more stringently defined subset of 15 (FIB) species. We quantified the extent of forest and interior forest (>100 m from a forest edge) along BBS routes based on digitized aerial photographs from 1971, 1985, and 1999. We also quantified changes in abundance of the 28 forest bird species along BBS survey routes over the same time period. Overall, changes in abundance of FIB species paralleled changes in extent of interior forest, with 13 of 15 species showing positive correlations, 5 of which were significant. However, substantial variation occurred among species, including conspicuous declines in Hylocichla mustelina (Wood Thrush) and Piranga olivacea (Scarlet Tanager) and conspicuous increases in Vireo solitarius (Blue-headed Vireo) and Setophaga coronata (Yellow-rumped Warbler). Changes were not significantly related to either migratory status (Neotropical vs. other) or nest location (ground vs. arboreal). Several differences could be attributed to species-specific factors, such as reintroductions of Meleagris gallopavo (Wild Turkey) and Corvus corax (Common Raven) or introduction of competitors, such as Haemorhous mexicanus (House Finch) impacting Haemorhous purpureus (Purple Finch). Changes in some bird populations seem to reflect forest succession, e.g., Hylatomus pileatus (Pileated Woodpecker), while others are unexplained and may be due to changes on migratory routes or wintering grounds. Overall, loss of interior forest is an important incremental factor in forest bird population declines, although other factors had a greater impact in the period under study.",Article,Scopus,0.761058831,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,170,NA

Using 15 years of data on the abundances of songbirds at four replicate forest sites in New Hampshire, USA, we addressed two main questions: (1) Are forest bird populations synchronous at the scale measured (tens of kilometers), and if so, (2) what environmental factors are responsible for the synchrony? Nine of the 10 bird species we examined exhibited significant spatial synchrony across the four sites. Within nesting and foraging species groups, tree nesters and foliage gleaners exhibited the highest spatial synchrony. Long-distance (Neotropical) migrants exhibited higher spatial synchrony than did short-distance migrants or year-round residents. Synchrony within and among six species of long-distance, migratory, insectivorous birds was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in the abundance of lepidopteran larvae, a primary food type during the breeding season, which in turn have been shown to be influenced by El Ni√±o/La Ni√±a global climate patterns. Abundances of year-round resident species were related to another large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Winter weather can have both direct (e.g., via temperature-mediated mortality) and indirect (e.g., via winter food availability) effects on year-round resident species. We do not believe that predation on adults or nests accounted for the observed synchrony. Dispersal among regional populations in this system may have played a role but is likely a product of the influence of regionally synchronous caterpillar fluctuations on bird reproduction. Long-term regional population trends may have contributed to the observed synchrony for some species, but we do not consider these trends to be primary factors. Our findings of population synchrony support the importance of food and climate in influencing forest bird abundances and have broad implications for potential responses of bird and insect populations to climate change.",Article,Scopus,0.758908893,1,NA,NA,15,NA,,,15,NA

Negative correlations between the degree of fragmentation and bird density or fecundity at local or regional scales support the fragmentation hypothesis. Yet, in spite of reduced fecundity and densities in fragmented. systems, many forest-nesting passerine species have increased in numbers over time. We hypothesized that range-wide population change in species for which habitat fragmentation negatively affects reproductive success should depend on the proportion of the population that actually occupies fragmented landscapes. We predicted that fragmentation-sensitive species (e.g., species that occur in reduced densities in fragmented landscapes) should increase globally in numbers at a greater rate than species that readily occupy fragmented landscapes, because fragmentation-sensitive distributions place a large proportion of the global population in contiguous landscapes that are superior for breeding. We used Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data and associated landscape metrics to test this prediction for 10 species of forest-nesting passerines in the United States that experience reproductive dysfunction associated with habitat fragmentation: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea), Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), and Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina). Our approach was to: (1) quantify landscape features associated with BBS routes across the eastern United States, (2) classify landscapes around BBS routes as ""fragmented"" or ""contiguous,"" (3) estimate the proportion of detected individuals that occurred in fragmented landscapes on a species-by-species basis, and then (4) associate 10-yr trends for each species with the proportion of breeding individuals occupying fragmented landscapes. Regression analysis indicated a significant, negative relationship between the proportion of the breeding population occupying fragmented landscapes and the population trend from 1970 to 1980. Although this result links habitat fragmentation to population change and provides support for the fragmentation hypothesis, other factors (e.g., land use change, weather, varying life history traits, varying winter survivorship, habitat amount thresholds) could generate similar results. More work is needed to partition the relative influence of these factors on regional bird population dynamics if conservationists are to understand more clearly, the effects of fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of species across their ranges.",Review,Scopus,0.754580392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,78,NA

Major findings from 40 years of research in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire reviewed here show that the distributions and abundances of bird species are dynamic, even within well-developed and mature forests, and that species respond differently to habitat (vegetation) structure, food availability, and other features of the forest environment. At the local scale, bird population demography is most affected by factors that influence fecundity and recruitment, mainly food availability, weather, nest predators, and density dependent processes. Fecundity is strongly correlated with subsequent recruitment and is critical for maintaining breeding population size. Events in the non-breeding season, however, also influence the abundance and demography of breeding populations, indicating the need to assess factors operating throughout the species' annual cycle. At the landscape scale, populations in temperate forests are spatially structured by each species' response to habitat and environmental patterns, but also by social interactions such as competition and conspecific attraction. Settlement patterns and ultimately reproductive performance depend on habitat quality, based on vegetation structure, food availability and nest predator effects that vary across the landscape. Results from these long-term studies centered at Hubbard Brook provide a mechanistic understanding of avian population dynamics and community responses. The results provide a framework for predicting how future changes in habitat quality, climate, and other environmental threats may influence bird populations and communities in north-temperate forests. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.751854251,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,55,NA

The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23 males/ha (95% CI = 0.197-0.252, n = 301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95% CI: 223,927-302,620). Our results provide the first abundance estimate using habitat and count data from a sampling design focused on range-wide inference.

We also included band recoveries submitted to the United States Geological Survey's Bird Banding Laboratory to assess connectivity of areas where geolocators were not deployed. We created a probabilistic map of origin for each capture site and mapped spring migration routes between nonbreeding and breeding locations.

Breeding Ovenbirds from western Canada spent the nonbreeding season throughout Central America and migrated through central North America during spring migration. Birds breeding in the northeastern United States were distributed throughout the central Greater Antilles in the Caribbean and migrated through eastern North America during spring migration.

The golden-winged warbler Vermivora chrysoptera is a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird experiencing a long-term population decline; yet no information about non-breeding season habitat quality or habitat selection exists to inform conservation efforts. We used a novel hierarchical model that requires only spatially and temporally replicated count data to estimate habitat-specific abundance, apparent survival, recruitment and detection probability of golden-winged warblers wintering in Costa Rica. We quantified habitat selection at the home-range level using radiotelemetry. Golden-winged warblers were absent from tropical dry forest and were most abundant in premontane evergreen forest. Within their home ranges, golden-winged warblers selected microhabitat features associated with intermediate disturbance that reflected their preference for foraging in hanging dead leaves. Consistent with other evidence of a declining population, local population size decreased over the duration of the study. The rate of decrease was higher during the non-breeding season than among seasons. We found no differences in apparent survival or recruitment among habitat types; however, our estimates of these parameters were imprecise. Synthesis and applications. Golden-winged warblers are forest-dependent species during the non-breeding season and have specialized microhabitat requirements that make them vulnerable to ongoing tropical deforestation. However, advanced secondary forests can provide the requisite microhabitat features, and because we found no evidence of reduced survival in this habitat type, regenerating forest on degraded lands may be an effective component of a conservation strategy for this species.

We conducted a nest-predation experiment in southern Appalachian Mountain forests (North Carolina, U.S.A.) during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons to determine the effects of exurban development and temperature on predator presence and the average number of days until eggs in an artificial nest were disturbed by predators. We baited artificial nests with quail (Excalfactoria chinensi) eggs and monitored them for 18 days. We used clay eggs, track plates, and motion-triggered cameras to detect and identify nest predators. The average number of days a nest was undisturbed decreased as mean temperature increased and, to a lesser extent, as the density of buildings increased. Nests on the ground were more often depredated than those in trees, likely due to increased predation by opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and other carnivores. Raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums, corvids (Corvus brachyrhynchos and Cyanocitta cristata), chipmunks (Tamias striatus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and domestic cats (Felis catus) were the most commonly detected predators. Presence of these predators did not vary as a function of mean temperature. Domestic cats and corvids were detected more frequently in plots with high rather than low densities of buildings. Forest-interior specialists and Neotropical migrants often nest in cool, high-elevation areas with low housing density. These bird species, especially those that nest on the ground, may be most vulnerable to increased nest predation if temperature and exurban development increase at higher elevations as anticipated. ¬© 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.737607225,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,135,NA

The collision risk was estimated by the Avian Hazard Index (AHI) which combines size, abundance and history of collisions of each species. During the study period 63 species were recorded, plus 10 aditional species were recorded after summer 2005. The most abundant species were the Grassland Yellow-Finch, Kelp Gull, Southern Lapwing Long-tailed Meadowlark (28%, 14%, 10%, 8% of all individual records). Excepting Kelp Gull, all remaining species exhibited seasonal cycles of abundance. The Kelp Gull showed multiyear outbreaks triggered. The species representing a higher collision risk for air navigation are the Kelp Gull (API = 36), Southern Lapwing (AHI = 24), South American Tern (AHI = 16), Black Vulture (AHI = 12), Neotropic Cormorant (AHI = 9) and Chimango Caracara (AHI = 8).

We analyzed stable hydrogen isotopic compositions in tail feathers (Œ¥Dw) collected from 26 sites in 11 countries throughout the wintering range of the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), a Nearctic- Neotropical migratory passerine bird. Feathers were assumed to have molted on the breeding grounds, and Œ¥Dw was used to estimate breeding origin. Values of Œ¥Dw were highly correlated with longitude of sampling location, indicating that breeding populations were generally distributed along the east-west axis of the wintering grounds. Within the Caribbean region, Florida, and Bahamas, Œ¥Dw values were negatively correlated with winter latitude, which suggests that American Redstarts exhibit a pattern of chain migration in which individuals wintering at northern latitudes are also the most northern breeders. To identify the most probable breeding regions, we used a likelihood-assignment test incorporated with a prior probability of breeding abundance using Bayes's rule. Expected Œ¥D values of feathers from five breeding regions were based on interpolated Œ¥D values from a model of continent-wide growing-season Œ¥D values in precipitation (Œ¥Dp) and were adjusted to account for a discrimination factor between precipitation and feathers. At most wintering locations, breeding assignments were significantly different from expected frequencies based on relative breeding abundance. Birds wintering in eastern and western Mexico had a high probability of breeding in northwest and midwest North America, whereas birds in the Greater and Lesser Antilles were likely to have originated from breeding regions in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Migratory connectivity, such as we report here, implies that the dynamics of breeding and nonbreeding populations may be linked at a regional scale. These results provide a key opportunity for studying the year-round ecology and evolution of spatially connected populations in a migratory species. ¬© The American Ornithologists' Union 2006.",Article,Scopus,0.735613152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,67,NA

Despite their ecological importance, the natural populations of these birds are increasingly threatened by deforestation and hunting pressure. The present study was conducted in the Araripe National Forest, Cear√° (Brazil), with the objective of estimating population parameters (density and total population size) in the Rusty-margined Guan (Penelope superciliaris) and the White-browed Guan (Penelope jacucaca), as well as providing data on their feeding ecology, including seasonal variation and fruit morphology. The study was based on the monthly collection of data between November, 2011, and October, 2012. Population parameters were estimated using line transect surveys, while feeding ecology was studied by direct observation, and the collection of plant and fecal samples. The estimated population density of P. superciliaris was 19.17 individuals/km2 (CV=13.98%), with a mean of 0.13 sightings per 10 km walked. Penelope jacucaca was not encountered during the surveys. A total of 14 plant species were recorded in the diet of P. superciliaris, 12 by direct observation, and two from fecal samples. Fruit diameter varied from 6.3¬±1.35 mm (Miconia albicans) to 29.9¬±1.7 mm (Psidium sp.). Yellow was the most frequent fruit color (41.6%, n=5), with two species each (16.6%) providing black, green, and red fruits. Fleshy fruits of the baccate (50.0%, n=6) and drupe (33.3%, n=4) types were the most consumed.

We report results from mist-netting operations conducted during spring and fall migration in 1994, 1995, and 1996. A total of 23,800 individuals of 146 species were captured during the study. Of the 146 species, 53 percent were Neotropical migrants, and 32 percent were temperate migrants. The most abundant species were the MacGillivray's Warbler, Wilson's Warbler, and White-crowned Sparrow in spring and the Chipping Sparrow, Pine Siskin, and White-crowned Sparrow in fall. Migrants were most abundant between late April and the first 2 weeks of May in spring and between the last week of August and mid-October. Temperate migrants passed through the sites earlier in spring and later in fall than Neotropical migrants. About 50 percent of the birds had no visible fat stores upon capture. More birds used riparian habitat along the middle Rio Grande for stopover in fall than in spring. Species richness and relative abundance were lower in spring (108 species, 4,673 birds) than in fall (125 species, 19,127 birds). In addition to the influx of hatching-year birds in fall, differential use of migratory routes by landbirds in spring and fall may explain the seasonal difference in capture rate. We recaptured 2,875 birds (12 percent of the total captures) after the day of initial capture. Energetic condition and migratory status affected recapture probability: birds with low fat stores were more likely to stay overnight, and Neotropical species had shorter stopovers than temperate migrants and residents. The average rate of body mass gain across all species was 7.46 ¬± 0.10 percent/day in spring and was 4.68 ¬± 0.05 percent/day in fall, suggesting that migrants were not only able to gain energy for regular metabolic needs, but also for accumulating fat stores for migration. The capture rate was highest in willow habitat (288 birds/1,000 net hour) in spring and in agricultural field/edge habitat (718 birds/1,000 net hour) in fall. Cottonwood with Russian olive understory had the highest species richness in spring (80 species) and in fall (94 species). Saltcedar habitat had lowest species richness both in spring (26 species) and in fall (33 species). Detrended correspondence analysis of spring migration data separated species with high abundance in saltcedar from species with high capture rates in cotton wood overstory habitats, and in agriculture and willow habitats. The same analysis for fall data separated species with high capture rates in habitats dominated by agriculture, willow, saltcedar, and cottonwood. Species composition was most similar between agricultural habitat and cottonwood/Russian olive habitat in spring and among habitats with cottonwood as overstory in fall. During fall migration, about 60 percent of the birds captured were immatures. Body masses of adult birds were generally higher than those of immature birds, and young birds were more likely to be fat-depleted when they captured at our sites. The rate of mass gain was similar between immatures and adults. Our study confirms that riparian habitats along the middle Rio Grande of central New Mexico are important stopover sites during spring and fall migration for birds that breed in New Mexico, its adjacent States, and at a much larger geographic scale. Habitat loss and disturbance along the middle Rio Grande could affect not only local breeding landbird populations, but also many Neotropical and temperate migratory individuals that may use the area for only a few days each migration season.",Article,Scopus,0.72713795,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,154,NA

However, the mechanisms that produce density-dependent feedbacks on demographic rates and thus regulate these populations are poorly understood, particularly for migratory species. We conducted a three-year density-reduction experiment to investigate the behavioral mechanisms that regulate the abundance of a Nearctic-Neotropical migrant passerine, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), during the breeding season. We found that the number of young fledged per territory, territory size, and the proportion of time males spent foraging were significantly greater on territories around which neighbor density was experimentally reduced compared to control territories. Territory quality, proportion of nests depredated per territory, and male countersinging rates were not statistically different between treatments. These results indicate that individuals with more neighbors (i.e., in neighborhoods with greater conspecific density) have reduced breeding productivity. The results also suggest that a crowding mechanism that mediates interactions among territory-holders could generate the density dependence needed to regulate local abundance, at least in areas of homogeneous, high-quality habitat. The effect of the neighbor-density reduction on warbler fecundity and behavior varied with annual fluctuations in weather and food availability, and was strongest in 1997, an El Ni√±o year, when conditions for breeding were least favorable. This variation in our experimental results among years implies that density dependence due to crowding may have its strongest impact on local abundance when environmental conditions are relatively poor.",Article,Scopus,0.723639417,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,54,NA

I recorded all birds detected within 100 m-wide strip transects, walked at random through every forest type all day long. The frequency of records per 10 h and flock sizes on each transect were averaged over all surveys in each study site (N = 3025 h). Censused groups included terrestrial (tinamous, woodquails, curassow and trumpeter) and arboreal species (guans, macaws, parrots, toucans), but not waterbirds. The abundance of all game birds was higher in non-hunted than in hunted areas, though not always significantly for secretive understorey species (tinamous, guans, wood-quail) or canopy frugivores (parrots, macaws, toucans). The Black Curassow and Gray-winged Trumpeter exhibited the highest and most consistent increases (7-10-fold) and more so between intermediate and non-hunted sites than between hunted and intermediate sites. The mean flock size also increased along the hunting gradient, especially in flocking species (macaws, parrots, trumpeter).

Combined densities of Neotropical migrants declined (14 44%) on all of the Saskatchewan plots; Tennessee Warblers (Vermivora peregrina).

Six of seven Neotropical migrants showed the same direction of change as in a province-wide Breeding Bird Survey. Successional changes did not account for decreased densities of these five species, but they may partly explain increases in some other species. Fluctuations in food supply (e.g., spruce budworm [Choristoneura fumiferana]) could not explain changes, because some species thai should have responded numerically to budworm outbreaks that occurred in the 1990s had increased whereas others had decreased at the same site. The surrounding forest remained continuous over the 17 18 years, so changes in forest area cannot account for the declines. In Manitoba, more Neotropical migrants increased (19) than decreased (11) according to combined densities from four plots. Combined densities of Neotropical migrants also increased at three of the four plots (33123%). Ten of 15 Neotropical migrant species showed different 'trends' than a province wide analysis of BBS data.

Neotropical migrants that breed in North America and winter in Central America occur in high concentrations on their non-breeding grounds where they spend the majority of the year and where habitat loss has been associated with population declines. Here, we use eBird data to model weekly patterns of abundance and occurrence for 21 forest passerine species that winter in Central America. We estimate species‚Äô distributional dynamics across the annual cycle, which we use to determine how species are currently associated with public protected areas and projected changes in climate and land-use. The effects of global change on the non-breeding grounds is characterized by decreasing precipitation, especially during the summer, and the conversion of forest to cropland, grassland, or peri-urban. The effects of global change on the breeding grounds are characterized by increasing winter precipitation, higher temperatures, and the conversion of forest to peri-urban. During spring and autumn migration, species are projected to encounter higher temperatures, forests that have been converted to peri-urban, and increased precipitation during spring migration. Based on current distributional dynamics, susceptibility to global change is characterized by the loss of forested habitats on the non-breeding grounds, warming temperatures during migration and on the breeding grounds, and declining summer rainfall on the non-breeding grounds. Public protected areas with low and medium protection status are more prevalent on the non-breeding grounds, suggesting that management opportunities currently exist to mitigate near-term non-breeding habitat losses. These efforts would affect more individuals of more species during a longer period of the annual cycle, which may create additional opportunities for species to respond to changes in habitat or phenology that are likely to develop under climate change. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.719272632,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,116,NA

Since mid-2004, the Ro Cruces wetland, a Ramsar site located in southern Chile (40¬∞S), exhibited a sudden increase in mortality and emigration of the largest breeding population of Black-necked swans in the Neotropics, a massive demise of the dominant macrophyte Egeria densa (the main food of swans and several aquatic birds), and a seasonal appearance of turbid waters. We compared annual variation in rainfall, river flow, and radiation over the period 20002005 to assess the role of environmental factors on these wetland changes. Those factors, with the exception of a decrease in river flow during 2004, did not show significant inter-annual differences. However, when comparing Landsat images, we found in the visible and near-infrared spectrum, a corresponding increase and decrease in water reflectance for 2005 with respect to 2003 and 2001, respectively. These results may reflect the appearance of turbid waters and the decrease in cover of E. densa. All temporal changes were restricted to the northern and central zones of the wetland. In addition, spatial analysis showed a gradient in turbidity across the wetland waters, which was enhanced by estuarine influence during spring-tides. Censuses of aquatic birds (19992005) showed that only herbivorous birds exhibited a pronounced decrease in population abundance after mid-2004, while piscivorous birds continued normal cycling, with even some positive trends in abundance during 20042005. Population declines in herbivorous birds may be related to the demise of E. densa and suspension of sediments during periods of reduced river flow (2004) that gave rise to the turbidity in the wetland waters. Environmental changes could be related to changes in water quality after a new pulp mill, built upstream of the wetland, initiated operations during February 2004. ¬© 2008 The Society of Wetland Scientists.",Article,Scopus,0.714685054,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,88,NA

Thus, parental strategies may include choosing appropriate nest sites and behaving in ways that minimize predation. Habitat characteristics that may influence nest success include degree of nest concealment, proximity to habitat edge, plant architecture as well as several others cited in the literature. However, few studies have examined display behavior as a factor that could also influence nest survival. We experimentally tested whether sexual motor displays served as a cue for visually oriented predators to locate artificial nests in a population of blue-black grassquits Volatinia jacarina, a Neotropical passerine that exhibits a complex sexual display and is subjected to elevated rates of nest predation. We also evaluated the effect of nest substrate on survival. Predation rate was higher for nests within territories of displaying males relative to areas without displaying males and for nests placed in shrubs relative to grasses. Predation increased sharply in the third experimental replicate, at the end of the breeding season, which suggests that predators may develop a search image for nests or may become more abundant during specific periods of the season. Avian predators appear to be the most important nest predators. Results suggest that there may be a trade-off between the increase in fitness derived from sexual displays of males to attract potential mates and the decrease owing to predation of active nests within their territories. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",Article,Scopus,0.706583387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,148,NA

The research was carried out in Playa de Oro (0¬∞52'35""N, 78¬∞47'40""W; 45-590 m a.s.l.), Esmeraldas, northwestern Ecuador. A total of 344 bird species are known to occur, though I presume that &gt;400 species might be present in the study area, or migrate through it, on a regular basis. I sampled 18 transects (25.14 km), using the MTW method for rapid assessments. In order to perform a comparative study of the effectiveness of mist-netting and transect-mapping protocols, I chose two independent transects, MNT 1 (625 m) and MNT 2 (550 m), which were studied with both methods. They were located in a similarly structured habitat mosaic of cultivated land and selectively logged forest. The greater variety of human-managed habitats was the principal cause for higher species richness and diversity at MNT 1 (nMN = 117; nMTW = 162) in comparison with MNT 2 (nMN = 96; nMTW = 144). Nevertheless, according to the MTW data, the number of forestdependent species (MNT 1 = 78, MNT 2 = 90) and threatened taxa (world: MNT 1 = 4, MNT 2 = 7; Ecuador: MNT 1 = 37, MNT 2 = 48) was higher at MNT 2, likely due to the lower degree of fragmentation, higher foliage complexity, and lower hunting pressure. Biomass density was almost identical, with an estimated 193 kg/km2 for MNT 1 and 198 kg/km2 for MNT 2. The number of breeding 'pairs' was roughly 2000 /km2 and 1800 /km2, and the average biomass per individual 36 g and 41 g, respectively. In conclusion, the conservation value of study sites should be ranked on the basis of a detailed comparison of habitat association as well as threat status of the bird species present, whereas species richness, diversity indices, and biomass density should not be used in this context. For example, the 'bird community index' (BCI ) sensu Canterbury et al. (2000) clearly reflected the higher value of MNT 2 in comparison with MNT 1 for the conservation of forestdependent birds (BCI : MNT 1 = -0.049 versus MNT 2 = 0.541). Regarding the comparative effectiveness and efficiency, the results indicate that, in only 8-9% (21-23 h) of the study time, 39-50% (45 and 48) more bird species were recorded by transect mapping than by mist netting. High costs and low time efficiency, as well as inaccurate representation of entire bird groups, make the use of mist netting prohibitive for most survey purposes, unless the status and habitat selection of altitudinal and latitudinal migrants are concerned. Transect mapping is highly effective at detecting avian taxa that regularly vocalize. However, dispersing birds, floaters, long-distance migrants on passage, and very silent breeding residents were overlooked or underestimated. Thus, I developed optimized MTW protocols to further increase bird species detectability. For instance, implementing the specifically designed MTW monitoring protocol, a well-trained observer might record c. 70% of the total species richness and 80-90% of all breeding residents present in the transect area within as little as six days. For transects of up to 1200 m, sufficient data for rough estimations of absolute population and biomass densities can be obtained in the same period. ¬© Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Bonn.",Article,Scopus,0.705628015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,167,NA

We studied the effects of creating group-selection openings (man-made canopy gaps) of various sizes on breeding bird habitat use in a bottomland hardwood forest in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA. We used spot mapping and mist netting to estimate bird abundance at 0.06-, 0.13-, 0.26-, and 0.5-ha gaps and at uncut control areas during the 1996, 1997, and 1998 breeding seasons (1 May-1 August). There were significant increases in the number of species mapped (P = 0.0001) and netted (P = 0.0001) with successive increases in gap size. The greatest number of total spot-map detections (P = 0.0002) and mist net captures (P = 0.0004) also occurred in and around the large gaps. These patterns were the result of increased use of larger gaps by field-edge species, primarily Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), Common Yellow-throat (Geothlypis trichas), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), and some forest-edge species, such as White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus) and Northern Parula (Parula americana). Conversely, Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) was less abundant in and adjacent to gaps. Because there were few differences in vegetation among gaps of different sizes, it is likely that birds that were detected more frequently in and adjacent to larger gaps selected those gaps based on other factors correlated with size. Creation of 0.5-ha group-selection openings in southern bottomland forests should provide breeding habitat for some field-edge species in gaps and habitat for forest-interior species and canopy-dwelling forest-edge species between gaps, provided that sufficient mature forest is maintained.",Article,Scopus,0.699083752,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,158,NA

Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4.

Noteworthy were the abundance of Turdidae and the rarity of Psittacidae on both islands as compared to other sites in the region. Abundance of individual species on the two islands was uncorrelated. In fact, 34% and 49% of the species were recorded exclusively on Ilha Grande and Cardoso respectively.

We studied a population of Tropical Kingbirds (Tyrannus melancholicus), a primarily insectivorous species, in eastern Bolivia to examine relationships between rainfall, food availability, and foraging strategies throughout the year. Our study site in the southern Amazon Basin was characterized by strong seasonal variation in the abundance of the kingbird's main insect prey (coleopterans and hymenopterans), with reduced abundance during the nonbreeding season which largely overlaps the dry season. Overall, mean search times for insect prey by Tropical Kingbirds during the breeding (96.9 ¬± 85.6 [SD] sec) and nonbreeding (83.7 ¬± 91.2 sec) seasons did not differ (P= 0.23). However, during the nonbreeding season, kingbird search times were negatively, but nonsignificantly, correlated with coleopteran abundance (r2= 0.43, P= 0.16) and significantly and negatively correlated with hymenopteran abundance (r2= 0.72, P= 0.03). Although insect abundance differed seasonally, kingbird search times did not, perhaps because kingbirds forage on a greater variety of insects during the nonbreeding season or, during the breeding season, kingbird search times may be influenced by the need to monitor and defend nests as well as constraints on the types of prey that can be fed to nestlings. However, the reduced abundance of their primary insect prey and negative relationships between the abundance of those prey and search times during the dry, nonbreeding season suggest that Tropical Kingbirds in southern Amazonia may be food limited, potentially explaining why some migrate and spend that season elsewhere. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

The fate of migratory birds has been a concern stimulating research over the past 40 years in response to population declines documented in long-term studies including those of the IITF and collaborators in Puerto Rico's Gu√°nica dry forest. Various studies indicate that in addition to forest loss or fragmentation, some migrant declines may be due to rainfall variation, the consequences of which may carry over from one stage of a migrant's annual cycle to another. For example, the Gu√°nica studies indicate that rainfall extremes on either the temperate breeding or tropical wintering grounds affect migrant abundance and survival differently depending on the species. In contrast, IITF's collaborative studies of the migrant Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) in the Bahamas found that late winter droughts affect its annual survival and breeding success in Michigan. We review these IITF migrant studies and relate them to other studies, which have improved our understanding of migrant ecology of relevance to conservation. Particularly important is the advent of the full annual cycle (FAC) approach. The FAC will facilitate future identification and mitigation of limiting factors contributing to migrant population declines, which for some species, may be exacerbated by global climate change. ¬© 2017 by the authors.",Article,Scopus,0.684734863,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,110,NA

Estimated apparent within-season survival of both species decreased as a function of amount of habitat within a 2000-m radius; survival was approximately 12 times (95% CI 3.43-14) greater in landscapes with 85% habitat than in landscapes with 10% habitat. Apparent annual survival also decreased as a function of amount of habitat within a 100-m radius. Over the range of habitat amount, apparent annual survival decreased 15% (95% CI 7-29%) as the amount of habitat decreased. Our results suggest that reduced species occurrence in landscapes with low proportions of habitat is due partly to lower apparent survival at these sites. This mechanism operates both directly (i.e., via effects on mortality or dispersal during breeding) and possibly through indirect effects during the nonbreeding season. Habitat loss was associated not only with a lower number of individuals, but also with lower survival of those individuals. ¬© 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.674379844,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,65,NA

The objectives of this study were to determine species composition and relative abundance of bird populations in oak and oak-conifer woodlands; and to evaluate the importance of these habitats to nesting birds. This study was undertaken near the northern limit of the Garry oak habitat in North America. The study design consisted of three replicates each of five upland habitats and three riparian habitats. Seventy-two bird species (53 Neotropical migrants and 19 permanent residents) were found at least twice on the 18 study sites. There were no significant differences in species richness among upland habitats. An average of 12 neotropical migrant species were detected per study site in both upland and riparian areas. Neotropical species comprised 62% of all birds detected. Bird abundance was highest in study sites with large amounts of small oak and small pine; it was lowest in riparian study sites. The most abundant species was the Nashville warbler.

We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9 m3 ha-1, equivalent to only 1.1 trees ha-1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Despite these effects, studies are limited, and lacking for raptors, in contrast to temperate and continental regions. During breeding and non-breeding seasons of 2012, roadside surveys and point counts were conducted in natural and human-transformed areas of the island of Cuba to determine whether or not raptors from an island show a pattern of ecological response to human activity similar to those observed in continental studies. Raptors showed strong variation in relation to habitat transformations, with lower richness, abundance, and density in the more extensively transformed areas. A total of 11 species was recorded, mostly in natural areas. Similar numbers of species were observed in coastal vegetation and cattle pasture habitat types within each zone.

Increasing intensity of forest management on private lands and decreased harvest rates on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest, USA, have resulted in a loss of diverse young forest stands, typically called early seral forest. Previous studies suggest that the amount of early seral broadleaf cover within conifer forests is linked to the composition of foliage-gleaning bird communities. However, information regarding productivity and juvenile use of post-breeding habitat in highly modified plantation habitat is lacking. We examined the relationship between vegetation structure resulting from intensive forest management practices and the abundance of five species of leafgleaning, neotropical migrants: orange-crowned warbler (Oreothlypis celata (Say, 1823)), Wilson's warbler (Wilsonia pusilla (A. Wilson, 1811)), MacGillivray's warbler (Oporornis tolmiei (J.K. Townsend, 1839)), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus (Nuttall, 1840)), and black-headed grosbeak (Pheucticus melanocephalus (Swainson, 1827)). All species, except MacGillivray's warbler, showed positive associations with the amount of early seral hardwood cover as fledglings, breeding adults, or both. However, the relative magnitude of these associations varied, suggesting that other factors may also have influenced avian responses. Abundances of breeding pairs and young are likely to show positive responses to management practices that increase early seral hardwood cover in regenerating stands. If adopted at landscape and regional scales, such practices may positively influence population trends of several declining bird species.",Article,Scopus,0.66253255,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,93,NA

This study explored the conservation status of a large predator, the jaguar, considered an indicator of the maintenance of how well ecological processes are maintained. We implemented an original integrative approach, exploring successive ecosystem status proxies, from habitats and responses to threats of predators and their prey, to canopy structure and forest biomass. Niche modeling allowed identification of more suitable habitats, significantly related to canopy height and forest biomass. Capture/recapture methods showed that jaguar density was higher in habitats identified as more suitable by the niche model. Surveys of ungulates, large rodents and birds also showed higher density where jaguars were more abundant. Although jaguar density does not allow early detection of overall vertebrate community collapse, a decrease in the abundance of large terrestrial birds was noted as good first evidence of disturbance. The most promising tool comes from easily acquired LiDAR data and radar images: a decrease in canopy roughness was closely associated with the disturbance of forests and associated decreasing vertebrate biomass. This mixed approach, focusing on an apex predator, ecological modeling and remote-sensing information, not only helps detect early population declines in large mammals, but is also useful to discuss the relevance of large predators as indicators and the efficiency of conservation measures. It can also be easily extrapolated and adapted in a timely manner, since important open-source data are increasingly available and relevant for large-scale and real-time monitoring of biodiversity. ¬© 2016 de Thoisy et al.

In this paper, we review several lines of evidence, emphasizing results of our research on paruline warblers in Jamaica, which indicate that migrant passerines often compete intraspecifically in winter for preferred quality habitats and that their populations may be limited at least in part by ecological conditions in winter. The demographic and ecological evidence supporting this hypothesis for migrant passerines includes: (1) differing densities among habitats, suggesting variation in habitat suitability; (2) strong territoriality, site attachment, and site fidelity; (3) experimental demonstrations of habitat saturation; (4) nonrandom distributions of sex and age classes among habitats; (5) overwinter decline of body mass by individuals occupying the most drought-stressed habitats; and (6) different residence times among habitats, suggesting differences in survival or dispersal.

In particular, few examinations of historical influences on patterns of species richness and relative abundances in tropical communities have been conducted. In part, that gap in our knowledge has been caused by a paucity of data on tropical communities, even for relatively well-studied taxa such as birds. In the Neotropics, only two sites, a 97-ha plot in lowland Peru and a 100-ha plot in French Guiana, have been inventoried on a spatial scale sufficient to estimate population densities for a majority of resident bird species. Results from those studies revealed extremely similar species richness, community biomass, and patterns of relative abundance. A third site in lowland Panama was originally censused in 1968-1969 and has often been compared with many other tropical and temperate sites. Results from Panama suggested an exceptionally different community structure from that observed at the Amazonian sites. Informative comparisons among sites have been hampered, however, by differences in sampling protocols. The Panama site was sampled on a much smaller spatial scale (2 ha) than the two Amazonian sites. To improve comparisons, we censused a 104-ha area (the Limbo plot) encompassing the original 2-ha Panama study area and used several census methods, including those used at the Amazonian sites. As expected, spatial scale had a strong effect on estimates of species richness. We detected 252 species on the Limbo plot, compared with 161 detected on the original 2-ha area. Estimates of total individual birds per 100 ha were similar, but estimates from the original study were based on densities measured for one-third fewer species than we measured on our larger study area. Of the 53 species for which both Panama studies estimated population densities, a significant number of estimates were higher in the original study. Thus, the small spatial scale of the original study apparently led to inflated density estimates. The primary cause of disparities appeared to result from undersampling in the smaller plot of many species with patchy distributions and large territory sizes. Compared with Amazonian communities, the Panama community had far fewer rare species. Although 33% of species in Amazonian sites had densities of ‚â§1 pair/100 ha, only 17% were equally rare in Panama. Furthermore, eight species in Panama were, by tropical standards, 'superabundant,' attaining densities as high as 212 breeding individuals/100 ha; the most abundant species in Amazonia barely reached one-third of that number. In total, those eight species accounted for 36% of all individuals at Limbo. The median abundance at Limbo was 7 pairs/100 ha, vs. 2.5 pairs/100 ha in Amazonia. Consequently, the total number of birds on the Limbo study area was nearly twice that found in Amazonia, despite species richness being only three-fourths as great. We conclude, first, that spatial scale has indeed had an important effect on the characterization of the Panama bird community. The intrinsically patchy distributions of most forest-dwelling bird species raise the need for large-scale censuses. Second, the Panama community, compared with the two Amazonian sites, has a fundamentally different organization; it hosts nearly twice as many individual birds and is distinctly less dominated by rarity. Similar patterns of community structure appear to be present within tree and mammal communities as well. Therefore, results from the Amazonian studies cannot be generalized to all lowland Neotropical communities. We attribute differences in community structure primarily to differing biogeographic histories. The lower species richness and the greater number of total birds present in Panama appear to derive, at least in part, from two important factors: an area effect linked to the location of Panama on a narrow isthmus, and the repeated history of disturbance on multiple temporal scales in Panama.",Article,Scopus,0.658913541,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,233,NA

Thus, an ecological process at a broader scale may act to constrain processes at finer scales (Allen and Starr 1982, Thompson et al. 2000). Developing a full understanding of the spatial scales at which habitat conditions impinge on ecological processes therefore demands a multi-scale approach (Wiens 1989). The continuum of possible spatial scales can be broken into: (1) the space occupied by an individual, (2) the patch scale ? the habitat patch occupied by many individuals and species, (3) the landscape scale ? the collection of different habitat patches occupied by local populations, and (4) a biogeographic scale that encompasses different climates, vegetation formations, and assemblages of species (adapted from Wiens et al. 1986). Habitat fragmentation alters the spatial arrangement, shape and relative proportions of different habitat patches. These changes have a profound influence on ecological processes that are sensitive to alteration of the composition of environments, particularly at spatial scales 2-4 above. Two ecological processes, nest predation and brood parasitism by the Brownheaded Cowbird (Molothrus ater), are the primary influences on nesting success of most North American land birds (Martin 1992). Many studies that have investigated the relationship between habitat and nesting success have focused on the question of how vegetation characteristics of the nest micro-environment influence nest success (e.g., Martin 1992, Larison et al. 2001). This focus is at the scale of the space occupied by an individual bird (Wiens et al. 1986). In contrast, studies at broader scales are mostly concerned with how variation in predator/parasite density or movement pattern associated with coarser-scale habitat features has an impact on nesting success. For example, at the scale of a local patch, nests situated closer to habitat edges often experience higher predation or parasitism rates, largely due to elevated predator/parasite densities at habitat edges (Andren and Angelstam 1988, Burke and Nol 2000). The relative density of predators and parasites within edge habitat may further depend on the relative proportions of different habitats at broader, landscape scales. Thus, a handful of studies have examined how nesting success varies with degree of habitat fragmentation within 1-10 km radii of study sites (Robinson et al. 1995, Tewksbury et al. 1999). Understanding the ecological basis for scale dependence in nest predation and parasitism, requires an understanding of the distribution and abundance of predators and parasites in relation to edge, area, and biogeographic effects. These have been examined in greatest detail for the Brown-headed Cowbird. Cowbirds generally forage in open, short-grass habitats, particularly agricultural and other humanmodified habitats (Lowther 1993). However, they often parasitize hosts breeding in forested habitats. Female cowbirds therefore commute daily between their foraging areas and nearby forested habitats to parasitize hosts (Donovan et al. 2000). This gives rise to an ""edge effect"" where parasitism is greater along the edges of forests that are closer to cowbird feeding habitat. Individual cowbirds are capable of commuting up to 15 km between foraging and breeding resources (Curson et al. 2000). In the eastern United States, however, average commuting distances are more commonly 1-3 km (Thompson 1994, Gates and Evans 1998, Raim 2000, Thompson and Dijak 2000). The distance that cowbirds will penetrate forest interiors is correlated with the local population size of cowbirds in suitable habitat surrounding the forest (Donovan et al. 1997). This local abundance of cowbirds is, to a large extent, limited by the availability of suitable feeding areas, an area effect. Thus, local cowbird abundance increases as the relative area of human-transformed, usually agricultural habitats increases (Donovan et al. 1997). Thus, edge effects at the patch scale are expected to be constrained by variation in local cowbird abundance associated with area effects at local landscape scales within as much as a 10 km radius. At a biogeographic scale, the relative abundance of cowbirds is greatest within the Great Plains (incorporating portions of southern Canada, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma) and becomes progressively less towards the eastern and western edges of their range (Peterjohn et al. 2000). This pattern of relative abundance reflects the historical distribution of cowbirds in North America. They are believed to have been originally concentrated in the Great Plains of central North America but to have spread eastward and westward during the 19th and 20th centuries (Mayfield 1965, Rothstein 1994). Consequently, cowbird abundance decreases with increasing distance from the center of abundance in the Midwest, independently of continental patterns in land cover (Thompson et al. 2000). This is consistent with a general ecological pattern of spatial variation in abundance: density declines from the region of peak density towards the boundaries of the range (Brown 1984). Predator abundance and the risk of nest predation are hypothesized to exhibit similar scale dependence (Donovan et al. 1997, Tewksbury et al. 1999, Thompson et al. 2002), although biogeographic variation has yet to be documented in sufficient detail. Most studies have investigated the relationship between habitat features and nesting success at small and medium scales for individual species at usually single sites, but very few have investigated larger-scale influences. A notable exception is the study of Robinson et al. (1995), which quantified levels of nest predation and cowbird parasitism for nine species across a gradient of forest fragmentation (quantified within a 10 km radius of study sites) spanning nine landscapes within six mid-western states of the United States. Hochachka et al. (1999) also found that increased forest cover within a 10 km radius resulted in lower rates of cowbird parasitism of hosts in general. Using nest success data collected on the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) collated in the Breeding Biology Research and Monitoring Database (BBIRD), we extend this approach to ask: what are the relationships between forest fragmentation and each of nest parasitism and nest predation? how do these relationships vary with the scale at which habitat fragmentation is assessed? The Ovenbird is a Neotropical migrant songbird that nests on the ground in the interior of mature forests in the eastern United States and Canada. It is known to be sensitive to forest edges, incurring higher nest mortality in edge habitat, and is a preferred host of the Brown-headed Cowbird (Van Horn and Donovan 1994). It is therefore expected to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. ¬© 2006 Springer.",Book Chapter,Scopus,0.658242885,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,205,NA

Bird surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17 60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002. Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species, however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorous), Wood Thrush (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence, overall community composition differed significantly between burned and unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that objective.

In Colombia, it began in 1992, and between 2002 and 2006, has been continuously developed. We assessed if this initiative could provide information on key aspects of nine species of Neotropical shorebirds currendy reported in our country. We review the achievements within five goals: 1) Increasing the awareness of wetlands values; 2) Providing the basis to estimate waterbird populations; 3) Monitoring changes in waterbird numbers; 4) Improving knowledge of little-known waterbird species; and 5) Identifying and monitoring sites that qualify as wetlands of international importance (Ramsar sites). Six Neotropical shorebird species have been registered by NWC in Colombia from 2002 to2006. In recent years (2005-2006), NWC has shown that more localities and species of Neotropical shorebirds could be monitored by involving more volunteers and ornithological organizations. NWC is starting to provide fine-scale information on distribution of litde-known species such as the Pied Lapwing (Vanellns cajanui) and supports range extensions for others. Two Ramsar sites, one potential site in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN), and other eight Important Bird Areas (IBAs) have been visited by NWC. Five Neotropical shorebird species have been recorded in such sites, most of them in die Andean region. Only one species, the Noble Snipe (Gallinago nobilis) has been reported in the 5 years of the NWC, but in only few localities. Other species showed temporal gaps or were recorded only occasionally, thus allowing only limited use of data for analyzing abundance and population trends. The relevance of NWC for monitoring Neotropical shorebirds can improve if expanded within key regions (Andes and llanos), and if periodical visits can be scheduled.",Conference Paper,Scopus,0.656408265,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,42,NA

At Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, lowland rain forests are particularly diverse in the avian fauna they contain and while most of the forests have been fragmented by human activity, many of the fragments still harbor diverse assemblages of bird species. In these landscapes, linear strips of residual rain forest vegetation along streams as well as linear strips of vegetation fences (live fences) crossing the pastures might provide some connectivity to bird populations existed in forest fragments. We investigated bird species richness and relative abundance in one 6-km long section of live fences (LF) bordering a dirt road and in two 6-km long sections of residual forest vegetation along a river (MR) and one permanent stream (BS). We used point count procedures which resulted in the count of 2984 birds representing 133 species. At the LF site we detected 74% of the species, 72% at the BS site and 57% at the MR site. Only 38% of the species were common among sites. Neotropical migratory birds accounted for 34-41% of the species counted at all sites. While edge and open habitat birds accounted for 6-10% of the species and for 50% of the records at the three vegetation strips, about 90% of the species were forest birds. Distance to forest fragments and degree of disturbance of the vegetation seemed to negatively influence bird species presence at the BS and MR strips.

We compared demographic indicators of habitat quality for a focal species, the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), wintering in Jamaican citrus orchards and shade coffee plantations with those in four natural habitats: mangrove, coastal scrub, coastal palm, and dry limestone forests. Demographic measures of habitat quality included density, age and sex ratio, apparent survival, and changes in body mass. Measures of habitat quality for redstarts in citrus and coffee habitats were generally intermediate between the highest (mangrove) and lowest (dry limestone) measurements from natural habitats. The decline in mean body mass over the winter period was a strong predictor of annual survival rate among habitats, and we suggest that measures of body condition coupled with survival data provide the best measures of habitat quality for nonbreeding songbirds. Density, which is far easier to estimate, was correlated with these more labor-intensive measures, particularly in the late winter when food is likely most limiting. Thus, local density may be useful as an approximation of habitat quality for wintering migrant warblers. Our findings bolster those of previous studies based on bird abundance that suggest arboreal agricultural habitats in the tropics can be useful for the conservation of generalist, insectivorous birds, including many migratory passerines such as redstarts. ¬©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.653978435,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,121,NA

In contrast, the ideal free distribution (IFD) predicts that local density is a function of habitat quality, but that individuals achieve the same fitness in different habitat types as a result of density-dependent variation in territory size. Although the IFD represents an alternative, population dynamics of territorial species are generally expected to be driven by an IDD. We tested the predictions of IFD and IDD by monitoring the demographic response of the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) to selection harvesting (30- 40% tree removal) during the first five years postharvest in five pairs of 25-ha study plots, each comprising a control (undisturbed) and a treatment (harvested plot). In the first year following harvesting, Ovenbird territory size increased in treatment plots relative to controls, whereas density, productivity per unit area, and the abundance of litter invertebrates decreased. Treatment effects declined consistently as stands regenerated, and most effects were no longer significant by the fifth year postharvest. However, there was no treatment effect on daily nest survival rate nor on per capita productivity. These results are consistent with the IFD, whereby similar per capita productivity is achieved across habitat types through density adjustments facilitated by changes in territory size. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence for an IFD in a territorial bird species. ¬© 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.653463096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,56,NA

Habitat position for a species was its mean foraging height, along with the mean scores on three principal habitat axes for census stations at which it was recorded. Habitat breadth was the standard deviation of recorded foraging heights and the standard deviations of ""positive"" station scores on the habitat axes. We also examined differences in habitat position and breadth between endemic and wide-ranging taxa and amongst dietary groups. Amongst 31 species for which density estimation was possible, there were no correlations between local abundance and breadth of habitat use on any of the habitat axes. Breadth of habitat used did not vary with degree of endemism, but herbivores used a greater breadth of habitats on the axis describing canopy closure than did omnivores. Habitat position did not vary with endemic status, but herbivores preferred higher-biomass habitats than faunivores, and higher foraging heights than either faunivores or omnivores. Local abundance was linked weakly to habitat position with commoner species tending to forage in the lower strata of open-canopied areas. The 31 most commonly recorded species tended to occupy ""middle-range"" habitat positions, while 28 rarer species occupied habitats toward one or other end of the vegetation axes.

Understanding the degree of such variation is an important aspect of migrant ecology, especially in South America, where routes and sites are not well known. We studied stopover site use by two Vireo species and three Catharus species in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia during a two-year period. We used capture totals corrected for mist-net effort and density estimates derived from variable distance transect observations performed at sites located at three different altitudes and thus habitats to describe variation in stopover site use. Four of the five study species showed significant seasonal variation in terms of presence, such that ecologically similar species were present during opposite migration periods; for example, Vireo flavoviridis was an autumn migrant, while Vireo olivaceus was commonest in spring. A similar pattern was observed for Catharus fuscescens and Catharus minimus. We detected differences in density with habitat/altitude, with C. minimus and Catharus ustulatus most abundant in pre-montane forest, while C. fuscescens abundance peaked in lowland forest. At the same altitude, Catharus species were more abundant in pre-montane forest than in shade coffee plantations. The abundance of C. ustulatus varied markedly between years during autumn migration, potentially in association with changes in the prevailing wind conditions. The temporal and spatial variation in stopover site use described here provides important insights into migratory strategies for Neotropical migrants within northern South America, and also regarding the multiple factors that may have shaped these strategies. ¬© 2012 Dt.

Recent evidence from a partially-migratory species suggests that in contrast, limited foraging opportunities at high elevations during severe wet season storms drives the most metabolically-challenged individuals down to elevations where rainfall is lighter. Here, I test community-level predictions of this hypothesis by examining the relationship between high-elevation rainfall in the second half of the year and counts of migrant birds in lowland forest during late December each year from 1990-2009. I contrast results derived from analysis of all migrant species with both analyses of only the frugivorous migrants, and analyses of resident species. Counts of migrant species were on average positively associated with montane rainfall with differences of up to 72% in the numbers of birds counted in drier or wetter years. Frugivores and smaller birds responded more strongly to variation in rainfall compared to the broader migrant species pool. Interestingly, counts of resident species were also higher following wetter montane wet seasons. Results of analyses exploring the cause of resident responses were not consistent with climatic effects on breeding productivity or short-term weather effects on detectability. Results were, however, consistent with cryptic down-slope migration of individuals breeding at higher elevations augmenting lowland resident populations in wet years. These results suggest that changes in rainfall amount, storm intensity, and timing of severe weather events would lead to large increases in or losses of an important behaviour. ¬© 2011 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.643486519,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,194,NA

In this study, we investigated how the combined effects of some forest structure components affect the occurrence and abundance of a resident bird species, the scale-backed antbird Hylophylax poecilinotus (Cabanis, 1847). We tested the null hypothesis of no difference between the variation in forest structure components at locations where birds occurred and at locations where they did not. In a pristine Terra Firme forest at the Ducke Reserve, Manaus, we recorded bird occurrence and abundance using mist nets in 56 transects (1 km long each) within a 9 √ó 9 km trail grid covering 6400 ha. Also in the same 56 transects, we set 50 √ó 50 m plots and recorded the following seven components of forest structure and landscape: 1) canopy opening, 2) leaf litter, 3) tree abundance, 4) logs, 5) snags, 6) streams, and 7) elevation. We evaluated their effects on avian occurrence and abundance by using models of Multiple Logistic Regression (for bird occurrence) and Multiple Linear Regression (for bird abundance). The results suggested that H. poecilinotus occurred significantly more often in lowland areas, in areas located farther away from streams, and in areas bearing thicker leaf litter. Hylophylax poecilinotus was also more abundant in lowland areas and in areas located further away from streams. Overall, the results indicated that environmental heterogeneity produced by variation in forest structure components affects habitat use by this bird species in the Amazon forest.",Article,Scopus,0.640451583,0,NA,NA,5,NA,,,2,NA

There were significant relationships between habitat selection and abundance or frequency of occurrence but not with diet or body size. Few species exhibited consistent geographical trends along the north-south gradient of decreasing rainfall. Guianan endemics tended to be widespread within the country. Several seasonal movements and inter-annual population fluctuations were documented. Rarity had different forms, but no general ecological correlates. Nearly half of rare species were associated with various types of forest gaps or edges, and were consequently more abundant outside the forest zone, i.e. in grasslands or clearings.

In this paper, we present one full year of data on macaw populations from a relatively pristine site in the Ecuadorian Amazon, and compare this site to two other sites with intermediate and relatively high levels of human activity. At Tiputini Biodiversity Station, a pristine terra-firme forest, macaws were more common in the dry season than in the wet season. This pattern is the opposite of that recently reported for seasonally inundated forests in Peru, suggesting that macaws may make large-scale, seasonal movements across habitat types. We employed the same sampling methodology for shorter periods of time at Sacha Lodge, characterized by intermediate levels of human activity, and at Jatun Sacha Biological Station, characterized by relatively high levels of human activity and habitat degradation. We recorded an intermediate number of macaws at Sacha Lodge, and the lowest densities at Jatun Sacha. Three groups of indicator taxa sampled at all three sites showed a similar pattern.

When subtle changes in diversity accumulate over time, annual comparisons may offer an incomplete perspective of changes in diversity. In this case, progressive change, the comparison of changes in diversity from a baseline condition, may offer greater insight because changes in diversity are assessed over longer periods of times. Our objectives were to determine how forest bird diversity has changed over time and whether those changes were associated with forest disturbance. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used North American Breeding Bird Survey data, a time series of Landsat images classified with respect to land cover change, and mixed-effects models to associate changes in forest bird community structure with forest disturbance, latitude, and longitude in the conterminous United States for the years 1985 to 2006. We document a significant divergence from the baseline structure for all birds of similar migratory habit and nest location, and all forest birds as a group from 1985 to 2006. Unexpectedly, decreases in progressive similarity resulted from small changes in richness (,1 species per route for the 22-year study period) and modest losses in abundance (228.7-210.2 individuals per route) that varied by migratory habit and nest location. Forest disturbance increased progressive similarity for Neotropical migrants, permanent residents, ground nesting, and cavity nesting species. We also documented highest progressive similarity in the eastern United States. Conclusions/Significance: Contemporary forest bird community structure is changing rapidly over a relatively short period of time (e.g., 22 years). Forest disturbance and forest regeneration are primary factors associated with contemporary forest bird community structure, longitude and latitude are secondary factors, and forest loss is a tertiary factor. Importantly, these findings suggest some regions of the United States may already fall below the habitat amount threshold where fragmentation effects become important predictors of forest bird community structure.¬© 2010 Rinderknecht et al.",Article,Scopus,0.637413421,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,144,NA

The strategic location of the Sierra suggests that other South American wintering migrants may stopover there, but no information is available on the migrant community during spring or how they distribute themselves between habitats and across the broad elevational gradient. Here, we present species richness and densities of migratory landbirds obtained through standardized census and captures along an elevation gradient (100-2,100 m) covering two habitats, forest and shade coffee, during two consecutive spring migrations. The migrant community (~39 species) showed a peak in species richness and abundance at mid elevations (700-1,700 m), mirroring the pattern often observed in communities of resident Neotropical birds. However, individually the abundance of the commonest species peaked at different elevations and showed high annual variability. We also found within-species differences in density between shade-coffee and forest at the same elevation, possibly reflecting differences in habitat quality for some species. Factors such as food availability and predation risk are expected to be critical in shaping the distribution of migrants during stopover, and further research is required to identify the drivers of the observed elevational patterns. This study contributes to our knowledge of the life histories of migrants during stopover and highlights the habitats and elevations where conservation measures would protect the highest number of species and individuals at a South American stopover site. ¬© 2015 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.637205206,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,66,NA

We compared breeding bird assemblages (grouped into 5 habitat guilds) in undisturbed shoreline habitats with those in 20-50-m-wide riparian buffer strips in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forests on insular Newfoundland, Canada. Total avian abundance was higher along buffer strips than undisturbed shorelines because of a greater abundance of ubiquitous species and species associated with clearcut edge habitats. Abundances of forest generalist, interior forest, and riparian species were similar between buffers and controls. Riparian buffer strips provided habitat for a diverse avian assemblage and maintained many riparian and woodland species in areas of intensive clearcutting. Counts of riparian species did not increase in wider buffers, likely due to their association with habitats adjacent to water, which do not increase in proportion to strip width. Total numbers of interior forest birds, many species of which may be declining in northeastern North America, may increase in wider buffers, but these species were rare even in the widest strips sampled (40-50 m) when compared to local interior forest habitat.

Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments. Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m.

Jaguarundis occupy and use a range of habitats with dense undergrowth from northern Mexico to central Argentina, but may be most abundant in seasonal dry, Atlantic, gallery, and mixed grassland/agricultural forest landscapes. Jaguarundis are principally predators of small (sigmodontine) rodents, although other mammals, birds, and squamate reptiles are taken regularly. The vast majority of jaguarundi camera-trap records occurred during daylight hours (0600h-1800h); jaguaurndis are also predominantly terrestrial, although they appear to be capable tree climbers. Home range sizes for jaguarundis vary greatly, but most are ‚â§25km2; females' territories may be much smaller than or similar in size to those of males. Males may concentrate movements in one area before shifting to another and, as with other felids, intersexual overlap in habitat use appears to be common. Interference competition may be important in influencing the distribution and ecology of jaguarundis, although their diurnal habits may somewhat mitigate its effect. Conflict between humans and jaguarundis over small livestock may be widespread among rural human communities and is likely to be underreported. Despite this conflict, jaguarundis can persist in agriculturally modified landscapes and small forest fragments. Additional research on local jaguarundi populations from more areas should be a priority to determine the true status of the species. ¬© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Review,Scopus,0.631959266,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,126,NA

We compared the abundance of cavities and cavity nests between primary and selectively-logged subtropical moist Atlantic forest in Argentina, and conducted the first before-after controlled nest-box addition experiment to determine whether nest sites limit the breeding density of cavity-nesting birds in tropical or subtropical moist forest. Visual inspection of 86 cavities identified through ground-surveys revealed that only 19% were suitable for nesting birds, suggesting that cavity abundance may be overestimated in the literature on tropical forests. Suitable cavities were found in fewer than 1% of 1156 trees <60. cm. dbh but 20% of 20 trees >100. cm. dbh. Logged forest had half the basal area of primary forest, one third the density of large trees, nine times fewer cavities suitable for nesting birds, and 17 times fewer active nests. When we added nest boxes, nesting density increased on treatment plots but not on control plots in both logged and primary forest, suggesting that cavity supply can limit nest density even in relatively undisturbed forest. This is the first experiment to show how reduced cavity supply in logged tropical forest can limit breeding density of cavity-nesting birds. International initiatives such as forest certification should promote tropical timber management strategies that conserve large live cavity-bearing trees. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.631719618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,47,NA

Migratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea-regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range. Conclusions/Significance. We demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms. ¬© 2007 Martin et al.",Article,Scopus,0.631360257,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,136,NA

On the Yucatan peninsula, migrants use many habitats, several of which remain unstudied, and methodological differences preclude interhabitat comparisons based on studies to date. We used distance sampling along line transects in six habitats in northeast Belize to examine use of previously unstudied habitats (e.g., salt marsh) by Neotropical migrants and to permit comparison across habitats. We calculated unadjusted and adjusted (for detectability) density estimates for individual migrant species and for all species combined to generate hypotheses about habitat quality based on the assumption that density and quality are positively correlated. Adjusted density estimates for all migrants were highest in black mangrove habitat (1799 ¬± 110 ind/km2), intermediate in three forest types and milpa (range 598-802 ind/km2), and lowest in salt marsh (207 ¬± 32.3 ind/km2). By combining density estimates with habitat availability in our study region, we estimated that evergreen forest and black mangrove supported 70% and 9% of the region's migrant population, respectively. At the species level, five of the 10 most common species had habitat preferences (&gt;50% detections in one habitat). Given the diversity of habitat preferences among species and apparent seasonal movements, our results indicate that Neotropical migrants in northeast Belize are dependent on a matrix of interconnected habitats. ¬©2010 The Authors.

We also examined whether forested buffer strips along second- and third-order streams effectively maintain the pre-logging riparian breeding bird community by comparing species abundance, richness, and turnover among three treatments: (1) unharvested controls; (2) sites that were clear-cut, leaving a narrow (‚àº14 m) forested buffer on both sides of the stream; and (3) sites that were clear-cut, leaving a wide (‚àº31 m) forested buffer along both sides of the stream. Deciduous trees, berry-producing shrubs, and other deciduous shrubs less common in adjacent upland forest characterized streamside zones. Despite different vegetation features, riparian and upland habitats did not differ in any measures of bird species richness and composition. No species or species group was more abundant in the upland. Neotropical migrants, resident species, and species associated with deciduous trees and shrubs in forested habitats were more abundant in riparian habitats than in adjacent uplands. Total bird abundance and abundance of four species (American Robin [Turdus migratorius], Pacific-slope Flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], Black-throated Gray Warbler [Dendroica nigrescens], and Winter Wren [Troglodytes troglodytes]) were higher in riparian habitats. Abundance of these riparian associates was correlated with percent cover of berry-producing shrubs and the number of deciduous trees in the canopy. We found that the number of breeding bird species on sites with narrow buffers increased from slightly fewer than controls before harvest to an average of 10 more species than controls after harvest, a change reflected in an average 20% increase in species turnover on narrow-buffer sites relative to controls. Total bird abundance did not differ between treatments and controls. Resident species, those species associated with shrubs in forested habitats and conifer trees, declined on both buffer treatments. Species associated with upland and riparian forests (Black-throated Gray Warbler, Golden-crowned Kinglet [Regulus satrapa], and Brown Creeper [Certhia americana]) decreased in abundance on riparian buffer treatments relative to controls, whereas species associated with open, shrubby habitats (Dark-eyed Junco [Junco hyemalis], Cedar Waxwing [Bombycilla cedrorum], and Song Sparrow [Melospiza melodia]) increased in abundance on one or both riparian buffer treatments. High species turnover on narrow-buffer treatments indicated that buffers <14 m on each side of the stream did not maintain the pre-logging bird community. There was little difference in species turnover or species richness between the wide-buffer treatment and the control, indicating that a 30-m buffer on both sides of second-order and third-order streams maintains most of the pre-logging bird community in the first two years postharvest. The Black-throated Gray Warbler was the only riparian associate to decline on both the narrow- and wide-buffer treatments; its abundance was positively correlated with buffer width, and a buffer ‚â•45 m wide on each side of second- and third-order streams was needed to support populations at densities found on unharvested controls. To maintain the entire breeding bird community associated with forested riparian habitats in the coastal Northwest, we recommend a minimum buffer of 45 m along both sides of second- and third-order streams. Habitat features such as deciduous trees (Alnus rubra and Acer macrophyllum) and berry-producing shrubs (especially Rubus spectabilis) appear to be important and should be maintained within forested riparian buffer strips. This study documents short-term effects of riparian treatments on the breeding bird community, which may take several years to respond to habitat manipulations.

The seasonality of moult thus revealed is combined with existing knowledge of breeding seasons and seasonal environmental changes in an attempt to work out the broad pattern of annual cycles and their relation to climate. Within any local population the date of onset of moult may vary according to sex and age. In genera in which both sexes participate in nesting, males and females begin to moult at about the same time, or the males slightly in advance of the females. In genera with marked sexual dimorphism, in which only the female attends the nest, males may begin to moult well before females, at about the time that the latter begin egg‚Äêlaying. The former group includes the genera Pachyramphus and Tityra, comprising species that are largely insectivorous, and the latter group includes the more specialized frugivorous genera.

A regional survey embracing all parts of the neotropical region shows that the peak of onset of moult occurs towards the end of the dry season (frugivorous group) or early in the wet season (Pachyramphus group). The changing moult seasons, strikingly in conformity with the geographical changes in the period of heaviest rainfall, are traced along a number of transects from Mexico in the north to Paraguay and Bolivia in the south. Such evidence as there is suggests that the main period of onset of moult in the frugivorous and Pachyramphus groups coincides with the period when their food is approaching or at its seasonal peak of abundance. It seems that both breeding and moult, which are almost entirely mutually exclusive, are as far as possible timed to coincide with this most favourable period; but whereas the moult takes a more or less fixed length of time the period when breeding is possible varies greatly in different species. Widely different patterns of annual cycle may result from the interaction of the two processes. Examples are given both from the cotingas and from species of other families with similar ecology. The proximate factors controlling the timing of the moult are briefly considered. It is suggested that increasing food availability is the main environmental controlling factor, and that an endogenous circannual cycle of moult must also be involved.

This study aimed to analyze the population size of the endemic and threatened subspecies Grus canadensis nesiotes. For this, a simultaneous census was undertaken in 24 count stations in Isla de la Juventud (IJ) and 32 stations in Ciego de √Åvila (CA), Cuba, during two consecutive days between 2008 and 2010. Abundance and behavior pattern (instantaneous method) were analyzed by habitat type, to help understand how cranes modify their behavioral pattern when the natural habitat is changed. Flocks in IJ had three individuals, and between 1.9 ¬± 1.5 and 2.8 ¬± 1.5 in CA. Population size in IJ was 164 individuals, and in CA of 137, 141 and 168 individuals for the 2008-2010 period, respectively. The counting efficacy was high (IJ: 91 %; CA: 81-87 %) and the numerical concordance was intermediate (IJ: 45.4 %; CA: 72 %). When comparing the habitat type, the abundance was higher in natural savannahs (83), followed by coastal flats (59), pines (23) and cattle pastures (7) in IJ; while in CA, marsh grasslands hosted the greatest abundance for the three years period (130; 120; 112), followed by grassland with palms (2; 17; 51) and cattle pastures (5; 4; 5). The cranes were fed more in cattle pas¬≠tures and were more alert in natural savannas and marsh grasslands. The frequency of feeding and alert behaviors was different from the natural savannah/coastal flats and natural savannah/cattle pastures combinations in IJ. For CA, differences were found between marsh grasslands and marsh grasslands with palms. The population size increased by management strategies adopted in CA; nevertheless, might be affected by habitat loss associated with invasive alien plants in IJ. We propose the maintenance of prescribed fire in marsh grasslands under protection regime, as a strategy for long-term management to contribute with population growth. ¬© 2016, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Exurban development, one of the fastest growing forms of land use in the United States, may affect wildlife through habitat fragmentation and building presence may alter habitat quality. We studied the effects of residential development and temperature gradients on bird species occurrence at 140 study sites in the southern Appalachian Mountains (North Carolina, U.S.A.) that varied with respect to building density and elevation. We used occupancy models to determine 36 bird species' associations with building density, forest canopy cover, average daily mean temperature, and an interaction between building density and mean temperature. Responses varied with habitat requirement, breeding range, and migration distance. Building density and mean temperature were both included in the top occupancy models for 19 of 36 species and a building density by temperature interaction was included in models for 8 bird species. As exurban development expands in the southern Appalachians, interior forest species and Neotropical migrants are likely to decline, but shrubland or edge species are not likely to benefit. Overall, effects of building density were greater than those of forest canopy cover. Exurban development had a greater effect on birds at high elevations due to a greater abundance of sensitive forest-interior species and Neotropical migrants. A warming climate may exacerbate these negative effects. ¬© 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.625715209,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,91,NA

However, quantified habitat-use relationships are often lacking, which makes forest management planning challenging for some species. One such species is the Eastern Whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus), a crepuscular, insectivorous, neotropical, migrant bird, designated as a species at risk throughout most of its breeding range. Thus, we determined occupancy of Eastern Whip-poor-wills at 37 sampling points in red pine (Pinus resinosa)-dominated stands harvested using clearcut with seed trees and in white pine (P. strobus)-dominated stands harvested using uniform shelterwood in June 2013 in eastern Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. In red pine stands, we found that model-predicted site occupancy increased by 3.3 times from 0.23 where young (<16. years since harvest) clearcuts were absent to 0.76 where young clearcuts were present. Shelterwood harvesting in white pine stands, by contrast, was unassociated with occupancy. Our data suggest that an aggregated mean total of 12. ha of clearcuts per 100. ha (interquartile range: 1.5-18. ha) of mature pine-dominated forest is associated with significantly higher occupancy by breeding Eastern Whip-poor-wills, and that the clearcuts can be composed of various sizes (interquartile range: 3-42. ha) and ages (interquartile range: 5-24. years since harvest). Given that similar relationships have been found by others elsewhere, clearcuts may increase the occupancy and abundance of breeding Eastern Whip-poor-wills in other regions and forest types throughout northeastern North America. ¬© 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.624979164,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,207,NA

Growing concern for the cumulative influence of land use activities on ecological systems has heightened the need for large-scale studies to complement what has been observed at local scales. We investigated possible landscape effects on Neotropical migrant bird populations for the eastern United States by linking two large-scale inventories designed to monitor breeding-bird abundances and land use patterns. The null hypothesis of no relation between landscape structure and Neotropical migrant abundance was tested by correlating measures of landscape structure with bird abundance, while controlling for the geographic distance among samples. Neotropical migrants as a group were more ""sensitive"" to landscape structure than either temperate migrants or permanent residents. Neotropical migrants tended to be more abundant in landscapes with a greater proportion of forest and wetland habitats, fewer edge habitats, larger forest patches, and with forest habitats well dispersed throughout the scene. Permanent residents showed few correlations with landscape structure and temperate migrants were associated with habitat diversity and edge attributes rather than with the amount, size, and dispersion of forest habitats. The association between Neotropical migrant abundance and forest fragmentation differed among physiographic strata, suggesting that landscape context affects observed relations between bird abundance and landscape structure. Finally, associations between landscape structure and temporal trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were counter to those observed in space. Trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were negatively correlated with forest habitats. These results suggest that extrapolation of patterns observed in some landscapes is not likely to hold regionally, and that conservation policies must consider the variation in landscape structure associations observed among different types of bird species and in physiographic strata with varying land use histories.",Article,Scopus,0.62303427,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,52,NA

To evaluate how this single-species management focus might fit within an ecologically based management approach for multiple forest birds, we performed a manipulative experiment using four treatments (three intensities of timber harvests and an unharvested control) at each of seven study areas within the core Cerulean Warbler breeding range. We collected pre-harvest (one year) and post-harvest (four years) data on the territory density of Cerulean Warblers and six additional focal species, avian community relative abundance, and several key habitat variables. We evaluated the avian and habitat responses across the 3-32m2ha-1 residual basal area (RBA) range of the treatments. Cerulean Warbler territory density peaked with medium RBA (~16m2ha-1). In contrast, territory densities of the other focal species were negatively related to RBA (e.g., Hooded Warbler [Setophaga citrina]), were positively related to RBA (e.g., Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]), or were not sensitive to this measure (Scarlet Tanager [Piranga olivacea]). Some species (e.g., Hooded Warbler) increased with time post-treatment and were likely tied to a developing understory, whereas declines (e.g., Ovenbird) were immediate. Relative abundance responses of additional species were consistent with the territory density responses of the focal species. Across the RBA gradient, greatest separation in the avian community was between early successional forest species (e.g., Yellow-breasted Chat [Icteria virens]) and closed-canopy mature forest species (e.g., Ovenbird), with the Cerulean Warbler and other species located intermediate to these two extremes. Overall, our results suggest that harvests within 10-20m2ha-1 RBA yield the largest increases in Cerulean Warblers, benefit additional disturbance-dependent species, and may retain closed-canopy species but at reduced levels. Harvests outside the optimum RBA range for Cerulean Warblers can support bird assemblages specifically associated with early or late (closed-canopy) successional stages. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.620047639,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,41,NA

Fruiting was seasonal, with the dry season (July- November) being the time of maximum fruit abundance, and the late wet season (February-April) a time of relative shortage.

Most of those species, however, appeared in very low numbers in the forest canopy, except understory frugivores, which regularly fed on canopy fruits. Among the migratory species were some Nearctic (6), Austral (3), and species probably holding both migratory and resident populations in the area (4). Additionally, I found evidence that two species of parrots perform seasonal movements, leaving the forest canopy around Manaus during the dry season. Frugivores dominated the canopy avifauna in abundance, but contradicting results reported from other Neotropical forest canopies, insectivores and frugivores had equal species richness. The canopy avifauna was highly homogeneous among sites in terms of species richness, distribution among abundance classes, and number of species in each feeding guild, habitat, and microhabitat. As in Costa Rica, the canopy avifauna of Manaus was mostly composed by typical canopy bird species, and not by edge-living species as reported from Panama.

Considerable empirical evidence has supported a positive correlation between spatial distribution and local numerical abundance of species, which could create a syndrome of rarity for species limited in geographic distribution and occurring at low densities even in their primary habitats. We used auditory-count data and range information for birds in the Tilar√°n mountains of Costa Rica to examine the abundance-distribution relationship in cloud forest species and to determine if endemic species (limited to Costa Rican-Panamanian highlands or Central America) are locally rare or restricted in ecological distribution. We found a positive correlation between abundance and distribution at the smallest spatial scale: species occupying few sites in the study area had low abundances where they occur. At larger scales, geographical distribution measured categorically was correlated with local ecological amplitude (zones occupied). Local abundance, however, was not correlated across all species with estimates of range size (km2), although most endemics exhibited below-median abundance. Within families with endemics and cosmopolitan species, 72% of narrow endemics were among the rarest species. For most narrow endemics, we rejected the possibility that they are sufficiently specialized within their habitats to reach relatively high densities. A conclusive test of the abundance-distribution relationship at large spatial scales and evaluation of global population size for endemics will require a comprehensive analysis using abundance data from throughout species' ranges. Such analyses for tropical species will be a long time coming, but it is meanwhile prudent to recognize that many endemics are threatened at several spatial scales, including the risks of small local populations. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Influences of habitat loss and degradation on breeding or wintering grounds have been postulated as possible causes, but few empirical data exist to support a specific cause. Based on previous studies linking abundances of Canada warbler and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), we hypothesized that the Canada warbler may be influenced by a persistent decline in spruce budworm throughout the bird's breeding range, a hypothesis that has received little attention. This hypothesis makes 5 predictions: 1) budworm outbreaks and warbler detections should be spatially and temporally coincident; 2) the relationship between Canada warbler and spruce budworm outbreaks should be similar to relationships for other warblers known to be spruce budworm associates; 3) the relationship should be stronger than for warblers lacking an association with spruce budworm; 4) because temporal trends of both spruce budworm and Canada warblers have varied throughout Canadian provinces, declines in Canada warblers should be seen only in provinces where spruce budworm also declined; and 5) variation in Canada warbler abundance should reflect variation in supply of preferred habitat for the spruce budworm if habitat rather than budworm abundance is the key. Our analyses supported predictions 14, suggesting that Canada warbler may be even more closely associated with spruce budworm than are known associated species, a phenomenon noted in the literature but previously unexplained. Prediction 5 was not supported, because budworm habitat (area of mature and older balsam fir Abies balsamea and white spruce Picea glauca) remained constant in Ontario while warbler abundance declined. Although the correlative nature of these results precludes inference of a causal relationship between the declines of the Canada warbler and spruce budworm, we postulate that potential links may exist directly, where spruce budworm outbreaks provide elevated levels of insect prey items for breeding Canada warblers, or indirectly through changes in forest structure and composition following outbreaks. These results have implications when considering long-term trends in Canada warbler populations, because it may be impossible to alter population trends for species linked to the timing and magnitude of spruce budworm outbreaks.",Article,Scopus,0.612437848,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,69,NA

The value of urban areas as habitat for native wildlife and the characteristics that determine its value, however, remain little studied. Many Neotropical migrant passerine bird species are declining due to changes in breeding, migratory, and wintering habitats and climatic conditions. During 2010‚Äì2013, we evaluated the importance of native valley oak (Quercus lobata) as stopover foraging habitat used by Neotropical migrant birds in urban areas of the Sacramento region in California, USA. Over 3 years, we surveyed spring and late summer-early fall migrant songbirds and measured tree canopy cover within 31 c.0.91 ha transects in Curtis Park, an older residential neighborhood. We detected 607 individuals from 20 migrant species, but four wood warblers comprised the bulk of observations: black-throated gray (Setophaga nigrescens), Wilson's (Cardellina pusilla), orange-crowned (Oreothlypis celata), and yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia). Migrant abundance was closely correlated with valley oak canopy abundance and increased linearly with oak canopy especially during fall migration. Migrants were nearly absent from areas lacking oak canopy. Migrant bird species as a group also foraged in valley oak substantially more often (74%) than would be expected based on its 15% relative canopy cover (œá2 1d.f. = 924, p &lt; 0.0001), as did all species whose selectivity could be tested. These results are important in demonstrating previously undocumented migrant use of urban areas with remnant valley oak canopy and suggest that protecting existing valley oaks and increasing their use in future urban forestry and landscape plantings in the Central Valley could provide substantial habitat benefits for native migratory birds. ¬© 2018",Article,Scopus,0.611013392,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,143,NA

The food habit of L. Dominicanus was analyzed in the State of Paran√°, Brazil. The food items of the pellets were identified in order to demonstrate the importance of demersal fish in the diet of this species. The pellets were sampled between August 2011 and July 2012 on the seaside of Barrancos. Based on the identification of the otoliths found in the pellets, length and mass of fishes were recalculated. In the 120 pellets collected, 228 fishes from 14 species and 3 families were identified, with emphasis on the Sciaenidae family with 11 species. Cathorops spixii, Larimus breviceps, Paralonchurus brasiliensis, and Stellifer rastrifer were most frequent. In the seasonal analyses, L. breviceps, Micropogonias furnieri, P. brasiliensis, and S. rastrifer were found in the diet of L. Dominicanus in all seasons. The canonical analysis showed significant seasonal differences in abundance, mass, and length of the teleosts identified in the diet of L. Dominicanus.

Due to poaching, habitat loss, and fragmentation, C. rubra is globally at risk, and has become rare or locally extinct throughout of its range. Viable populations May occur in southeastern Mexico, particularly in Los Chimalapas region, in the state of Oaxaca, but this has not yet been verified. Recently, camera traps have been used for ecological studies of cracids, and other birds in the understory of rain forests. Our aim was to document the occupancy, relative abundance, and activity patterns of C. rubra in the understory of a tropical rain forest in Los Chimalapas region, through data gathered from camera traps. We gathered data from 27 camera traps and used occupancy models to analyze the effect of microhabitat on the detection (the probability that at least one individual of a species will be detected, given that the species inhabits the area of interest) and occupancy (the probability that a randomly selected site or sampling unit contains at least one individual of the species) probabilities. The best model indicated that C. rubra detection probability was higher in sites with higher records of a potential predator, the margay (Leopardus wiedii). The occupancy probability of C. rubra was 0.94 (SE = 0.06), and its detection probability ranged from 0.08 (station with zero records of L. wiedii) to 0.79 (stations with 27 records of L. wiedii). This association May be due to L. wiedii tracking the abundance of a potential prey (i.e., C. rubra) or because both species select sites with similar structural components of vegetation. Other models showed lower support, such as those models linking the presence of C. rubra to other predators and human presence. The species was mainly recorded as solitary individuals and showed more frequent activity in the morning and afternoon. The presence of chicks and juveniles suggest that there are suitable conditions for the establishment of a reproductive population of C. rubra in the region. Los Chimalapas still has connections with both, conserved (i.e., Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve) and highly deforested areas (i.e., the Uxpanapa region), and should be a priority region for C. rubra conservation. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.608031863,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,199,NA

We sought toelucidate patterns and magnitudes of temporal change in avian communities insecondary forest patches in Southern Costa Rica biannually over a 10 year periodduring the late breeding season and mid-winter.

Monitoring nesting survival is becoming an important and increasingly reliable method for assessing habitat quality. We investigated nest survival and Brown-headed Cowbird nest parasitism of 18 Neotropical migratory bird species in experimentally managed mixed-oak forests in southeast Ohio. We monitored nests during one pre-treatment year and four post-treatment years in four treatment plots: thin, burn, thin + burn, and unmanipulated control. Nesting activity was lower in the first two post-treatment years, but returned to pre-treatment levels in the last two post-treatment years. Overall post-treatment nesting success in the thin and thin + burn treatments exceeded that in the control and burn plots. Ground and shrub nesting species responded negatively to burning alone, but were not affected by the other treatments. Understory nesting success was initially lower in the burn and thin + burn treatments than in the thin only treatment, but increased in the thin and thin + burn treatment in the final two years. Furthermore, we observed bird species nesting in the thin and thin + burn treatments in the final two years that had not been recorded in the previous three years. Hence, the thinned habitats attracted secondary scrub nesting species. Nest heights were significantly higher in burn and thin + burn treatments. We did not detect Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism until the third and fourth years post-treatment, but nest parasitism was still low at 4.1% of active nests. Our results suggest that combining selective harvests (thinning) with prescribed fire is the best of these forest management plans when considering avian nest survival. ¬© Streby and Miles; Licensee Bentham Open.",Article,Scopus,0.603769293,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,240,NA

Here, we test if urban sources of ALAN are responsible, at least in part, for these observed urban associations. We use weekly estimates of diurnal occurrence and relative abundance for 40 nocturnally migrating bird species that breed in forested environments in North America to assess how associations with distance to urban areas and ALAN are defined across the annual cycle. Migratory bird populations presented stronger than expected associations with shorter distances to urban areas during migration, and stronger than expected association with higher levels of ALAN outside and especially within urban areas during migration. These patterns were more pronounced during autumn migration, especially within urban areas. Outside of the two migration periods, migratory bird populations presented stronger than expected associations with longer distances to urban areas, especially during the nonbreeding season, and weaker than expected associations with the highest levels of ALAN outside and especially within urban areas. These findings suggest that ALAN is associated with higher levels of diurnal abundance along the boundaries and within the interior of urban areas during migration, especially in the autumn when juveniles are undertaking their first migration journey. These findings support the conclusion that urban sources of ALAN can broadly effect migratory behavior, emphasizing the need to better understand the implications of ALAN for migratory bird populations. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.602804794,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,51,1

Antbirds quickly abandoned territories and mates to move to openings created by experimental removals. Pairing with the resident on a new territory was rapid. Unmated birds attracted new mates by singing a gender-specific song that differed from songs given by mated birds. There were no gender differences in replacement time or rate. Some vacancies, experimental and natural, were not filled, suggesting that floaters were rare. Territory and mate switching were not related to immediate enhancement of reproductive success because the probability of reproducing successfully was equally poor on all territories. Territory switching may be an overlooked but common tropical form of territoriality that increases individual survivorship during periods of low food abundance (dry season).

Such information allows more effective application of conservation efforts by applying focused actions along movement trajectories at the population level. Stable isotope methods, especially those using stable hydrogen isotope abundance in feathers (Œ¥2Hf) combined with Bayesian assignment techniques incorporating prior information such as relative abundance of breeding birds, now provide a fast and reliable means of establishing migratory connectivity, especially for Neotropical migrants that breed in North America and molt prior to fall migration. Here we demonstrate how opportunistic sampling of feathers of 30 species of wintering birds in Cuba, Venezuela, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, regions that have typically been poorly sampled for estimating migratory connectivity, can be assigned to breeding areas in North America through both advanced spatial assignment to probability surfaces and through simpler map lookup approaches. Incorporating relative abundance information from the North American Breeding Bird Survey in our Bayesian assignment models generally resulted in a reduction in potential assignment areas on breeding grounds. However, additional tools to constrain longitude such as DNA markers or other isotopes would be desirable for establishing breeding or molt origins of species with broad longitudinal distributions. The isotope approach could act as a rapid means of establishing basic patterns of migratory connectivity across numerous species and populations. We propose a large-scale coordinated sampling effort on the wintering grounds to establish an isotopic atlas of migratory connectivity for North American Neotropical migrants and suggest that isotopic variance be considered as a valuable metric to quantify migratory connectivity. This initiative could then act as a strategic template to guide further efforts involving stable isotopes, light-sensitive geolocators, and other technologies. ¬© 2014 Association of Field Ornithologists.

Several studies have reported segregated fruiting seasons of melastomes, but this pattern is not widespread. The segregated fruiting phenologies of congeneric sympatric species may be an evolutionary response to reduce competition for seed dispersers. Alternatively, aggregated fruiting phenologies may be favoured if local fruit abundance attracts more frugivores, thus enhancing seed dispersal. We monitored melastome fruiting in transects over a 2-y period at a cloud-forest site in the Colombian Andes. Fruiting periods of nine melastome species were aggregated and fruiting peaks coincided with rainy seasons. In a separate 6-mo study, observations at focal plants revealed that 47 of 61 bird species fed on 10 species of melastome, representing 37.4% of feeding events observed. Melastomes were consumed by birds in a higher proportion than expected from their availability and peak melastome fruit abundance coincided with the breeding season of the frugivore community, when melastomes constituted 54% of feeding records. Melastomes interact with a large number of bird species throughout their annual cycles, and seem to constitute pivotal elements that sustain the frugivore community in montane forests. ¬© Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.",Article,Scopus,0.590630335,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,188,NA

The concurrent decrease in the spatial occurrence of the aquatic plant Egeria densa Planch. 1849 - the main food source of swans - was proposed as a cause for swan migration and mortality. Additionally, post-mortem analyses carried out on swans during 2004 showed diminished body weight, high iron loads and histopathological abnormalities in their livers, suggesting iron storage disease. Various hypotheses were postulated to describe those changes; the most plausible related to variations in water quality after a pulp mill located upstream the wetland started to operate in February 2004. Those changes cascaded throughout the stands of E. densa whose remnants had high iron contents in their tissues. Here we present results of a long-term monitoring program of the wetland components, which show that swan population abundance, body weights and histological liver conditions recovered to pre-disturbance levels in 2012.

We believe that a multi-scale approach is essential to assess the influence of factors that control en route habitat use. We determined the relative importance of eight variables, each operating at a habitat-patch, landscape, or regional spatial scale, in explaining the differential use of hardwood forests by Nearctic-Neotropical land birds during migration. We estimated bird densities through transect surveys at sites near the Mississippi coast during spring and autumn migration within landscapes with variable amounts of hardwood forest cover. At a regional scale, migrant density increased with proximity to the coast, which was of moderate importance in explaining bird densities, probably due to constraints imposed on migrants when negotiating the Gulf of Mexico. The amount of hardwood forest cover at a landscape scale was positively correlated with arthropod abundance and had the greatest importance in explaining densities of all migrants, as a group, during spring, and of insectivorous migrants during autumn. Among landscape scales ranging from 500 m to 10 km radius, the densities of migrants were, on average, most strongly and positively related to the amount of hardwood forest cover within a 5 km radius. We suggest that hardwood forest cover at this scale may be an indicator of habitat quality that migrants use as a cue when landing at the end of a migratory flight. At the patch scale, direct measures of arthropod abundance and plant community composition were also important in explaining migrant densities, whereas habitat structure was of little importance. The relative amount of fleshy-fruited trees was positively related and was the most important variable explaining frugivorous migrant density during autumn. Although constraints extrinsic to habitat had a moderate role in explaining migrant distributions, our results are consistent with the view that food availability is the ultimate factor shaping the distributions of birds during stopover. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.589053452,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,137,NA

In addition to the incomplete knowledge of their distribution, nothing is known about the biology and ecology of the species in the country. Most owls in Nicaragua are typical of the forested areas that cover more than 40% of the total land area. This is the most threatened habitat due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier and pressure from human displacement into forested areas. In order to conserve biodiversity in general, Nicaragua has a system of protected areas (SINAP), including three important biosphere reserves.

Army ants (Ecitoninae) are generally thought to have the greatest predatory impact on populations of social wasps, but there is emerging evidence that predatory birds could also be a significant source of colony mortality. Our objectives were to (1) identify the genera of wasps preyed upon by Ibycter americanus (Falconidae), a specialist predator of Neotropical social wasps, (2) quantify wasp nest predation by I. americanus, and (3) compare wasp nest predation rates by I. americanus with calculated rates of wasp nest predation by Eciton burchellii army ants. In 2008 and 2009, we video recorded chick provisioning at I. americanus nests in French Guiana and found that adult birds brought nests of at least ten genera of mainly swarm-founding wasps (Epiponini). In 2012, we noted that three of four sympatric Eciton species raided into trees and thus potentially preyed upon the brood of paper wasps at the same site. We quantified the population density of one Eciton species, calculated its rate of wasp nest predation, and compared this predation rate to that of I. americanus. We conclude that I. americanus rivals the predatory impact of E. burchellii army ants on some populations of Neotropical social wasps. Ibycter americanus and other diurnal vertebrate predators may exert strong selection on wasp defensive behavior, resulting in defensive adaptations that include selection of specific nest sites as well as physical fortification and visual crypsis of nests. ¬© 2014, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Article,Scopus,0.586132809,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,210,NA

In 1993-94, we studied the short-term effects of uneven-aged forest management on bird communities in oak-hickory forests of north western Arkansas. We estimated bird abundance in mature forests and on managed plots receiving either a heavy cutting of understory vegetation (understory treatment) or a combination of both understory cutting and selective cutting in the forest overstory (full treatment). Two nesting guilds and 7 of 14 species with adequate sample size showed significant treatment effects. Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), and the understory-nesting guild were most abundant in mature forest. Indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), and eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) were more abundant on full treatment plots. Tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) were most abundant on mature forest and understory treatment plots. The canopy-nesting guild was most abundant on understory and full treatment plots. Our results suggest that if removal of understory vegetation was practiced widely in the Arkansas Ozarks as part of uneven-aged management, populations of some ground- and shrub-nesting forest interior species of birds could be negatively affected, whereas a few forest canopy and edge species may respond positively.

The study sites spanned approximately 10¬∞ latitude, with two sites each in Central and South America. We recorded a total of 22 species of army ants. The four sites varied in observed and estimated species richness. Species overlap was highest between the Central American sites, and lowest between the South American sites. Raid activity varied significantly among sites. Raid activity per kilometre of trail walks was over four times higher at the most active site (Sta. Maria, Venezuela) than at the least active site (Barro Colorado Island, Panama). Furthermore, each site showed a different diel pattern of activity. For example, raid activity was higher during daylight hours in Costa Rica, and higher at night in Venezuela. Raid activity relationships with ambient temperature also varied significantly among sites. The overall rate of army ant raids passing through 1 m2 plots was 0.73 raids per day, but varied among sites, from 0 raids per day (Panama) to 1.2 raids per day (Venezuela). Primarily subterranean species were significantly more abundant in Venezuela, and above-ground foragers that form large swarm fronts were least abundant in Panama.

We investigated the available food resources, sex ratios, and body condition of territorial Bicknell's Thrushes (Catharus bicknelli) wintering in the Dominican Republic between 1999 and 2008 at two ecologically distinct wet-forest sites, one in high-elevation cloud forest and the other in mid-elevation rainforest. Arthropod abundance was greater in cloud forest habitat, which was occupied by proportionally more males, the larger-bodied sex (74% male). By contrast, both sexes occurred at parity in rainforest habitat (53% male), where soft-bodied fruit was the predominant dietary resource. Body condition of cloud forest males was comparable to that of rainforest males, but cloud forest females were in poorer body condition than rainforest females. Females at the cloud forest site may face a greater likelihood of agonistic interactions with larger-bodied males and the thermoregulatory demands of roosting in colder night temperatures (0-12¬∞C). We suggest that there are sex-specific advantages of wintering in these two habitats and that both are critical to supporting the full demographic structure of Bicknell's Thrush populations.

As these conditions change, one mechanism to maintain favorable resources is for an organism to shift its range. Much of the research examining range shifts has focused on dynamic distribution boundaries wheras the role of species breeding habitat or migration strategies on shift tendencies has received less attention. We expand on previous research by using a large suite of avian species (i.e., 277), analyzing observed abundance-weighted average latitudes, and categorizing species by breeding environment and migration strategy. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey dataset to address two questions: (1) Has the center of observed abundance for individual species shifted latitudinally? (2) Is there a relationship between migration strategy or breeding habitat and range shifts? Results indicate the majority of species have experienced poleward range shifts over the last 43¬†years, and birds breeding in all habitat showed trends of poleward shift but only those species breeding in scrub-shrub and grassland environments were different from zero. Additionally, species that are short distance migrants are experiencing significant poleward shifts while Neotropical and permanent residents had shifts that were not different from zero. Our findings do support the general trend expected from climate driven changes (i.e.,¬†>¬†52¬†% shifting poleward), however, the proportion of species exhibiting equatorial shifts (24¬†%) or no significant shifts (23¬†%) illustrates the complex interplay between land cover, climate, species interactions, and other forces that can interact to influence breeding ranges over time. Regardless of the mechanisms driving range shifts, our findings emphasize the need for connecting and expanding habitats for those species experiencing range shifts. This research describes the patterns of breeding birds through central North America and we encourage future research to focus on the mechanisms driving these patterns. ¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus,0.572092402,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,118,NA

We live-trapped small mammals in eleven gaps and understorey sites for two years, and compared abundance, fitness components (survival and per capita recruitment) and dispersal of these two rodent species across gaps and understorey and seasons (rainy and dry). Our data indicated no differences in resource availability and consumption rate between habitats. Treefall gaps may represent a sink habitat for Oryzomys where individuals had lower fitness, apparently because of habitat-specific ant predation on early life stages, than in the understorey, the source habitat. Conversely, gaps may be source habitat for Proechimys where individuals had higher fitness, than in the understorey, the sink habitat.

First, we created distribution and abundance models for common bird species using climate, elevation, and tree species variables and modeled how bird distributions might change as habitats shift. Second, we assessed potential effects on high-elevation birds, especially Bicknell's thrush (Catharus bicknelli), that may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, by using statistical associations between climate, spruce-fir forest vegetation and bird survey data. Last, we complemented these projections with an assessment of how habitat quality of a migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) might be affected by climate change. Large changes in bird communities of the Northeast are likely to result from climate change, and these changes will be most dramatic under a scenario of continued high emissions. Indeed, high-elevation bird species may currently be at the threshold of critical change with as little as 1¬∞C warming reducing suitable habitat by more than half. Species at mid elevations are likely to experience declines in habitat quality that could affect demography. Although not all species will be affected adversely, some of the Northeast's iconic species, such as common loon and black-capped chickadee, and some of its most abundant species, including several neotropical migrants, are projected to decline significantly in abundance under all climate change scenarios. No clear mitigation strategies are apparent, as shifts in species' abundances and ranges will occur across all habitat types and for species with widely differing ecologies. ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.571601745,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,48,NA

However, information on the tradeoffs between such intensive forestry practices and biodiversity is scant. Here we assess the magnitude and direction of potential impacts of intensive forest management on populations of early seral-associated breeding birds. Observed population declines of several Neotropical migrant bird species are hypothesized to be linked to the loss of early seral habitat on the breeding grounds. We investigated the association between broadleaved hardwood cover and avian abundance and diversity in intensively managed early seral Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands of the Pacific Northwest. Bird species richness decreased across an elevational gradient, but did not vary as a function of either local vegetation composition or structure. In contrast, bird abundance was strongly associated with hardwood cover at local and landscape scales, especially for foliage-gleaning species. We found strong support for the existence of a threshold in relative bird abundance as a function of hardwood at the stand scale; abundance doubled with an increase from 1% to ‚àº6% hardwood and then reached a plateau. Though abundance of leaf-gleaners increased even more strongly across a gradient in hardwood cover, evidence for a distinct threshold was less clear. We conclude that when early seral hardwood forest is scarce, even small increases in hardwood may provide substantial conservation benefits. However, for some species (i.e., foliage gleaners), there may be more direct trade-offs in abundance and juvenile recruitment with hardwood management intensity. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.567913887,0,NA,NA,5,NA,,,5,NA

We asked whether migrants and residents affect each other's ability to forage at army ant raids. We quantified variation in raid attendance by three guilds of birds: wintering migrants, regular and obligate raid attending residents (ant-following residents), and facultative raid attending residents. To test whether wintering migrants and residents were negatively associated at raids, we collected data on raid attendance in four adjacent life zones in the Tilar√°n Mountains of Costa Rica and in different seasons (when migrants were present and absent). We first compared the guilds' raid attendance among life zones. There was little geographic overlap of migrants and ant-following residents at raids, and raid attendance frequencies were strongly correlated with the estimated local abundances of these bird guilds in each life zone. We then analyzed resident bird flock size and species makeup in the life zones where migrants attended raids most often (Premontane and Lower Montane Wet forests). If migrants affected raid attendance by facultative resident birds, we expected resident numbers or species richness at raids to decrease with migrant presence. Resident flock size and species richness did not differ between times of year with and without migrants, and species identities differed little between seasons. Furthermore, resident flock composition in migrant presence season was similar at raids with and without migrants. We conclude migrants had no measurable effect on resident bird army ant exploitation. Migrants were smaller on average and less likely than residents to capture prey from the ground at raids. These body size and foraging substrate differences between residents and migrants may mitigate inter-guild competition for food at raids. ¬© 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.563846102,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,134,NA

It is unclear whether patterns in older systems concur with results from these dynamic landscapes, and hence the long-term viability of populations inhabiting habitat fragments remains largely unexplored. I focused on resident birds in fragments of humid pine-oak forest in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, isolated over 5000 years ago by climate-change. Seventeen fragments, ranging from 2 ha to over 150,000 ha were sampled in 1997 and 1998 yielding 141 species, of which 60 residents were used for analysis. Avian assemblages exhibited a highly nested structure and, with several notable exceptions, assemblages of birds in low-richness fragments were predictable subsets of those in more diverse fragments. Patch-scale factors - area, shape, elevation, habitat diversity and fractal dimension of edge - all exerted strong univariate influence on avian richness but were so closely inter-related that none had a significant independent effect. Thus, larger fragments were more complex in shape, included higher peaks, supported more diverse forests, and contained higher diversities of resident species. In contrast, the landscape-scale index used - distance from nearest large fragment (> 50,000 ha) - had little effect on richness. This was reinforced by species-level analyses - one species was significantly influenced by isolation, compared with 31 species that displayed significant minimum-area distributions, restricted to patches larger than a particular threshold value. In terms of autecology, vagility, relative abundance and elevational breadth were closely related to distribution - those species with greater mobility, higher abundances and broader elevational tolerances were consistently more widespread. I suggest that more abundant species were less prone to extinction initially, more vagile species were better dispersers and species with broader elevational tolerances more likely to be successful colonists. As with previous research from older landscapes, patch-scale factors were consistently found to be influential, with high quality fragments supporting diverse communities regardless of landscape context. This suggests that the influence of landscape-scale factors noted in younger, anthropogenically fragmented systems may be transitory, overwhelmed by patch-scale factors with time. Which patch attributes are most influential could not be resolved, however, indicating that even thousands of years after fragmentation, they affect diversity patterns in concert. Rather than differentiating effects of area from habitat heterogeneity and other patch-level factors, I advocate resource-based approaches to understand and manage diversity in habitat fragments. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Intensively managed pine supports a diverse avian assemblage potentially affected by establishment and maintenance of an annual biomass feedstock via changes in plant communities, dead wood resources, and habitat structure. We sought to understand how establishing switchgrass on an operational scale affects bird communities within intercropped plantations as compared to typical intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest. We conducted breeding bird point counts using distance sampling for three years (2011-2013) following establishment of intercropped switchgrass stands (6 replicates), traditionally-managed pine plantations, and switchgrass-only plots (0.1km2 minimum) in Kemper Co., MS. We detected 59 breeding bird species from 11,195 detections. Neotropical migrants and forest-edge associated species were less abundant in intercropped plots than controls the first two years after establishment and more abundant in year three. Short distance migrants and residents were scarce in intercropped and control plots initially, and did not differ between these two treatments in any year. Species associated with pine-grass habitat structure were less abundant initially in intercropped plots, but converged with pine controls in subsequent years. Switchgrass monocultures provided minimal resources for birds. If songbird conservation is a management priority, managers should consider potential reductions of some breeding birds for one to two years following intercropping. It is unclear how these relationships may change outside the breeding season and as stands age. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,0.557942269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,239,NA

We used study plots in primary mid-elevation forest and in shade coffee fields in western Panama. We expected that all species would spend as much time as possible flocking, but that the social and environmental factors listed above would limit compatibility between flock movements and individual bird movements, explaining variability in flocking propensity both within and among species. Flocking propensity was well predicted by home range size and flock abundance together, for four of the five species. While flock abundance was uniform across plots, home range sizes varied among species and plots, so that home range size appeared to be the principle factor limiting flocking propensity. Estimates of flock abundance were still required, however, for calculating flocking propensity values. Foraging height and patch characteristics slightly improved predictive ability for the remaining species, M. miniatus. In general, individual birds tended to join flocks whenever one was available inside their home range, regardless of a flock's specific location within the home range. Flocking propensities of individual species were lower in shade coffee fields than in forests, and probably vary across landscapes with variations in habitat. This variability affects the stability and species composition of flocks, and may affect survival rates of individual species. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Article,Scopus,0.557632826,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,117,NA

We explored how the activity of fruit-eating birds was influenced by the abundance of fruits at the local and landscape scales in Andean mountain forests during the breeding season, when most birds forage close to their nest. We measured: (1) the spatial scale of variation in the abundance of fruits, (2) the spatial scale of variation in the activity of fruit-eating birds, and (3) the spatial match between both variables. The sampling design consisted of eleven 1.2-ha sites, each subdivided into 30 cells of 20 √ó 20 m, where we sampled fruits and fruit-eating birds. We found that fruit consumption, and to a lesser extent bird abundance, were associated with local spatial variation in abundance of selected fruit species. However, fruit-eating birds did not modify their spatial distribution in the landscape following changes in availability of these fruits. Our study shows that fruit-eating birds detect local spatial variation in fruit availability in their home breeding ranges, and exploit patches with large clusters of selected fruits. However, it may be unprofitable for breeding birds to stray too far from their nests to exploit fruit-rich patches, accounting for the absence of fruit tracking at larger spatial scales. ¬© 2015 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Inc.",Article,Scopus,0.55511913,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,44,NA

Spearman's rank correlations of habitat and avian community descriptor variables tested the strength and significance of the relationship between variables. Full stepwise regression procedures assessed the response to independent variables of landscape-habitat to five bird guilds. Guilds varied in the strength and nature of the relationship between community parameters and several gradients of habitat structure, vegetation, area and site configuration. Significant negative correlations of species richness of permanent resident, winter resident, and neotropical guilds with housing density, road density and volume of exotic woody species were found. These same guilds were positively correlated to riparian area, channel density, and total volume of woody species. Linear and quadratic regression equations explained between 40 and 81% of the observed variation in avian guild richness and abundance. Total volume of woody species was the single most important predictor included in regression equations for four of seven community guilds.

Their economic and social importance to landowners lies in the landowners' potential to derive substantially more income from leasing access for quail hunting than from raising livestock. Moreover, quail hunters have begun to purchase property that was formerly used for cattle or timber production, with the express purpose of maximizing quail production. A variety of habitat management techniques are being applied on these properties to create vegetation structure that provides usable habitat space for bobwhites. Land management for bobwhite production is fast becoming a reality throughout Texas. People who are interested in wildlife species that have habitat requirements similar to those of quails should embrace this development. Webb and Guthery (1983) and Gruver and Guthery (1986) concluded that bobwhite habitat management applied to Texas rangelands also improved habitat for nongame birds. The research cited in this chapter also provides reasonably strong evidence that habitat management performed for quail production benefi ts both small- and large-mammal populations. Therefore, carefully planned quail habitat management that is applied in the appropriate manner will probably benefi t native fl ora and fauna communities in most parts of Texas because quail management emphasizes maximizing habitat diversity. Self-sustaining nongame bird and small-mammal communities, as well as large wildmammal populations, should all fl ourish on rangelands managed for quails. Bobwhites are grassland birds that require habitats composed of about 65- 75 percent herbaceous habitat and 25- 35 percent woody cover. The herbaceous plant community should be composed of a diversity of forbs and grasses that provide suffi cient food as well as foraging, nesting, brooding, escape, and thermal cover. Similarly, the woody plant community should also be composed of a diversity of plants that provide additional food in the form of mast as well as thermal and escape cover. Woody cover should be interspersed throughout herbaceous plant communities in a manner that ensures that a quail does not have to move more than 60- 80 meters (54- 72 yards) to fi nd woody cover. These vegetation conditions will provide habitat that generally supports diverse and abundant native bird and small-mammal communities, as well as healthy populations of predators and popular game mammals such as white-tailed deer, javelinas, and feral hogs. Quail habitat requirements can be provided on rangelands by applying a number of habitat management techniques. Research has demonstrated that mechanical techniques such as roller-chopping and chaining, herbicide applications, and prescribed fi re, as well as grazing, can all be utilized to provide good quail habitat conditions on rangelands. In fact, a combination of these techniques, such as roller-chopping followed by prescribed burning, or herbicide treatment followed by prescribed burning, will usually create and maintain better habitat conditions for quails than a single technique. Ranchers and quail managers therefore have a great deal of fl exibility in choosing habitat management techniques that will provide the best quail habitat conditions for their individual operations. Fortunately, numerous research projects have indicated that most of the habitat improvement techniques utilized to improve landscapes for quails also benefi t nontarget wildlife populations. Grassland birds in particular represent a declining avian guild that could benefi t signifi cantly as quail habitat management continues to increase on Texas rangelands. Quail management in the forests of East Texas will also likely benefi t nontarget wildlife populations. Recent research has demonstrated that midstory hardwood-removal techniques, such as thinning and girdling and herbicide application followed by prescribed burns ignited in the spring two to three years posttreatment, can be used to restore longleaf pine forests in a manner that benefi ts native bird populations. Other studies have shown that native wildlife populations can also benefi t from eff orts to improve pine forest composed of fast-growing species, though the composition and abundance of bird communities remain diff erent from those of native bird communities of longleaf pine forests. Nevertheless, the commercial pine forests that dominate most of East Texas are capable of supporting diverse native fauna communities when they are managed for bobwhites. The local and regional abundance of numerous species of Neotropical migratory birds, which have been declining in recent years, could improve if more acreage in East Texas and the Southeast are managed for bobwhites. In addition, forest communities of small mammals, white-tailed deer, and feral hogs would also probably benefi t from bobwhite management of pinelands. Nontarget wildlife species that require woody cover would likely decline on rangelands and forests managed for quail production. Anytime that vegetation communities undergo dramatic alteration, populations of a few species suff er and decline. Trade-off s are inevitable and unavoidable. However, most of the bird and mammal species that decline as a result of quail management are species that responded positively to destructive land management practices that ruined the native rangeland and forest ecosystems in Texas. Restoring these ecosystems by applying habitat management that creates vegetation communities pre-ferred by quails simultaneously encourages restoration of native fauna populations, generally resulting in a more diverse and abundant vertebrate community. Most of the rangeland ecosystems in Texas that support or historically supported quail populations have deteriorated over the past 150 years as a result of overgrazing, exotic plant invasions, urbanization, and other disturbances. Similarly, the longleaf pine forests that once dominated the uplands of East Texas are now reduced to small, highly fragmented remnant stands. They have been replaced by commercial forests composed of fast-growing pine species managed in a manner that maximizes profi ts for timber companies at the expense of wildlife. Native bird and mammal abundance and diversity in these commercial forests are poor and generally remain in this condition as long as traditional silviculture is observed. Consequently, good quail management of rangelands and pinelands is a superior alternative to traditional land management practices because the vegetation communities created and maintained for quails support more abundant and diverse wildlife communities than do the overgrazed, brush- and exotic grass- infested pastures and intensively managed commercial pine plantations. The increasing popularity of quails in Texas represents a genuine benefi t to nontarget wildlife species. As more of Texas is improved for quails, more of Texas will be improved for native wildlife.

Historical restriction of gene flow across the Andes (i.e. between our Central and South American subgroups) is supported by coalescent analyses, the haplotype network and significant FST values, however reciprocally monophyletic lineages do not correspond to geographical locations in maximum likelihood analyses. A sudden population expansion for South America is indicated by a mismatch distribution analysis, and further supported by significant (p&lt;0.05) negative values of Fu and Li's DF and F, and Fu's FS. This expansion, estimated at approximately 60 000 years BP (99 000-36 000 years BP 95% CI), encompasses a transition from a warm and dry time period prior to 50 000 years BP to an interval of maximum precipitation (50 000-36 000 years BP). Notably, this time period precedes the climatic and habitat changes associated with the last glacial maximum. In contrast, a multimodal distribution of haplotypes was observed for Central America suggesting either population equilibrium or a recent decline. Significance: High levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity in combination with genetic differentiation among subgroups within regions and between regions highlight the importance of local population conservation in order to preserve maximal levels of genetic diversity in this species. Evidence of historically restricted female-mediated gene flow is an important consideration for captive-breeding programs. ¬© 2009 Lerner et al.",Article,Scopus,0.548555696,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,203,NA

The main purpose of this paper was to advance into the knowledge of the ecological features that allow those species to survive in urban environments and to identify which sets of characters enhance the risk of local extinction. Location: Puebla-Cholula Conurbation (PCC), in M√©xico, a developing country between the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions. Methods: First, 355 qualitative point counts (Echantillonnage Frecuentiels Progressifs) were performed in 21 green areas of the PCC to determine the regional distribution and local abundance of 51 species. Then, groups of species were formed through multivariate cluster analysis as a function of their similarity in distribution and abundance. Finally, bird species were characterized (body length, body mass, type of diet and migration status) and multivariate clusters were analyzed to look for differences between groups (through Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA), and also with the avifauna from evergreen oak forest communities described in the literature. Results: Regional distribution of great-tailed grackle, house finch and house sparrow were maximal, since they were found in all the 21 study areas; local abundances of these species, plus those of inca dove and rock dove, were also high (incidence > 50 %). Regional distribution of seven species (like acorn woodpecker, townsend's warbler or rose-breasted grosbeak) was minimal, since they were located in just one site; and six species exhibited very low local abundances (incidence < 5 %). Cluster analysis formed 3 groups. The abovementioned 5 species with the largest distribution and abundance were included in Group #1, typically urban: thus, the most common species, urban exploiters, were mainly granivorous, resident and had a body size larger than all the remaining species. Urban avoiders (Group #3: ""rare"" species, with a small regional distribution and local abundance) were mainly insectivorous, included resident, wintering and transient species, and had the smallest body size. Conclusions: Classification analysis formed three groups of species, similar to those described in the literature of developed countries in temperate latitudes. Ecological features of urban exploiters are not the same than those of ""rare"" species, neither than those of the bird fauna from natural forest communities. If urban growth keeps provoking the conversion of natural forest habitats into urban environments, green urban areas most likely could not maintain viable populations of many of these bird species.",Article,Scopus,0.544789559,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,76,NA

Existing theory postulates that demographic and environmental stability are required for lekking to be an evolutionarily viable reproductive strategy. However, we lack empirical tests for the hypotheses that lek stability is facilitated by age-specific variation in demographic rates, and by predictable, abundant resources. To address this knowledge gap, we use multistate models to examine how two demographic elements of lek stability‚Äîmale survival and recruitment‚Äîvary with age, social status and phase of the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a Neotropical frugivorous bird, the wiretailed manakin (Pipra filicauda). Our results show that demographic and environmental conditions were related to lek stability in the Ecuadorean Amazon. Apparent annual survival probability of territorial males was higher than that of non-territorial floaters, and recruitment probability increased as males progressed in an age-graded queue. Moreover, annual survival of territorial males and body condition of both floaters and territory holders were higher following years with El Ni√±o conditions, associated with reduced rainfall and probably higher fruit production in the northern Neotropics, and lower after years with wet, La Ni√±a conditions that predominated our study. Recruitment probabilities varied annually, independent of ENSO phase, and increased over our study period, but the annual mean number of territorial males per lek declined. Our results provide empirical support for hypothesized demographic and environmental drivers of lek dynamics. This study also suggests that climate-mediated changes in resource availability can affect demography and subsequent lek stability in a relatively buffered, lowland rainforest. ¬© 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of grazing on vegetation structure and bird species richness and abundance in grazed monoculture and mixed pastures. Study pasture units were subject to four cattle grazing intensities: 0 = nongrazed (control), 15=low, 20=medium, or 35=high animal units (AU) per pasture unit (no cattle, 1.3, 1.0, and 0.6 ha¬∑AU-1, on monoculture pastures and no cattle, 2.1, 1.6, and 0.9 ha¬∑AU-1, on mixed pastures). Monoculture pastures displayed a greater decrease in spatial heterogeneity of the vegetative community in the presence of grazing than mixed pastures. An increase in grazing intensity led to declines in total avian species richness and abundance and species richness within short-distance migrant, neotropical migrant, and permanent resident guilds on monoculture pastures. Declines in total species richness and abundance and neotropical migrant guild species richness and abundance were observed on mixed pastures subject to increasing grazing intensity. However, species richness within short-distance migrant and urban guilds and abundance within the grassland guild increased on this pasture type in the presence of grazing. Loss of spatial heterogeneity typically results in a lack of suitable habitat for birds that occupy the extremes of the vegetation structure gradient. This can lead to a loss of species richness and abundance. For the majority of avian guilds, a low grazing intensity of 1.3 ha¬∑AU-1 and 2.1 ha¬∑AU-1 on monoculture and mixed pasture, respectively, is recommended to maintain abundance. However, these grazing intensities may result in declines in species richness. Ultimately, if a range of avian species are to be supported on monoculture and mixed pastures, spatial heterogeneity of plant structure and composition must be maintained. ¬© Society for Range Management.",Article,Scopus,0.542133507,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,166,NA

We used 5-min point counts to sample birds in each study area each spring from 1995 to 1998, and measured ground-surface elevations and a suite of other habitat variables to investigate bird distributions and community characteristics in relation to important environmental gradients. In both AR and SC, the average number of Neotropical migrant species detected was lowest in semipermanently flooded Nyssa aquatica Linnaeus habitats and greatest in the highest elevation floodplain zone. Melanerpes carolinus Linnaeus, Protonotaria citrea Boddaert, Quiscalus quiscula Linnaeus, and other species were more abundant in N. aquatica habitats, whereas Wilsonia citrina Boddaert, Oporornis formosus Wilson, Vireo griseus Boddaert, and others were more abundant in drier floodplain zones. In LA, there were no significant differences in community metrics or bird species abundances among forest types. Canonical correspondence analyses revealed that structural development of understory vegetation was the most important factor affecting bird distributions in all three study areas; however, potential causes of these structural gradients differed. In AR and SC, differences in habitat structure were related to the hydrologic gradient, as indexed by ground-surface elevation. In LA, structural variations were related mainly to the frequency of canopy gaps. Thus, bird communities in all three areas appeared to be organized primarily in response to repeated localized disturbance. Our results suggest that regular disturbance due to flooding plays an important role in structuring breeding bird communities in floodplains subject to prolonged inundation, whereas other agents of disturbance (e.g., canopy gaps) may be more important in headwater systems subject to only short-duration flooding. Management for avian community integrity in these systems should strive to maintain forest zonation and natural disturbance regimes. ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.539496774,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,145,NA

Forest plantations, particularly those based on native species, could be valuable for conservation purposes, especially in heavily fragmented and disturbed ecosystems. We evaluated the value of a monoculture of a native tree species, the Andean alder (. Alnus acuminata), for the conservation of avifauna in the Central Andes region, which is considered a bird species diversity hotspot but also suffers from high anthropogenic disturbance levels. Our results suggest that alder plantations are valuable for conservation from three points of view: (1) they have similar or greater bird species richness and abundance than secondary native forests; (2) low community similarities are found between this type of forest compared to secondary forest stands (with 27 species exclusive to alder plantations); and (3) three near threatened species (. Odontophorus hyperythrus, Eriocnemis derbyi, and Cyanolyca viridicyanus). Further, 27 out of the 85 species found at the alder plantations were of least concern but showing decreasing population trends. While forest plantations do not replace native forests, they offer habitat for many bird species, some of them being of conservation concern (i.e., included in an IUCN threat category) or with decreasing populations. Hence establishing native species plantations among native forest remnants - especially in heavily fragmented landscapes - could have a positive effect in the conservation of threatened avifauna. ¬© 2014 Elsevier GmbH.",Article,Scopus,0.538347567,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,90,NA

In this study, we analyze the geographic distribution of two endemic emberizids in Argentina, the Cinnamon Warbling-Finch (Poospiza omata) and the Carbonated Sierra-Finch (Phrygilus carbonarius). To study the residence status of the populations and movement patterns of these species we combine geographic information about the occurrence of the species with local information about abundance and mark-recapture studies in the central Monte desert. Analysis at biogeographic scale showed that both species mainly occur in and and semi-arid environments of Argentina. The Cinnamon Warbling-Finch shows movements that correspond to short-distance migration. In contrast, movement patterns of the Carbonated Sierra-Finch are not so clear because the species is always present in its central distributional range. At local scale, in the central Monte desert, seasonal changes in abundance were consistent with the observed patterns in the geographic distribution and movement of both species. Banding of birds also showed that these species are highly mobile, at least in this region. Local results are consistent with the hypotheses that the Cinnamon Warbling-Finch is a nomadic species in its breeding range while the Carbonated Siena-Finch exhibits temporal changes in the boundary of its southern breeding range. The combined analysis at different spatial scales allowed us to describe the movement patterns of Cinnamon Warbling-Finch and Carbonated Sierra-Finch.

One of the most intriguing (but often neglected) ecological phenomena in African rain forests is the interaction between swarm-raiding army ants and ant-following birds. Similar to their well-known Neotropical representatives, ant-following birds in Africa track the massive swarm raids of army ants and feed on arthropods flushed by the ants. In this study we analyzed the effect of habitat fragmentation and degradation of a mid-altitude Congo-Guinean rain forest in western Kenya on the structure of ant-following bird flocks. Significant numbers of swarm raids were located in all forest fragments and in both undegraded and degraded forest. Fifty-six different species of birds followed army ant raids, forming bird flocks of one to 15 species. We quantitatively differentiated the bird community into five species of specialized ant-followers and 51 species of opportunistic ant-followers. Species richness and size of bird flocks decreased with decreasing size of forest fragments and was higher in undegraded than in degraded habitat. This was caused by the decrease of the species richness and number of specialized ant-followers at swarms, while the group of opportunistic ant-followers was affected little by habitat fragmentation and degradation. The composition of bird flocks was more variable in small fragments and degraded forest, compared to undegraded habitat in large fragments. The effect of habitat fragmentation on flock structure was best explained by the strong decline of the abundance of specialized ant-followers in small forest fragments. To conserve the association of army ants and ant-following birds in its natural state, vast areas of unfragmented and undegraded tropical rain forest are necessary. ¬© 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.530794123,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,157,NA

This approach has greatly increased our ability to investigate aspects of avian migration and stopover ecology, since origins of unmarked individuals at migration stopover sites can be estimated for the first time. However, few studies have explored the power of combining isotope measurements with geographic information system (GIS) methods. We measured Œ¥D values in feathers of hatching-year (HY) Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus; n = 60), Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina; n = 113), and Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis; n = 158) at Ft. Morgan Peninsula, Alabama (30¬∞10'N, 88¬∞00'W), a migration stopover site along the Gulf coast. By applying an elevation-corrected hydrogen isotope basemap for birds in North America, we derived a GIS surface depicting expected feather Œ¥D values across the continent. We then used GIS to constrain the possible origins of the sampled populations by considering only values falling within the North American breeding ranges of the species. We depicted likely origins of migrating birds by the 50% and 75% tolerance limits of the data. Our GIS analysis indicated that our captured populations represented much-reduced regions of possible origin based on the North American breeding distributions. Gradients in abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) allowed us to further narrow possible origins within isotopic boundaries for Wood Thrushes and Gray Catbirds. This exercise provided a means by which priority regions and habitats could be assessed at large continental scales based on actual productivity. We suggest the combination of isotopic and GIS tools provides a powerful means to derive conservation priorities and to investigate key factors involved in the ecology of avian migration and stopover. ¬© The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.",Article,Scopus,0.527140175,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,151,NA

Morphologically similar, con-generic bird species potentially compete for limited resources while coexisting, although ecological segregation can reduce negative effects of inter-specific competition. We evaluated ecological segregation between the resident Ruddy-capped Nightingale Thrush (Catharus frantzii) and the migratory Swainson's Thrush (C. ustulatus) during spring of 2002 and 2003 in a cloud mountain forest reserve in the Central Highlands of Chiapas. In order to examine possible habitat segregation we compared relative abundances of Ruddy-capped Nightingale and Swainson's thrushes across five forest habitat types. Furthermore, we compared morphological characters of these thrush species in an attempt to predict the foraging position of each species in the forest understory. The Ruddy-capped Nightingale and Swainson's thrushes coexist in the same habitats in the Huitepec Ecological Reserve during Swainson's Thrush's northward migration period. However, differences in morphology imply that each species may exploit different foraging locations within the forest understory. Despite this, preliminary observations suggest that Ruddy-capped Nightingale and Swainson's thrushes might require food from parts of the forest understory to which the other species seems better adapted.

In the short term, thinning promotes development of understory vegetation, which in turn can increase habitat diversity for wildlife, particularly for songbirds. Thinning also has been identified as a potential approach to accelerate the development of characteristics that are typical of older forest stands. Both the immediate and long-term response of wildlife and habitat to thinning is likely to be influenced by thinning intensity and pattern. The BLM Density Management Study (DMS) was designed to compare ecological responses among various thinning intensities. The purpose of our study was to compare songbird abundance among these thinning treatments to demonstrate the range of responses that might occur as a result of different thinning practices. We sampled breeding songbird abundance using fixed-radius point counts at four of the DMS sites (Bottomline, Green Peak, O.M. Hubbard, and Ten High).

Climate projections coupled to hydrological models were used to analyse variability in wetland water level throughout the current century. Two potential scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions were explored, both resulting in an increase in the inter-annual fluctuations of the water level. In the scenario with higher emissions, projections also showed a long-term negative trend in water-level. To explore the possible response of biota to such water-level changes, species-area relationships of flora and aerial censuses of macro-fauna were analysed during an extraordinary dry period. Plant species richness at the basin scale was found to be highly resistant to hydrological changes, as the large dimension of the wetland acts to buffer against the water-level variations. However, local diversity decreased significantly with low water levels, leading to the loss of ecosystem resilience to additional stressors. The analysis of macro-fauna populations suggested that wetland provides refuge, in low water periods, for the animals with high dispersal ability (aquatic and migratory birds). On the contrary, the abundance of animals with low dispersal ability (mainly herbivorous species) was negatively impacted in low water periods, probably because they are required to search for alternative resources beyond the wetland borders. This period of resource scarcity was also related to increased mortality of large mammals (e.g. marsh deer) around water bodies with high anthropogenic enrichment and cyanobacteria dominance. The synergy between recurrent climatic fluctuations and additional stressors (i.e. biological invasions, eutrophication) presents an important challenge to the conservation of neotropical wetlands in the coming decades. ¬© 2013 √öbeda et al.",Article,Scopus,0.51403902,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,127,NA

The abundance and predictability of food resources have been posited as explanations for the increase of animal species richness in tropical habitats. However, the heterogeneity of natural ecosystems makes it difficult to quantify a response of animal species richness to these qualities of food resources. 2. Fruit-frugivore studies are especially conducive for testing such ecological theories because fruit is conspicuous and easily counted. Fruit-frugivore research in some locations has demonstrated a relationship between animal abundance and fruit resource abundance, both spatially and temporally. These studies, which typically use fruit counts as the variable of fruit abundance, have never documented a response of species richness at the community level. Furthermore, these studies have not taken into account factors influencing the detection of an individual within surveys. 3. Using a combination of nonstandard approaches to fruit-frugivore research, we show a response of bird species richness to fruit resources. First, we use uniform and structurally similar, one-ha shade-grown coffee plots as replicated experimental units to reduce the influence of confounding variables. Secondly, we use multi-season occupancy modelling of a resident omnivorous bird assemblage in order to account for detection probability in our analysis of site occupancy, local immigration and local emigration. Thirdly, we expand our variable of fruit abundance, Fruit Energy Availability (FEA), to include not only fruit counts but also fruit size and fruit quality. 4. We found that a site's average monthly FEA was highly correlated (0√Ü90) with a site's average bird species richness. In our multi-season occupancy model 92% of the weight of evidence supported a single model that included effects of FEA on initial occupancy, immigration, emigration and detection. 5. These results demonstrate that fruit calories can broadly influence the richness of a neotropical bird community, and that fluctuations of FEA explains much of the site occupancy patterns of component species. This study shows that in depauperate, managed landscapes fruit resource abundance supports more species and fruit constancy allows for higher levels of avian persistence, an important practical concept for conservation planning. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

The cyclical nature of migration provides a constant re-evaluation of habitat quality and spatial distribution by migrant birds. Avian monitoring programs can detect changes in migrant abundance. Migrating birds may thus provide a living sensor of environmental change, enabling broad-scale environmental assessments to detect and address habitat degradation early on, allowing local managers to prioritize restoration efforts accordingly.

Natural savannas in South America have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the Colombian Llanos. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine ‚Äòkudzu‚Äô, a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the Llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,0.504176426,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,73,NA

However, there is a remarkable lack of information of these plantations on the value for conservation biodiversity. To evaluate these plantations as habitat for wildlife, I studied bird communities in native secondary forest and in plantation of exotic tree spedes (Pinus oocarpa and Cuprassus Iusitanica) in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, Costa Rica. Bird assemblage composition, richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness were compared between habitats using the fixed-radius point count method. Fieldwork was conducted from September 2008 to May 2009. A total of 743 birds of 79 species corresponding to 10 orders and 25 families were recorded. The bird composition varied across habitats, sharing 51.9% of the same bird species. Although I found no significant differences in the patterns of bird diversity or evenness, the native forest had a greater bird richness and abundance than the plantation. This could be explained by the higher spatial heterogeneity and productivity in the native forest than in the plantation. On the basis of these results, secondary native forests seem to have a greater value for bird conservation than conifer plantations. Therefore, some management measures could favor bird communities in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, such as the implementation of strategies for ecological restoration in order to gradually replace the exotic vegetation by native species which offer more resources available for bird populations. The continuation of studies in plantations of exotic conifers may provide more knowledge that will allow a better understanding of the role played by exotic plantations in maintaining bird populations and biodiversity in general. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",Article,Scopus,0.502342048,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,197,NA

We sought to explain variation in abundance of Neotropical forest birds using a dataset of population densities of 596 species. We tested a priori hypotheses for the roles of species traits, environmental factors, and species interactions. Specifically, we focused on four factors: 1) body mass (trait), 2) habitat type (environmental factor), 3) net primary productivity (NPP; environmental factor) and 4) species richness of competitors (species interaction). Body size explained much variation in density, although only when analyzed at higher taxonomic levels. Habitat type was a strong predictor of density. The relationship between density and productivity was weak. Densities were related negatively to the species richness of heterospecifics. This trend was particularly strong within closely related groups. Our results show that the influence of energetic factors such as body size and productivity depends on phylogeny, and that they act through indirect relations with other variables; alternative ecological factors such as habitat structure and species interactions play a more direct and stronger role in determining abundance than previously thought. ¬© 2018 The Authors",Article in Press,Scopus,0.493221474,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,164,NA

We show that raids of each species, and of both species pooled, reach peak densities at intermediate (premontane) elevations. These patterns suggest that army ant swarm raids are relatively abundant in Neotropical montane forests. Therefore, a paucity of ant raids does not explain the absence of obligate ant-following bird species, particularly true antbirds (Thamnophilidae), from montane forests. As army ant raids are relatively common at middle elevations, opportunities exist for other montane bird taxa to exploit army ant raids as a food source. ¬© International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI) 2010.",Article,Scopus,0.492192699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,39,NA

Besides, they are important predators in these ecosystems. However, studies of factors that determine odonate species richness and distribution in wetlands are scarce in the Neotropical region. The objectives of this study were to: 1) conduct a survey of the diversity of odonate larvae in southern Brazil wetlands, and 2) determine how much variation in odonate richness, abundance and composition is explained by wetland area, altitude, water conductivity and nitrate, hydroperiod, and dominant aquatic vegetation in 140 wetlands in an extensive area of the Neotropical region (‚àº280,000 km2, southern Brazil). A total of 4,039 individuals distributed among five families and 28 genera were collected. Libellulidae, Coenagrionidae and Aeshnidae were the families that showed the greatest richness. Erythrodiplax was observed in more than 70 of the sampled wetlands, and comprised 61 of individuals collected. Richness was negatively associated with wetland area and nitrate concentration. Odonate abundance was negatively associated with water conductivity and nitrate, and it was higher in aquatic beds than in emergent wetlands. Richness and abundance were higher in permanent than in intermittent wetlands. Variation in odonate composition was correlated with wetland altitude, area and water conductivity. Hydroperiod and dominant aquatic vegetation also influenced composition. Our results showed that southern Brazil wetlands are important habitats for 28 odonate genera, and that richness, abundance and composition are influenced mainly by hydroperiod, nitrate, and aquatic vegetation type. These results should be seen as important to determine the environmental factors that shape and maintain odonate diversity in southern Brazil wetlands. ¬© 2010 Kansas Entomological Society.",Review,Scopus,0.488313137,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,45,NA

Analysis of the relative reproductive investment (RRI) of these tropical birds showed significant differences between habitats and among families and feeding guilds. Comparison of these families and feeding guilds to their relatives in temperate regions showed that neotropical birds have a smaller RRI, due to both smaller clutch sizes and lower egg mass, even when there are more broods per season.

Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with >15% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest. Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.476767959,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,146,NA

According to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), 17 of 43 explanatory variables accounted for significant variation in the bird species matrix: stand age, tamarack Larix laricina canopy cover, percentage shrub Alnus glutinosa, canopy closure (6-30%), percentage herbs, maximum canopy height, percentage shrub Alnus viridis, percentage moss, percentage shrub Betula nana, minimum and mean shrub height, percentage litter, white birch Betula papyrifera canopy cover, white spruce Picea glauca canopy cover, mean canopy height, canopy closure (71-100%), and zero shrub canopy closure. Habitat and stand identity (clustering of sites within stands) explained 55.5% of the total variation; 16.3% was unique to habitat alone (29.4% of the total variance explained - TVE) and 17.2% (31.0% TVE) was shared with stand identity. Stand identity accounted for 22.0% (39.6% TVE) of the variation. Neotropical migrants associated with ""overmature"" mixed-wood stands included Cape May Dendroica tigrina, bay-breasted D. castanea and Tennessee Vermivora peregrina warblers. Conversely, orange-crowned V celata, palm D. palmarum, and Nashville V. ruficapilla warblers were found in young stands. The presence of several Neotropical migrants was associated with mixed-wood attributes (ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus with aspen, red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus with shrub alder, and Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus with canopy white birch). Jack pine stands older than commercial rotation age must be maintained in a managed landscape because their bird communities differ from younger stands. Because of the limited avian diversity in pure jack pine stands, sufficient mixed-wood stands must be regenerated to sustain populations of characteristic bird species. We recommend that jack pine mixed-woods be managed using shelterwood or selective cuts, and that rotation age of some stands be increased. Without the extensive fires necessary for regeneration, cutting patterns at the landscape level should approximate natural disturbance patches both in size and frequency of disturbance. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.476398291,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,214,NA

Much of the interest was inspired by untested hypotheses proposing that extensive conversion of traditional coffee plantations, grown under a diverse canopy of shade trees, into modern, technified plantations with severely reduced shade canopy, contributed to concurrent declines of long-distance migratory birds. This possible relationship sparked major publicity campaigns during the late 1990s and continuing today, promoting shaded coffee plantations as quality habitat for migratory birds. Based on a review of the Published scientific literature concerning avian use of coffee plantations, I summarize avian ecology in coffee agroecosystems, and evaluate the hypothesis that coffee plantations are important for the conservation of migratory or resident birds. While no literature has presented strong evidence that coffee plantations in general negatively affect bird populations of conservation importance, nonetheless published studies have not tested hypotheses that birds have greater survivability, fitness or productivity in coffee plantations compared with other available habitats (natural or artificial), or that any species selects coffee plantations over other available habitats for foraging or for breeding. While coffee plantations may have higher avian richness and abundance than other highly disturbed agricultural habitats and some natural habitats, more research is needed to evaluate whether and how certain coffee agroecosystems contribute to the conservation or decline of avian diversity. ¬© BirdLife International 2006.",Review,Scopus,0.47552311,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,130,NA

The asymmetry of bilateral traits may be indicative of the extent to which developmental stability is compromised by the stressful conditions underlying fragmentation. Using an assemblage- and population-level approach, we explored asymmetry differences in tarsus and outermost tail feathers of birds inhabiting fragmented landscapes in the tropical Andes of Colombia. More than 2500 individuals of 185 species were mist-netted at nine forest sites representing continuous forest (> 1000 ha), medium- (70-110 ha), and small-sized (8-20 ha) fragments. Feathers showed true fluctuating asymmetry (FA), whereas tarsus presented a mixture of FA and directional asymmetry. Overall, asymmetry was lowest in continuous forest, and highest in small and medium fragments. These patterns remained unchanged when directionality and differences in species composition, abundance, and foraging tactics were considered. The population-level analyses showed a general trend of increased asymmetry variation in fragments, yet the responses were not always in the same direction. Increased asymmetry may represent an outcome of processes that contribute to the persistence of species in changing environments, and to the generation of phenotypic innovation, which suggests individual adjustments of development to deal with stress. This calls into question the deliberated application of FA as a biomonitoring tool for conservation. ¬© 2007 The Linnean Society of London.",Article,Scopus,0.475124556,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,98,NA

We focused on breeding cowbirds' use of forest because of the risk of nest parasitism to forest-dwelling hosts and to identify factors affecting breeding cowbird habitat selection. We compared distances of cowbird locations in the forest from the forest edge (""edge distances"") to distances of random forest locations in the entire landscape or within individual cowbird home ranges. We analyzed 1322 locations of 84 cowbirds across three landscapes. We found support for the landscape context hypothesis that breeding cowbird preference for forest edge varied with landscape context. Ninety percent of cowbird locations were within 150-350 m of forest edge, despite the overall availability of forest at greater distances from edge (as far as 500-1450 m) both within cowbird home ranges and the entire forested landscape. Cowbird preference for edge varied by landscape context largely due to differences in the availability of forest edge. In a highly fragmented forest cowbirds utilized the entire forest and likely viewed it as ""all edge."" In less fragmented forests, cowbirds preferred edge. We consider how variation in cowbird edge preference might relate to patterns in host abundance, host diversity, and host quality because cowbird movements indicate they are capable of using forest farther from edges. ¬© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus,0.474117469,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,129,NA

The number of woody species in tropical forests tends to increase with precipitation, forest stature, soil fertility, rate of canopy turnover and time since catastrophic disturbance, and decrease with seasonality, latitude, altitude, and diameter at breast height (d.b.h.). 2. A model is presented to account for these trends. Novel hypotheses include how increased rainfall and substrate fertility, and decreased seasonality, might (i) increase attacks by natural enemies, and thus the overall level of density-dependent plant mortality; (ii) increase shade tolerance, canopy turnover, and stem density of the species-rich understorey; and (iii) increase reliance on relatively sedentary forest-interior birds for seed dispersal, fostering high rates of speciation in understorey genera. 3. High rainfall and low seasonality in the tropics favour two key groups of natural plant enemies - insects and fungi - that are directly responsible for promoting high rates of density-dependent plant mortality. Lower rainfall, greater seasonality, soil infertility, or unfavourable rooting conditions favour greater allocation to anti-herbivore defences, and thus lead to lower rates of such mortality and thence to lower tree diversity. The increased number of individuals on rainier sites is a minor contributor to increased tree diversity, accounting for only about 17% of the 8.3-fold increase with rainfall in the lowland Neotropics. 4. Predictions of the model are consistent with many ecological patterns of variation in tropical tree diversity within regions, and may help explain the decrease in tree diversity with elevation and the accompanying decrease in horizontal patchiness (within-habitat Œ≤ diversity). 5. Random drift over evolutionary time in the relative effectiveness of density-dependent control of individual tree species by specialized natural enemies may better account for the observed distribution of tropical tree abundance than a random walk of species abundance through ecological time.",Article,Scopus,0.469906648,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,215,NA

Location: Venezuela. Methods: We placed a grid over Venezuela (0.5 √ó 0.5 degree cells) and applied a stratified sampling design to select a minimum set of 25 cells spanning environmental and biogeographical variation. We implemented standardized field sampling protocols for birds, butterflies and dung beetles, along transects on environmental gradients ('gradsects'). We compared species richness estimates from our field surveys at national, bioregional and cell scales to those calculated from data compiled from museum collections and the literature. We estimated the variance in richness, composition, relative abundance and diversity between gradsects that could be explained by environmental and biogeographical variables. We also estimated total survey effort and cost. Results: In one field season, we covered 8% of the country and recorded 66% of all known Venezuelan dung beetles, 52% of Pierid butterflies and 37% of birds. Environmental variables explained 27-60% of variation in richness for all groups and 13-43% of variation in abundance and diversity in dung beetles and birds. Bioregional and environmental variables explained 43-58% of the variation in the dissimilarity matrix between transects for all groups. Main conclusions: NeoMaps provides reliable estimates of richness, composition and relative abundance, required for rigorous monitoring and spatial prediction.

Assignment models based on stable isotopes historically have been an important tool for studying migratory connectivity of small-bodied species, but the low resolution of these assignments has generated interest into combining isotopes with other sources in information. Abundance is one of the most appealing data sources to include in isotope-based assignments, but there are currently no statistical methods or guidelines for optimizing the contribution of stable isotopes and abundance for inferring migratory connectivity. Using known-origin stable-hydrogen isotope samples of six Neotropical migratory bird species, we rigorously assessed the performance of assignment models that differentially weight the contribution of the isotope and abundance data. For two species with adequate sample sizes, we used Pareto optimality to determine the set of models that simultaneously minimized both assignment error rate and assignment area. We then assessed the ability of the top models from these two species to improve assignments of the remaining four species compared to assignments based on isotopes alone. We show that the increased precision of models that include abundance is often offset by a large increase in assignment error. However, models that optimally weigh the abundance data relative to the isotope data can result in higher precision and, in some cases, lower error than models based on isotopes alone. The top models, however, depended on the distribution of relative breeding abundance, with patchier distributions requiring stronger downweighting of abundance, and we present general guidelines for future studies. These results confirm that breeding abundance can be an important source of information for studies investigating broad-scale movements of migratory birds and potentially other taxa. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

In spring 2004, we conducted weekly bird surveys at 3 pairs (with and without water developments) of washes. In spring 2005, we designed an experiment to test whether migratory birds more frequently used water developments with than without vegetation cover. During spring, in both 2004 and 2005, we documented use of water by directly observing birds at 13 existing water developments. We found little evidence to support that water developments were important water sources for migratory birds. Migratory bird communities in desert washes near wildlife water developments did not differ in species richness, relative abundance, or density when compared with washes without water developments. This observation suggests that the wildlife water developments that we studied were not an attractant to migratory birds at the landscape scale. At a finer scale, migratory birds rarely (0.1% of all observations) used water developments and experimental water sources. However, resident bird species frequently were recorded (>69,000 observations) drinking and bathing at wildlife water developments.

The coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) is the world's primary coffee pest. Researchers have demonstrated that birds reduce insect abundance on coffee farms but have not documented avian control of the berry borer or quantified avian benefits to crop yield or farm income. We conducted a bird-exclosure experiment on coffee farms in the Blue Mountains, Jamaica, to measure avian pest control of berry borers, identify potential predator species, associate predator abundance and borer reductions with vegetation complexity, and quantify resulting increases in coffee yield. Coffee plants excluded from foraging birds had significantly higher borer infestation, more borer broods, and greater berry damage than control plants. We identified 17 potential predator species (73% were wintering Neotropical migrants), and 3 primary species composed 67% of migrant detections. Average relative bird abundance and diversity and relative resident predator abundance increased with greater shade-tree cover. Although migrant predators overall did not respond to vegetation complexity variables, the 3 primary species increased with proximity to noncoffee habitat patches. Lower infestation on control plants was correlated with higher total bird abundance, but not with predator abundance or vegetation complexity. Infestation of fruit was 1-14% lower on control plants, resulting in a greater quantity of saleable fruits that had a market value of US$44-$105/ha in 2005/2006. Landscape heterogeneity in this region may allow mobile predators to provide pest control broadly, despite localized farming intensities. These results provide the first evidence that birds control coffee berry borers and thus increase coffee yield and farm income, a potentially important conservation incentive for producers. ¬© 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.453000256,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,75,NA

Several vegetation attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the influences of urban vegetation-represented by characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree species and tree species richness)-and characteristics of the landscape (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human population size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the streets of the landscape. We used a series of competing GLM models (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5. Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However, the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species richness, preserving large trees and planting more native trees species in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently improve human wellbeing and quality of life. ¬© 2017 Pena et al.

There have been many attempts to determine the ecological traits associated with bird species' vulnerability to disturbance, but no attempt has been made to synthesize these studies to show consensus. We analyzed data from 57 published studies (covering 1214 bird species) that investigated the response of tropical bird assemblages to moderate forest disturbance (e.g., selective logging). Our results show that the mean abundance of species from six commonly reported feeding guilds responded differently to disturbance and that species' ecological traits (body size, local population size, and geographic range size) and evolutionary relationships may influence responses in some guilds. Granivore abundance increased significantly and insectivore and frugivore abundance decreased significantly following disturbance. These general conclusions were robust to the effects of ecological traits and phylogeny. Responses of carnivores, nectarivores, and omnivores were less clear, but analyses that accounted for phylogeny indicated that these guilds declined following disturbance. In contrast to the other guilds, the reported responses of carnivores and nectarivores differed among regions (Asia vs. Neotropics) and were influenced by the sampling protocols used in different studies (e.g., time since disturbance), which may explain the difficulty in detecting general responses to disturbance in these guilds. Overall, general patterns governed the responses of species to habitat disturbance, and the differential responses of guilds suggested that disturbance affects trophic organization and thus ecosystem functioning. ¬© 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.",Article,Scopus,0.415145576,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,62,NA

In turn, human disturbances alter both the original animal assemblage with which plants interact and the outcome of the mutualistic interaction. Negative consequences of human disturbances can be weakened when different seed dispersers exert similar effects on plant populations, being functionally equivalent. To understand the consequences of variability in seed dispersers on the recruitment of a long-lived tree species, I assessed changes in the assemblages of avian dispersers of Podocarpus parlatorei in subtropical Andean cloud-forests, and how these changes affect the outcome of the interaction at different spatial scales. The seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) concept, defined as the likelihood of a seed removed by a fruit-eating bird to be dispersed to a suitable site for seed survival and germination, provides the framework to compare the contributions of different birds to seed dispersal. I compared the SDE in two old-growth forests dominated by P. parlatorei and a human disturbed forest, and in the main habitat types of these sites. In all sites, highest SDE values were provided by ""gulpers"" that swallow the whole fleshy cone (""fruit""), predominantly Elaenia and Turdus species. SDE was highest in forest edges and secondary forests, and negligible in other habitats. Equivalence in SDE was relatively low both within and between forest sites. Human forest disturbance modified the functional equivalence, the generalization in mutualistic interactions and the strength of SDE. Secondary forests showed the higher SDE and the greater richness of dispersers high in SDE; as a consequence, the ecological equivalence increased in the most suitable habitat for recruitment. This could lead to greater resilience of plant populations to local extinctions of dispersers, and allows the recovery of human disturbed forests. This study shows that in the replacement of functional equivalent species, the outcomes of the interactions are strongly affected by disperser abundance and habitat use, at the expense of dispersers' trait redundancy on plant population dynamics and community structure. ¬© 2017 Blendinger.",Article,Scopus,0.406201387,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,216,NA

However, understanding how focal organisms respond to these stressors is crucial for conservation planning for these species. We propose a paradigm that alternates extensive, broadscale data collection by volunteer collaborators to document patterns of response, with intensive fine-scale studies by professional researchers, to elucidate the processes underlying these patterns. We demonstrate this technique, building on our existing work linking patterns of population declines in the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) to synergistic effects of acid rain and habitat fragmentation. To better understand the processes behind these patterns, we use a simple protocol to explore linkages between acid rain, leaching of calcium from the soil, and declines in the abundance of calcium-rich invertebrate prey species, which may be necessary for successful breeding by this thrush. We sampled at 40 study sites across New York that were chosen based on estimated acid deposition and soil properties. Our results show that the calcium content of the soils sampled is proportional to the soil pH, that the abundance of calcium-rich invertebrate prey tracks soil properties, and that the presence of a breeding Wood Thrush was correctly predicted in >70% of study sites by the biomass of calcium-rich prey, and in particular, the biomass of myriapods (Diplopoda). We show that a simple repeatable protocol, suitable for use by volunteers across broad geographic extents and ranges of habitat fragmentation, can help us understand the reactions of some forest birds to acid rain in combination with habitat fragmentation. We detail the development of this protocol for volunteers in the Birds in Forested Landscapes project, and describe future plans.

Here we test the applicability of remote sensing, particularly novel use of waveform lidar measurements, for quantifying the habitat heterogeneity of a contiguous northern hardwoods forest in the northeastern United States. We apply these results to predict the breeding habitat quality, an indicator of reproductive output of a well-studied Neotropical migrant songbird, the Blackthroated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). We found that using canopy vertical structure metrics provided unique information for models of habitat quality and spatial patterns of prevalence. An ensemble decision tree modeling approach (random forests) consistently identified lidar metrics describing the vertical distribution and complexity of canopy elements as important predictors of habitat use over multiple years. Although other aspects of habitat were important, including the seasonality of vegetation cover, the canopy structure variables provided unique and complementary information that systematically improved model predictions. We conclude that canopy structure metrics derived from waveform lidar, which will be available on future satellite missions, can advance multiple aspects of biodiversity research, and additional studies should be extended to other organisms and regions. ¬© 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.392546674,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,106,NA

At the 2013 joint American Ornithologists' Union and Cooper Ornithological Society meeting in Chicago, USA, researchers convened a symposium to address the ecology and conservation of understory insectivores. This Special Issue of Biological Conservation is the result of that symposium: a collection of articles that unites our efforts to further understand and conserve understory insectivores. In this introductory paper, we review the diversity and ecology of understory insectivores, identify threats to the guild, discuss hypotheses on drivers of population declines, and make suggestions for future research. Deforestation and forest degradation are the immediate threats to this guild, with agricultural expansion (particularly oil palm plantations), urbanization, road expansion and logging leading the list. Although vulnerabilities of this guild are most evident in the Neotropics, there are few studies from Asia and fewer still from Africa-we recommend increased geographic coverage. If we are to understand the vulnerabilities of understory insectivores from a pantropical perspective, researchers should prioritize understanding the most serious threats (e.g., edge effects, deforestation, fragmentation, etc.) and standardize efforts to gauge understory insectivores' response to these threats (e.g., via species richness, abundance, demographic metrics). A coordinated approach by researchers working in tropical rainforests across the globe can help us understand the ecology of understory insectivores and meaningfully apply conservation and management actions. ¬© 2015 .",Article,Scopus,0.376559777,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,140,NA

We studied the structure and organization of a local avian haemosporidian assemblage (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in the Cerrado biome of Central Brazil for 5 years. We obtained 790 blood samples from 54 bird species of which 166 (21%) were infected with haemosporidians based on molecular diagnostics. Partial sequences of the parasite cytochrome b gene revealed 18 differentiated avian haemosporidian lineages. We also analysed the relationship of life-history traits (i.e., nesting height, migration status, nest type, sociality, body mass, and embryo development period) of the 14 most abundant bird species with the prevalence of avian haemosporidia. It was found that host species that bred socially presented a higher prevalence of Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) than bird species that bred in pairs. Thus, aspects of host behaviour could be responsible for differential exposure to vectors. The assemblage of avian haemosporidia studied here also confirms a pattern that is emerging in recent studies using molecular markers to identify avian haemosporidians, namely that many lineages are host generalists. ¬© Cambridge University Press 2012.",Article,Scopus,0.368281479,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,229,NA

Even though nectar robbing may have negative, neutral or even positive effects on plant fitness, few studies have investigated temporal and spatial variation in robbing rate and their consequences, particularly in the tropics. In this study, robbing levels were estimated during 3 years in four populations of Salvia gesneriflora, a hummingbird-pollinated shrub endemic to central Mexico that is mainly robbed by birds, carpenter bees and bumblebees. The effect of robbing on nectar availability, flower longevity and on visitation rate by floral visitors was also evaluated. Our results indicate great variation in robbing levels across years and populations and a positive relationship between robbing level and flower abundance per population. Moreover, our results show that nectar availability is about eight times higher in unrobbed flowers than in robbed flowers, and that nectar robbers prefer younger flowers, although lifespan of robbed and unrobbed flowers did not differ statistically. Primary and secondary nectar robbers showed a higher visitation rate compared to legitimate visitors, and neither legitimate nor illegitimate floral visitors seem to discriminate between robbed and unrobbed flowers. These results suggest that robbers may respond to food availability and that no floral visitors apparently could differentiate between robbed and unrobbed flowers. Finally, results show that nectar robbers prefer the youngest flowers, which suggests that strong competition for access to nectar between pollinators and robbers might occur, mainly at the first stages of the flowers. ¬© 2016 German Botanical Society and Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Article,Scopus,0.365963756,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,111,NA

Here we present the first test of whether MC1R variation is associated with differences in parasite abundance in a natural population. Bananaquits (Coereba flaveola) (Linnaeus, 1758) living on Grenada in the Caribbean exhibit a melanic plumage dimorphism as a result of a mutation in MC1R. The proportion of black individuals increases clinally towards the central, wetter parts of the island. We captured bananaquits through the cline and quantified parasite abundances. Avian malaria, feather mites, and mallophaga lice varied significantly in abundance across the cline; however, neither these infections, nor coccidia, nor arboviruses showed overall differences between the morphs. Feather mites tended to be more abundant on black individuals, in areas where the black morph was more common. This may result from differences in microhabitat use by the two morphs. These patterns do not support the idea that MC1R variation in itself results in differing susceptibility to parasites. ¬© 2013 The Linnean Society of London.",Article,Scopus,0.361535551,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,168,NA

The group can be divided into hermits and non-hermits, in which hermits are often regarded as the most specialized group closely associated with more specialized ornithophilous plants. In this study, we investigated the association of ornithophilous flowers and hummingbirds in two small fragments of forest surrounded by an urban matrix. We characterized the species composition, abundance and phenology of the hummingbirds and ornithophilous plants and related pollinator abundance to floral resource availability. Our results were compared to published data from other forest areas from the Cerrado. In our study areas, the diversity of ornithophilous plants and hummingbirds was similar to what has been reported for forest fragments in the Cerrado. Nevertheless, we found Thalurania furcata, a non-hermit, acting as the most frequent hummingbird pollinator in contrast to more preserved areas in which a hermit, Phaethornis pretrei, is commonly found as the main pollinator for ornithophilous plants. The nectar energy availability at the plant population level was the only factor associated with hummingbird visitation rates, suggesting that a higher availability of nectar resources in the fragments attracts greater abundance of birds. The unusual setting of having a non-hermit species as the main hummingbird pollinator in forest areas suggests that habitat fragmentation can favor more generalist hummingbird species, and this potentially has consequence for the pollination of associated plants. ¬© 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Article,Scopus,0.355786543,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,186,NA

Fragmented landscapes reduce animal abundance and movement, limiting seed dispersal between distant forest remnants. In 2006, experimental plantings were established in pasture to determine whether plantings enhance seed dispersal and, ultimately, seedling recruitment. We examined patterns of naturally recruited seedlings of Ocotea uxpanapana, a large-seeded bird-dispersed tree endemic to southern Mexico that occurs in the surrounding landscape. We used GIS and least-cost path analysis to ask: (1) Do restoration efforts alter recruitment patterns? (2) What is the importance of canopy cover and likely dispersal pathways to establishment? Patterns of seedling establishment indicated that dispersal agents crossed open pastures to wooded plots. Recruitment was greatest under woody canopies. Also, by reducing movement cost or risk for seed dispersers, wooded canopies increased influx of large, animal-dispersed seeds, thereby restoring a degree of functional connectivity to the landscape. Together, canopy openness and path distance from potential parent trees in the surrounding landscape explained 73% of the variance in O. uxpanapana seedling distribution. Preliminary results suggest that strategic fenced plantings in pastures increase dispersal and establishment of large-seeded trees, thereby accelerating forest succession in restorations and contributing to greater connectivity among forest fragments. ¬© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",Article,Scopus,0.351285196,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,102,NA

Neotropical migrant birds show a clear preference for stopover habitats with ample food supplies; yet, the proximate cues underlying these decisions remain unclear. 2. For insectivorous migrants, cues associated with vegetative phenology (e.g. flowering, leaf flush, and leaf loss) may reliably predict the availability of herbivorous arthropods. Here we examined whether migrants use the phenology of five tree species to choose stopover locations, and whether phenology accurately predicts food availability. 3. Using a combination of experimental and observational evidence, we show migrant populations closely track tree phenology, particularly the flowering phenology of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and preferentially forage in trees with more flowers. Furthermore, the flowering phenology of honey mesquite reliably predicts overall arthropod abundance as well as the arthropods preferred by migrants for food. 4. Together, these results suggest that honey mesquite flowering phenology is an important cue used by migrants to assess food availability quickly and reliably, while in transit during spring migration. ¬© 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,0.351107633,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,59,NA

Despite recent investigations into the distribution and richness of these parasites and their vertebrate hosts, little is known about their dipteran vectors. The Neotropics has the highest diversity of mosquitoes in the world, but few studies have tried to identify vectors in this area, hampering the understanding of the ecology of avian malaria in the highly diverse Neotropical environments. Methods: Shannon traps and active collection were used to capture 27,110 mosquitoes in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in southeastern Brazil, a highly endangered ecosystem. Results: We screened 17,619 mosquito abdomens from 12 different species and several unidentified specimens of Culex, grouped into 1,913 pools, for the presence of haemosporidians. Two pools (out of 459) of the mosquito Mansonia titillans and one pool (out of 29) of Mansonia pseudotitillans were positive for Plasmodium parasites, with the detection of a new parasite lineage in the former species. Detected Plasmodium lineages were distributed in three different clades within the phylogenetic tree revealing that Mansonia mosquitoes are potential vectors of genetically distant parasites. Two pools of Culex spp. (out of 43) were positive for Plasmodium gallinaceum and closely related lineages. We found a higher abundance of these putative vectors in pasture areas, but they were also distributed in areas at intermediate and late successional stages. One pool of the mosquito Psorophora discrucians (out of 173) was positive for Haemoproteus. Conclusions: The occurrence of different Plasmodium lineages in Mansonia mosquitoes indicates that this genus encompasses potential vectors of avian malaria parasites in Brazil, even though we did not find positive thoraces among the samples tested. Additional evidence is required to assign the role of Mansonia mosquitoes in avian malaria transmission and further studies will add information about evolutionary and ecological aspects of avian haemosporidia and untangle the diversity of their vectors in Brazil. ¬© 2016 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,0.341338213,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,213,NA

Our hypotheses are that (1) sparrows always prefer grass over forb seeds and (2) different species of sparrows show the same preferences when consuming seeds. We presented seeds from eight species of plants (four grasses and four forbs) in both choice and nonchoice experiments. In general, sparrow species preferred grass over forb seeds, though one of them (Rufous-collared Sparrow [Zonotrichia capensis]) included one forb species (Parthenium hysterophorus) among its preferred seed items. Among grass seeds, sparrows avoided or showed less preference for the tiny seeds of Sporobolus cryptandrus, which suggests that seed weight may affect seed choice among grasses. Avoidance of most forb species, by contrast, could not be associated with seed size, probably because of the presence of unpalatable or toxic compounds in forb seeds. Experimental evidence suggests that the main feeding pressure of sparrows is clearly directed to grass seeds, which coincides with reported information on bird diet.

We examined how tropical deforestation affects hummingbird community structure in premontane forest patches embedded in a tropical countryside of Coto Brus Canton, Costa Rica. We captured hummingbirds in fourteen landscapes representing a gradient in patch size and forest amount, and tested for the effects of these variables on (1) hummingbird captures at flowers (pollinator availability); (2) species richness; and (3) filtering of functional traits. After accounting for sampling effects, both hummingbird availability and species richness declined by 40% and 50%, respectively, across the gradient in deforestation that we observed (9‚Äì66% forest within 1000¬†m). Focal patch size was the strongest predictor, even after statistically accounting for the amount of forest and matrix composition of landscapes. These reductions in availability and richness were well predicted by functional traits; morphologically specialized species with the capacity to transport long-distance outcrossed pollen and low functional redundancy within the pollinator network showed the greatest sensitivity to landscape change. We hypothesize that declines in hummingbird availability, diversity, and functional traits are important mechanisms driving the observed pollen limitation of ornithophilous flowers in fragmented tropical landscapes. Efforts to conserve large forest patches and enhance matrix permeability are critical for maintaining forest hummingbird communities and pollination services under current and predicted deforestation regimes. ¬© 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation",Article,Scopus,0.334280659,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,235,NA

In this paper the concept of keystone plant resources is reviewed using potential candidates proposed in the literature for neotropical forest sites. A poorly known example of a potential keystone resource - the gums produced by mature pods of two emergent tree species (Parkia nitida and P. pendula, Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) - is described for primates and other arboreal vertebrates in Amazonian forests. In particular, the fruiting phenology, tree density, patterns of vertebrate consumption, and nutritional quality of Parkia gums in Amazonian terra firme forests are considered. Putative neotropical keystone resources are then divided into four intersecting ecological attributes defining their community-wide importance to vertebrate frugivores: (1) temporal redundancy, (2) degree of consumer specificity, (3) reliability, and (4) abundance. From a vertebrate perspective, keystone plants are here defined as those producing reliable, low-redundancy resources that are consumed by a large proportion of the bird and mammal assemblage with which they coexist. Plant populations proposed to date as keystone species range widely across two of these four variables, which may disqualify most putative taxa (including Parkia spp.) from a more formal definition of keystone resources. Other importance attributes, the context-dependent role, the taxonomic refinement, and removal effects of the keystone plant resource concept as applied to tropical forests are also discussed.",Article,Scopus,0.318223547,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,242,NA

Although plant species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology are rare, they provide predictable food resources and therefore may play a pivotal role in animal community structure and diversity. I experimentally planted a supplemental patch of a shrub species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology, Hamelia patens Jacq., into coffee agroforests to evaluate the contribution of this unique phenology to the structure and diversity of the flower-visiting community. After accounting for the higher abundance of captured animals in the coffee agroforests with the supplemental floral resources, species richness was 21% higher overall in the flower-visiting community in these agroforests compared to control agroforests. Coffee agroforests with the steady-state supplemental floral patch also had 31% more butterfly species, 29% more hummingbird species, 65% more wasps and 85% more bees than control coffee agroforests. The experimental treatment, together with elevation, explained 57% of the variation in community structure of the flower-visiting community. The identification of plant species that can support a high number of animal species, including important ecosystem service providers, is becoming increasingly important for restoration and conservation applications. Throughout the Neotropics plant species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology can be found in all aseasonal forests and thus could be widely tested and suitable species used throughout the tropics to manage for biodiversity and potentially ecosystem services involving beneficial arthropods. ¬© 2014 Valerie E.

But conservation of those iconic plants is important since they are key stone species to understand evolution and diversification in those ecosystems. We investigated the distribution, host plants and floral biology of a root holoparasite Langsdorffia hypogaea Mart. (Balanophoraceae) in the Brazilian Savanna of southern Brazil. Langsdorffia hypogaea showed an aggregated distribution in patches, and similar sex ratio and abundance between populations. The nectar was secreted by extra-floral structures at the basal bracts of females and among freshly open flowers on male inflorescences. Nectar was relatively dilute (11‚Äì18%), and concentration and volume did not differ between male and female flowers. We found five plant species of different families as hosts, confirming that L. hypogaea is a generalist and suggesting interactions with the local plant community based on abundance and/or host quality. Besides a non-quantified number of insect species, we recorded for the first time a bird species visiting and possibly pollinating the inflorescences. Despite the limited observations, the information provided here opens interesting lines of investigation on the reproductive biology of this species. ¬© 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Article,Scopus,0.31236255,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,83,NA

Shifts in animal community composition, such as those driven by the clearing of native vegetation, are therefore likely to drive changes in plant recruitment. We used manipulative experiments excluding ants, small rodents, and birds to quantify the relative impacts of these granivores on animal-dispersed pioneer trees (ADPT) in fragments of savanna vegetation and adjacent soy plantations in Brazil‚Äôs Cerrado. We found that ants were the main consumers of ADPT seeds, that the rates of seed removal varied with seed size, and that removal rates were higher in savanna fragments than in soy plantations. However, we also found significant interactions between habitat type, seed species, and the type of seed predator being excluded. Our results underscore how challenging it can be to predict the influence of human disturbances on the interactions between plant and animal communities. Because ants, rodents, and birds are Cerrado‚Äôs the main seed dispersers and granivores, seedling recruitment in Cerrado landscape mosaics will depend on how these distinct but related processes are each influenced by species-specific patterns of seed size and seed abundance. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus,0.28446473,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,94,NA

We used a comparative approach to examine the influence of host ecology and morphology on the diversity of chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) among 52 species of Peruvian birds. For each host species we calculated two components of parasite diversity: 1) cumulative species richness, and 2) mean abundance. We tested for correlations between these parasite indices and 13 host ecological and morphological variables. Host ecological variables included geographic range size, local population density, and microhabitat use. Host morphological variables included body mass, plumage depth, and standard dimensions of bill, foot and toenail morphology, all of which could influence the efficiency of anti-parasite grooming. Data were analysed using statistical and comparative methods that control for sampling effort and host phylogeny. None of the independent host variables correlated with louse species richness when treated as a dependent variable. When richness was treated as an independent variable, however, it was positively correlated with mean louse abundance. Host body mass was also positively correlated with mean louse abundance. When louse richness and host body mass were held constant, mean louse abundance correlated negatively with the degree to which the upper mandible of the host's bill overhangs the lower mandible. This correlation suggests that birds with longer overhangs are better at controlling lice during preening. We propose a specific functional hypothesis in which preening damages lice by exerting a shearing force between the overhang and the tip of the lower mandible. This study is the first to suggest a parasite-control function of such a detailed component of bill morphology across species. Avian biologists have traditionally focused almost exclusively on bills as tools for feeding. We suggest that the adaptive radiation of bill morphology should be reinterpreted with both preening and feeding in mind.",Article,Scopus,0.256428385,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,63,NA

We investigate how the waterbird community in a Neotropical river-floodplain system responds to environmental gradients, identifying how they affect waterbird species richness, functional diversity (measured as functional dispersion) and functional composition (specific functional traits). We sampled 22 lakes in the Upper Paran√° floodplain system in southern Brazil, and modelled avian functional diversity and species richness as a function of environmental variables. Then we used a unified RLQ and fourthcorner analysis to evaluate environment-trait relationships. Waterbird species richness and functional diversity varied according to different environmental variables. Lake area and diversity of aquatic vegetation were associated with avian species richness, while relative abundance of grass and emergent macrophytes and mean and variation of depth were related to functional diversity. Furthermore, changes in functional diversity seemed to be mainly driven by presence of species that depend on perches for foraging (e.g. kingfishers, cormorants, and kites), whose presence was mainly associated with deep water and emergent macrophytes. Nevertheless, changes in functional diversity and functional composition did not depend on exactly the same set of environmental variables, suggesting that trait combinations (e.g. below surface feeders who feed on fish), not only specific traits, are important drivers of the variation in functional diversity between lakes. Given the observed differences in responses of species richness and functional diversity, both these diversity metrics should be used as complementary tools in ecosystem management. Furthermore, our results show that functional diversity and composition are partially coupled, suggesting that although functional diversity is influenced by the environmental filtering of particular traits, it also reflects other ecological mechanisms (e.g. competitive interactions among species). ¬© 2018 Arruda Almeida et al.
