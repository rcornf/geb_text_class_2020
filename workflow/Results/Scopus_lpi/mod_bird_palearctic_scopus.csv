The two sites, on the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts, differ importantly in annual rainfall, tide amplitude, and seasonal invertebrate abundance. Most migrant species varied temporally in abundance with the opposite pattern at each site, suggesting mid-winter movements correlated with abundance of food resources. Because of their wide geographic distribution and their particular response to hydrographic factors, mangroves are likely to have a temporally complementary role in sustaining migrant populations throughout the Neptropics. However, variations in migrant numbers reported in other Neotropical habitats could also reflect large-scale movements by migrants.

A mid-monthly counting scheme runs from October to March (all species, both geese and swans), additional counts being organised for Greylag Geese in Semptember and Brent Geese in May (Tab. 1). Prior to 1993, only geese were taken into account whereas census work was mainly undertaken during periods of peak-occurrence of the various species. Seven goose and three swan species occur as regular visitors to The Netherlands. Most abundant species are White-fronted, Greylag, Barnacle and Brent Geese. In all species numbers recorded are of international importance (Tab. 13). Occurrence of Bewick's Swan and Pink-footed, White-fronted, Greylag, Barnacle and Brent Geese highlight the important position of the Netherlands in the West-Palearctic network of flyways. The entire Svalbard population of Pinkfooted Goose stages in the Netherlands in autumn (November). Since the 1960s most species have shown a marked increase (Fig. 2). This trend conforms with overal West-Palearctic trends, often attributed to better protection measures (lower hunting pressure), improvement of feeding habitats in winter and/or changes in flyways. Results of Dutch counts suggest that in most species population growth has levelled off during the 1990s. Fluctuations in numbers over the past decades may be due to severe winter conditions, resulting in an influx of species which regularly winter in the Baltic or eastern Europe (e.g. Whooper Swan, Tundra and Taiga Bean Goose), or in an efflux of birds wintering in The Netherlands to the British Isles and Belgium and northern France (e.g. Bewick's Swan, White-fronted Goose). Since there were no severe winters during 1990/91-1994/95 (Fig. 1), goose and swan numbers as well as seasonal patterns and distribution throughout the country refect the situation in mild winters. The series of mild winters from 1986/87 onwards, eventually may have contributed to increasing numbers of wintering Bewick's Swans and Greylag Geese, whereas numbers of Whooper Swan and Taiga and Tundra Bean Geese have dropped to a lower level as compared to the 1980s.","Article","Scopus",0.740698458554578,NA,"1",NA,NA,15,51,NA

In the spring and summer of 1992, however, the aerosol cloud resulting from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo (Philippines) had reached the high northern latitudes and caused significant cooling in most of the Arctic, with widespread negative consequences for Arctic-breeding birds. At the same time, low abundance of small rodents and high abundance of predators presented additional problems for breeding birds in parts of the Palearctic. We compiled data on breeding biology of Arctic waterfowl and waders from more than 30 field studies to illuminate in what ways the circumpolar bad weather and predation influenced the breeding season of Arctic birds in 1992. Most projects reported a higher proportion of nonbreeders and a delayed onset of nest initiation compared to other years. Hatching and fledging success of the low number of late breeders was reduced. In addition, some projects reported lower clutch sizes and increased adult mortality. Detailed data from field studies are complemented by data on overall reproductive success of waterfowl and wader populations collected from staging and wintering grounds. In total, there was an almost complete reproductive failure for waders and waterfowl throughout the Arctic in 1992, suggesting a short-term effect on global waterbird populations. This is an example of climatic fluctuations influencing reproductive biology of a group of species on a circumpolar scale.","Article","Scopus",0.803868275833811,NA,"?","Compiles breeding biology studies, may contain abundance trends but unclear.",NA,10,39,NA

The species most frequently caught were Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, Melodious Warbler Hippolais polyglotta and Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. Phenology data showed that the three species were more frequently mist netted early and late in the winter which was presumed to coincide with times of migration through the area. However, care must be taken when interpreting the data because Pied Flycatchers were abundant in other habitats in times when none was mist netted and therefore the data do not reflect relative abundance in the area. In Willow Warbler and Melodious Warbler, the data indicate possible itinerant behaviour. All three species show highest median body mass and scores toward the end of the winter but this is not significant in Pied Flycatcher, possibly due to the low capture rate. Although there are individual birds with high mass and fat scores, there is no indication that the area serves as an important stopover area for premigratory fattening as some sites in the Sahel region.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.661934879912029,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29,NA

Concerns over its conservation status prompted an intensive research programme to gather information on its breeding ecology, identify the causes of the recent decline and make recommendations to aid its recovery and conservation. Turtle Doves require tall, overgrown bushes for nesting and short weed-rich areas for feeding, but agricultural intensification has markedly reduced the availability and suitability of these habitats. Over the last 40 years, Turtle Doves have switched from foraging in 'natural habitats' to those created by humans, and their diet is now primarily seeds from cultivated plants. The number of chicks fledged per pair per year is today almost half that in the 1960s, while autumn migration has become significantly earlier.

Large vultures suffered a dramatic decline (98%) outside protected areas. The Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus population also collapsed in some regions, but survived in central Burkina Faso. Conversely, their abundance index did not decrease significantly in national parks. Four eagle species decreased by 86-93% and seven were not even recorded in the later study outside protected areas; by contrast, in national parks, only three species had declined marginally. Smaller Accipitridae (kites, goshawks, buzzards) also exhibited significant declines outside but not within national parks where woodland species reached their highest densities.

Similar trends had previously been documented in Cameroon. They are associated with human population growth and development, global habitat degradation and ecosystem impoverishment (woodcutting, agricultural intensification, overgrazing, desertification). Heavy use of pesticides, control of locust outbreaks and overhunting have suppressed major food sources. Vultures may suffer from a shortage of carcasses, poisoning for predator control or persecution for trade of meat and body parts.

Changes in climatic conditions have already influenced the demography, phenology and distribution of a wide range of plant and animal taxa. This review focuses on the impacts, both observed and potential, of climate change on birds breeding in temperate woodlands of the Western Palaearctic, a significant proportion of which are currently declining. Changes in ambient temperatures and patterns of precipitation may have direct and indirect effects on the survival rates and productivity of bird species, thus influencing population sizes. For some species or populations, the timing of events such as egg-laying and return from the wintering grounds is also changing in relation to shifts in the peak of food availability during the breeding season. The degree to which different individuals are able to track these temporal changes will have a significant bearing on population sizes and distributions in the future. Unless active management steps are taken, the relatively low dispersal rates of tree species may lead to a decrease in the total area of some woodland habitat types as losses at the southern edge of the range are likely to occur much more quickly than expansion at the northern edge. In addition, the dispersal rates of many woodland birds are themselves low, which could affect their ability to move to new habitat patches if currently occupied areas become unsuitable. Thus, woodland birds may be particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","Conference Paper","Scopus",0.712234162784413,"1","1","??

The purpose of this study was to assess the geographic pattern in the abundance, species richness, and importance of different migration patterns of the boreal forest avifauna of Eurasia from Europe to East Asia as well as their relationship to climate and forest productivity. We further examine data from two widely separated sites in the New World to see how these conform to the patterns found in the Eurasian system. Location: Boreal forest sites in Russia and Canada. Methods: Point counts were conducted in two to four boreal forest habitats at each of 14 sites in the Russian boreal forest from near to the Finnish border to the Far East, as well as at two sites in boreal Canada. We examined the abundance and species richness of all birds, and specific migratory classes, against four gradients (climate, primary productivity, latitude, and longitude). We tested for spatial autocorrelation in both dependent and independent variables using Moran's I to develop spatial correlograms. For each migratory class we used maximum likelihood to fit models, first assuming uncorrelated residuals and then assuming spatially autocorrelated residuals. For models assuming unstructured residuals we again generated correlograms on model residuals to determine whether model fitting removed spatial autocorrelation. Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion, adjusted for small sample size. Results: Overall abundance was highest at the eastern and western extremes of the survey region and lowest at the continent centre, whereas the abundance of tropical and short-distance migrants displayed an east-west gradient, with tropical migrants increasing in abundance in the east (and south), and short-distance migrants in the west. Although overall species richness showed no geographic pattern, richness within migratory classes showed patterns weaker than, but similar to, their abundance patterns described above. Overall abundance was correlated with climate variables that relate to continentality. The abundances of birds within different migration strategies were correlated with a second climatic gradient - increasing precipitation from west to east. Models using descriptors of location generally had greater explanatory value for the abundance and species-richness response variables than did those based on climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Main conclusions: The distribution patterns for migrant types were related to both climatic and locational variables, and thus the patterns could be explained by either climatic regime or the accessibility of winter habitats, both historically and currently. Non-boreal wintering habitat is more accessible from both the western and eastern ends than from the centre of the boreal forest belt, but the tropics are most accessible from the eastern end of the Palaearctic boreal zone, in terms of distance and the absence of geographical barriers. Based on comparisons with Canadian sites, we recommend that future comparative studies between Palaearctic and Nearctic faunas be focused more on Siberia and the Russian Far East, as well as on central and western Canada.","Article","Scopus",0.598347449209879,"0",NA,NA,10,NA,15,NA

Most of breeding birds of Ladakh are Palearctic or breed at high elevations in the mountains. There is a small proportion of Oriental species, and no bird is endemic to this region. We found that heavier birds tended to start their egg-laying earlier than lighter ones. Since body mass is related to the length of incubation and nesting periods, it would appear that one result of this phenomenon is that the time of peak demand for food for most birds coincides with peak food abundance in summer. Status affected the elevation of the breeding range, with resident birds tending to breed at higher elevations than summer visitors.

The processes underlying such colonization events are poorly understood. Using the blackbird Turdus merula, a former forest specialist that is now one of the most common urban birds in its range, we provide the first assessment of two contrasting urban colonization models. First, that urbanization occurred independently. Second, that following initial urbanization, urban-adapted individuals colonized other urban areas in a leapfrog manner. Previous analyses of spatial patterns in the timing of blackbird urbanization, and experimental introductions of urban and rural blackbirds to uncolonized cities, suggest that the leapfrog model is likely to apply. We found that, across the western Palaearctic, urban blackbird populations contain less genetic diversity than rural ones, urban populations are more strongly differentiated from each other than from rural populations and assignment tests support a rural source population for most urban individuals. In combination, these results provide much stronger support for the independent urbanization model than the leapfrog one. If the former model predominates, colonization of multiple urban centres will be particularly difficult when urbanization requires genetic adaptations, having implications for urban species diversity. ¬© 2009 The Royal Society.","Article","Scopus",0.390099992033152,"0",NA,NA,10,NA,12,NA

At present, the annual western Palearctic duck bag is at least 17 million birds. From a sustainable management perspective, wetland users and managers request predictions of spatial distribution and abundance variations of these bird populations. The objective of this study was to analyze local factors potentially influencing the diurnal distribution and population size of wintering ducks and coots, the main game species, in Camargue (southern France). First, we showed that marshland surface area, salinity and hunting disturbance were the principal variables explaining the duck and coot distribution. Secondly, we tested the hypothesis that hunting disturbance would reduce the carrying capacity of the Camargue with two analyses: the effect of creating a protected area and the change of the hunting closing date. This hypothesis was not validated. Our study therefore led us to reconsider the research orientations on the carrying capacity in this wetland. The surface of protected day roosts seems presently sufficient in the Rhone delta. Consequently, to increase the population size with the same level of hunting disturbance at the scale of the Camargue, alternative strategies should be envisaged, such as the creation of nature reserves on nocturnal feeding ground or the creation of large management units with limited disturbance. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Scopus",0.668614755809502,"0",NA,NA,15,NA,21,NA

Using GIS and Distance Sampling methodologies, the population on Fuerteventura in 2008 was estimated at 1, 035 birds (832-1, 287) with the species more abundant on hillsides than in gullies.

This spatial diversity in community structure was also found to be temporally consistent over this 8-year period. The abundance of the most numerically dominant bird species, such as red-necked stint Calidris ruficollis and grey teal Anas gracilis, explained much of this spatial variation.

Aims: To compare population densities of Willow Warblers and eremomelas in adjacent acacia, mopane and miombo woodlands, and assess the abundance of potential invertebrate prey in each habitat type, in order to investigate whether Palearctic migrants use more open habitats and are more flexible in habitat use than their Afrotropical counterparts in the same feeding guild. Methods: Using distance sampling we carried out four replicated sets of point counts in acacia woodland and three sets of counts in miombo and mopane between December 1999 and February 2000. We noted the tree species in which we saw warblers foraging and took beating-tray samples of potential arthropod prey present on tree foliage in each of the three habitats. Results: Willow Warbler density in acacia woodland increased from 1.80 ¬± 0.54 (se) birds/ha in early December to 7.15 ¬± 1.41 birds/ha in late January after influxes of later arrivals. Densities of Willow Warblers in miombo and mopane were much lower (1.14 ¬± 0.28 and 0.38 ¬± 0.23 birds/ha, respectively) and did not show significant changes.

Densities in mopane were too low to estimate reliably. Willow Warblers and Green-capped Eremomelas showed some apparent preferences in tree species used for foraging but differences in tree use were not obviously related to the abundance of arthropod taxa present as potential prey.

Aims To determine how change in tree density affects African and Palearctic migrant bird density in already degraded Sahelian woodland. Methods We compared differences in the number of bird species and their abundance with differences in the size and number of woody plants between two seasons separated by five years at 16 degraded woodland sites across 250 km east-west in northern Nigeria. Results Densities of large trees (>5 m) decreased, but densities of smaller trees and shrubs increased, partly as a consequence of growth and because larger trees have been preferentially removed or partly cut down; tree densities were, however, initially low. Of 37 common bird species, 16% had higher densities and 22% had lower densities, in the second study period. The density of Common Whitethroats, Northern Wheatears and Yellow Wagtails was correlated with the number and size of trees, but not that of Lesser Whitethroat and Subalpine Warbler. Overall there was relatively little turnover in species between the two surveys and if (the initially low) tree density was halved, only approximately 2.1% of the average total for number of bird species per 0.2 ha point would be lost. Conclusion Few large changes in bird species' density were found, possibly because: (1) all habitats sampled were already at relatively low tree density - initial reductions from high tree density or near removal of all trees may cause larger changes in local bird densities; (2) reduction in the number of large trees was partially compensated by a more lush development of the vegetation as a whole in the second study period; and (3) the bird species remaining in degraded Sahelian woodland in northern Nigeria are already well adapted to habitat change and low tree density. ¬© 2010 British Trust for Ornithology.","Article","Scopus",0.770485977549933,NA,"1",NA,NA,10,30,NA

Evolutionary adaptation to heterogeneously distributed resources may arise from local adaptation with individuals of such locally adapted populations rarely dispersing long distances and hence having small populations and small overall ranges. We quantified mean population density and spatial heterogeneity in population density of 197 bird species across 12 similarly sized regions in the Western Palearctic. Variance in population density among regions differed significantly from a Poisson distribution, suggesting that random processes cannot explain the observed patterns. National estimates of means and variances in population density were positively correlated with continental estimates, suggesting that means and variances were maintained across spatial scales. We used Morisita's index of population abundance as an estimate of heterogeneity in distribution among regions to test a number of predictions. Heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species as reflected, by Morisita's index had small populations, low population densities, and small breeding ranges. Their breeding populations had been consistently maintained at low levels for considerable periods of time, because the degree of genetic variation in a subsample of non-passerines and passerines was significantly negatively related to heterogeneity in distribution. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species were not more often habitat specialists than homogeneously distributed species. Furthermore, heterogeneously distributed passerine species had high annual adult survival rates but did not differ in annual fecundity from homogeneously distributed species. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species rarely colonized urban habitats. Finally, homogeneously distributed bird species were hosts to a greater diversity of blood parasite species than heterogeneously distributed species. In conclusion, small breeding ranges, population sizes, and population densities of heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species, combined with their low degree of genetic variability, and their inability to colonize urban areas may render such species particularly susceptible to human-influenced global climatic changes. ¬© 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Article","Scopus",0.700926082866016,"0","0",NA,5,15,6,NA

In recent decades traditional pastoral practices have declined, and this may be affecting biodiversity. We investigated the effects of prescribed fires and bomas on savanna bird communities in East Africa during the first and second dry seasons of the year (respectively before and after the rains that mark the onset of breeding for most birds). We compared abundance, richness, and community composition on 9-ha burned plots, recently abandoned bomas, and control plots in the undisturbed matrix habitat over a 3-year period. Generally, recently burned areas and abandoned bomas attracted greater densities of birds and had different community assemblages than the surrounding matrix. The effects of disturbances were influenced by interactions between primary productivity, represented by the normalized difference vegetation index, and time. Bird densities were highest and a greater proportion of species was observed on burned plots in the months following the fires. Drought conditions equalized bird densities across treatments within 1 year, and individuals from a greater proportion of species were more commonly observed on abandoned bomas. Yearly fluctuations in abundance were less pronounced on bomas than on burns, which indicate that although fire may benefit birds in the short term, bomas may have a more-lasting positive effect and provide resources during droughts. Several Palearctic migrants were attracted to burned plots regardless of rainfall, which indicates continued fire suppression may threaten their already-declining populations. Most notably, the paucity of birds observed on the controls suggests that the current structure of the matrix developed as a result of fire suppression. Traditional pastoralism appears critical to the maintenance of avian diversity in these savannas. ¬© 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Article","Scopus",0.612390118961893,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25,NA

In the west of France, breeding populations declined by 96% from 1978 to 2008 in cultivated areas where grasslands have been converted into intensively managed annual crops. Little Bustard abundance and nest productivity have been monitored since 1995 in a 450-km2 site in western France. We assessed the proximate causes of the decline of Little Bustards in French farming landscapes and quantified the effectiveness of conservation measures that aimed to reverse the decline. The decline of Little Bustard, from about 65 males in 1995 to just six males in 2003, could be related to a near absence of recruitment over this period. Since 2004, the establishment of more than 1300 ha of specifically targeted agri-environment schemes (AES) in the study site has led to a sharp increase in female productivity, mainly associated with nesting in AES fields. By imposing constraints on mowing dates, AES have prevented nest destruction and female mortality during mowing and, by increasing plant species diversity, provided chicks with a higher abundance of grasshoppers. This has contributed to reversing the trend, and increasing the population to around 30 males in 2009. Conservation strategies involving specifically targeted AES based on the identification of limiting factors can help to reverse the decline of threatened species. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

Here, diversity/dominance diagrams have been used to relate the structural differences in two phenology-based assemblages (i.e. sedentary species and long distance migrants) obtained by an occurrence data set throughout a local breeding bird atlas in an Apennine nature reserve of Central Italy. Among the 58 breeding bird species sampled, 28 % were long distance migrants. On the average, long distance migrants were spatially rarer when compared to sedentary species. In diversity/dominance diagrams, sedentary species show a trend similar to that obtained by the entire community (broken-stick pattern), while long distance migrants have a curve with slope tending to fit geometrically. Geometric species models show steep plots and are typical of assemblages with high relative dominance, low evenness and few species (in our case, the long distance migrants). Moving from geometric series towards a broken-stick model, the assemblages tend to be even more species rich (in our case, the sedentary species). In a Palearctic bird community, long distance migrants are generally rarer in abundance and spatial distribution when compared to sedentary species. A different phenology may imply differences in species evolution, history and ecology with consequences for abundance, distribution and rarity patterns. In our study area, patterns of spatial occurrences evidenced by diversity/dominance curves may be due to the influence of long-term history, short-term competition and local disturbances that differentiated the two phenologic sub-assemblages.","Article","Scopus",0.491379688363043,"0",NA,NA,10,NA,13,NA

The Inner Niger Delta (IND) in Mali is a major African wetland where >1 million Palearctic and African waterbirds congregate. Waterbirds are the main reservoir of Avian Influenza Viruses (AIV). Our objective was to model their spatial distribution in order to predict where these viruses would be more likely to circulate. We developed a generalized linear model (GLM) and a boosted regression trees (BRT) model based on total aerial bird counts taken in winter over 6 years. We used remotely sensed environmental variables with a high temporal resolution (10 days) to predict the spatial distribution of four waterbird groups. The predicted waterbird abundances were weighted with an epidemiological indicator based on the prevalence of low pathogenic AIV reported in the literature. The BRT model had the best predictive power and allowed prediction of the high variability of waterbird distribution. Years with low flood levels showed areas with a higher risk of circulation and had better spatial distribution predictions. Each year, the model identified a few areas with a higher risk of AIV circulation. This model can be applied every 10 days to evaluate the risk of AIV emergence in wild waterbirds. By taking into account the IND's ecological variability, it allows better targeting of areas considered for surveillance. This could enhance the control of emerging diseases at a local and regional scale, especially when resources available for surveillance programs are scarce. ¬© 2010 International Association for Ecology and Health.","Article","Scopus",0.413917252563156,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27,NA

Whinchats winter in West Africa but there are almost no data on their habitat use and behaviour there that may help to explain the cause of this decline. We measured the density of Whinchats, the habitat characteristics associated with their occurrence on farmland, and the relationships between behavioural and habitat variation on farmland around Jos, central Nigeria, over three winters. Whinchats occurred in many fields harvested in the dry season, the density at three sites varying from 0.03 to 0.43 birds/ha, but they were absent at a fourth site. Whinchats were less likely to be found in farmland without particular crops (e.g. structural stem crops such as maize and millet), with more trees, lower amounts of short vegetation (grass, weeds, crops and crop stubble less than 10 cm in height), and higher amounts of medium vegetation (coverage of vegetation 10-100 cm in height) and litter (dead, unburned, vegetation on the ground). Whinchat abundance in areas of farmland where they were present was independent of most variables considered, but density was higher where there was more short vegetation cover. Foraging behaviour did not vary significantly between farmland habitats. All predictors were consistent between season, years and across sites. The presence/absence model was very poor at predicting presence and there were no strong predictors of abundance or foraging variation. This is consistent with a species well below carrying capacity within its environment so that many suitable areas do not have birds present and there is little aggregation at better sites. Overall, Whinchats were abundant and appeared to have plentiful habitat; densities have probably increased alongside the intensification of agriculture (presence of fallow farmland, short vegetation and structural crops). The results suggest that West African farmland in the dry season can support large numbers of Whinchats and that recent population declines in Europe are unlikely to be caused primarily by lack of suitable wintering habitat. ¬© 2012 The Authors Ibis ¬© 2012 British Ornithologists' Union.","Article","Scopus",0.774588737819955,"1","1",NA,10,10,14,NA

As a consequence it is an area of outstanding importance for waders, not only in the Western Palearctic but also across the entire Arctic region. Until recently, knowledge of the breeding birds of Kolguev was limited to the results of a small number of ornithological expeditions that took place mostly in the early 1900s. During the three summers 2006-2008, a Russian-German team undertook a series of expeditions to investigate the bird populations of the entire island. Here we present the results of these expeditions in respect the breeding status, abundance, distribution and population trends of waders, and report on some aspects of their breeding biology. We found 15 breeding wader species of which Dunlin Calidris alpina, Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres showed a decline between 1994-1995 and 2006-2008 while numbers of Grey Plovers Pluvialis squatarola appeared to be stable. In contrast Eurasian Golden Plovers P. apricaria which were rare in 1994 are now breeding regularly. Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Jack Snipe Lymnocryptes minimus and Eurasian Dotterel Eudromias morinellus were confirmed as breeding species, but these might have been overlooked in earlier years.

To address these issues, we analysed bird metacommunity structure in a 1200-km2 forested landscape (Istranca Forests) in Turkish Thrace at the margin of the Western Palaearctic (WP) temperate-forest biome. First, we used spatial regressions and Mantel tests to assess the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors as drivers of local species richness and composition within the metacommunity. Second, we analysed species' abundance-occupancy relationship across the metacommunity and used null models to assess whether occupancy is determined by species' environmental niches. Third, we used generalized linear models to test for links between species' metacommunity-wide occupancy and their broader WP regional populations and assessed whether these links are consistent with environmental species sorting. There was strong environmental control on local species richness and composition patterns within the metacommunity, but non-environmental spatial factors had also an important joint role. Null model analyses on randomized communities showed that species' occupancy across the metacommunity was strongly determined by species' environmental niches, with occupancy being related to niche position marginality. Species' metacommunity-wide occupancy correlated with their local abundance as well as with their range size and total abundance for the whole WP, suggesting that the same assembly mechanisms act consistently across local to regional scales. A species specialization index that was estimated by bird species' habitat use across France, incorporating both niche position and breadth, was significantly related to species' occupancy and abundance at both metacommunity and WP regional scales. Hence, the same niche-related assembly mechanisms appear to act consistently across the WP region. Overall, our results suggest that the structure of the Istranca Forest' bird metacommunity was predominantly controlled by environmental species sorting in a manner consistent with the broader WP region. However, variability in local community structure was also linked to purely spatial factors, albeit more weakly. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

This makes it imperative to understand the role of land-use on landscape-scale patterns of raptors and to define priority areas for conservation. We examine landscape-scale community patterns of raptors in biogeographical zones with different degrees of anthropogenic land-use and assess the role of protected areas in maintaining such patterns. We recorded raptors along road transects in Cameroon's savannas, covering four years and 7,340-7,700 km in wet and dry seasons, in three biogeographical zones: the relatively well-preserved Inundation and Guinea zones to the north and south of the heavily exploited Sudan zone. The Inundation zone had the largest species pool and Palearctic raptor richness and abundance. The Guinea zone had the largest Afrotropical raptor species pool, while raptor diversity and richness were higher there than in the Sudan zone. The abundance of only one species (Fox Kestrel) peaked in the Sudan zone and only one large-bodied raptor (Hooded Vulture) with a Sudan-centered distribution was more common there than in the other zones. Our results suggest that land-use as determined by protected areas and human exploitation may override the role of biogeographical zonation in shaping raptor assemblages. Comparable patterns of raptor richness and diversity inside and outside protected areas suggest that both protected areas and partly cultivated peripheral zones act as important foraging and source areas, ensuring the preservation of diverse raptor assemblages at the landscape scale. Finally, our data illustrate the comparatively high richness of Cameroon's and West Africa's savanna raptor communities on a continental and global scale, underlining their importance for raptor conservation. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus",0.531052473880962,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31,NA

However, processes influencing population change can operate throughout the annual cycle and throughout migratory ranges. Here, we explore the evidence for impacts of breeding and non-breeding conditions on population trends of British breeding birds of varying migratory status and wintering ecology. Location: Great Britain (England & Scotland). Methods: Within- and between-species variation in population trends is quantified for 46 bird species with differing migration strategies. Results: Between 1994 and 2007, rates of population change in Scotland and England differed significantly for 19 resident and 15 long-distance migrant species, but were similar for 12 short-distance migrant species. Of the six long-distance migrant species that winter in the arid zone of Africa, five are increasing in abundance throughout Britain. In contrast, the seven species wintering in the humid zone of Africa are all declining in England, but five of these are increasing in Scotland. Consequently, populations of both arid and humid zone species are increasing significantly faster in Scotland than England, and only the English breeding populations of species wintering in the humid zone are declining. Main conclusions: Population declines in long-distance migrants, especially those wintering in the humid zone, but not residents or short-distance migrants suggest an influence of non-breeding season conditions on population trends. However, the consistently less favourable population trends in England than Scotland of long-distance migrant and resident species strongly suggest that variation in the quality of breeding grounds is influencing recent population changes. The declines in humid zone species in England, but not Scotland, may result from poorer breeding conditions in England exacerbating the impacts of non-breeding conditions or the costs associated with a longer migration, while better conditions in Scotland may be buffering these impacts. ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Scopus",0.81808939910071,"1","1",NA,15,5,17,NA

Our results indicated that QNNR plays a vital and unique role in bird species preservation and scientific study, especially for endemic and endangered species. Species richness of both the Palearctic and Oriental realms were different, there was no overall significant difference (164 and 178, respectively). Species differences between the northern and southern slope of QNNR were especially remarkable. The northern slope was characterized with enriched endemic plateau species over small total number of bird species the southern flank held an abundance of bird species with complex composition. Moreover, on the southern slope, the peak of breeding birds richness occurred at 2,500~3,100 m a.s.l., supporting the mid-domain effect hypothesis. Meanwhile, as elevation increased, the richness of Oriental species decreased while that of Palearctic species increased. The percentages of Oriental and Palearctic species were similar at 3,100~4,000 m a.s.l.. Accordingly, we estimated that the boundary of Oriental realm and Palearctic realm was at 3,100~4,000 m a.s.l., and the species invasion from Palearctic to Oriental realm was more obvious. Perhaps most significantly, the specific distribution species along the vertical gradients also indicated their corresponding adaptation strategies.","Article","Scopus",0.605984249863716,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,50,NA

In 2008 and 2009, we conducted field surveys in Greenland from 76.00¬∞ to 77.35¬∞N for breeding and non-breeding waterfowl and have collected anecdotal field notes of avian observations over a 20-year period (1993-2012).

Northern pintails (Anas acuta) were observed for the first time in northwest Greenland, and a previously unknown breeding location for brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) was also identified.

Thus, 1,100 common chiffchaffs Phylloscopus collybita were sampled during 2009-2012 at eight wintering locations within the Palearctic and Afrotropical regions. Biometric and body condition variables were studied for their relationship to geographical, climatic and productivity indexes. A higher proportion of adults and females were observed at lower latitudes. Common chiffichaffs were larger and in better body condition in sub-Saharan areas, coinciding with greater plant productivity and less annual rainfall. The selection of the southernmost areas by adults may be related to fidelity to more favourable sites. Southern and coastal locations offer better conditions for chiffichaffs, despite the challenges involved in crossing the Sahara Desert. Moreover, the greater skills of adults in finding abundant food resources may also drive greater relative abundance south of the Sahara. Greater body mass and fat deposits in birds wintering in sub-Saharan areas reflect higher resource availability and may imply that the birds are in better physical condition.","Article","Scopus",0.564258513250798,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,49,NA

We investigated variation in annual productivity 2010‚Äì2012 in the Cyprus Wheatear Oenanthe cypriaca, a small endemic migrant passerine at the National Forest Park (NFP) of Troodos. Clutch size for first nests was usually five, although 0.40 eggs lower in 2011. Nest survival did not vary with year, nesting attempt, or clutch initiation date, but was significantly higher in the chick (0.96; 0.88‚Äì0.98, 95¬†% CI) versus the egg stage (0.74; 0.62‚Äì0.83, 95¬†% CI). The number of chicks fledged from a successful nest varied with nest type‚Äîwith first nests and second nests after failure being similar producing ~3‚Äì4.5 chicks dependent on year, and with second nests after success producing ~2 chicks, independent of year. There were only weak positive or negative effects of clutch initiation date dependent on year, controlling for nest type, and no effects of male age on productivity. After fledging, chicks had a >95¬†% chance of surviving the first month, but with a greater probability of one or rarely two chicks per brood dying if fledged later in the season. Renesting rate was significantly different in all years (26, 48, and 78¬†% renesting): 2010 had a much lower renesting rate after success with very few second broods (29 versus 76¬†% and 73¬†% in 2011 and 2012, respectively). Overall productivity per territory did not vary with year with 3.96¬†¬±¬†0.09 SE chicks alive 1¬†month after fledging. Cyprus Wheatears showed several unusual breeding parameters including a highly variable renesting probability, high nestling, and very high fledgling survival, resulting in exceptionally high productivity. This may be because renesting is constrained by high mid-summer temperatures and low abundance of chick predators. ¬© 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus",0.803895282650493,"0","0","Focused on reproductive performance.",15,10,22,NA

Such anthropogenic areas have specific environmental characteristics, which influence the physiology, life history, and population dynamics of plants and animals. For example, the date of bud burst is advanced in urban compared to nearby natural areas. In some birds, breeding success is determined by synchrony between timing of breeding and peak food abundance. Pertinently, caterpillars are an important food source for the nestlings of many bird species, and their abundance is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and date of bud burst. Higher temperatures and advanced date of bud burst in urban areas could advance peak caterpillar abundance and thus affect breeding phenology of birds. In order to test whether laying date advance and clutch sizes decrease with the intensity of urbanization, we analyzed the timing of breeding and clutch size in relation to intensity of urbanization as a measure of human impact in 199 nest box plots across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East (i.e., the Western Palearctic) for four species of hole-nesters: blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), great tits (Parus major), collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Meanwhile, we estimated the intensity of urbanization as the density of buildings surrounding study plots measured on orthophotographs. For the four study species, the intensity of urbanization was not correlated with laying date. Clutch size in blue and great tits does not seem affected by the intensity of urbanization, while in collared and pied flycatchers it decreased with increasing intensity of urbanization. This is the first large-scale study showing a species-specific major correlation between intensity of urbanization and the ecology of breeding. The underlying mechanisms for the relationships between life history and urbanization remain to be determined. We propose that effects of food abundance or quality, temperature, noise, pollution, or disturbance by humans may on their own or in combination affect laying date and/or clutch size. ¬© 2016 The Authors.

The avifauna was dominated by shorebirds (52% of records), followed by large wading birds (25%), open-water birds (18%) and waterfowl (5%). However, the structure of local waterbird communities and their composition in terms of foraging guilds varied according to habitat type. The bird communities of sandy beaches were dominated by open-water birds, whereas large mudflats were dominated by shorebirds, and wadi estuaries showed a more even representation of foraging guilds. Locally rare species had narrow distributions, whereas locally abundant species were found widely within the gulf. For four species the 1% population level criterion of the Ramsar Convention was exceeded.

Avian migrants use an array of strategies when conducting these movements depending on e.g. morphology, life history traits and environmental factors encountered en route. Here we used geolocators to derive data on the annual space-use, temporal pattern and migratory strategies in an Afro-Palaearctic aerial insectivorous bird species ‚Äì the European nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus. More specifically, we aimed to test a set of hypothesises pertaining to the migration of a population of nightjars breeding in south-eastern Sweden. We found that the birds wintered across the central and western parts of the southern tropical Africa almost entirely outside the currently described wintering range of the species. The nightjars performed a narrow loop migration across Sahara, with spring Sahel stopovers significantly to the west of autumn stops indicative to an adaptive response to winds during migration. To our surprise, the migration speed was faster in the autumn (119 km d‚àí 1) than in the spring (99 km d‚àí 1), possibly due to the prevailing wind regimes over the Sahara. The estimated flight fraction in both autumn (14%) and spring (12%) was almost exactly as the theoretically predicted 1:7 time relationship between flights and stopovers for small birds. The temporal patterns within the annual cycle indicate that individuals follow alternative spatiotemporal schedules that converge towards the breeding season. The positive relationship between the spatially and temporally distant winter departure and breeding arrival suggests that individuals¬¥ temporal fine-tuning to breeding may be constrained, leading to potential negative fitness consequences. ¬© 2016 The Authors","Article","Scopus",0.68179748720338,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26,NA

We propose a general strategy of tracking the broad seasonal abundance of resources throughout the annual cycle in the longest-distance migrating land birds as an alternative to tracking a certain climatic niche or shorter-term resource surplus occurring, for example, during spring foliation. Whether and how this is possible for complex annual spatiotemporal schedules is not known. New tracking technology enables unprecedented spatial and temporal mapping of long-distance movement of birds. We show that three Palearctic-African species track vegetation greenness throughout their annual cycle, adjusting the timing and direction of migratory movements with seasonal changes in resource availability over Europe and Africa. Common cuckoos maximize the vegetation greenness, whereas red-backed shrikes and thrush nightingales track seasonal surplus in greenness. Our results demonstrate that the longest-distance migrants move between consecutive staging areas even within the wintering region in Africa to match seasonal variation in regional climate. End-of-century climate projections indicate that optimizing greenness would be possible but that vegetation surplus might be more difficult to track in the future. 2017 ¬© The Authors. some rights reserved.","Article","Scopus",0.549416126211194,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,45,NA

Understanding constraints to the distribution of threatened species may help to ascertain whether there are other suitable sectors for reducing the risks associated with species that are recorded in only one protected locality, and to inform about the suitability of other areas for reintroduction or translocation programs. Methods. We studied the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (Fringilla polatzeki), a habitat specialist endemic of the Canary Islands restricted to the pine forest of Inagua, the only area where the species has been naturally present as a regular breeder in the last 25 years. A suitability distribution model using occurrences with demographic relevance (i.e., nest locations of successful breeding attempts analysed using boosted classification trees) was built considering orographic, climatic and habitat structure predictors. By means of a standardized survey program we monitored the yearly abundance of the species in 100 sectors since the declaration of Inagua as a Strict Nature Reserve in 1994. Results. The variables with the highest relative importance in blue chaffinch habitat preferences were pine height, tree cover, altitude, and rainfall during the driest trimester (July-September). The observed local abundance of the blue chaffinch in Inagua (survey data) was significantly correlated with habitat suitability derived from modelling the location of successful nesting attempts (using linear and quantile regressions). The outcomes of the habitat suitability model were used to quantify the suitability of other natural, historic, pine forests of Gran Canaria. Tamadaba is the forest with most suitable woodland patches for the species. We estimated a population size of 195-430 blue chaffinches in Inagua since 2011 (95% CI), the smallest population size of a woodland passerine in the Western Palearctic. Discussion. Habitat suitability obtained from modelling the location of successful breeding attempts is a good surrogate of the observed local abundance during the reproductive season. The outcomes of these models can be used for the identification of potential areas for the reintroduction of the species in other suitable pine forests and to inform forest management practices. ¬© 2017 Carrascal et al.","Article","Scopus",0.747624151308854,NA,"1",NA,NA,15,37,NA

Evidence regarding population trends of endangered species in special protection areas and their recovery ability from catastrophic disturbances is scarce. We assessed the population trend of the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (Fringilla polatzeki), a habitat specialist endemic to the pine forest of Inagua in the Canary Islands, following a devastating wildfire in July 2007. Using a standardized census program that accounts for detectability, we have monitored the population trend of the species since Inagua was declared a Strict Nature Reserve in 1994. The breeding population density of the blue chaffinch remained stable in Inagua from the beginning of the monitoring program in 1994 until the year before the wildfire. However, in spring 2008, the population density decreased by half with respect to density in the preceding years. Since 2008, the population has gradually increased, reaching its highest recorded density in 2016 (15.8 birds/km2).This represents an average annual increase of 23.7%, indicating impressive resilience to catastrophic events. The creation of Inagua as a strict nature reserve did not therefore increase the global population or protect the blue chaffinch against a demographic crisis but probably prevented a deepening of the demographic crisis or further declines. Except for the two years immediately after the severe wildfire of 2007, the population density of the blue chaffinch in Inagua has remained relatively stable at around 9‚Äì16 birds/km2, the lowest recorded abundance for a small woodland passerine in the Western Palearctic. ¬©.2018 Museu de Ci√®ncies Naturals de Barcelona.","Article","Scopus",0.868870649139402,"1","1",NA,10,5,8,NA

A total of 36 species belonging to 14 waterbird families were encountered. Fifteen of the species were resident birds, including the endemic Wattled Ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), and 14 of the species were Palaearctic migrants, including the globally Near-Threatened Ferruginous Duck (Ayithya nyroca) and Maccoa Duck (Oxyura maccoa).

Three quarters of birds showed ITM across the non-breeding range. We found no difference in range values and mean values of NDVI between the single non-breeding sites of stationary birds and the two sites of moving birds. The vegetation conditions were better at the second sites compared to the first sites during the period which moving birds spent at the first sites. Vegetation conditions further deteriorated at the first sites during the period the moving birds resided at their second sites. Our study provides evidence that birds probably benefit from improved conditions after ITM compared to the conditions at the sites from where they departed. ¬© 2018 The Authors.","Article","Scopus",0.695332477553974,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41,NA

In this study, counts on waterbirds were conducted in dry and wet season (in years 2001-2008) in a riverine habitat in southern Africa (Shamvura stretch of the Okavango River). In total, 84 waterfowl species were recorded. The birds were assigned to different guilds according to their migration activity, diet and nesting site selection. In overall, the species number was almost the same (74 vs. 73) in the wet and dry season. The abundance of all resident species recorded was lower in wet (N = 5992) than in dry seasons (N = 6965)(œá2 = 73.1, P &lt; 0.01). In both seasons Palearctic migrants were represented by seven species, which comprised 1-2% of all waterbirds. Six species were classified as dominants: African reed cormorant Phalacrocorax africanus, African openbill stork Anastomus lamelligerus, cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, wattled lapwing Vanellus senegallus, African darter Anhinga rufa and white-faced duck Dendrocygna viduata. In the wet season the dominant species comprised 68%, while in dry season-52.5% of all birds recorded. Significant seasonal differences in the numbers of individuals were shown for the following species: African reed cormorant, great egret, squacco heron, wattled lapwing and pied kingfisher. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more abundant in wet season, while piscivorous, carnivorous and plant eating birds in dry season. These differences can be related mainly to seasonal variation in the availability of food as well as to the timing of breeding. ¬© 2018 E-flow BioOne.
