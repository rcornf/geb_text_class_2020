2,desert,How to Bloom the Green Desert: Eucalyptus Plantations and Native Forests in Uruguay beyond Black and White Perspectives,"The ongoing debate on the boon or bane of monocultural timber plantations demonstrates the need to develop alternative approaches that achieve forest productivity while conserving biodiversity. We assessed the diversity of tree species in native forests and in Eucalyptus plantations, and evaluated the potential use of native species to enhance plantation management. For this purpose, we established one-hectare permanent plots in nine native forests (riverine and park forests) and nine Eucalyptus plantations in the northwestern part of Uruguay. Forest inventories were carried out on 200 m(2) plots and regeneration was assessed along transects in 9 m(2) subplots. Riverine forests have the highest Shannon diversity index (2.5) followed by park forests (2.1) and Eucalyptus plantations (1.3). Tree density was high in riverine forests (1913/ha) and plantations (1315/ha), whereas park forests have lower tree density (796/ha). Regeneration density was high in riverine forests (39136/ha) and park forests (7500/ha); however, native species can regenerate in the understory of plantations (727/ha), and this underlines the possibility of developing a mixed species approach to reduce the negative impact of monocultures. Differences in the composition of plant communities were denoted between native forests and plantations, although native forests were similar in composition, even in the presence of exotic species. Native forests harbor specialist species that are absent from plantations, and therefore perform a decisive role in maintaining local biodiversity. Strategies to enhance species diversity and structural diversity within plantations or to establish mixed buffer strips containing native species at the edge of plantations are potential measures to enhance biodiversity and foster the integration of plantations into the local landscape.",WOS:000448550700033,285,0.924211805,1,how to bloom the green desert eucalypt plant and nat forest in uruguay beyond black and whit perspect the ongo deb on the boon or ban of monocult timb plant demonst the nee to develop altern approach that achiev forest produc whil conserv biodivers we assess the divers of tre specy in nat forest and in eucalypt plant and evalu the pot us of nat specy to enh plant man for thi purpos we est on hect perm plot in nin nat forest riverin and park forest and nin eucalypt plant in the northwestern part of uruguay forest inv wer carry out on m plot and reg was assess along transect in m subplot riverin forest hav the highest shannon divers index follow by park forest and eucalypt plant tre dens was high in riverin forest ha and plant ha wherea park forest hav low tre dens ha reg dens was high in riverin forest ha and park forest ha howev nat specy can reg in the underst of plant ha and thi underlin the poss of develop a mix specy approach to reduc the neg impact of monocult diff in the composit of plant commun wer denot between nat forest and plant although nat forest wer simil in composit ev in the pres of exot specy nat forest harb spec specy that ar abs from plant and theref perform a decid rol in maintain loc biodivers strategies to enh specy divers and structural divers within plant or to est mix buff strips contain nat specy at the edg of plant ar pot meas to enh biodivers and fost the integr of plant into the loc landscap,new,0.9342755522205606,0.8931386762746487,0.8582215126865599,0.8295533408581001,0.8052827466594862,0.7839316214761265,0.7643805825908984,0.745693944868589,0.7268102438470573,0.7060331815209336,0.6793486118164016
3,desert,Maintenance of richness despite reduced abundance of desert bees ( Hymenoptera: Apiformes) to persistent grazing,"Anthropogenic changes to ecosystems typically result in decreased species richness and abundance relative to that of adjacent semi-pristine or pristine areas. Yet, there is debate about the generality of this result for bees given that most studies have included extremely disturbed areas and are from a limited set of biogeographical areas. Repeat sampling of an unusually specialised, species-rich bee community was done in the north-western Chihuahuan Desert, North America at sites in five habitats (riparian, mesquite forest, abandoned field, grassland, and desert scrub) that either had been intensely grazed by cattle in the previous year or not been grazed for 22+ years. Species density and species composition of bees did not change in response to grazing, abundance and proportion of singleton species (those represented by one specimen) did. In all habitats, other than the riparian, there was lower overall abundance and a greater proportion of singleton species at sites that had been recently grazed than at sites that had not been grazed since 1979. The proportion of singletons was greater in recently grazed than in long-term ungrazed areas, but pollen-specialist species did not respond more strongly than pollen generalists. The substantial variation in bee abundance and rarity was probably associated with differences in floral resources. Overall, lower bee abundance in grazed areas reflects the continuous removal by grazers of the flowers that bees use. Despite reduced bee abundance due to long-term grazing, species richness, and composition in this desert bee community remained high.",WOS:000335471900007,9,0.894215874,1,maint of rich despit reduc abund of desert bee hymenopter apiform to persist graz anthropog chang to ecosystem typ result in decreas specy rich and abund rel to that of adjac sem pristin or pristin area yet ther is deb about the gen of thi result for bee giv that most study hav includ extrem disturb area and ar from a limit set of biogeograph area rep sampl of an unus spec specy rich bee commun was don in the nor western chihuahu desert nor americ at sit in fiv habit rip mesquit forest abandon field grassland and desert scrub that eith had been intens graz by cattl in the prevy year or not been graz for year specy dens and specy composit of bee did not chang in respons to graz abund and proport of singleton specy thos repres by on specim did in al habit oth than the rip ther was low overal abund and a gre proport of singleton specy at sit that had been rec graz than at sit that had not been graz sint the proport of singleton was gre in rec graz than in long term ungraz area but pol spec specy did not respond mor strongly than pol gen the subst vary in bee abund and rar was prob assocy with diff in flor resourc overal low bee abund in graz area reflect the continu remov by graz of the flow that bee us despit reduc bee abund due to long term graz specy rich and composit in thi desert bee commun remain high,new,0.917627863368296,0.8929500809427684,0.8751391296961755,0.8614534414680289,0.8501640362234351,0.8403363480418146,0.8313813927465596,0.8228493913952225,0.8142998869479076,0.8051161350293551,0.7941439960528911
4,desert,Grazing promotes dung beetle diversity in the xeric landscape of a Mexican Biosphere Reserve,"We analyze the impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity at the Barranca de Metztitlan Biosphere Reserve, a xeric ecosystem in central Mexico with a long history of use by humans. We compared the community structure, as well as the alpha and beta diversity between two cover conditions (open and closed vegetation) that represent the impact of grazing within a habitat, and between habitat types (submountainous and crassicaule scrublands). From 576 samples we collected 75,605 dung beetles belonging to 20 taxa. While mean species richness and diversity were different between habitat types, cumulative species richness was not. The effects of grazing on vegetation structure influenced the cumulative species richness and diversity of dung beetles in the submountainous scrubland, where grazing has created land mosaics of a grassland matrix with scrubland patches. This was not the case in the crassicaule scrubland where the impact of grazing is not as evident. Beta diversity significantly responds to the effects of grazing on habitat conditions. We discuss the ecological factors that may promote these responses by landscape diversity components. We also identify the species that could act as useful indicators to monitor the effect of land management on biodiversity. Our results indicate cattle farming maintains a diversified land mosaic, and these areas support more diverse dung beetle ensembles than homogeneous areas of closed, shrubby vegetation cover. Thus, controlled grazing activity could certainly favour the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and improve ecosystem functioning by maintaining dung decomposition rates.",WOS:000251210800011,18,0.8780437109999999,1,graz promot dung beetl divers in the xer landscap of a mex biosph reserv we analys the impact of graz on dung beetl divers at the barranc de metztitl biosph reserv a xer ecosystem in cent mexico with a long hist of us by hum we comp the commun structure as wel as the alph and bet divers between two cov condit op and clos veget that repres the impact of graz within a habit and between habit typ submountain and crassica scrublands from sampl we collect dung beetl belong to tax whil mean specy rich and divers wer diff between habit typ cum specy rich was not the effect of graz on veget structure influ the cum specy rich and divers of dung beetl in the submountain scrubland wher graz has cre land mosa of a grassland matrix with scrubland patch thi was not the cas in the crassica scrubland wher the impact of graz is not as evid bet divers sign respond to the effect of graz on habit condit we discuss the ecolog fact that may promot thes respons by landscap divers compon we also ident the specy that could act as us ind to monit the effect of land man on biodivers our result ind cattl farm maintain a divers land mosa and thes area support mor divers dung beetl ensembl than homog area of clos shrubby veget cov thu control graz act could certain favo the conserv of dung beetl biodivers and improv ecosystem funct by maintain dung decomposit rat,new,0.9047536029855948,0.8655818819927354,0.8348568830672971,0.8106353149301037,0.7908479614643714,0.7741518391892772,0.7596576735096279,0.7467547797444838,0.7349797112093926,0.7239312470688295,0.7132413857313638
5,desert,Effect of landscape and stand variables on tree species diversity in the understory of Pinus taeda plantations in Misiones province,"Forest plantations are within the most important productive activities in Misiones, Argentina. Afforestations are strongly criticized under the idea that are green deserts, non suitable as habitat for native fauna. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the regeneration of native tree species in the understory of Pinus taeda plantations and the influence of stand and landscape variables in the northwest of Misiones, Argentina. Plantations presenting different ages, previous land uses and landscape contexts were sampled. A total of 91 native tree species were found in the forest understory, and the most abundant were animal-dispersed tree species. The native tree composition of plantations understory was different from that of native forest. The similarity analysis revealed that old plantations were more similar to native forest than to young plantations. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that previous land use was the variable with more influence on the understory composition, followed by the basal area and the distance to the native forest at the time of planting. Wind-dispersed and pioneer species were more associated with short distances to the native forest and lower basal area; whereas animal-dispersed and shade tolerant species were related to high basal area and previous land use.

6,desert,CACTI COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN A TROPICAL MEXICAN DRY FOREST UNDER CHRONIC DISTURBANCE,"When agricultural lands in formerly dry forest are abandoned, chronic disturbance by livestock grazing and wood extraction may set back successional processes precluding older dry forest structure from be reached. We compare cacti density, richness, diversity and evenness in twelve 50 x 50 m plots: six plots in secondary dry forest and six plots in older conserved dry forest at Sierra de Huautla, Central Mexico. Cacti were identified, the life-form of each species was recorded and size was measured to assign individuals into four life-stage classes. Nine cacti species were registered across both forest types. In this dry forest, richness, diversity and evenness of cacti community increased in sites under chronic disturbance, whereas density was not significantly affected. Size structure at community level in the conserved forest showed an increase of individuals with size, whereas in the secondary forest, size structure showed an uneven distribution of individuals, as in populations that regenerate by pulses. In the secondary forest, there was a lower proportion of adults and they were in average, smaller than those in the conserved forest. Chronic disturbance may eventually change cacti community structure, affecting animals that depend on large arboreal cacti for food, perches and/or refuge; therefore, maintenance of biodiversity will be at stake.",WOS:000341675600007,273,0.873223372,1,cact commun structure in a trop mex dry forest und chronic disturb when agricult land in form dry forest ar abandon chronic disturb by livestock graz and wood extract may set back success process preclud old dry forest structure from be reach we comp cact dens rich divers and ev in twelv x m plot six plot in second dry forest and six plot in old conserv dry forest at sierr de huautl cent mexico cact wer ident the lif form of each specy was record and siz was meas to assign individ into four lif stag class nin cact specy wer reg across both forest typ in thi dry forest rich divers and ev of cact commun increas in sit und chronic disturb wherea dens was not sign affect siz structure at commun level in the conserv forest show an increas of individ with siz wherea in the second forest siz structure show an unev distribut of individ as in pop that reg by puls in the second forest ther was a low proport of adult and they wer in av smal than thos in the conserv forest chronic disturb may ev chang cact commun structure affect anim that depend on larg arb cact for food perch and or refug theref maint of biodivers wil be at stak,new,0.8749035956509957,0.8217789575063732,0.7825033153486117,0.7534714199189829,0.731216840737814,0.7136777990630485,0.699675929878059,0.6886230636518708,0.6804095639124813,0.6756741963972193,0.6770228499872742

Striking differences are observed in the species richness, number of clades and functional diversity of termite assemblage between different habitats. This study aim was to examine effect of human interference in the diversity of wood destroying termite in forest areas as well as managed and unmanaged plantations in South India. Termites attacking trees and wooden logs were collected from forest areas, managed plantations and unmanaged plantations. The termites collected were identified and compared for species abundance, richness and species diversity. Results show that the species composition and species diversity of the wood destroying termites vary according to the conditions. The species diversity measures revealed that there is a significance variation among the forest fauna and plantations. The forest areas have the highest species composition compared to plantations.

Spatial and temporal variations in species composition and structure were compared, and alpha and beta diversities were compared for the field data collected from sampled sites. The diversity of native desert species decreased from 66% in desert areas to 44% of the total recorded plants inside the forests. Meanwhile, the percentage of agricultural weed species increased in forests to >twofold more than that recorded in desert areas. Plant communities in forest stands shared <50% of their species with adjacent vegetation in desert stands. The percentage of variation in species composition was >340% in some forests compared with the desert areas. Alpha diversity and beta-diversity were significantly higher in forest stands than in the desert. Spatial and temporal variations in species diversity were correlated with type of tree canopy and irrigation system.

9,desert,Gardening in the desert changes bee communities and pollination network characteristics,"Conversion of natural habitats to human settlements creates an alternative habitat with different bio-physical characteristics such as micro-climatic conditions and resource availability. Deserts are especially sensitive to such effects due to generally low nutrient levels and water availability. Gardens in human settlements in the desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant pollinator networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat surrounding the gardens.",WOS:000293312600005,32,0.8473785,1,gard in the desert chang bee commun and pollin network charact convert of nat habit to hum settl cre an altern habit with diff bio phys charact such as micro clim condit and resourc avail desert ar espec sensit to such effect due to gen low nutry level and wat avail gard in hum settl in the desert ar oft a main sourc of aly plant specy that provid ampl for resourc year round thes chang in flor composit and avail may alt pollin commun composit and for behavio as wel as pollin network charact we investig the effect of desert gard on pollin commun and pollin network in the jord rift valley israel an arid agro nat landscap sou of the dead sea we study season divers pattern of plant and wild bee in nat habit and in gard in settl wild bee and bloom plant wer sampl from febru to july in and in we construct plant pollin network and comp bee commun between the two habit typ along the season we found that bee abund was gre in the gard and that rarefy bee specy rich was gre in the nat habit bee specy rich and abund exhibit contrast season pattern between habit bee commun composit also diff gre between habit and specy in the gard had a gen wid geograph rang in comparison to specy in the nat habit we also found a high level of gen of the pollin network in the gard comp to the nat habit which may ind a respons to a disturb and unst environ we conclud that gard in desert although promot overal bee abund neg affect specy rich and chang commun composit and network charact with poss imply on the composit of nat flor in the nat habit surround the gard,new,0.8487952428906266,0.8243788116938016,0.8095610748507777,0.7999467696891942,0.7934539682378184,0.7891672493196962,0.7867040921390704,0.786023084307208,0.7874825497008411,0.7922361199875324,0.8039017223749629

11,desert,Effect of a desert planted forest on the understory plant diversity: implication to conservation,"The present study aimed to assess the potential role of desert tree plantations for biodiversity conservation of native vegetation. For this purpose, we compared diversity and composition of understory vegetation in a managed desert plantation in Egypt with adjacent natural vegetation. In 126 stands, we estimated the diversity indices of the understory vegetation associated with five tree plantations inside and outside the forest. The results showed that therophytes had the highest contribution to the total flora of the study area (45.7 %), followed by chamaephytes (21.7 %). The weed species were the main components inside the forest (37 species). In the stands of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Khaya senegalensis, the agricultural weeds were the most abundant followed by natural weeds. Spring season was the main flourishing season for weeds followed by autumn. Dalbergia sissoo had the highest values for species richness (8.8) and the lowest for species turnover (2.5). On the contrary, Casuarina spp. had the lowest values of species richness (3.0) and the highest of species turnover (7.3) and Simpson index (12.3).

12,desert,"Desert grassland canopy arthropod species richness: temporal patterns and effects of intense, short-duration livestock grazing","Arthropods living in the canopies of two woody shrub species (a sub-shrub (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and a large shrub (Prosopis glandulosa)) and perennial grasses plus associated herbaceous species, were sampled on 18, 0.5 hectare plots in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland for five consecutive years. Mesquite shrubs were removed from nine plots, six plots were grazed by yearling cattle in August and six plots were grazed in February for the last 3 years of the 5 year study. Arthropod species richness ranged between 154 and 353 on grasses, from 120 to 266 on G. sarothrae, and from 69 to 116 on P. glandulosa. There was a significant relationship between the number of families of insects on grass and G. sarothrae and growing season rainfall but species richness was not a function of growing season rainfall on any of the plants. Several of the arthropod families that were the most species rich in this grassland were found on all of the plants sampled, i.e. Salticid spiders, Bruchid and Curculionid beetles, Cicadellid and Psyllid homopterans, and ants (Formicidae). There were more species rich families that were shared by grasses and the sub-shrub G. sarothrae than with mesquite. The absence of a relationship between growing season rainfall and species richness was attributed to variation in life history characteristics of arthropods and to the non-linear responses of annual and perennial desert grassland plants to rainfall. There were no significant differences in insect family or species richness on any of the plant types as a result of removal of mesquite (P. glandulosa) from selected plots. Intense, short duration (24 h) grazing by livestock during in late summer resulted in reduced species richness in the grass-herb vegetation layer but had no effect on insect species richness on snakeweed or mesquite shrubs. Livestock grazing in winter had no effect on insect species richness on any of the vegetation sampled. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

13,desert,Complex responses within a desert bee guild (Hymenoptera : Apiformes) to urban habitat fragmentation,"Urbanization within the Tucson Basin of Arizona during the past 5 years has fragmented the original desert scrub into patches of different sizes and ages. These remnant patches and the surrounding desert are dominated by Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), a long-lived shrub whose flowers are visited by > 120 native bee species across its range. Twenty-one of these bee species restrict their pollen foraging to L. tridentata. To evaluate the response of this bee fauna to fragmentation, we compared species incidence and abundance patterns for the bee guild visiting L. tridentata at 59 habitat fragments of known size (0.002-5 ha) and age (up to 70 years), and in adjacent desert. The 62 bee species caught during this study responded to fragmentation heterogeneously and not in direct relation to their abundance or incidence in undisturbed desert. Few species found outside the city were entirely absent from urban fragments. Species of ground-nesting L. tridentata specialists were underrepresented in smaller fragments and less abundant in the smaller and older fragments. In contrast, cavity-nesting bees (including one L. tridentata specialist) were overrepresented in the habitat fragments., probably due to enhanced nesting opportunities available in the urban matrix. Small-bodied bee species were no more likely than larger bodied species to be absent from the smaller fragments. The introduced European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was a minor faunal element at > 90% of the fragments and exerted little if any influence on the response of native bee species to fragmentation. Overall, bee response to urban habitat fragmentation was best predicted by ecological traits associated with nesting and dietary breadth. Had species been treated as individual units in the analyses, or pooled together into one analysis, these response patterns may not have been apparent. Pollination interactions with this floral host are probably not adversely affected in this system because of its longevity and ability to attract diverse pollinators but will demand careful further study to understand.",WOS:000237052200017,280,0.84372996,1,complex respons within a desert bee guild hymenopter apiform to urb habit frag urb within the tucson basin of arizon dur the past year has frag the origin desert scrub into patch of diff siz and ag thes remn patch and the surround desert ar domin by larre tridentat creosot bush a long liv shrub whos flow ar visit by nat bee specy across it rang twenty on of thes bee specy restrict their pol for to l tridentat to evalu the respons of thi bee faun to frag we comp specy incid and abund pattern for the bee guild visit l tridentat at habit frag of known siz ha and ag up to year and in adjac desert the bee specy caught dur thi study respond to frag heterog and not in direct rel to their abund or incid in undisturb desert few specy found outsid the city wer entir abs from urb frag specy of ground nest l tridentat spec wer underrepres in smal frag and less abund in the smal and old frag in contrast cav nest bee includ on l tridentat spec wer overrepres in the habit frag prob due to enh nest opportun avail in the urb matrix smal body bee specy wer no mor lik than larg body specy to be abs from the smal frag the introduc europ honey bee ap mellifer was a min faun el at of the frag and exert littl if any influ on the respons of nat bee specy to frag overal bee respons to urb habit frag was best predict by ecolog trait assocy with nest and diet bread had specy been tre as individ unit in the analys or pool togeth into on analys thes respons pattern may not hav been app pollin interact with thi flor host ar prob not advers affect in thi system becaus of it longev and abl to attract divers pollin but wil demand car furth study to understand,new,0.8528994076229347,0.8480181344053658,0.8468260886346946,0.8471640186955066,0.8483661183843924,0.850258935067128,0.8528696419918959,0.8563847651661802,0.8612486585306193,0.8684956063732977,0.8810000396902082
14,desert,National assessment of forest fragmentation in India: Landscape indices as measures of the effects of fragmentation and forest cover change,"Forest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1 km(2). At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187 ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975-2005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Five plant communities were recognized and for each one all woody individuals >= 10 cm DBH were tallied in sixteen 400 m(2) circular plots, whereas individuals between 2.5 and 9.9 cm DBH were measured in a 100 m(2) circular subplot centered within each larger plot.

The tropical deciduous forest and Quercus deserticola forest had low values of mean plant height (< 5 m) and basal area (17.8 and 26 m(2)/ha, respectively), but these communities showed the higher density. Forests dominated by Q. rugosa and Quercus-Pinus had the lowest density but the highest mean height (> 11 m) and basal area (> 40 m(2)/ha). Diversity was greater in the tropical deciduous forest (S= 23 and alpha= 5.4, respectively) and lower in the oak-pine forest (S= 13 and alpha= 2.71).

16,desert,Variation in arthropod communities in response to urbanization: Seven years of arthropod monitoring in a desert city,"Continuous monitoring is essential to understand dynamics of biological communities in response to urbanization, and to provide guidance in landscape planning for conserving urban biodiversity. Arthropods serve this purpose because they are abundant and diverse in urban areas, and relatively easy to collect. Over seven years, in the Central Arizona Phoenix area, arthropod communities in three urban habitat categories were collected and compared to arthropods in natural desert using pitfall traps and non-parametric analyses. First, we tested for differences in arthropod composition, abundances, and diversity across habitats and years. Second, we examined how conclusions about arthropod diversity vary with level of taxonomic resolution. We found that arthropod community composition varied among the four habitats at all taxonomic levels tested. In particular, urban mesic habitats had generally lower diversity than natural desert habitats, although with some exceptions. In contrast, mesic habitats had higher arthropod abundance than all habitats, and fluctuations in abundance were completely independent from changes in precipitation. Taxonomic shortcuts gave overall good impressions of community differences, but finer taxonomic resolutions on certain groups of arthropods revealed distinctly different responses to urbanization (e.g., higher beetle and ant diversity in the urban habitats). Urban areas have great potential for arthropod diversity, but community composition and dynamics are notably different from natural habitats. Institutions, local governments and homeowners can make an impact in arthropod conservation by choice of landscaping, and we recommend that remnants of natural habitats within cities receive further attention in urban planning.

Richness and abundance of bees were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees.

18,desert,Ant biodiversity in semiarid landscape mosaics: The consequences of grazing vs. natural heterogeneity,"The conservation of biodiversity in landscape mosaics requires an understanding of the impacts of human land use within mosaic elements and an evaluation of the biological uniqueness of different elements. We address these issues by examining patterns of ant diversity in three semiarid rangeland landscapes used predominantly for grazing. These landscapes lie along a regional gradient from shortgrass steppe through a transitional zone to desert grassland, along which climate and ant species composition vary. Within each landscape, we compared the effects of grazing and natural variation in soils and vegetation on ant diversity and community composition. Grazing had little effect on ant richness, diversity, or composition at the transitional zone or the desert grassland site, but ungrazed areas at the shortgrass steppe site had a higher overall richness and favored the abundance of some species. Some samples of saltbush (Atriplex canescens) shrubland were similar to ungrazed samples in richness and species composition. In both the transitional zone and the desert grassland, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata)-dominated habitats harbored comparatively species-rich and distinct ant communities. In addition, mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) coppice dunes at the desert grassland site favored the abundance of several species that were rare across the site. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that variation in soil strength and texture best explained community variation at the shortgrass steppe site, whereas soil texture and associated differences in shrub density best explained differences in composition at the transitional and desert grassland sites. The characterization of habitats based upon vegetation classification did not adequately reflect environmental variation that was important to ants in shortgrass steppe, but reflected important soil textural variation in the transitional and desert grassland sites. These results suggest that ant conservation in these semiarid rangelands should emphasize patterns of variation in soil properties. The results add to a growing consensus that a variety of variables determined by the responses of several focal taxa may be needed to characterize biodiversity patterns.",WOS:000170209200015,11,0.8336635020000001,1,ant biodivers in semiarid landscap mosa the consequ of graz vs nat heterog the conserv of biodivers in landscap mosa requir an understand of the impact of hum land us within mosa el and an evalu of the biolog un of diff el we address thes issu by examin pattern of ant divers in three semiarid rangeland landscap us predomin for graz thes landscap lie along a reg grady from shortgrass step through a transit zon to desert grassland along which clim and ant specy composit vary within each landscap we comp the effect of graz and nat vary in soil and veget on ant divers and commun composit graz had littl effect on ant rich divers or composit at the transit zon or the desert grassland sit but ungraz area at the shortgrass step sit had a high overal rich and fav the abund of som specy som sampl of saltbush atriplex canesc shrubland wer simil to ungraz sampl in rich and specy composit in both the transit zon and the desert grassland creosotebush larre tridentat domin habit harb comp specy rich and distinct ant commun in addit mesquit prosop glandulos cop dun at the desert grassland sit fav the abund of sev specy that wer rar across the sit canon correspond analys rev that vary in soil strength and text best explain commun vary at the shortgrass step sit wherea soil text and assocy diff in shrub dens best explain diff in composit at the transit and desert grassland sit the charact of habit bas upon veget class did not adequ reflect environ vary that was import to ant in shortgrass step but reflect import soil text vary in the transit and desert grassland sit thes result suggest that ant conserv in thes semiarid rangeland should emphas pattern of vary in soil property the result ad to a grow consens that a vary of vary determin by the respons of sev foc tax may be nee to charact biodivers pattern,new,0.8528509278568512,0.8035426641662865,0.7679396625637984,0.7413880532262632,0.7206428625516083,0.7039087633898546,0.6901499292789763,0.6787746577302814,0.6695113165909812,0.6624572270415259,0.658626815367714
19,desert,"Soil nematodes associated with different land uses in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Veracruz, Mexico","Modification of above-ground land use leads to many changes in the below-ground rhizosphere. A study was conducted of soil nematodes and their diversity associated with different land uses in the Biosphere Reserve Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Three sites were selected to investigate 4 types of land uses: natural forest, secondary forest, pasture, and maize fields. Total abundance of nematodes and estimators based on generic and diversity indices were assessed and compared between the 4 land uses and sites. Fifty-three families and 124 genera of nematodes were identified from the study area. The dominant families were Criconematidae, Hoplolaimidae, Cephalobidae, and Tylenchidae, and the most abundant genera in this study were Helicotylenchus, Discocriconemella, Tylenchus, Steinernema and Mesocriconema. The greatest nematode abundance, generic richness, and diversity were found in natural forest, closely followed by secondary forest. Intensive (largely monocrop) agricultural systems, represented by maize fields and pasture, had low generic richness and significantly less diversity than non-disturbed systems.

20,desert,Preliminary assessment of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity and community structure in an urban ecosystem,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) species richness, composition, spore density and diversity indices were evaluated in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA at 20 sampling sites selected to represent the four predominant land-use types found in the greater urban area: urban-residential, urban non-residential, agriculture and desert. AMF spores were extracted and identified from soil samples and from trap cultures established using soil collected at each site. Data were analyzed according to land use, land-use history, soil chemistry and vegetation characteristics at each site. Current agricultural sites were associated with decreased spore densities and historically agricultural sites with decreased species richness. Overall species composition was similar to that previously reported for the Sonoran desert, but composition at each sampling site was influenced by the vegetation from which samples were collected. Sites with the highest degrees of similarity in AMF species composition were also similar to each other in native plants or land use. Conversely, sites with the lowest similarity in AMF composition were those from which the majority of samples were collected from non-mycorrhizal plants, predominately ectomycorrhizal plants or bare soil. Spores of Glomus microggregatum were most abundant in urban sites, while those of G. eburneum were most abundant in desert and agricultural sites.

21,desert,Biodiversity of semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands: Impact of grazing and afforestation,"Question: What is the impact of grazing and/or afforestation on grassland diversity, species composition and cover parameters? Location: Semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands of Jordan. Methods: Vegetation. litter, bare soil and rock cover were compared among four management types - free grazing and protected from grazing with three levels of tree cover. Species composition. plant cover, species richness and evenness were used to evaluate differences in vegetation among management types. Species composition differences among management types were also investigated. Results: Semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands harbour appreciable levels of plant biodiversity. Grazing did not affect plant diversity. indicating the high resilience against and adaptation to grazing: however. grazing affected species composition and cover parameters. Afforestation seems to protect soil through higher litter cover but its impact on plant biodiversity was negative and markedly affected species composition. Conclusions: Neither protection from grazing or massive afforestation alone are sufficient for conserving biodiversity in this system. A management model is suggested where the landscape should be maintained as a mosaic of four management types: complete protection from grazing, grazing rotation, planting sparse trees in eroded areas and revegetating degraded areas using native, herbaceous and grazing tolerant species.",WOS:000247766700012,83,0.8313293629999999,1,biodivers of sem arid mediter grassland impact of graz and afforest quest what is the impact of graz and or afforest on grassland divers specy composit and cov paramet loc sem arid mediter grassland of jord method veget lit bar soil and rock cov wer comp among four man typ fre graz and protect from graz with three level of tre cov specy composit plant cov specy rich and ev wer us to evalu diff in veget among man typ specy composit diff among man typ wer also investig result sem arid mediter grassland harbo apprecy level of plant biodivers graz did not affect plant divers ind the high resy against and adapt to graz howev graz affect specy composit and cov paramet afforest seem to protect soil through high lit cov but it impact on plant biodivers was neg and mark affect specy composit conclud neith protect from graz or mass afforest alon ar sufficy for conserv biodivers in thi system a man model is suggest wher the landscap should be maintain as a mosa of four man typ complet protect from graz graz rot plant spars tre in erod area and reveget degrad area us nat herbac and graz tol specy,new,0.8885762134148906,0.8398285393868138,0.8027480358004465,0.7742254558533416,0.7512685503820073,0.732061675275236,0.7154546155300928,0.7006575903926577,0.6870471837643642,0.6739764846051302,0.6604050722629395
22,desert,Medium to large-sized mammals in agricultural landscapes of south-eastern Brazil,"We determined the patterns of distribution and abundance of medium to large-sized mammals on an agricultural landscape in south-eastern Brazil. Here, we discuss some management recommendations to improve the conservation value of agricultural landscapes. From July 2003 to June 2004 we surveyed 284.4 km transects searching for tracks and visualizations of mammals in the main environments of an agricultural landscape in south-eastern Brazil. We recorded 25 native species, two exotic and six domestic species in the area: 23 species on native forest fragments, 19 on sugarcane plantations, 17 on eucalyptus plantations, and 12 on pasture areas. There were significant differences in species richness and frequency of occurrence among these environments. Pasture areas had the lowest species richness and sugarcane plantations the greatest frequency of occurrence. Some species are associated with open areas, whereas other species are associated with forested habitats. Although a considerable part of the original mammal diversity is still present, the community found is predominantly composed of species able to adapt to environmental alterations. Therefore, to improve the conservation value of agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Brazil, the maintenance of native forest fragments is essential, in addition to mitigation measures of the various agricultural impacts.",WOS:000296765400005,14,0.830579634,1,med to larg siz mam in agricult landscap of sou eastern brazil we determin the pattern of distribut and abund of med to larg siz mam on an agricult landscap in sou eastern brazil her we discuss som man recommend to improv the conserv valu of agricult landscap from july to jun we survey km transect search for track and vis of mam in the main environ of an agricult landscap in sou eastern brazil we record nat specy two exot and six domest specy in the are specy on nat forest frag on sugarc plant on eucalypt plant and on past area ther wer sign diff in specy rich and frequ of occur among thes environ past area had the lowest specy rich and sugarc plant the greatest frequ of occur som specy ar assocy with op area wherea oth specy ar assocy with forest habit although a consid part of the origin mam divers is stil pres the commun found is predomin compos of specy abl to adapt to environ alt theref to improv the conserv valu of agricult landscap in sou eastern brazil the maint of nat forest frag is ess in addit to mitig meas of the vary agricult impact,new,0.8379658221764296,0.8133688148225393,0.7989920665662391,0.7901416973276755,0.7846222173441376,0.7814629466207818,0.7802619154486607,0.7809995115709671,0.7840754724516384,0.7907071513676427,0.8044763671339253
23,desert,"Structure and organization of rodent assembles of a forest of the Sierra Madre Occidental, Durango, Mexico","Biodiversity of temperate forests in the mountain region called ""Sierra Madre"", at western Mexico, is rich. This zone lies in the Transition Zone, a biogeographical important area of North America characterized by a remarkable local environmental heterogeneity. However, little is known about the taxonomic composition, and organization of the assemblage of native small mammal, and the influence of local ecological factors, particularly from different vegetation types. Therefore, we were interested in documenting the species composition and structure of the small mammal assemblages of this sierra and provide insights into the nesting level of the Community and deviations from a random organization. The study area was a place named ""El Durangueno"" ranch, Durango, Mexico. Three different vegetation types (grassland, and oak-pine and pine-oak forests) were sampled there during every season of 2005 to 2006. During three consecutive nights rodents of each site were captured, recaptured, and taxonomically identified. Results produced 520 individuals (386 captures, 134 recaptures) of 18 small mammal species (14 mice, four squirrels) of different body sizes that represent neartic. neotropical, or shared affinity; endemicity of taxa was found as well as taxa in some extinction risk category. Species richness and eveness were high and the diversity and population levels were moderate. although high density of small mammals highlights oak-pine forest whereas dominance of some species occurs in pine-oak forest perhaps due to disturbance. Spatial pattern of medium-size species was not at random. Assemble of species revealed a non-nested pattern and displayed a log-normal distribution, characterized by four common and widely distributed rodent species (Peromyscus truei, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys montanus, and Sigmodon leucotis), and seven of restricted distribution. On the other hand, several species were allocated to different trophic-niche guilds, as revealed by their reported food preferences, that were composed by up to two dominant species by site. In conclusion, the small mammal assemblage of forests of Sierra Madre is distinctive and diverse, is not structured at random and vegetation may be one of the ecological factors that have played an important evolutionary role.",WOS:000274063100007,322,0.828246907,0,structure and org of rod assembl of a forest of the sierr madr occid durango mexico biodivers of temp forest in the mountain reg cal sierr madr at western mexico is rich thi zon lie in the transit zon a biogeograph import are of nor americ charact by a remark loc environ heterog howev littl is known about the taxonom composit and org of the assembl of nat smal mam and the influ of loc ecolog fact particul from diff veget typ theref we wer interest in docu the specy composit and structure of the smal mam assembl of thi sierr and provid insight into the nest level of the commun and devy from a random org the study are was a plac nam el durangueno ranch durango mexico three diff veget typ grassland and oak pin and pin oak forest wer sampl ther dur every season of to dur three consecut night rod of each sit wer capt recapt and taxonom ident result produc individ capt recapt of smal mam specy mic four squirrel of diff body siz that repres neart neotrop or shar affin endem of tax was found as wel as tax in som extinct risk categ specy rich and ev wer high and the divers and pop level wer mod although high dens of smal mam highlight oak pin forest wherea domin of som specy occ in pin oak forest perhap due to disturb spat pattern of med siz specy was not at random assembl of specy rev a non nest pattern and display a log norm distribut charact by four common and wid distribut rod specy peromysc true p maniculat reithrodontom montan and sigmodon leucot and sev of restrict distribut on the oth hand sev specy wer alloc to diff troph nich guild as rev by their report food pref that wer compos by up to two domin specy by sit in conclud the smal mam assembl of forest of sierr madr is distinct and divers is not structured at random and veget may be on of the ecolog fact that hav play an import evolv rol,new,0.838403357199207,0.771985432372027,0.7237882053163859,0.6886140036462081,0.6618398916735788,0.6407776199354718,0.6239096527107169,0.6104384289362061,0.6001168073321447,0.593439080152892,0.5928233209447556
24,desert,Effects of past and present land use on vegetation cover and regeneration in a tropical dryland forest,"Brazilian Caatinga is one of the most diverse dryland ecosystem of the world and is threatened by strong land use pressure and poor protection. In this study, we investigate the effects of past and present land use on plant community richness and structure. We used satellite information to identify 55 Caatinga forest plots with and without past vegetation clearing. We also quantified current land use, i.e. grazing by domestic animals, and selective logging. Caatinga vegetation structure, measured as vegetation cover, vegetation height, basal area and woody plant density, as well as recruitment, measured as woody plant seedling density and species richness, were negatively affected by both past and current land use. Past clear-cut not only had strong effects on most vegetation measures, but also increased current grazing which further negatively affected vegetation structure. Selective logging had little measurable effects but increased recruitment in plots previously clear-cut. Increasing time since the last clear-cut increased negative effects on vegetation, presumably because of a prolonged negative effect of grazing. Our results suggest that grazing needs to be prevented in areas degraded by clear-cut to allow vegetation restoration through natural succession and avoid further degradation and desertification.

25,desert,Do live fences help conserve butterfly diversity in agricultural landscapes?,"Do live fences help conserve butterfly diversity in agricultural landscapes? In Central America, natural forests have been transformed into agriculture production areas, generating forest fragmentation, desertification, erosion and loss of biodiversity, among other concerns. Different tree cover compositions are kept on these agricultural landscapes, including scattered trees in pastures, live fences, fragments of secondary forests, and riparian forests. These can help in biodiversity conservation because they generate shelter, feeding and reproduction areas, among others. We studied the composition, richness and abundance of diurnal butterflies on two types of live fences in a landscape where pastures are predominant in Costa Rica's Central Pacific Region. Transects (120x5m) were observed for an hour (two days/habitat) in five multi-strata fences (with several plant species, strata and canopy width) and five simple fences (with smaller and pruned trees). A total of 2 782 butterflies were observed (75 species). The most abundant species were Anartia fatima, Eurema daria, Eurema nise, Hermeuptychia hermes, Junonia evarete and Phoebis philea. Multi-strata fences had more species and can help maintain 56% of the total species observed in secondary and riparian forests. This type of live fence can play an important role in butterfly conservation in livestock areas, and its benefits are influenced by the manner in which farmers manage their land. Rev. Biol.

27,desert,Non-linear effect of habitat fragmentation on plant diversity: Evidence from a sand dune field in a desertified grassland in northeastern China,"Although a large number of empirical studies have documented the effect of habitat fragmentation on plant diversity, we are far from being able to draw effective conclusions due to a lack of a proper reference point and a large range of patch size. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the effect of habitat fragmentation on plant diversity is non-linear, i.e. there is a shift in the effect of habitat fragmentation on plant diversity from positive to negative (or from negative to positive) with intensifying fragmentation. A sand dune field in a desertified grassland in eastern Inner Mongolia, China, was used as the study site. Eighteen fragmented plots (inter-dune lowlands in the sand dune) and 14 continuous plots (different sizes of grassland) were selected. Plant diversity was estimated by species richness, functional groups and rare species. Logarithmic, power and exponential functions were used to analyze the relationship of species richness, frequency and abundance and plot area. There was a shift from positive to negative in the relationship between habitat fragmentation and species richness with the intensifying fragmentation. The number of plant functional groups increased due to habitat fragmentation, and different functional groups showed distinct responses to the degree of fragmentation. The effect of habitat fragmentation on rare species richness is non-linear, and the effect of habitat fragmentation on rare species population is negative. Our results indicate: (1) thresholds should be taken into consideration when drawing up plant diversity conservation plans; and (2) a single large reserve and several small reserves have different implications in plant diversity conservation.

38,desert,Effects of open grazing and livestock exclusion on floristic composition and diversity in natural ecosystem of Western Saudi Arabia,"Livestock grazing is one of the main causes of rangeland degradation in Saudi Arabia. Fencing to exclude grazers is one of the main management practices used to restore vegetation and conserve biodiversity. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the changes in plant diversity and abundance, floristic composition and plant groups of the major life forms in response to thirty-five years of grazing exclosure in western Saudi Arabia. These vegetation attributes and palatability were compared in 30 sampling stands located in the excluded and grazed sites. Our results showed that livestock exclusion significantly increased covers, density and species richness of annuals, grasses, perennial forbs, shrubs and trees. Exclosure enhanced the abundance and richness of palatable species and depressed the development of weedy species. About 66.7% of the recorded species at the excluded site were highly palatable compared to 34.5% at the grazed site. In contrary, about 55.2% unpalatable species were found in the grazed site compared to 25.8% in the protected site. Jaccard's similarity index between the excluded and grazed sites showed lower values of 0.39%, 0.40% and 0.31% at levels of families, genus and species, respectively. The results suggest that establishing livestock exclusion may be a useful sustainable management tool for vegetation restoration and conservation of plant diversity in degraded rangelands of arid regions.

59,desert,Introduction of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) into Western Europe: Epigaeic arthropods in intermediate-aged pure stands in northwestern Germany,"Epigaeic arthropods were studied in intermediate-aged pure plantations of the exotic American Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and of European sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.), which had both been established after forest clear-cuts. Studies took place in two blocks in a forest in northwestern Lower Saxony, Germany. Pitfall trapping throughout the vegetation period of 2004 delivered quantitative data for epigaeic macro-arthropods. Communities of ants (Formicidae), ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and spiders (Araneae) were studied in further detail. Several differences in catch numbers, species richness and structure of communities became obvious between the studied stands and are partially interpreted as effects of the different tree cover. As far as environmental factors are concerned, the studied Douglas fir stands showed a high cover of mosses and needle litter, a low weed cover, and a higher soil acidity as compared to the sessile oak plantations. Activity of isopods and diplopods was significantly higher within Douglas fir stands than in those of sessile oak, whereas activity of ants, carabids and weevils was lower in the plantations of this exotic tree species. For all three taxa studied in detail, the numbers of exclusively recorded species were higher in oak stands. Except for wolf spiders (Lycosidae), spider communities of sessile oak sustained to a certain degree in the Douglas fir plantations. On the other hand, communities of ants and carabids were quantitatively impoverished under Douglas fir. Overall, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and cluster analysis showed that the communities of all three taxa in focus were strongly altered by treatment and by area, with treatment prevailing over area. Furthermore, we expected especially carabid communities to recruit individuals continuously from the surrounding deciduous forests. With some reservations resulting from the few replicates studied we conclude, that (1) intermediate-aged pure Douglas fir plantations are no biodiversity deserts as a broad spectrum of epigaeic arthropods persists in the plantations, at least, when these are small.-sized. Furthermore, we conclude that (2) afforestation with exotic Douglas fir leads to conspicuous changes in epigaeic invertebrate communities as compared to autochthonous, deciduous forests of the same age class. Recommendations for forestry using Douglas fir and aimed at conserving biodiversity include the restriction of Douglas fir to recent and new forests, to avoid pure and dense stands, as well as to limit the total area stocked.

130,desert,Landscape level patterns of grasshopper communities in Inner Mongolia: interactive effects of livestock grazing and a precipitation gradient,"Grasshoppers are a dominant herbivore assemblage globally and play an important role for ecosystem nutrient cycling. Yet, we lack a strong understanding of the relationship between grasshopper diversity and plant community composition at the landscape scale. Our aim was to test landscape scale relationships between plant and grasshopper communities. We used a large-scale, replicated experiment at four sites, including grazed and protected pastures across a 350 km transect and 200-400 mm precipitation gradient in the steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We analyzed the relationships between plant and grasshopper parameters with ANOVAs and CCA. We collected 17 grasshopper species and 15,000+ individuals. The desert steppe (lowest precipitation) had the lowest grasshopper richness and diversity, but abundance was not different from the other sites. In two dry sites (desert steppe and Stipa steppe), livestock grazing decreased grasshopper diversity and increased abundance of the main pest species. In contrast, at the highest precipitation site (meadow steppe), grasshopper communities did not differ between grazing levels. Across all sites and grazing intensities, grasshopper abundance tended to be lowest and diversity highest in plant communities with intermediate levels of biomass and plant species richness. These results support the concept that appropriate land use management practices would be beneficial for increasing biodiversity, promoting grassland sustainability, and reducing outbreaks of the dominant pest grasshopper in Inner Mongolia. Our study suggests that different management approaches are necessary depending on the average annual precipitation and that the driest sites are most vulnerable to disturbance.",WOS:000361903500007,10,0.7526921059999999,1,landscap level pattern of grasshop commun in in mongol interact effect of livestock graz and a precipit grady grasshop ar a domin herb assembl glob and play an import rol for ecosystem nutry cyc yet we lack a strong understand of the rel between grasshop divers and plant commun composit at the landscap scal our aim was to test landscap scal rel between plant and grasshop commun we us a larg scal reply expery at four sit includ graz and protect past across a km transect and mm precipit grady in the step of in mongol chin we analys the rel between plant and grasshop paramet with anova and cca we collect grasshop specy and individ the desert step lowest precipit had the lowest grasshop rich and divers but abund was not diff from the oth sit in two dry sit desert step and stip step livestock graz decreas grasshop divers and increas abund of the main pest specy in contrast at the highest precipit sit meadow step grasshop commun did not diff between graz level across al sit and graz intens grasshop abund tend to be lowest and divers highest in plant commun with intermedy level of biomass and plant specy rich thes result support the conceiv that appropry land us man pract would be benef for increas biodivers promot grassland sustain and reduc outbreak of the domin pest grasshop in in mongol our study suggest that diff man approach ar necess depend on the av an precipit and that the driest sit ar most vuln to disturb,new,0.7805672891267198,0.7288544732570312,0.6962312515428741,0.67449097745598,0.6593972678894755,0.6489828655641608,0.6423548209075504,0.6392982650940711,0.6403268954664971,0.6472926226611458,0.6658868757347606

Spatiotemporal patterns of saprophagous Copestylum (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in different cactus species richness have not yet been studied, although seasonal changes and plant species richness have been shown to strongly impact the diversity and distribution of many insect communities in scrublands. We analyzed the impact of seasonality and of habitat type (disturbed and undisturbed) on Copestylum communities reared from cactus species at the Barranca de Metztitlan Biosphere Reserve, in central Mexico, by comparing their community structure between seasons and habitats, and assessing the contribution of diversity components for the total diversity of this genus. We also measured patterns of temporal niche overlap among hoverfly species considering their breeding medium. Seasonal variation influenced Copestylum community composition most significantly. Species richness and abundance of Copestylum were higher in the rainy season. Additive partitioning of diversity showed that the main component for species richness is beta diversity between seasons. We detected high niche overlap during the dry season and low overlap during the rainy season.

191,desert,"Urban and wildland herpetofauna communities and riparian microhabitats along the Salt River, Arizona","Metropolitan areas are continually expanding, resulting in increasing impacts on ecosystems. Worldwide, riverine floodplains are among the most endangered landscapes and are often the focus of restoration activities. Amphibians and reptiles have valuable ecological roles in ecosystems, and promoting their abundance and diversity when rehabilitating riparian systems can contribute to reestablishing degraded ecosystem functions. We evaluated the herpetofauna community by measuring abundance, richness, diversity, and species-habitat relations along three reaches (wildland, urban rehabilitated, and urban disturbed reaches) varying in degree of urbanization and rehabilitation along the Salt River in central Arizona. We performed visual surveys for herpetofauna and quantified riparian microhabitat along eight transects per reach. The wildland reach had the greatest herpetofauna species richness and diversity, and had similar abundance compared to the urban rehabilitated reach. The urban disturbed reach had the lowest herpetofauna abundance and species richness, and had a similar diversity compared to the urban rehabilitated reach. Principal Component Analysis reduced 21 microhabitat variables to five factors which described habitat differences among reaches. Vegetation structural complexity, vegetation species richness, densities of Prosopis (mesquite), Salix (willow), Populus (cottonwood), and animal burrow density had a positive correlation with at least one herpetofauna community parameter, and had a positive correlation with abundance of at least one lizard species. Rehabilitation activities positively influenced herpetofauna abundance and species richness; whereas, urbanization negatively influenced herpetofauna diversity. Based on herpetofauna-microhabitat associations, we recommend urban natural resource managers increase vegetation structural complexity and woody debris to improve herpetofauna habitat when rehabilitating degraded riparian systems.",WOS:000304241400011,15,0.71962803,1,urb and wildland herpetofaun commun and rip microhabit along the salt riv arizon metropolit area ar contin expand result in increas impact on ecosystem worldwid riverin floodplain ar among the most endang landscap and ar oft the foc of rest act amphib and reptil hav valu ecolog rol in ecosystem and promot their abund and divers when rehabilit rip system can contribut to reest degrad ecosystem funct we evalu the herpetofaun commun by meas abund rich divers and specy habit rel along three reach wildland urb rehabilit and urb disturb reach vary in degr of urb and rehabilit along the salt riv in cent arizon we perform vis survey for herpetofaun and quant rip microhabit along eight transect per reach the wildland reach had the greatest herpetofaun specy rich and divers and had simil abund comp to the urb rehabilit reach the urb disturb reach had the lowest herpetofaun abund and specy rich and had a simil divers comp to the urb rehabilit reach princip compon analys reduc microhabit vary to fiv fact which describ habit diff among reach veget structural complex veget specy rich dens of prosop mesquit salix willow popul cottonwood and anim burrow dens had a posit correl with at least on herpetofaun commun paramet and had a posit correl with abund of at least on lizard specy rehabilit act posit influ herpetofaun abund and specy rich wherea urb neg influ herpetofaun divers bas on herpetofaun microhabit assocy we recommend urb nat resourc man increas veget structural complex and woody debr to improv herpetofaun habit when rehabilit degrad rip system,new,0.7354680573862945,0.7093619433850697,0.6960059051669795,0.6895481544308922,0.6874846656940788,0.6888056012224116,0.6932459003633408,0.7010972827652847,0.7133928666181238,0.7326841254025424,0.7657362858044291
211,desert,Assessing the Use of Functional Diversity as a Measure of Ecological Resilience in Arid Rangelands,"It is becoming more apparent that species richness alone many not be sufficient to fully understand ecosystem resilience but that functional diversity (diversity of species having similar effects on an ecosystem process) may be more relevant. In particular, response diversity (diversity of species that respond differently to disturbance) within functional groups (FG) is suggested to be critical for resilience. We assess for the first time the use of response diversity as a measure of resilience in an empirical study. Our experimental design consisted of sites with three disturbance intensities during a grazing exclosure period and the same sites, 1 year later, after grazing. Plant FGs were identified based on effect traits related to nutrient cycling and soil retention, and species richness within groups was assessed during exclosure and after grazing. To assess if response diversity could predict loss of species richness (resilience analysis), response diversity was calculated only during the exclosure period, based on traits related to grazing tolerance. We also assessed the contribution of richness to response diversity during exclosure (redundancy analysis). Response diversity was significantly and highly correlated with species richness within FGs during disturbance. That is, FGs with the lowest response diversity were the most affected, disappearing when disturbance appeared. Richness within FGs during exclosure was not significantly correlated with response diversity, showing that higher richness does not ensure resilience. We conclude that response diversity can be used to predict which FGs are more resilient, and hence, less vulnerable to future disturbance.",WOS:000300144100010,13,0.710246374,0,assess the us of funct divers as a meas of ecolog resy in arid rangeland it is becom mor app that specy rich alon many not be sufficy to ful understand ecosystem resy but that funct divers divers of specy hav simil effect on an ecosystem process may be mor relev in particul respons divers divers of specy that respond diff to disturb within funct group fg is suggest to be crit for resy we assess for the first tim the us of respons divers as a meas of resy in an empir study our expery design consist of sit with three disturb intens dur a graz exclos period and the sam sit year lat aft graz plant fgs wer ident bas on effect trait rel to nutry cyc and soil ret and specy rich within group was assess dur exclos and aft graz to assess if respons divers could predict loss of specy rich resy analys respons divers was calc on dur the exclos period bas on trait rel to graz tol we also assess the contribut of rich to respons divers dur exclos redund analys respons divers was sign and high correl with specy rich within fgs dur disturb that is fgs with the lowest respons divers wer the most affect disappear when disturb appear rich within fgs dur exclos was not sign correl with respons divers show that high rich doe not ens resy we conclud that respons divers can be us to predict which fgs ar mor resy and hent less vuln to fut disturb,new,0.759246890507343,0.700962897096733,0.6645649402173065,0.6403766219564229,0.623634962814984,0.6121492787025763,0.6049290229928407,0.6017396780331812,0.6031616069641759,0.6112680614996217,0.632331440639765
436,desert,Impact of Fencing and Irrigation on Species Composition and Diversity of Desert Plant Communities in the United Arab Emirates,"Grazing and water are among the most important factors influencing community structure and productivity in natural rangelands. Little is known about the independent effects of grazing and water and their interaction on plant community structure and productivity in rangelands of the arid Arab Gulf deserts. Paired sampling plots were used to compare plant species composition, diversity and plant abundances and sizes inside and outside 14-month irrigated and 30-month non-irrigated exclosures constructed during dry years on sandy dunes of the arid Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve. The results showed that the negative impacts of high grazing pressures on plant productivity (plant sizes and abundances) and diversity were stronger in the non-irrigated sites. Both irrigation (IR) and protection (PR) enhanced plant diversity and productivity of the overgrazed degraded Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve. The combined effects of PR and IR resulted in the occurrence of a total of 22 species inside the irrigated exclosures; however, none of them appeared in the irrigated grazed sites. Eighteen palatable species occurred inside, but not outside, the irrigated exclosures. Chamaephytes, which are more sensitive to human and animal disturbances, recovered more than other life forms under PR and IR. Dipterygium glaucum showed a great potential to be used for restoration projects under water IR in the Arab Gulf deserts. It is concluded that grazing and water independently affected plant diversity and productivity, but the relative role of grazing is more important than that of water in conserving desert plants, especially the palatable ones.

480,desert,Sympatry and allopatry in two desert ant sister species: how do Cataglyphis bicolor and C-savignyi coexist?,"Two extremely morphologically similar sister species of desert ants, Cataglyphis bicolor and C. savignyi, exhibit broadly overlapping distributional ranges within Tunisia. In order to analyse the microhabitats of C. bicolor and C. savignyi within the sympatric and allopatric areas of both ant species, the plant species located at 113 different nest sites of the two ant species were determined. In the sympatric area, the two species exhibit a clear-cut nest site segregation. This is not the case in the allopatric areas. Hence the two species differentiate their microhabitat only when they are sympatric. The plant species associated mainly with the nest sites of C. bicolor indicate that this species prefers a type of vegetation that needs irrigation. This is in contrast to the nest sites of C. savignyi, which are usually found around plants that characterize typical dry steppe areas. As the ants' foraging paths recorded in the sympatric area reveal, C. bicolor performs significantly shorter foraging runs with respect to both length and time, and covers a much smaller foraging range than C. savignyi does. This result reflects the fact that the microhabitat occupied by the colonies of C. bicolor is richer in food abundance. When direct interspecific interactions were investigated by placing a bait midway between two heterospecific nests, C. bicolor foragers dominated over those of C. savignyi. The same dominance of C. bicolor over C. savignyi occurred in laboratory experiments. These results suggest that the dominant species drives the subordinate one out of the high quality microhabitats, and that the subordinate species is forced to survive in the less lucrative habitats. In conclusion, coexistence seems to be maintained by the asymmetric competitive relationship between the two species and the fact that the subordinate species has the ability to endure in the less favourable microhabitat.",WOS:000183638000007,5,0.626521759,0,sympatry and allopatry in two desert ant sist specy how do cataglyph bicol and c savigny coex two extrem morpholog simil sist specy of desert ant cataglyph bicol and c savigny exhibit broad overlap distribut rang within tunis in ord to analys the microhabit of c bicol and c savigny within the symp and allop area of both ant specy the plant specy loc at diff nest sit of the two ant specy wer determin in the symp are the two specy exhibit a clear cut nest sit segreg thi is not the cas in the allop area hent the two specy differenty their microhabit on when they ar symp the plant specy assocy main with the nest sit of c bicol ind that thi specy pref a typ of veget that nee irrig thi is in contrast to the nest sit of c savigny which ar us found around plant that charact typ dry step area as the ant for path record in the symp are rev c bicol perform sign short for run with respect to both leng and tim and cov a much smal for rang than c savigny doe thi result reflect the fact that the microhabit occupy by the colony of c bicol is rich in food abund when direct interspec interact wer investig by plac a bait midway between two heterospec nest c bicol for domin ov thos of c savigny the sam domin of c bicol ov c savigny occur in lab expery thes result suggest that the domin specy driv the subordin on out of the high qual microhabit and that the subordin specy is forc to surv in the less lucr habit in conclud coex seem to be maintain by the asymmet competit rel between the two specy and the fact that the subordin specy has the abl to end in the less favo microhabit,new,0.6383766040716715,0.5965501120938612,0.574688571624825,0.5634758446922097,0.5589379089643854,0.5595026079209836,0.5647987890242684,0.5753627579235636,0.5929811480768838,0.6220602948931773,0.6742498734207123

1094,desert,"Selection of foraging sites by desert granivorous birds: Vegetation structure, seed availability, species-specific foraging tactics, and spatial scale","Seed availability in the algarrobal of the Monte desert, Argentina, as in other deserts, is highly heterogeneous at small scales and is associated with vegetation structure. Granivores are expected to use space selectively (within the capacities of their foraging techniques), resulting in a heterogeneous effect on the seed bank. First, we describe the foraging repertoire of granivorous birds in the algarrobal to develop predictions about their expected use of space. Although the granivory guild as a whole tracked the temporal availability of seeds, species within the guild differed in foraging behavior and seasonal changes. We assessed selection of space by foraging birds through a two-scale bird-centered analysis, comparing the distributions of used and available sites. Granivorous birds, considered as a guild, used the whole range of available microsites, though as a result of an aggregation of contrasting partial patterns. Microsites with more cover of shrubs, grasses, and litter were preferred for predispersal consumption, which is consistent with the frequent technique of attacking grasses from low woody perches. By contrast, use of microsites for postdispersal consumption did not differ from random, which suggests that there are no safe microsites for seeds in this habitat.

However, relatively little is known about phylogeography of the iconic endemic palm species of this region. We therefore analyzed a total of 2,294 bp of chloroplast and 738 bp of nuclear sequence data in 169 samples of five native palm species from Baja California, Sonora and Guadalupe Island. We found that Washingtonia and Brahea palms had low levels of genetic diversity and were highly structured, with the majority of species and major geographic regions being characterized by distinct haplotypes. We also found strong support for currently recognized species in Washingtonia, but our results were less clear cut for Brahea due to haplotype sharing. Furthermore, patterns of population structure were broadly consistent with historical vicariant events such as the inundation of the Isthmus of La Paz, the formation of the Sea of Cortez, and the more recent colonization and isolation of Guadalupe Island's palms.

1,floodgrass,Habitat and landscape attributes influencing spider assemblages at lowland forest river valley (Hungary),"The lower Tisza valley in the Hungarian Great Plain consists mainly of small patches of semi-natural grassland and forest fragments embedded in a matrix of agricultural fields. We tested the effect of landscape and habitat attributes on the structure of spider assemblages. The fieldwork was carried out in nine forest fragments within two regions in the southern part of the Hungarian Great Plain, near the river Tisza. The epigeic spider fauna was collected with pitfall traps. The traps were arranged in three groups of five traps at each fragment. Landscape attributes had the strongest effect on spider species composition at the scales between 250 and 750 m, with a peak at 500 m buffer. Spider species composition differed between regularly flooded and non-flooded fragments. Vegetation cover and the proportion of neighboring forests had significant effect on the rarefaction diversity of spiders. Flooding, soil moisture, vegetation cover, and the proportion of forests within 500 m buffer significantly affected spider assemblages. Our results suggest that both habitat and landscape attributes affected spider species richness and composition in lower Tisza valley.

31,floodgrass,Are both agricultural intensification and farmland abandonment threats to biodiversity? A test with bird communities in paddy-dominated landscapes,"Land-use changes, including agricultural intensification and farmland abandonment, influence biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. However, few studies have focused on how the two major land-use changes affect different types of species at landscape scales. This study examined the relationships between the richness and abundance of five bird groups (agricultural wetland species, agricultural land species, grassland species, edge species, and woodland species) as well as the total species richness and abundance, and intensification or abandonment in 28 square, 100-ha grid cells in paddy-dominated landscapes in the Tone River basin of central Japan. Rice-field intensification and abandonment were not completely segregated spatially: intensification occurred in both plain and hilly areas surrounded by forests, while abandonment tended to occur in hilly areas. The effects of intensification and abandonment differed among species groups and between seasons. The richness or abundance of agricultural wetland species in summer were negatively associated with both intensification and abandonment. While the abundance of agricultural land species in winter and grassland species in both seasons were positively associated with intensification and abandonment, respectively. The total species richness and abundance did not show clear association with intensification and abandonment due to a variety of responses of the five bird groups. Based on prefectural Red Data Books, agricultural wetland species, followed by grassland species, were more threatened than other three groups in both summer and winter. This study found that (1) the diversity of habitats (including consolidated and abandoned farmlands) provides buffer areas for the different bird groups on different times of the year and (2) agricultural wetland species that use flooded rice fields in summer, such as egrets and shorebirds, are particularly threatened by both intensification and abandonment.

42,floodgrass,"Relative influence of size, connectivity and disturbance history on plant species richness and assemblages in fragmented grasslands","Questions: What is the relative influence of size, connectivity and disturbance history on plant species richness and assemblages of fragmented grasslands? What is the contribution of small fragments to the conservation of native species pool of the region? Location: Tandilia's Range, Southern Pampa, Argentina. Methods: Cover of plants was registered within 24 fragments of tall-tussock grassland remnants within an agricultural landscape using modified Whittaker nested sampling. We analysed the influence of site variables related to disturbance history (canopy height, litter thickness) and fragment variables (size, connectivity) on species richness (asymptotic species richness, slope of the species-area curve) as well as on species assemblages by multiple regressions analysis and canonical correspondence analyses, respectively. Cumulative area was used for analysing whether small fragments or large fragments are more important to species diversity in the landscape. Results: Asymptotic species richness was significantly influenced by site variables, in particular by Paspalum quadrifarium's canopy height, but not by fragment variables. Species assemblages were also affected by site variables (12.2% of total variation), but no additional portion of the species assemblage variability was significantly explained by fragment size and connectivity. Sampling of several small fragments rendered more exotic and native species than sampling of few large fragments of the same total area. Conclusions: Our results agree with previous studies reporting low sensitivity of species diversity to size and isolation of grassland fragments in fragmented landscapes and high sensitivity of species diversity to local variables. The higher capture of regional native species pool by small grassland fragments than by few larger ones of equivalent accumulated area highlights the value of small fragments for conservation.",WOS:000287863600004,43,0.8727486520000001,1,rel influ of siz connect and disturb hist on plant specy rich and assembl in frag grassland quest what is the rel influ of siz connect and disturb hist on plant specy rich and assembl of frag grassland what is the contribut of smal frag to the conserv of nat specy pool of the reg loc tandil s rang southern pamp argentin method cov of plant was reg within frag of tal tussock grassland remn within an agricult landscap us mod whittak nest sampl we analys the influ of sit vary rel to disturb hist canop height lit thick and frag vary siz connect on specy rich asymptot specy rich slop of the specy are curv as wel as on specy assembl by multipl regress analys and canon correspond analys respect cum are was us for analys wheth smal frag or larg frag ar mor import to specy divers in the landscap result asymptot specy rich was sign influ by sit vary in particul by paspal quadrifar s canop height but not by frag vary specy assembl wer also affect by sit vary of tot vary but no addit port of the specy assembl vary was sign explain by frag siz and connect sampl of sev smal frag rend mor exot and nat specy than sampl of few larg frag of the sam tot are conclud our result agr with prevy study report low sensit of specy divers to siz and isol of grassland frag in frag landscap and high sensit of specy divers to loc vary the high capt of reg nat specy pool by smal grassland frag than by few larg on of equ accum are highlight the valu of smal frag for conserv,new,0.9009992234499792,0.8653116978549379,0.8386410604704343,0.8178678053397676,0.8007386570756251,0.7859592960043591,0.7726929714628026,0.7603157189114037,0.7482033470962529,0.7354389248561446,0.7200093088368421
51,floodgrass,Species richness and composition of amphibians and reptiles in a fragmented forest landscape in northeastern Bolivia,"We quantified patterns of species richness and species composition of frogs and reptiles (lizards and snakes) among three habitats (Continuous forest, forest islands, and a seasonally flooded savannah) and between forest island size and isolation classes in a floristic transition zone in northeastern Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia. Species richness was similar across macrohabitats, as was faunal composition of forested habitats, although savannah harbored a distinct herpetofauna. On forest islands, richness and composition of forest Frogs was largely related to isolation, whereas reptiles were affected by both isolation and habitat. The observation that isolation rather than area was the primary driver of distribution patterns on forest islands stands in contrast to many studies, and may be a function Of (1) the greater range in forest island isolation values compared to area or (2) the long history of isolation in tills landscape.

61,floodgrass,Grassland area determines beetle assemblage dissimilarity from surrounding floodplain forest,"Patch size is known to affect biodiversity in fragmented landscapes, but is usually examined in systems where the surrounding matrix habitat is unfavourable. We examined beetle diversity in a floodplain ecosystem that is characterised by naturally occurring grassland patches within a dominant matrix of contrasting yet habitable forest. We asked whether differences in the beetle assemblage between grassland and forest vegetation depended on the area of the grassland patch, which is a function of its flooding frequency and duration: smaller grasslands tend to be higher on the floodplain and are flooded less often and for shorter periods than larger grasslands. We found a negative relationship between grassland area and beetle abundance and species richness, and a positive relationship between grassland area and compositional dissimilarity from the surrounding forest. As expected, we found an overall difference in composition between forest and grassland assemblages, with five beetle species more common in the grasslands. Our study indicates that floodplain grasslands not only support beetle assemblages that are distinct from the surrounding forest, but that assemblages from the larger grasslands are compositionally more distinct than those from smaller grasslands. A likely cause of this pattern is the reduced edge effects and greater environmental contrast between forest and large grasslands that may be exposed to greater variation in local climate. Ongoing changes to flood regimes and potential encroachment of forest plants may decrease grassland area in the future, which may reduce spatial heterogeneity in the insect community in this unique floodplain ecosystem.",WOS:000327897200014,27,0.856037541,0,grassland are determin beetl assembl dissimil from surround floodplain forest patch siz is known to affect biodivers in frag landscap but is us examin in system wher the surround matrix habit is unfavo we examin beetl divers in a floodplain ecosystem that is charact by nat occur grassland patch within a domin matrix of contrast yet habit forest we ask wheth diff in the beetl assembl between grassland and forest veget depend on the are of the grassland patch which is a funct of it flood frequ and dur smal grassland tend to be high on the floodplain and ar flood less oft and for short period than larg grassland we found a neg rel between grassland are and beetl abund and specy rich and a posit rel between grassland are and composit dissimil from the surround forest as expect we found an overal diff in composit between forest and grassland assembl with fiv beetl specy mor common in the grassland our study ind that floodplain grassland not on support beetl assembl that ar distinct from the surround forest but that assembl from the larg grassland ar composit mor distinct than thos from smal grassland a lik caus of thi pattern is the reduc edg effect and gre environ contrast between forest and larg grassland that may be expos to gre vary in loc clim ongo chang to flood regim and pot encroach of forest plant may decreas grassland are in the fut which may reduc spat heterog in the insect commun in thi un floodplain ecosystem,new,0.8545265478408307,0.7656101682014945,0.6926355817931319,0.636630465937573,0.593184094710876,0.5587042957578128,0.5308116801996862,0.5080595897359066,0.48966887971384954,0.47561414251858175,0.46747580205696365
71,floodgrass,"Agricultural management and flooding shape habitats for non-native earthworms in southern Quebec, Canada","Agricultural intensification leading to the cultivation of unmanaged field margins along rivers and streams is expected to impact soil biodiversity. Earthworm communities are typically smaller with fewer species in agricultural soils, but the effect of agriculture on earthworms could be mitigated by the more favorable soil moisture regime in riparian areas, as well as planting perennial grasses or keeping forest fragments as permanently vegetated buffers. The objective of this study was to compare earthworm community composition under contrasting land use (agricultural vs. riparian forest) similar to 5 m and similar to 30 m away from the Pike River in southern Quebec, Canada. Furthermore, we evaluated how earthworm communities were affected by management intensity, flooding, soil and vegetation patterns within these land uses. We established 4 transects at 3 sites along the Pike River representing 4 land uses (agricultural field, agricultural buffer, riparian forest fragment, upland forest fragment). Along each transect, earthworm populations and soil properties were evaluated at 5 discrete points on 4 occasions from fall 2009 to spring 2011. Vegetation cover and plant species richness were measured, and management and flooding intensity were documented through farmer surveys. Earthworm abundance and diversity were highest in a riparian forest transect (460 individuals m(-2), 9 species) and agricultural buffer (325 individuals m(-2), 10 species), and lowest in the agricultural fields with annual crop rotations and agrochemical inputs, which also had the lowest plant diversity. Redundancy analysis revealed that differences in earthworm species compositions across the study area were linked to site-specific management and flooding, represented by differences in soil moisture, vegetation diversity, and soil nutrient concentrations (dissolved organic carbon in soil solution, mineral nitrogen, extractable phosphorus). Generalized linear mixed modeling also showed that less intensively managed agricultural buffers and forest fragments with regular flooding supported higher earthworm diversity. We recommend further research on soil functions affected by earthworms in riparian areas because these non-native earthworms could affect the conservation value of unmanaged agricultural buffers and forest fragments in southern Quebec, Canada.

81,floodgrass,Enriching plant diversity in grasslands by large-scale experimental sward disturbance and seed addition along gradients of land-use intensity,"Aims The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is among the most active areas of ecological research. Furthermore, enhancing the diversity of degraded ecosystems is a major goal in applied restoration ecology. In grasslands, many species may be locally absent due to dispersal or microsite limitation and may therefore profit from mechanical disturbance of the resident vegetation. We established a seed addition and disturbance experiment across several grassland sites of different land use to test whether plant diversity can be increased in these grasslands. Additionally, the experiment will allow us testing the consequences of increased plant diversity for ecosystem processes and for the diversity of other taxa in real-world ecosystems. Here, we present details of the experimental design and report results from the first vegetation survey 1 year after disturbance and seed addition. Moreover, we tested whether the effects of seed addition and disturbance varied among grassland depending on their land use or pre-disturbance plant diversity. Methods A full-factorial experiment was installed in 73 grasslands in three regions across Germany. Grasslands were under regular agricultural use, but varied in the type and the intensity of management, thereby representing the range of management typical for large parts of Central Europe. The disturbance treatment consisted of disturbing the top 10 cm of the sward using a rotavator or rotary harrow. Seed addition consisted of sowing a high-diversity seed mixture of regional plant species. These species were all regionally present, but often locally absent, depending on the resident vegetation composition and richness of each grassland. Important Findings Seven months after sward disturbance, respective plots had significantly increased in bare soil, seedling species richness and number of seedlings. Seed addition had increased plant species richness, but only in combination with sward disturbance. The increase in species richness, when both seed addition and disturbance was applied, was higher at high land-use intensity and low resident diversity. Thus, we show that at least the early recruitment of many species is possible also at high land-use intensity, indicating the potential to restore and enhance biodiversity of species-poor agricultural grasslands. Our newly established experiment provides a unique platform for broad-scale research on the land-use dependence of future trajectories of vegetation diversity and composition and their effects on ecosystem functioning.",WOS:000417976800001,95,0.847948895,0,enrich plant divers in grassland by larg scal expery sward disturb and see addit along grady of land us intens aim the rel between biodivers and ecosystem funct is among the most act area of ecolog research furtherm enh the divers of degrad ecosystem is a maj goal in apply rest ecolog in grassland many specy may be loc abs due to dispers or microsit limit and may theref profit from mech disturb of the resid veget we est a see addit and disturb expery across sev grassland sit of diff land us to test wheth plant divers can be increas in thes grassland addit the expery wil allow us test the consequ of increas plant divers for ecosystem process and for the divers of oth tax in real world ecosystem her we pres detail of the expery design and report result from the first veget survey year aft disturb and see addit moreov we test wheth the effect of see addit and disturb vary among grassland depend on their land us or pre disturb plant divers method a ful fact expery was instal in grassland in three reg across germany grassland wer und regul agricult us but vary in the typ and the intens of man thereby repres the rang of man typ for larg part of cent europ the disturb tre consist of disturb the top cm of the sward us a rotav or rot harrow see addit consist of sow a high divers see mixt of reg plant specy thes specy wer al reg pres but oft loc abs depend on the resid veget composit and rich of each grassland import find sev month aft sward disturb respect plot had sign increas in bar soil seedl specy rich and numb of seedl see addit had increas plant specy rich but on in combin with sward disturb the increas in specy rich when both see addit and disturb was apply was high at high land us intens and low resid divers thu we show that at least the ear recruit of many specy is poss also at high land us intens ind the pot to rest and enh biodivers of specy poor agricult grassland our new est expery provid a un platform for broad scal research on the land us depend of fut traject of veget divers and composit and their effect on ecosystem funct,new,0.8614898833692387,0.8185402409005638,0.7882903590932726,0.7658527865566405,0.7482508420860736,0.7339131347446051,0.7219367945359635,0.7117704544004324,0.7030881490617341,0.6957432345942517,0.6899992419161965

At the local scale (0.25 ha), we analysed alpha diversity, site colonization and extinction rates, and changes in species and functional type composition. Site colonization rates were calculated separately for new species (not recorded in the original inventory) and old species (present in the first survey at other sample sites of the community). Correspondence analysis was applied to the presence/absence species matrix for all sites in both periods. At regional scale, we evaluated gamma diversity, heterogeneity within and between communities, changes in proportion of functional types (growth season, longevity and life form) and species origin. Results: In the mesophytic prairie, average local species richness increased 46% and regional richness 28%, while in the halophytic steppe changes were not significant. The colonization rate was higher and the extinction rate lower in the richest community (mesophytic prairie). Differences in colonization rates between natives and exotics were not found. Principal variability between sites in species composition was associated with abiotic conditions explaining 20.9% of inertia, temporal changes were relegated to the second axis with 6.38%. Proportions of warm-season exotics among new arrivals were higher than expected. Biotic homogenization was evidenced in the mesophytic prairie as a significant reduction in species turnover between sampling dates. Conclusions: After 35 yr under moderate grazing intensity we found increases in species richness, no biodiversity loss and no losses of native species. Instead of those species favoured by grazing, as expected, warm season species increased. Different grassland communities showed clear differences in richness changes, in degree of homogenization and in species turnover.",WOS:000340572700020,4,0.847886244,0,loc and reg long termdivers chang and biot homog in two temp grassland quest ar ther loss in specy rich due to extinct is the input of new specy low in environ with strong resourc limit is ther a decreas in abund and divers of nat specy due to anthropog disturb at loc and reg scal has abund of exot specy been favo by graz increas ar flor chang assocy with homog process loc two grassland commun typ of the argentin flood pampa the mesophyt prairy and the halophyt step method grassland sit n wer resurvey with the sam methodolog aft yr at the loc scal ha we analys alph divers sit colon and extinct rat and chang in specy and funct typ composit sit colon rat wer calc sep for new specy not record in the origin inv and old specy pres in the first survey at oth sampl sit of the commun correspond analys was apply to the pres abs specy matrix for al sit in both period at reg scal we evalu gamm divers heterog within and between commun chang in proport of funct typ grow season longev and lif form and specy origin result in the mesophys prairy av loc specy rich increas and reg rich whil in the halophys step chang wer not sign the colon rat was high and the extinct rat low in the richest commun mesophys prairy diff in colon rat between nat and exot wer not found princip vary between sit in specy composit was assocy with abiot condit explain of inert temp chang wer releg to the second ax with proport of warm season exot among new ar wer high than expect biot homog was evid in the mesophys prairy as a sign reduc in specy turnov between sampl dat conclud aft yr und mod graz intens we found increas in specy rich no biodivers loss and no loss of nat specy instead of thos specy favo by graz as expect warm season specy increas diff grassland commun show clear diff in rich chang in degr of homog and in specy turnov,new,0.8743586954026223,0.8130498422611309,0.7655152517822814,0.7280698731721837,0.6971529765768847,0.6705801473016944,0.6469146455154027,0.6250604498930299,0.6039469280761431,0.5820373456733593,0.5560032990233356
101,floodgrass,Last Remnants of Riparian Wooded Meadows along the Middle Drava River (Slovenia): Species Composition Is a Response to Light Conditions and Management,"In the present study, we investigated the species richness and species composition in relation to light and management regime in remnants of wooded meadows within the riparian forests along the middle Drava River in Slovenia. 41 plots of still managed and, at different time periods (< 5 yrs, 5-15 yrs, > 15 yrs), abandoned riparian wooded meadows (RWM) were sampled. In addition to vegetation relev,s, light intensity (PAR) was also measured in plots. Within the still-managed RWM, two floristically distinct types were recognized using TWINSPAN analysis: meadow-like and forest-like. Light intensity differed significantly between types. The CCA of active RWM showed a significant relation between species composition and light conditions. The number of species per relev, on active RWM was negatively correlated with light intensity - in contrast to North European wooded grasslands. This could be explained by the influence of species-rich riparian hornbeam forests that contribute many understorey species, in contrast to naturally mesotrophic meadows. CCA of both active and abandoned RWM demonstrated that light was a good predictor of RWM species composition and that abandonment caused profound changes in floristic composition. The species turnover during succession was more pronounced in less shaded meadow-like RWM where more light-requiring (grassland) species occurred. Species richness was the highest in active forest-like RWM. There were no significant differences in species richness between active meadow-like RWM and groups of abandoned RWM. The remains of riparian forests stretching along the flood plains of Central and Eastern Europe are considered one of the most natural ecosystems in the prevailing agricultural landscape. But naturalness could be in many cases only the consequence of abandonment of ancient land-use practices, like grazing of livestock, cutting between the trees, litter collecting, etc. Examination of the middle Drava River in Slovenia suggests the need to recognize the remains of ancient cultural landscape.",WOS:000262490400004,156,0.846140172,1,last remn of rip wood meadow along the middl drav riv sloven specy composit is a respons to light condit and man in the pres study we investig the specy rich and specy composit in rel to light and man regim in remn of wood meadow within the rip forest along the middl drav riv in sloven plot of stil man and at diff tim period yr yr yr abandon rip wood meadow rwm wer sampl in addit to veget relev s light intens par was also meas in plot within the stil man rwm two flor distinct typ wer recogn us twinsp analys meadow lik and forest lik light intens diff sign between typ the cca of act rwm show a sign rel between specy composit and light condit the numb of specy per relev on act rwm was neg correl with light intens in contrast to nor europ wood grassland thi could be explain by the influ of specy rich rip hornbeam forest that contribut many understorey specy in contrast to nat mesotroph meadow cca of both act and abandon rwm demonst that light was a good predict of rwm specy composit and that abandon caus profound chang in flor composit the specy turnov dur success was mor pronount in less shad meadow lik rwm wher mor light requir grassland specy occur specy rich was the highest in act forest lik rwm ther wer no sign diff in specy rich between act meadow lik rwm and group of abandon rwm the remain of rip forest stretching along the flood plain of cent and eastern europ ar consid on of the most nat ecosystem in the prevail agricult landscap but nat could be in many cas on the consequ of abandon of ant land us pract lik graz of livestock cut between the tre lit collect etc examin of the middl drav riv in sloven suggest the nee to recogn the remain of ant cult landscap,new,0.8709901994856114,0.8185861927436829,0.7789663848917797,0.7491752583954085,0.7260240928362967,0.7075166087202329,0.6924631553085243,0.6802015422307739,0.6704661587393133,0.6634999450609828,0.6607593131289194
111,floodgrass,Alternative management on fens: Response of vegetation to grazing and mowing,"The impact of cattle grazing on the vegetation of calcareous fens was compared to the effects of traditional autumn mowing in southern Germany. Vegetation composition was studied in adjacent pairs of fen meadows and pastures with similar environmental conditions and biomass production. Vegetation data were analysed with respect to species richness, species composition and response of species traits to disturbance, including morphology, defence mechanisms, clonal growth form and generative reproduction. Species richness was significantly reduced by grazing, but the percentage of typical fen species or Red Data Book species was not affected by land use type. Detrended Corrspondence Analysis indicated that species composition could best be explained in terms of a land use gradient. Species traits showed a clear trend in their response to land use type. Grazing favoured grasses and small forbs. Only a few species with defence mechanisms against foraging were more frequent or abundant on pastures. Many other species with defence mechanisms, however, did not have an advantage on pastures. Flowering and seed dispersal traits did not respond significantly to grazing or mowing. Species with fast spreading stem derived clonal organs were favoured on pastures, whereas all other clonal growth forms and, particularly, non-clonal species were more abundant on meadows. More indicator species of wet soil conditions and species adapted to flooding were found on pastures. Grazing can be recommended as an alternative land use to mowing in contrast to abandonment, but a reduction in species richness and changes in species composition and species traits may occur.",WOS:000220133300017,13,0.8458181990000001,1,altern man on fen respons of veget to graz and mow the impact of cattl graz on the veget of calc fen was comp to the effect of tradit autumn mow in southern germany veget composit was study in adjac pair of fen meadow and past with simil environ condit and biomass produc veget dat wer analys with respect to specy rich specy composit and respons of specy trait to disturb includ morpholog def mech clon grow form and gen reproduc specy rich was sign reduc by graz but the perc of typ fen specy or red dat book specy was not affect by land us typ detrend corrspond analys ind that specy composit could best be explain in term of a land us grady specy trait show a clear trend in their respons to land us typ graz favo grass and smal forb on a few specy with def mech against for wer mor frequ or abund on past many oth specy with def mech howev did not hav an adv on past flow and see dispers trait did not respond sign to graz or mow specy with fast spreading stem der clon org wer favo on past wherea al oth clon grow form and particul non clon specy wer mor abund on meadow mor ind specy of wet soil condit and specy adapt to flood wer found on past graz can be recommend as an altern land us to mow in contrast to abandon but a reduc in specy rich and chang in specy composit and specy trait may occ,new,0.8793751965166232,0.8430293686617466,0.8175176286450626,0.7986391353456819,0.7838343612638421,0.7717449118202608,0.7615838556950607,0.7528652355040859,0.7452834101988592,0.7386580140715285,0.7330484730636402
121,floodgrass,Vegetation ecology and diversity relationships in a riparian forest remnant of Western Greece,"The present study investigates vegetation differentiation in a riparian forest remnant dominated by Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. oxycarpa and Ulmus minor subsp. minor. Floristic data from 46 plots and soil data from 20 plots were collected from the study site in the area of Lesini (Western Greece). Dendrochronological analysis was conducted and forest structure was also investigated. Plot diversity was assessed for total floristic composition and species groups. Three vegetation units were distinguished, differentiating mainly along a soil texture gradient, with their floristic composition also affected by human disturbances. Total species, as well as species group diversity and evenness were differentiated along the main ecological gradient. The vegetation unit most affected by natural disturbance regimes is characterized by the highest diversity of riparian plant specialists and the lowest total species diversity. The vegetation units less affected by natural disturbances have increased forest species diversity. Human disturbances were found to increase total species diversity and evenness, as well as diversity of grassland and synanthropic species. With the exception of one vegetation unit, the forest lacks young individuals of the dominant tree species. This is a major problem for the persistence of the riparian forest, especially considering the reduction of annual precipitation in the wider area and the lower frequency and intensity of flood events.

131,floodgrass,Cattle grazing increases plant species richness of most species trait groups in mesic semi-natural grasslands,"The effects of cattle grazing on plant species trait groups were studied by comparing three kinds of mesic semi-natural grasslands in southern Finland: old (continuously cattle grazed), new (cattle grazing restarted 3-8 years ago) and abandoned pastures (grazing terminated > 10 years ago). Two spatial scales were studied: 1 m(2) and grassland patch (0.25-0.8 ha). Species richness was higher among most species trait groups in old than in abandoned pastures and showed some recovery in new pastures. More pronounced differences were found per m(2) than per grassland patch. Richness of perennial and biennial plants was in order old > new > abandoned pastures both per m(2) and per grassland patch, but richness of annual plants was significantly higher only per grassland patch. Grazing increased the richness of hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes and decreased that of geophytes both per m(2) and per grassland patch. Richness of small and medium-sized plants was higher in grazed than in abandoned grasslands. Only richness of the tallest species (height > 80 cm) was lower in grazed grasslands. The proportion of species trait groups, in which species richness was higher in grazed than in abandoned grasslands, was higher than in previous studies. This may be due largely to the differences in the grassland type (mesic vs. dry or wet). It is proposed that species trait responses to grazing may be related to how effectively natural factors (e.g., drought, flooding) limit plant growth. In mesic grasslands natural factors limit plant growth less than in dry or wet grasslands. Because of this the number of groups of species with different species traits benefitting from grazing is higher in mesic than in dry or wet areas.",WOS:000226444100006,14,0.8408955690000001,1,cattl graz increas plant specy rich of most specy trait group in mes sem nat grassland the effect of cattl graz on plant specy trait group wer study by comp three kind of mes sem nat grassland in southern finland old continu cattl graz new cattl graz restart year ago and abandon past graz termin year ago two spat scal wer study m and grassland patch ha specy rich was high among most specy trait group in old than in abandon past and show som recovery in new past mor pronount diff wer found per m than per grassland patch rich of peren and bien plant was in ord old new abandon past both per m and per grassland patch but rich of an plant was sign high on per grassland patch graz increas the rich of hemicryptophyt and chamaephyt and decreas that of geophyt both per m and per grassland patch rich of smal and med siz plant was high in graz than in abandon grassland on rich of the tallest specy height cm was low in graz grassland the proport of specy trait group in which specy rich was high in graz than in abandon grassland was high than in prevy study thi may be due larg to the diff in the grassland typ mes vs dry or wet it is propos that specy trait respons to graz may be rel to how effect nat fact e g drought flood limit plant grow in mes grassland nat fact limit plant grow less than in dry or wet grassland becaus of thi the numb of group of specy with diff specy trait benefit from graz is high in mes than in dry or wet area,new,0.8780351028596752,0.8321713459538961,0.797427926100806,0.7706536970979655,0.7491237569863083,0.7311956703100642,0.7158399783862137,0.7023787286433947,0.6903273429721851,0.6792720820236754,0.6687423271903047
141,floodgrass,The most species-rich plant communities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (with new world records),"We provide an inventory of the sites and vegetation types in the Czech Republic and Slovakia that contain the highest numbers of vascular plant species in small areas of up to 625 m(2). The highest numbers of species were recorded in semi-natural grasslands, in which we report four new world records for fine-scale species richness: 17 species of vascular plants in 0.0044 m(2) in a mountain meadow in the Krkonose Mts, 52 and 63 species in 0.25 and 0.5 m(2), respectively, in the Kopanecke luky meadows in the Slovak Paradise (Slovensky raj), and 109 species in 16 m2 in the Porazky meadows in the White Carpathians (Bile Karpaty). The previous world record of 43 species in 0.1 m(2) was equalled in the Certoryje meadows in the White Carpathians, however, the previous record referred to shoot presence while the new record considers only the species rooted in the plot. We interpreted and corrected the data from the Czech Republic that Wilson et al. (2012) used to compile a list of world records and provide an updated list. The updated list contains five world records from the Czech Republic and two from Slovakia. The most species-rich grasslands and forests in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are concentrated in regions with base-rich soils in the Western Carpathians, especially in the flysch zone in SE Moravia and the Czech-Slovak borderland, and in limestone and volcanic areas in central Slovakia. The richest types of non-forest vegetation include semi-dry base-rich meadows (Bromion erecti and Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati), base-rich pastures and mesic meadows (Cynosurion cristati and Arrhenatherion elatioris), Nardus stricta grasslands (Violion caninae and Nardo strictae-Agrostion minds) and some wet meadows and natural subalpine grasslands. A special type of species-rich herbaceous to open woodland vegetation develops as successional stages on gravel accumulations in Carpathian rivers after severe flooding. The maximum counts of vascular plant species in non-forest vegetation in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are 7 species/0.0009 m(2), 11/0.0011 m(2), 12/0.004 m(2), 17/0.0044 m(2), 23/0.01 m(2), 37/0.04 m(2), 43/0.1 m(2), 52/0.25 m(2), 63/0.5 m(2), 82/1 m(2), 88/4 m(2), 109/16 m(2), 116/25 m(2), 131/49 m(2) and 133/100 m(2). While the maximum counts for plots smaller than 0.5 m(2) are from various regions and probably mainly depend on appropriate management, the maximum counts for plots larger than 0.5 m(2) are for two areas only, the south-eastern part of the White Carpathians and Kopanecke hilcy meadows, suggesting the importance of regionally specific landscape processes for high species richness at such scales. Czech and Slovak forest vegetation is much poorer than grasslands, reaching maxima of 100, 109 and 118 species in plots of 100,400 and 500 m2, which are considerably smaller than global maxima for temperate forests. Most of the species-rich sites occur on base-rich soils, in habitats with intermediate values of environmental factors, are subject to low-intensity management or natural disturbance, occur in landscapes with large areas of natural and semi-natural vegetation and probably have a long historical continuity.",WOS:000364105800001,199,0.838361369,0,the most specy rich plant commun in the czech republ and slovak with new world record we provid an inv of the sit and veget typ in the czech republ and slovak that contain the highest numb of vascul plant specy in smal area of up to m the highest numb of specy wer record in sem nat grassland in which we report four new world record for fin scal specy rich specy of vascul plant in m in a mountain meadow in the krkonose mts and specy in and m respect in the kopaneck luky meadow in the slovak parad slovensky raj and specy in m in the porazky meadow in the whit carpath bil karpaty the prevy world record of specy in m was equal in the certorys meadow in the whit carpath howev the prevy record refer to shoot pres whil the new record consid on the specy root in the plot we interpret and correct the dat from the czech republ that wilson et al us to compil a list of world record and provid an upd list the upd list contain fiv world record from the czech republ and two from slovak the most specy rich grassland and forest in the czech republ and slovak ar cont in reg with bas rich soil in the western carpath espec in the flysch zon in se morav and the czech slovak borderland and in limeston and volc area in cent slovak the richest typ of non forest veget includ sem dry bas rich meadow brom erect and cirsio brachypod pinnat bas rich past and mes meadow cynos cristat and arrhenath elaty nard stricta grassland viol canina and nardo strictae agrost mind and som wet meadow and nat subalpin grassland a spec typ of specy rich herbac to op woodland veget develop as success stag on gravel accum in carpath riv aft sev flood the maxim count of vascul plant specy in non forest veget in the czech republ and slovak ar specy m m m m m m m m m m m m m m and m whil the maxim count for plot smal than m ar from vary reg and prob main depend on appropry man the maxim count for plot larg than m ar for two area on the sou eastern part of the whit carpath and kopaneck hilcy meadow suggest the import of reg spec landscap process for high specy rich at such scal czech and slovak forest veget is much poor than grassland reach maxim of and specy in plot of and m which ar consid smal than glob maxim for temp forest most of the specy rich sit occ on bas rich soil in habit with intermedy valu of environ fact ar subject to low intens man or nat disturb occ in landscap with larg area of nat and sem nat veget and prob hav a long hist continu,new,0.8352843370703148,0.7730406112143665,0.7289192581007935,0.697206519025688,0.6734926293268357,0.6553135625924474,0.6413109643741359,0.6308220541629037,0.6237505842920853,0.6208155125929978,0.6247893978679689
151,floodgrass,"Resilience of a high-conservation-value, semi-arid grassland on fertile clay soils to burning, mowing and ploughing","In grassland reserves, managed disturbance is often necessary to maintain plant species diversity. We carried out experiments to determine the impact of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing and disc ploughing on grassland species richness and composition in a nature reserve in semi-arid eastern Australia. Vegetation response was influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn. Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or disc ploughing. In the fire experiment, species richness and composition recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on species richness and composition. Even disc ploughing caused only a small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of the treatment, and the high degree of natural movement and cracking in these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community. However, the ability of the Astrebla- and Dichanthium-dominated grasslands to recover quickly after disturbance, given favourable seasonal conditions, suggests that they are well adapted to natural disturbances (e.g. droughts, fire, flooding and native grazing).",WOS:000278107600010,33,0.838169423,1,resy of a high conserv valu sem arid grassland on fertil clay soil to burn mow and plough in grassland reserv man disturb is oft necess to maintain plant specy divers we carry out expery to determin the impact of fir kangaroo graz mow and disc plough on grassland specy rich and composit in a nat reserv in sem arid eastern austral veget respons was influ by wint spring drought aft est of the expery but mod rainfal follow in lat sum autumn specy composit vary gre between sampl tim and the vary due to rainfal diff between season and year was gre than the effect of fir kangaroo graz mow or disc plough in the fir expery specy rich and composit recov mor rapid aft spring than autumn burn specy rich and composit wer simil to control sit within month of burn and mow suggest that remov of the domin grass canop is unnecess to enh plant divers two fir sep by year and post fir kangaroo graz had on min influ on specy rich and composit ev disc plough caus on a smal reduc in nat rich the min impact of plough was explain by the smal area that wer plough the ont off nat of the tre and the high degr of nat mov and crack in thes shrink swel soil recovery of the composit and rich of thes grassland was rapid becaus of the high proport of peren specy that resprout veget aft fir and mow ther appear to be littl conserv benefit from fir mow or plough ungraz area as we could ident no nat plant specy depend on frequ disturb for persist in thi grassland commun howev the abl of the astrebl and dichanth domin grassland to recov quick aft disturb giv favo season condit suggest that they ar wel adapt to nat disturb e g drought fir flood and nat graz,new,0.877067194478415,0.8240679040383917,0.7829554483674904,0.7505506455063986,0.7238797910018303,0.7010993426737478,0.6810049278935837,0.6627139246205141,0.6454483735032599,0.6282324264119598,0.6092305765037863

171,floodgrass,"Responses of birds to planting of Lotus tenuis pasture in the Flooding Pampas, Argentina","The Flooding Pampas is the most important livestock region of Argentina, but is a region where replacement of originally natural, perennial tussock grasses by pasture species is changing the heterogeneity of the grassland system. We evaluated the response of grassland bird assemblages of the Flooding Pampas to planting of Lotus tenuis (Lotus) pasture, which mainly modifies vegetation structure by reducing vertical heterogeneity. Species richness and abundance of birds were compared between fields of Lotus pasture and semi-natural grasslands. Avian species richness and abundance were both greater in semi-natural grassland than in Lotus pasture. When grouped by nesting habits (grassland specialists, generalists), species richness and abundance of grassland specialists was greater in semi-natural grassland, whereas richness and abundance of generalist species was greater in Lotus pasture. An indicator-species analysis showed that five grassland birds were closely linked to semi-natural grassland vegetation, with two of those species - Hudson's Canastero (Asthenes hudsoni) and Bay-capped Wren-Spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides) of conservation concern. 1 In contrast, generalist species, such as Southern Lapwings (Vanellus chilensis) and Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia), were associated with Lotus pasture. Planting of Lotus pasture has negative effects on species that naturally occur in tussock grassland.

181,floodgrass,Local habitat management and landscape-scale restoration influence small-mammal communities in grasslands,"Ecosystem/habitat restoration has become a major goal of international biodiversity policy. However, restorations are often limited in space or time, and we know little on whether and how restoration and management affect vertebrates. Here we assessed the local and landscape-scale effects of habitat restoration and management on small-mammal communities in the Egyek-Pusztakocs marsh system (Hortobagy National Park, Hungary), site of the largest active restoration of grasslands on former croplands in Europe. We live-trapped mice, voles and shrews in spring and autumn in 2 years (four sampling periods) at two sites in six habitat types: croplands, grasslands restored 3-6 years earlier and natural grasslands. Data on 421 individuals of 12 species showed that restored grasslands were similar to croplands and natural grasslands in species richness, abundance and composition. At the local scale, management influenced abundance because there were more small mammals in unmanaged and early-mown grasslands with taller vegetation than in late-mown or grazed grasslands with lower vegetation, or in ploughed croplands. Elevation was also important because sites at higher elevation provided refuges during spring floods or summer droughts. At the landscape scale, the proportion of restored and natural grasslands positively affected the abundance of small mammals, whereas the proportion of linear habitats (roads, canals) had a negative effect on abundance. Our results show that management is more important than restoration per se at the local scale, which is expected for habitat generalists such as small mammals in contrast to specialists such as plant-feeding invertebrates. However, restoration provides landscape-scale benefits by increasing the area of grasslands that can serve as refuges for small mammals in unfavourable periods. We thus conclude that a mosaic of restored and appropriately managed grasslands with tall vegetation will provide the best chances for the persistence of small-mammal communities in dynamic landscapes.",WOS:000363471300009,50,0.818955185,1,loc habit man and landscap scal rest influ smal mam commun in grassland ecosystem habit rest has becom a maj goal of intern biodivers policy howev rest ar oft limit in spac or tim and we know littl on wheth and how rest and man affect vertebr her we assess the loc and landscap scal effect of habit rest and man on smal mam commun in the egyek pusztakoc marsh system hortobagy nat park hung sit of the largest act rest of grassland on form cropland in europ we liv trap mic vol and shrews in spring and autumn in year four sampl period at two sit in six habit typ cropland grassland rest year ear and nat grassland dat on individ of specy show that rest grassland wer simil to cropland and nat grassland in specy rich abund and composit at the loc scal man influ abund becaus ther wer mor smal mam in unm and ear mown grassland with tal veget than in lat mown or graz grassland with low veget or in plough cropland elev was also import becaus sit at high elev provid refug dur spring flood or sum drought at the landscap scal the proport of rest and nat grassland posit affect the abund of smal mam wherea the proport of linear habit road can had a neg effect on abund our result show that man is mor import than rest per se at the loc scal which is expect for habit gen such as smal mam in contrast to spec such as plant fee invertebr howev rest provid landscap scal benefit by increas the are of grassland that can serv as refug for smal mam in unfavo period we thu conclud that a mosa of rest and appropry man grassland with tal veget wil provid the best chant for the persist of smal mam commun in dynam landscap,new,0.8356583459235526,0.7929085789470692,0.762400298448708,0.7399730136170576,0.7228432113256079,0.7094310428252865,0.6988316844538325,0.690565845335137,0.6844926338927317,0.6809220424086865,0.681384996288602
192,floodgrass,Management of grasslands in rewetted floodplains: effects of grazing and cutting on vegetation development,"Extensive floodplain wetlands of high conservation value have become very rare in Central Europe because of river regulation, flood control measures, drainage, and melioration. In the recent past, restoration measures for water bodies and floodplains have been used specifically to promote endangered animal and plant species of open wetlands. In the process, harvested pastures, which were formerly used intensively, are frequently restored. The question of site management following rewetting is important from a practical and economic as well as a conservation perspective. Extensive grazing on rewetted floodplain habitats is often more feasible than mowing. However, such a management change is often contested from a conservation perspective. Within the scope of this study, a vegetation analysis is used to compare different land use regimes for floodplains in the Luxembourg Syr-wetlands six years after rewetting through a land restoration project. The aim is to analyse differences in vegetation composition between the management alternatives of extensive grazing, one-cut mowing with grazing and two-cut mowing, and to draw conclusions for the future management of rewetted floodplain wetlands. Along the use limits of pasture-mowing areas, vegetation surveys have been carried out using paired sampling plots to keep site conditions as similar as possible. Alongside parameters for floristic diversity and rarity, the vegetation data have also been analysed with the help of indicator values and species traits. One dimension of an NMDS-ordination allows the vegetation composition of the management alternatives to be significantly distinguished from one another. The main influencing factor here is primarily differing land use. At the pasture areas investigated, more species were observed overall than in the mowing areas. The average species numbers, diversity indices, and structural vegetation parameters per unit of measurement point to a greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation under the influence of grazing animals. Regarding rare and conservation-relevant plant species, no significant differences between the management alternatives were recorded. In contrast, the two-cut mowing areas in particular differ from the permanent pasture with regard to species traits like life-form, reproduction type, and flowering time span. This result is not consistent with the species decline associated with a management change from mowing to grazing, which has been observed in other studies for different site conditions. The extensive mowing and grazing use in the Syr floodplain comes close to historical agricultural management forms, which are increasingly required for the conservation and development of species-rich habitat types. The different land-use regimes complement each other in the Syr valley and offer different habitats for plant species with varying species traits.",WOS:000306680700011,71,0.816729287,1,man of grassland in rewet floodplain effect of graz and cut on veget develop extend floodplain wetland of high conserv valu hav becom very rar in cent europ becaus of riv reg flood control meas drain and mely in the rec past rest meas for wat body and floodplain hav been us spec to promot endang anim and plant specy of op wetland in the process harvest past which wer form us intend ar frequ rest the quest of sit man follow rewet is import from a pract and econom as wel as a conserv perspect extend graz on rewet floodplain habit is oft mor feas than mow howev such a man chang is oft contest from a conserv perspect within the scop of thi study a veget analys is us to comp diff land us regim for floodplain in the luxembourg syr wetland six year aft rewet through a land rest project the aim is to analys diff in veget composit between the man altern of extend graz on cut mow with graz and two cut mow and to draw conclud for the fut man of rewet floodplain wetland along the us limit of past mow area veget survey hav been carry out us pair sampl plot to keep sit condit as simil as poss alongsid paramet for flor divers and rar the veget dat hav also been analys with the help of ind valu and specy trait on dimend of an nmds ordin allow the veget composit of the man altern to be sign distinct from on anoth the main influ fact her is prim diff land us at the past area investig mor specy wer observ overal than in the mow area the av specy numb divers ind and structural veget paramet per unit of meas point to a gre spat heterog in veget und the influ of graz anim regard rar and conserv relev plant specy no sign diff between the man altern wer record in contrast the two cut mow area in particul diff from the perm past with regard to specy trait lik lif form reproduc typ and flow tim span thi result is not consist with the specy declin assocy with a man chang from mow to graz which has been observ in oth study for diff sit condit the extend mow and graz us in the syr floodplain com clos to hist agricult man form which ar increas requir for the conserv and develop of specy rich habit typ the diff land us regim compl each oth in the syr valley and off diff habit for plant specy with vary specy trait,new,0.864488520108811,0.8295774689973803,0.8058189345119716,0.7886524848702623,0.7755044809261354,0.7650714828291543,0.7566486450621228,0.7498660791870775,0.7446187917368157,0.7411526329226158,0.7407072309246242
271,floodgrass,Climatic and land-use drivers along a latitudinal gradient: species diversity in temperate grasslands on agricultural soils,"Questions: Do remaining mesophytic grasslands on soils with agricultural potential respond to a latitudinal gradient? Are climatic or land-use factors the principal drivers of regional and local diversity of these grasslands? Location: Mesophytic grasslands, Argentine Pampas, Rio de la Plata grasslands. Methods: The species presence and cover was recorded in each of 96 remnant grasslands on soils suitable for cropping, grouped into five sampling locations. In each region, CIs for c-diversity and for the slope of species/area curves were estimated. Unconstrained ordination was applied to detect the principal gradients in floristic composition and correlation analysis to identify their main drivers. Mantel test was used to evaluate the correlation between floristic similarity and geographic distance, and with Euclidean distance in fragmentation and climatic variables. To rank the climatic and land-use factors that account for local species richness and percentge of exotics, we applied correlation analysis and regression models. Results: Community composition (73% native species) was mainly related to climatic variables determined by latitude, with a slight influence of fragmentation variables. Regional species richness responded to latitude: c-diversity decreased linearly with increasing distance from the Equator, as did the rate of species accumulation with expanding area. Alpha-diversity did not vary in a systematic way with latitude, being associated with landscape fragmentation and mean annual precipitation. Relative importance of C-4 grasses and mean percentage exotics showed opposite latitudinal tendencies, the former decreasing and the latter increasing towards the south. Conclusions: Latitude was a strong determinant of regional diversity and community composition, but a partial driver for local species richness, mainly influenced by landscape fragmentation. While climatic and geographic drivers determined gradual latitudinal turnover in regional species pools, within regions land-use history, stochastic processes and biotic interactions were also important. All these patterns need to be considered together when delimiting grassland nature reserves for conservation of the most diverse ecosystems of this region, currently threatened by agricultural expansion and intensification.",WOS:000423189400013,20,0.7920093220000001,1,clim and land us driv along a latitudin grady specy divers in temp grassland on agricult soil quest do remain mesophys grassland on soil with agricult pot respond to a latitudin grady ar clim or land us fact the princip driv of reg and loc divers of thes grassland loc mesophys grassland argentin pampa rio de la plat grassland method the specy pres and cov was record in each of remn grassland on soil suit for crop group into fiv sampl loc in each reg cis for c divers and for the slop of specy are curv wer estim unconstrain ordin was apply to detect the princip grady in flor composit and correl analys to ident their main driv mantel test was us to evalu the correl between flor simil and geograph dist and with euclid dist in frag and clim vary to rank the clim and land us fact that account for loc specy rich and percentg of exot we apply correl analys and regress model result commun composit nat specy was main rel to clim vary determin by latitud with a slight influ of frag vary reg specy rich respond to latitud c divers decreas linear with increas dist from the equ as did the rat of specy accum with expand are alph divers did not vary in a system way with latitud being assocy with landscap frag and mean an precipit rel import of c grass and mean perc exot show opposit latitudin tend the form decreas and the lat increas toward the sou conclud latitud was a strong determin of reg divers and commun composit but a part driv for loc specy rich main influ by landscap frag whil clim and geograph driv determin grad latitudin turnov in reg specy pool within reg land us hist stochast process and biot interact wer also import al thes pattern nee to be consid togeth when delimit grassland nat reserv for conserv of the most divers ecosystem of thi reg cur threatened by agricult expand and intens,new,0.8062856251994933,0.752093520559313,0.716266501252513,0.6914516084206815,0.6732874006853258,0.6596191958917136,0.6493451547355924,0.6419622894785945,0.6374481885209418,0.6364662973052763,0.6415873321103508
32,floodgrass,Effects of water level and grassland management on alpha and beta diversity of birds in restored wetlands,"Nearly 60% of European wetlands have been lost to drainage or to the cessation of grassland management. Large amounts of resources are put into wetland restoration with the aim to recover biodiversity. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated effects of management, wetness and flooding dynamics on biodiversity of restored wetlands such as seasonally flooded wet grasslands. We inventoried bird communities over 4years at 137 sites (each 31ha) within five restored wet grassland areas in Sweden to investigate whether species richness and occurrence of 12 common wet grassland species were related to (i) local conditions such as management (grazing, mowing and unmanaged areas), basic wetness and spring flooding dynamics. Further, we investigated whether (ii) the composition of the adjacent landscape (20ha) related to local bird diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale. Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale. Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure, resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet grassland bird species.Synthesis and applications. The selection of wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest edges. Restoration and management of wet grasslands should include water level management, removal of shrubs and trees, and low-intensity grazing, whereas mowing could be used in non-flooded grasslands of low basic wetness.

35,floodgrass,Atlantic floodplain meadows: influence of hydrological gradients and management on sciomyzid (Diptera) assemblages,"Maintaining biodiversity is central to maintaining ecosystem functionality of wetlands. Hydrology has the strongest influence on wetland biodiversity, second to which agriculture is the most influential factor. This study investigates the influence of hydrology and farming practices on the abundance, species richness and composition of dipteran communities on temperate Atlantic floodplain hay meadows. Insects were sampled by sweep-net across twenty-four vegetation zones for which hydrological variables were calculated by combining river level data with fine-scale topographical data. Plant communities were surveyed using relev,s and land owners were interviewed to gather data on current and past management regimes. A total of twenty-two sciomyzid species were recorded; over one-third of the Irish fauna. Flood depth and duration were found to have the strongest influence on sciomyzids, syrphids and plants. Sciomyzid species richness and total abundance were both positively correlated with hydroperiod and flood depth while both plants and syrphids responded negatively to increases. The difference in response highlights the need to assess more than one taxonomic group, when assessing the impact of changing environmental variables on biodiversity. Whereas vegetation structure drives changes in sciomyzid indicator species, plant species richness and composition, past management regimes and current nutrient inputs do not appear to influence these species. Thus, while the maintenance of the hydrological heterogeneity and the diversity of mowing regimes is important in maintaining biodiversity, variation in nutrient inputs and previous management (at least within the range here investigated) is likely to be of lesser importance for Syrphidae and Sciomyzidae.",WOS:000336400000013,8,0.770144715,1,atl floodplain meadow influ of hydrolog grady and man on sciomyzid dipter assembl maintain biodivers is cent to maintain ecosystem funct of wetland hydrolog has the strongest influ on wetland biodivers second to which agricult is the most influ fact thi study investig the influ of hydrolog and farm pract on the abund specy rich and composit of dipt commun on temp atl floodplain hay meadow insect wer sampl by sweep net across twenty four veget zon for which hydrolog vary wer calc by combin riv level dat with fin scal topograph dat plant commun wer survey us relev s and land own wer interview to gath dat on cur and past man regim a tot of twenty two sciomyzid specy wer record ov on third of the ir faun flood dep and dur wer found to hav the strongest influ on sciomyzid syrphid and plant sciomyzid specy rich and tot abund wer both posit correl with hydroperiod and flood dep whil both plant and syrphid respond neg to increas the diff in respons highlight the nee to assess mor than on taxonom group when assess the impact of chang environ vary on biodivers wherea veget structure driv chang in sciomyzid ind specy plant specy rich and composit past man regim and cur nutry input do not appear to influ thes specy thu whil the maint of the hydrolog heterog and the divers of mow regim is import in maintain biodivers vary in nutry input and prevy man at least within the rang her investig is lik to be of less import for syrphida and sciomyzida,new,0.808440232244891,0.7689897939988886,0.7438811266789146,0.7269940180502592,0.7151796730354401,0.7069309088198547,0.7015382694007943,0.6987957461949009,0.6990062312306272,0.7033684960836295,0.7156413306786068
39,floodgrass,Variation of grazing-induced vegetation changes across a large-scale productivity gradient,"QuestionsDoes the magnitude of grazing-induced changes in species composition vary with habitat productivity? How does the sign and magnitude of grazing effects on species richness and beta-diversity change with increasing productivity? Do major life forms exhibit consistent responses to grazing along productivity gradients? LocationSteppes and grasslands of southern South America in Argentina and Uruguay. MethodsWe evaluated grazing effects on plant composition, species richness, beta-diversity and life-form abundances along a ten-fold, regional productivity gradient and within subregions of contrasting productivity, using a common sampling protocol for 23 paired grazed vs ungrazed plots. The annual integral of the normalized difference vegetation index was used as a surrogate for above-ground net primary productivity. ResultsCompositional dissimilarity between grazed and ungrazed plots, as well as grazing-induced differences in plant richness and beta-diversity all increased with habitat productivity. Grazing decreased species richness in low-productive steppes but enhanced the richness of high-productive grasslands. On average, grazing reduced beta-diversity in high-productive sites but not in low-productive sites. Dominant species were more strongly suppressed by grazing towards productive grasslands. Grazing generally decreased shrub species cover, whereas graminoid and forb cover did not consistently change with grazing through the productivity gradient. ConclusionsOur results indicate that the overall grazing effects on vegetation structure increased along a regional productivity gradient. Yet the sign of grazing impacts on species richness and beta-diversity shifted with habitat productivity, in agreement with models of herbivore-mediated co-existence and species colonization in productive systems. Further, we found that narrowing the spatial extent of analysis to the subregion generally obscured grazing-productivity relationships.

41,floodgrass,Effect of grazing on community structure and productivity of a Uruguayan grassland,"Grasslands and their grazers provide some of the most compelling examples for studying the relationship between diversity, productivity, and disturbance. In this study, we analyzed the impact of grazing-induced changes in species composition and community structure upon the productivity of a grassland in the Campos region, Uruguay. We compared three treatments: a continuously grazed area, a 9-year old exclosure to domestic herbivores, and grazing-simulated plots inside the exclosure, which were clipped so that their standing biomass resembled that of the grazed area. We studied the community composition of the grazed and ungrazed situations, and determined biomass and above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of the three treatments during 1 year. Grazed plots had higher species richness and diversity than the exclosure. Grazing resulted in the replacement of some cool-season, tussock grasses by warm-season, prostrate grasses. ANPP was 51% higher under grazing than in the exclosure, but the grazing-simulated plots inside the exclosure were the most productive treatment, 29% higher than the grazed plots. Thus, two components of grazing effect may be postulated for this grassland. The structural component resulted in higher ANPP, probably due to the elimination of standing dead biomass. The species composition component resulted in lower ANPP once the structural component was controlled, probably due to the shift to warm-season phenology and prostrate habit. Our findings contrast with a similar experiment carried out in the neighbouring Flooding Pampa region, which suggests that the relationship between grazing and community structure and function is difficult to generalize.",WOS:000231805000008,7,0.752881982,1,effect of graz on commun structure and produc of a uruguay grassland grassland and their graz provid som of the most compel exampl for study the rel between divers produc and disturb in thi study we analys the impact of graz induc chang in specy composit and commun structure upon the produc of a grassland in the campo reg uruguay we comp three tre a continu graz are a year old exclos to domest herb and graz sim plot insid the exclos which wer clip so that their stand biomass resembl that of the graz are we study the commun composit of the graz and ungraz situ and determin biomass and abov ground net prim produc anp of the three tre dur year graz plot had high specy rich and divers than the exclos graz result in the replac of som cool season tussock grass by warm season prost grass anp was high und graz than in the exclos but the graz sim plot insid the exclos wer the most produc tre high than the graz plot thu two compon of graz effect may be post for thi grassland the structural compon result in high anp prob due to the elimin of stand dead biomass the specy composit compon result in low anp ont the structural compon was control prob due to the shift to warm season phenolog and prost habit our find contrast with a simil expery carry out in the neighbo flood pamp reg which suggest that the rel between graz and commun structure and funct is difficult to gen,new,0.8238969702603479,0.7531825797924315,0.7030421511466679,0.6661585677224061,0.6375070058370184,0.6143979298921804,0.5953075831078812,0.5793409202599966,0.5660397616168739,0.5553841239022219,0.5482855521528434
58,floodgrass,"More species, but all do the same: contrasting effects of flood disturbance on ground beetle functional and species diversity","The role of habitat disturbance on biodiversity is central as it promotes changes in ecological systems. That said, still little is known about the functional consequences of such changes. Functional diversity can be used to revealing more mechanistically the disturbance effects on communities by considering the richness and the distribution of traits among the species. Here we analyzed the response of functional and species diversity of ground beetles to flood disturbance to better understand the functioning of alluvial invertebrate communities. Ground beetles were sampled in periodically flooded grasslands along the Elbe River in Germany. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to unveil the relationships between flood disturbance, species and functional diversity, respectively. We measured different components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, dispersion, and divergence) and analyzed species diversity by means of rarefied species richness, abundances, evenness and Simpson's diversity. We found contrasting relationships in that most species diversity measures peaked at highest disturbance levels, while most functional diversity measures decreased with increasing disturbance intensities. Inversed relationships between species and functional diversity are rarely observed, as most studies report on positive correlations. We explain increasing species diversity with a higher amount of resources available in highly disturbed sites. Decreasing functional diversity is best explained through the convergence of species traits by flood disturbance and uneven resource exploitation in highly disturbed plots (low functional evenness), suggesting strong impacts from functionally different generalist species in floodchannels. We show that the amount of resources available, and how these resources are exploited, play major roles in the functioning of floodplain ground beetle communities.",WOS:000301537200004,11,0.7209792620000001,0,mor specy but al do the sam contrast effect of flood disturb on ground beetl funct and specy divers the rol of habit disturb on biodivers is cent as it promot chang in ecolog system that said stil littl is known about the funct consequ of such chang funct divers can be us to rev mor mech the disturb effect on commun by consid the rich and the distribut of trait among the specy her we analys the respons of funct and specy divers of ground beetl to flood disturb to bet understand the funct of alluv invertebr commun ground beetl wer sampl in period flood grassland along the elb riv in germany we us gen linear mix effect model to unveil the rel between flood disturb specy and funct divers respect we meas diff compon of funct divers funct rich ev dispers and diverg and analys specy divers by mean of rarefy specy rich abund ev and simpson s divers we found contrast rel in that most specy divers meas peak at highest disturb level whil most funct divers meas decreas with increas disturb intens invers rel between specy and funct divers ar rar observ as most study report on posit correl we explain increas specy divers with a high amount of resourc avail in high disturb sit decreas funct divers is best explain through the converg of specy trait by flood disturb and unev resourc exploit in high disturb plot low funct ev suggest strong impact from funct diff gen specy in floodchannel we show that the amount of resourc avail and how thes resourc ar exploit play maj rol in the funct of floodplain ground beetl commun,new,0.7601102124548048,0.7055503326736524,0.6705730073757572,0.6468711806775905,0.6302173128390975,0.6185905392158668,0.611040456992693,0.6073057810342714,0.6078411813456717,0.6143875750789446,0.6322862390265007
79,floodgrass,Floristic heterogeneity of Flooding Pampa grasslands: a multi-scale analysis,"The present paper describes vegetation heterogeneity at contrasting spatial scales in order to analyse patterns of floristic diversity and vegetation-environment relations in the Flooding Pampa grasslands of Argentina. The overall grassland flora contains a large proportion of exotic species, which are mostly annual forbs. At a regional scale, there is a latitudinal turnover in relative abundance of major grass tribes, and C-3 grasses become increasingly common in grasslands at higher latitudes. The principal gradients in overall vegetation composition were associated with landscape-level changes in topography and soil chemistry. Both native and exotic species richness increased with topographic elevation, and markedly decreased in flood-prone habitats with acidic or saline soils. In remnants of tussock grassland, the predominant physiognomy of the Pampas in pre-settlement times, the presence of the tall native grass Paspalum quadrifarium is a strong determinant of local community structure, reducing the percentage of exotic species. Heterogeneity analysis at the community scale revealed a fine-grained species packing that was in sharp contrast with spatial mosaics observed in other grasslands under livestock grazing. At this scale, spatial variation in floristic composition correlated with changes in various soil parameters, but not with subtle differences in topographic relief. The studied grasslands possess some unique features that contribute towards a better understanding of how current vegetation heterogeneity is controlled by historical, environmental and management factors.",WOS:000233849700002,16,0.6853277809999999,0,flor heterog of flood pamp grassland a mult scal analys the pres pap describ veget heterog at contrast spat scal in ord to analys pattern of flor divers and veget environ rel in the flood pamp grassland of argentin the overal grassland flor contain a larg proport of exot specy which ar most an forb at a reg scal ther is a latitudin turnov in rel abund of maj grass trib and c grass becom increas common in grassland at high latitud the princip grady in overal veget composit wer assocy with landscap level chang in topograph and soil chem both nat and exot specy rich increas with topograph elev and mark decreas in flood pron habit with acid or salin soil in remn of tussock grassland the predomin physiognom of the pampa in pre settl tim the pres of the tal nat grass paspal quadrifar is a strong determin of loc commun structure reduc the perc of exot specy heterog analys at the commun scal rev a fin grain specy pack that was in sharp contrast with spat mosa observ in oth grassland und livestock graz at thi scal spat vary in flor composit correl with chang in vary soil paramet but not with subtl diff in topograph reliev the study grassland possess som un feat that contribut toward a bet understand of how cur veget heterog is control by hist environ and man fact,new,0.7050610717636915,0.6222180555296432,0.5684077633991532,0.5320767061147704,0.5064217209684957,0.48801354003641445,0.4751373919752491,0.46710600509468125,0.46415631291206105,0.46800264884959536,0.4844388246556065
86,floodgrass,Diversity and structure of Lepidoptera communities in the ecotonal zone between plains piedmont and flood savanna in Casanare-Colombia (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea),"This research found that diversity and structure of Lepidoptera communities varies according to the habitats both in the piedmont plains and flood savanna of the Orinoco in Colombia. Sampled sites in the piedmont zone have greater similarity both in species richness and representativeness of some taxonomic groups, and there is also the presence of unique species such as Parides erithalion, Dismorphia crisia, Pereute leucodrosime and Pycina zamba. Moreover, sampled sites in the flood savanna zone are less diverse than the piedmont areas and more similar to each other, since they share a large percentage of the species composition, mainly Anartia amathea, Callicore cyllene, Chlosyne poecile and Siproeta stelenes, species that are adapted to disturbed habitats. Heraclides thoas, Adelpha alala, Danaus gilippus and Heliconius erato are categorized as common species because they are most often shared between sites and samplings. Finally, it highlights the dominance shown by subfamilies Biblidinae and Ithomiinae in most sites sampled in the plains piedmont.

107,floodgrass,Viable seed banks under grazing and exclosure conditions in montane mesic grasslands of Argentina,"Grazing by large herbivores affects the composition of established vegetation and seed banks. Montane Pampas grasslands are highly productive and have evolved with the influence of grazing by native herbivores. Thus we proposed, firstly that grazing by feral horses would increase seed bank diversity, without changing seed density in grazed areas and secondly that there is a greater similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation in exclosure areas. The study area is located in sub-humid montane grassland in mid-eastern Argentina. Sampling took place at the beginning and end of summer in 2008 and 2009, in three one-year-old exclosures and grazed areas. Soil and litter samples were collected and established vegetation cover was visually recorded in every area. Each sample was elutriated and sieved. Seed composition was recorded using a dissecting microscope. Seed density and species richness of the samples was analyzed using ANOVA and species composition was analyzed by multivariate analysis. Grazing reduces the seed density and richness of grasses, but forb species are not affected. The seed density of grasses increases in soil samples at the end of summer, while the density of forb species does not change. Similarity between the established vegetation and the seed bank was low. Grazing affects seed bank composition which could limit restoration time after the removal of herbivores. However, grass seed availability increases considerably during a short period after exclosure establishment, showing high potential for recovery in sub-humid grasslands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

119,floodgrass,Restoring grassland biodiversity: Sowing low-diversity seed mixtures can lead to rapid favourable changes,"We studied the effect of sowing low-diversity seed mixtures (containing 2-3 competitive grass species) on the regeneration of vegetation on croplands previously used as alfalfa fields. In four permanent plots in 10 restored fields (four with alkali and six with loess seed mixture) the cover of flowering plants was recorded and phytomass was measured between 2006 and 2008. We asked three questions: (i) How fast will weedy, short-lived species decrease in abundance during secondary succession enhanced by sowing low-diversity seed mixtures? (ii) Can weeds be suppressed by sowing competitive native grasses, followed up by management by mowing? (iii) Can succession towards the target native grasslands be accelerated by sowing only low-diversity seed mixtures compared to set-aside old field succession? Our results showed that in just two years a vegetation dominated by perennial grasses has developed, which successfully prevented the establishment of weed species. These results suggested that sowing seeds of two or three competitive grass species is an effective tool to eliminate weed domination and to lead towards the restoration of species poor grasslands with grass domination such as alkali grasslands. However, the developed dense perennial grass cover and the accumulated litter may hamper the immigration of specialist species characteristic to reference grasslands. Therefore, the restoration of species-rich grasslands requires the facilitation of the immigration of grassland specialist species by further management (grazing, mowing and/or hay-transport).

163,floodgrass,Influence of Flood Pulse on Termite Diversity (Insecta: Isoptera) in the Pantanal,"This research aimed to associate termite diversity to flood pulse by Paraguay River, and with savannas and pasture areas. The study was conducted nearby the town of Caceres, in Pantanal - Mato Grosso, on six livestock farms subject to the flood pulse of Paraguay River. The types of land use sampled were native savanna and cultivated pasture. Flooded and dry plots were selected, both from the savanna and the pasture in each sampling area. Termite richness and abundance was analysed based on the environments as an explanatory variable (FP - flooded pasture, DP - dry pasture, FS - flooded savanna, DS - dry savanna) through GLM; Tukey's test was subsequently performed to determine whether land use and/or flood pulse can significantly affect the termite community. There were 37 termite species and 19 genera. Richness and abundance of termite species cannot be explained by flooding pulse, but were explained only by land use (pasture and savanna). We identified a greater richness and abundance of arboreal species in flooded environments.

A confinement gradient related to an increase in macrophyte density and determined by the nearest distance from permanent waters seemed to be a key factor in structuring the fish community in the flooded grasslands. Along this gradient, Cyprinids (essentially 0+) dominated near permanent water bodies (95% in abundance) but were substituted further by more tolerant species (Anguilla anguilla and Lepomis gibbosus) and mainly Ameiurus melas (age > 1, 40% in abundance). Although most species (10/13) present in the main permanent channels have been found in flooded grasslands, the efficiency of these grasslands as fish habitat was low compared to other similar sites from literature.

110,mang,Fish assemblages in Tanzanian mangrove creek systems influenced by solar salt farm constructions,"Deforestation of mangrove forests is common occurrence worldwide. We examined fish assemblage composition in three mangrove creek systems in Tanzania (East Africa), including two creeks where the upper parts were partly clear-cut of mangrove forest due to the construction of solar salt farms, and one creek with undisturbed mangrove forest. Fish were caught monthly for one year using a seine net (each haul covering 170 m(2)) within three locations in each creek, i.e. at the upper, intermediate and lower reaches. Density, biomass and species number of fish were lower in the upper deforested sites compared to the mangrove-fringed sites at the intermediate and lower parts in the two creeks affected by deforestation, whereas there were no differences among the three sites in the undisturbed mangrove creek system. in addition, multivariate analyses showed that the structure of fish assemblages varied between forested and clear-cut sites within the two disturbed creeks, but not within the undisturbed creek. Across the season, we found no significant differences except for a tendency of a minor increase in fish densities during the rainy season. At least 75% of the fishes were juveniles and of commercial interest for coastal fisheries and/or aquaculture. Mugil cephalus, Gerres oyena and Chanos chanos were the most abundant species in the forested sites. The dominant species in the clear-cut areas were M. cephalus and Elops machnata, which were both found in relatively low abundances compared to the undisturbed areas. The conversion of mangrove forests into solar salt farms not only altered fish assemblage composition, but also water and sediment conditions. In comparison with undisturbed areas, the clear-cut sites showed higher salinity, water temperature as well as organic matter and chlorophyll a in the sediments.

Larvae were sampled over a 2-yr period in 7 wetland types (brackish and freshwater herbaceous swamps, mangrove swamps, freshwater ponds, clear-cut marsh forests, small irrigation canals, and swamp forests), covering 3 environmental gradients (salinity, aquatic vegetation, and habitat permanence). Twelve variables were quantified to describe each habitat. Two species of anophelines were collected. An. aquasalis was the species with the widest distribution, and its highest abundance was in the seasonal brackish mangrove habitat during the rainy season. An. oswaldoi Peryassu was rarely encountered but was mainly associated with the dry season and with the permanent freshwater wetlands (such as ponds). Principal components and correlation analyses revealed that the physicochemical (salinity, disserved oxygen) variables of the wetland were associated most strongly with the spatial distribution of both species. Variations in salinity were strongly associated with the abundance of An. aquasalis. Both the occurrence and abundance of An. oswaldoi were most closely correlated with disserved oxygen. Changes in seasonal abundance of both species were associated with rainfall.

43,mang,Benthic bacterial diversity and nutrient processes in mangroves: impact of deforestation,"The bacterial diversity and nutrient dynamics of mangrove sediments in Kisakasaka, Tanzania, was investigated in order to evaluate potential changes associated with deforestation of mangroves. Study sites included relatively undisturbed, recently protected mangroves and clear-cut mangrove areas that were sampled during both the wet and dry seasons. Physicochemical parameters, nitrogenase activity, pore water nutrient concentrations and bacterial diversity were measured in sediment depth profiles using both molecular and chemical techniques. Results show that there are significant differences in sediment pore water nutrient concentrations and bacterial diversity in sediments of mangrove areas which have been deforested compared to those which have been protected. Average measured values for protected and deforested areas, respectively, were: sulphide (S-2-),S- < 42 +/- 10 mu M and > 1.9 +/- 0.5 mM at 30 cm depth; ammonium (NH4+), 58 +/- 2 mu M and 113 +/- 12 mu M at 4-5 cm depth; soluble reactive phosphate, 40.2 +/- 11 mu M and 18.4 +/- 1.2 at 4-5 cm depth. Nitrogen fixation rates were lower in deforested areas during day and night, organic content was higher in protected areas (20 +/- 5%) compared to deforested areas (12 +/- 3%). The bacterial diversity was lower in deforested areas as determined by Shannon index using 16S rRNA gene analysis with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism.

Because little phenotypic variation has been reported for this species, we investigated genetic, physiological, and/or morphological variations in 18 strains of C. ogasawaraensis isolated from 14 countries. The combined data of plastid-encoded ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene and its spacer, nuclear-encoded large subunit (LSU) rDNA, and mitochondrion-encoded cox spacer region suggested that this species is divided into three groups; Group I contains Australian, Melanesian, and Micronesian strains; Group II includes strains from western Pacific coasts, Micronesia, and Madagascar; and Group III consists eastern Pacific-Atlantic and Malaysian strains. Considering wide distribution range and close genetic similarity within the groups, a long-distance dispersal event does not seem to be rare in this species. Growth of the strains was compared between brackish (salinity = 8) and seawater (salinity = 32) media; most Group I strains grew well in both brackish and seawater media; whereas, all the Group II strains showed better growth in the brackish medium. Morphological analyses of the strains incubated under the same conditions revealed that the Group III strains had wider rhizoids than the other strains. However, this feature was highly variable and easily affected by environmental and algal conditions.

Mangrove deforestation is widespread in the Greater Caribbean but its impact on macrobenthos has not been evaluated to date. In order to assess the impact of mangrove conversion to pasture, densities and shell sizes of two dominant gastropods (Neritina virginea and Melampus coffeus) were compared among four mangrove types: 1) Rhizophora mangle-dominated fringing mangroves, 2) Avicennia germinans-dominated basin mangroves, 3) Mixed-species basin mangroves, and 4) A. germ mans- basin mangroves converted to pastures, in the Turbo River Delta (Uraba Gulf, Colombia). Mangrove types were polygon-delimited with satellite images and color aerial photographs were taken in 2009. Various (n<5) polygons per mangrove type were sampled in January, July and December 2009, and a total (n<20) 0.025m(2)-quadrats were randomly placed along each polygon. Forest structure variables, pore-water physicochemical variables and sediment-grain metrics were measured in the four mangrove types. Mean density and size of both gastropod species were measured. The results showed that the mean density and size of both species were significantly greater in R. mangle-fringing mangroves. N. virginea density decreased gradually towards the A. germinans-basin mangroves seemly related to the diadromous life-history. This species nearly disappeared in the neighboring pastures because individuals were constrained to a few remaining flooded areas. In the pastures, M coffeus individuals were clumped in the remaining A. germinans trees due to its climbing behavior as a pulmonate. We hypothesize that the decline of these two gastropods was related to physical microhabitat (e.g. trees, prop roots, and seedlings) degradation, and alteration of soil properties (e.g. temperature, pH, organic matter content). Finally, we also hypothesize that the local extinction of N. virginea due to clear-cutting may exert strong negative effects on the ecosystem function because it is a dominant omnivore. Rev. Biol.

The present study attempts to characterise the assemblages of drosophilids of this environment, based on 28 collections taken in three mangrove areas in Santa Catarina Island, southern Brazil. The three mangroves surveyed were different in their surroundings, which varied from highly urbanised areas to conservation areas with natural vegetation. Overall, 69 species were collected, and no remarkable difference was detected in species composition and abundances or in the richness, evenness and heterogeneity between sites. The species abundance distribution observed fitted to a theoretical lognormal distribution in the three mangroves. The species richness scored and the performance of the species richness estimators showed an unexpectedly high diversity, considering the very low floristic diversity and the harsh conditions of the environment. Regarding species composition and abundances, the drosophilid mangrove assemblages were shown to be more similar to those found in open environments, with a marked dominance of exotic species. Finally, considering the apparent lack of feeding and breeding sites, we suggest that mangrove forests are acting as sink habitats for the drosophilids populations.",WOS:000281427000008,7,0.856771339,1,assembl of drosophilid dipter drosophilida in mangrov forest commun ecolog and specy divers brazil faun of drosophilid has been research in vary ecosystem but thos in mangrov forest remain overlook in brazil and elsewh the pres study attempt to charact the assembl of drosophilid of thi environ bas on collect tak in three mangrov area in sant catarin island southern brazil the three mangrov survey wer diff in their surround which vary from high urb area to conserv area with nat veget overal specy wer collect and no remark diff was detect in specy composit and abund or in the rich ev and heterog between sit the specy abund distribut observ fit to a theoret lognorm distribut in the three mangrov the specy rich scor and the perform of the specy rich estim show an unexpect high divers consid the very low flor divers and the harsh condit of the environ regard specy composit and abund the drosophilid mangrov assembl wer shown to be mor simil to thos found in op environ with a mark domin of exot specy fin consid the app lack of fee and bree sit we suggest that mangrov forest ar act as sink habit for the drosophilid pop,new,0.865699375313572,0.8234624214502648,0.7945702854140649,0.7742138893997419,0.7591640587930556,0.7477136753243505,0.7389554345935535,0.7324639429035776,0.7281994546265208,0.7267074228762649,0.7301464951500307
82,mang,"Functional diversity of fish in tropical estuaries: A traits-based approach of communities in Pernambuco, Brazil","Environmental changes and human activities may have strong impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. While biodiversity is traditionally based on species richness and composition, there is a growing concern to take into account functional diversity to assess and manage species communities. In spite of their economic importance, functional diversity quantified by a traits-based approach is still poorly documented in tropical estuaries. In this study, the functional diversity of fishes was investigated within four estuaries in Pernambuco state, northeast of Brazil. These areas are subject to different levels of human impact (e.g. mangrove deforestation, shrimp farming, fishing etc.) and environmental conditions. Fishes were collected during 34 scientific surveys. A total of 122 species were identified and 12 functional traits were quantified describing two main functions: food acquisition and locomotion. Fish abundance and functional dissimilarities data were combined into a multivariate analysis, the Double Principal Coordinate Analysis, to identify the functional typology of fish assemblages according to the estuary. Results showed that Itapissuma, the largest estuary with a wider mangrove forest area, differs from the other three estuaries, showing higher mean values per samples of species richness S and quadratic entropy Q. Similarly, it presented a different functional typology (the first two axes of the DPCoA account for 68.7% of total inertia, while those of a traditional PCA based solely on species abundances provided only 17.4%). Conversely, Suape, Sirinhaem, and to a lower extent Rio Formoso, showed more similarity in their diversity. This result was attributed to their predominantly marine influenced hydrological features, and similar levels of species abundances and in morphological traits. Overall, this study, combining diversity indices and a recent multivariate analysis to access species contribution to functional typology, allows to deepen diversity assessment by providing additional information regarding the functional pattern of fish assemblages.

Over a two-year period, a total of 14 species were recorded with the species diversity (H'(log(2))) ranged from 0.54 to 2.4. The community was dominated by two large polychaetes (Neanthes glandicincta and Potamilla acuminata) and a number of small pollution tolerant species (Tharyx, Capitella capitata and Prionospio cirrifera). It was also characterized by both temporal and spatial variations in terms of abundance and species composition with the lowest species number observed at onshore Station B in August and the highest at offshore Station D in February. Two distinct polychaete communities were formed along the intertidal towards subtidal mudflat, particularly the assemblage at onshore Station B showing a significant difference from those at the other three stations (P < 0.05, N = 32). Results of the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC) indicated a typical impacted community at the whole study area, especially at Station B which was close to the Shenzhen River mouth and mangrove forest. The total organic carbon had a significant positive effect on the abundance of Capitella capitata (P = 0.037, N = 8) while sedimentary compositions were statistically related to the abundance of Potamilla acuminata, Tharyx and total abundance of polychaetes (P < 0.05, N = 8).

Mean density of macrobenthos was 2.5-fold higher in the central (881.8 +/- A 1,151.3 ind. m(-2)) than in the eastern mangrove site (356.3 +/- A 218.8 ind. m(-2)). Community structures differed significantly between these sites and showed a serial shift during the investigation period. Gastropods dominated the community in the central mangrove location, whereas sipunculids, polychaetes and gastropods had similar densities in the eastern site. Differences in community composition were best explained by three sediment properties: pore water salinity, delta C-13(org), and C-org/N. It is suggested that small-scale heterogeneity of food availability and quality is a main factor determining the small-scale variability of the community composition. Compared to other Indo-West Pacific mangroves, species richness and densities are high. However, the dominance of specific taxa, especially of opportunistic species and the comparably low species richness in the subtidal of the lagoon may be attributed to the high sediment input by rivers in the central part and to the large-scale cutting of mangroves. Continuous tree logging will probably lead to a further spread of two fast growing understorey plants and thus to an increase of uniform swamp sites and a decrease of micro-habitats for benthic macrofauna.

112,mang,Spatial patterns of seagrasses and salinity regimes interact to structure marine faunal assemblages in a subtropical bay,"Anthropogenic disturbances in coastal and marine environments have resulted in the transformation of vegetated benthic habitat spatial patterns, which is thought to influence the distribution, community composition, and behavior of marine fauna. In Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA, freshwater discharges into nearshore areas have resulted in the fragmentation of the spatial patterning of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). To understand the ecological consequences of the freshwater-induced SAV seascape fragmentation, fish and crustaceans were sampled using seine nets across seascapes with continuous and highly fragmented SAV spatial configurations and across salinity regimes. Fragmented SAV seascapes supported significantly higher species diversity of fish and crustaceans, especially in areas influenced by freshwater discharges. Also, fragmented seascapes supported a higher abundance of the pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum and the goby Gobiosoma robustum, and higher biomass of generalist predatory fishes than seascapes with continuous SAV. In contrast, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides was more abundant in seascapes with continuous SAV. Faunal assemblage composition differed between zones of contrasting salinity regimes, and the contribution of species occurrence and abundance to the differentiation of assemblage composition between seascape types was associated with the salinity regimes of the seascapes. Thus, water salinity and spatial properties of SAV seascapes are factors that interact to influence faunal community structure in Biscayne Bay. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how environmental context (e.g. salinity regimes) can modulate the influence of benthic spatial patterning on the abundance and biodiversity of nekton communities.",WOS:000431203900002,11,0.5051339739999999,0,spat pattern of seagrass and salin regim interact to structure marin faun assembl in a subtrop bay anthropog disturb in coast and marin environ hav result in the transform of veget benth habit spat pattern which is thought to influ the distribut commun composit and behavy of marin faun in biscayn bay florid us freshw discharg into nearsh area hav result in the frag of the spat pattern of submerg aqu veget sav to understand the ecolog consequ of the freshw induc sav seascap frag fish and crustac wer sampl us sein net across seascap with continu and high frag sav spat config and across salin regim frag sav seascap support sign high specy divers of fish and crustac espec in area influ by freshw discharg also frag seascap support a high abund of the pink shrimp farfantepenae duorar and the goby gobiosom robust and high biomass of gen pred fish than seascap with continu sav in contrast pinf lagodon rhomboid was mor abund in seascap with continu sav faun assembl composit diff between zon of contrast salin regim and the contribut of specy occur and abund to the differenty of assembl composit between seascap typ was assocy with the salin regim of the seascap thu wat salin and spat property of sav seascap ar fact that interact to influ faun commun structure in biscayn bay thes find highlight the import of understand how environ context e g salin regim can mod the influ of benth spat pattern on the abund and biodivers of nekton commun,new,0.4776140507911027,0.4463615036535898,0.43361080975334737,0.43030954669784977,0.43318264224205916,0.44124580443025546,0.4547249201531905,0.47494750785931067,0.5050282562363512,0.5521515578058804,0.634647196303274
122,mang,"Does hydrological fragmentation affect coastal bird communities? A study from Abaco Island, The Bahamas","Habitat fragmentation represents one of the most important threats to biodiversity. Fragmentation of aquatic ecosystems is pervasive, fundamentally altering aquatic community structure and ecosystem function on a worldwide scale. Because of the many ecological changes associated with hydrologic fragmentation of coastal wetlands, there may be cascading effects on non-aquatic organisms. Here we explored if anthropogenic fragmentation of tidal creek wetlands on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, affected bird communities. By comparing fragmented and unfragmented sections of nine separate tidal creeks, we tested whether fragmentation of coastal wetlands (due to roads) affected the richness, abundance, and composition of wetland bird assemblages. Although bird communities significantly differed among tidal creeks (irrespective of fragmentation status), and water salinity was positively correlated with species richness and abundance of wetland-associated birds, we found no significant differences in bird communities between fragmented and unfragmented sections of wetlands. Our findings suggest fragmented portions of tidal creek wetlands support avian communities relatively similar to their unfragmented counterparts, despite a range of differences in environmental features. These results indicate that other ecological factors (i.e., salinity) may be more important than fragmentation per se in affecting bird utilization of wetland habitats in The Bahamas.",WOS:000356540000018,12,0.6284585229999999,1,doe hydrolog frag affect coast bird commun a study from abaco island the bahama habit frag repres on of the most import threats to biodivers frag of aqu ecosystem is pervas funda alt aqu commun structure and ecosystem funct on a worldwid scal becaus of the many ecolog chang assocy with hydrolog frag of coast wetland ther may be cascad effect on non aqu org her we expl if anthropog frag of tid creek wetland on abaco island the bahama affect bird commun by comp frag and unfr sect of nin sep tid creek we test wheth frag of coast wetland due to road affect the rich abund and composit of wetland bird assembl although bird commun sign diff among tid creek irrespect of frag stat and wat salin was posit correl with specy rich and abund of wetland assocy bird we found no sign diff in bird commun between frag and unfr sect of wetland our find suggest frag port of tid creek wetland support av commun rel simil to their unfr counterpart despit a rang of diff in environ feat thes result ind that oth ecolog fact i e salin may be mor import than frag per se in affect bird util of wetland habit in the bahama,new,0.6226079076373168,0.5940247324933785,0.5805064377470781,0.5752041852408333,0.5754729047481899,0.5803485918485366,0.5897935443101031,0.6046111555427904,0.6268469570032361,0.6612873484125253,0.7199726455171429
132,mang,"Artificial structures versus mangrove prop roots: a general comparison of epifaunal communities within the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, USA","Urbanized coastal landscapes are becoming increasingly widespread throughout the world, and as a result, essential habitat is being replaced with artificial structures. Mangroves are threatened globally, and crucial ecosystem functions are being lost (e.g. habitat/refuge for associated species). There remains a lack of understanding of how artificial structures function as habitat compared to natural substrates, particularly those being lost, such as mangrove prop roots. The objectives of this study were to compare benthic epifaunal communities on artificial structures to those on mangrove prop roots across a large spatial scale and to assess seasonal trends of colonizing species within each habitat. Identified species were also classified as either native or non-native to assess whether artificial structures harbor more non-natives compared to mangroves. Results indicated that community composition differed significantly between habitat types, as did richness and diversity. More species were found and in higher percent cover on artificial structures. Only a few species were dominant throughout the study and were present in both habitats, and these species varied in their abundance across sites and time. Colonization at all sites was continuous throughout each season, particularly for those dominant species. Non-native species richness made up 30-50% of the community composition in each of the habitats and was significantly higher on artificial structures. Overall, artificial structures appeared to provide a functional, unique surface for both dominant and rare species and could act as a buffer to biodiversity loss in mangroves, a globally threatened habitat.",WOS:000452891600006,13,0.6825836120000001,0,art structures vers mangrov prop root a gen comparison of epifaun commun within the ind riv lagoon florid us urb coast landscap ar becom increas widespread throughout the world and as a result ess habit is being replac with art structures mangrov ar threatened glob and cruc ecosystem funct ar being lost e g habit refug for assocy specy ther remain a lack of understand of how art structures funct as habit comp to nat subst particul thos being lost such as mangrov prop root the object of thi study wer to comp benth epifaun commun on art structures to thos on mangrov prop root across a larg spat scal and to assess season trend of colon specy within each habit ident specy wer also class as eith nat or non nat to assess wheth art structures harb mor non nat comp to mangrov result ind that commun composit diff sign between habit typ as did rich and divers mor specy wer found and in high perc cov on art structures on a few specy wer domin throughout the study and wer pres in both habit and thes specy vary in their abund across sit and tim colon at al sit was continu throughout each season particul for thos domin specy non nat specy rich mad up of the commun composit in each of the habit and was sign high on art structures overal art structures appear to provid a funct un surfac for both domin and rar specy and could act as a buff to biodivers loss in mangrov a glob threatened habit,new,0.6865577467807484,0.6434508095547212,0.6197523862778622,0.6069189551665374,0.6009387894645096,0.6000982995481906,0.603862844930362,0.6125705857928851,0.6276679372339482,0.6528822667581702,0.6982461934421905
142,mang,Occurrence of species-rich crab fauna in a human-impacted mangrove forest questions the application of community analysis as an environmental assessment tool,"Diversity and composition of the intertidal brachyuran crab community in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Java, Indonesia, during the dry season of 2005 and the rainy season of 2006, shows that crab community composition and structure alone appeared to be poor indicators for the state of a forest in terms of tree diversity and wood-cutting intensity. The lagoon is surrounded by the largest mangrove stand in Java and is under constant anthropogenic pressure, mainly due to logging, land conversion for agriculture, overfishing and industrial pollution. This study aims to determine the crab community composition at different sites of the lagoon in relation to vegetation composition and sediment parameters. In addition it investigates if mangrove crabs can be used as bioindicators to describe the environmental state of mangrove forests (tree diversity, degree of logging). It was assumed to find a low crab diversity and species richness and a strong dominance of a single species at highly disturbed forest sites compared to moderately disturbed sites. A stratified, hierarchical design was used to sample the crab fauna at 13 stations distributed over the entire lagoon. Additionally, abiotic parameters and vegetation composition were recorded. In total 6463 crabs were caught belonging to 49 species, 5 super-families and 10 families, with Ocypodidae and Sesarmidae being the families of most note. Mean density of adult crabs was 27.7 individuals*m(-2) and mean biomass was 12.8 g wet mass*m(-2) or 1.3 g ash free dry mass*m-2. Density and biomass varied strongly within and between stations but they where within the range reported for other mangrove forests of the Indo-West-Pacific. Species composition was significantly different between stations. The distribution of facultatively leaf-feeding grapsid crabs was related to vegetation parameters (tree, seedling and undergrowth density), but the occurrence of single crab and tree species was not correlated. The distribution of ocypodid crabs, feeding on detritus and micro-phytobenthos, correlated with sediment characteristics like median grain size and organic content. The crab community was strongly dominated by one species at six stations, however, this was not correlated to the degree of logging. Leaf-feeding crab and mangrove tree diversity was correlated at areas of one hectare (stations), but not at a lower spatial scale (areas of 100 m(2), ""zone""). Species richness of leaf-feeding crabs was not linked to forest diversity. Hence a functional relation between leaf-feeding crab and tree species diversity could not be proven. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

152,mang,Impact of logging activities in a tropical mangrove on ecosystem diversity and sediment heavy metal concentrations,"Productivity of mangrove ecosystems is compromised by anthropogenic activities including over-exploitation of wood. This study set out to understand how different wood harvesting regimes have affected the biodiversity of a tropical ecosystem and to identify relationships between the heavy metal concentrations in the mangrove sediments and tree felling. Soil samples were collected and plant diversity studies carried out on seven sites in the mangrove. Physico-chemical, chemical and mineralogical analyses were done on soil samples and plant population structure, species richness, evenness and diversity index at these sites were calculated. Results showed that soils across sites were characteristically clayey and acidic, with high organic matter content. Minerals identified included quartz, gibbsite, goethite, hematite and kaolinite. Heavy metal concentrations were higher in Sites 6 and 7 with a longer history of anthropogenic activity. There were strong negative correlations between the duration of logging and NO3-N (r = -0.838, p = 0.019), total N (r = -0.837, p = 0.019), NH4 (+)-N (r = -0.844, p = 0.017), Mg = (-0.789, p = 0.035), K (r = -0.819, p = 0.024), and Na (r = -0.988, p = 0.002). Sites which had experienced logging for longer periods (sites 3, 6, and 7) had lower nutrient content and lower values for species richness and diversity index.

162,mang,Diversity and conservation of wood-inhabiting polypores and other aphyllophoraceous fungi in Malaysia,"We reviewed the ecological characteristics of wood-inhabiting fungi in Malaysia in relation to the major threats to these fungi; we also examined the forest uses that would help to conserve them. Although wood-inhabiting fungi do not show high host specificity or preference in many tropical areas, several are specific to Dipterocarpaceae trees in Malaysia and some species may preferably inhabit other minor tree species. Tree size and decomposition stage are also important determinants of which fungi are present. Among the polypores described by E. J. H. Corner, 41 and 26 species have been recorded only from Malaysian lowland rainforest and montane forest, respectively. Evidence suggests that both of these forest types in Malaysia are home to unique fungal communities. More than 30 polypore species described by Corner are known only from their type localities. These species are likely rare and may be restricted to old-growth forests. Logging decreases species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi because the number of natural treefalls is decreased in logged forests, and the decline of old-growth forests is a major threat to conservation of Malaysian fungi. However, species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi is relatively high in old secondary forests and forests undergoing reduced-impact logging. The diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi is extremely low in oil palm plantations, whereas several species inhabit rubber-tree and acacia plantations. Preservation of old-growth forest is essential for conserving rare wood-inhabiting fungi in Malaysia, but old secondary forests, reduced-impact logged forests, and matured tree plantations may have some importance for the conservation of some species.",WOS:000307295400012,16,0.768842402,1,divers and conserv of wood inhabit polyp and oth aphyllophorac fung in malays we review the ecolog charact of wood inhabit fung in malays in rel to the maj threats to thes fung we also examin the forest us that would help to conserv them although wood inhabit fung do not show high host spec or pref in many trop area sev ar spec to dipterocarpacea tre in malays and som specy may pref inhabit oth min tre specy tre siz and decomposit stag ar also import determin of which fung ar pres among the polyp describ by e j h corn and specy hav been record on from malays lowland rainforest and mont forest respect evid suggest that both of thes forest typ in malays ar hom to un fung commun mor than polyp specy describ by corn ar known on from their typ loc thes specy ar lik rar and may be restrict to old grow forest log decreas specy rich of wood inhabit fung becaus the numb of nat treefal is decreas in log forest and the declin of old grow forest is a maj threat to conserv of malays fung howev specy rich of wood inhabit fung is rel high in old second forest and forest undergo reduc impact log the divers of wood inhabit fung is extrem low in oil palm plant wherea sev specy inhabit rub tre and acac plant preserv of old grow forest is ess for conserv rar wood inhabit fung in malays but old second forest reduc impact log forest and mat tre plant may hav som import for the conserv of som specy,new,0.7876907633460294,0.7446965447785048,0.7191956664393451,0.7036166280030387,0.6940765651336703,0.6887972623318558,0.6870432101727265,0.6887842257071474,0.6947482223940129,0.7071391951249953,0.7323424905713269

182,mang,Brachyuran crab diversity and abundance patterns in the mangroves of Cameroon,"Brachyuran crabs are the most important group of mangroves epifauna. They operate relevant ecological roles in terms of structure and function in mangrove ecosystems. The study aims to assess crab diversity and the patterns of their distribution for biodiversity documentation. The survey was carried out in mangrove forests of the Cameroon coastline. Investigations were randomly carried out on 17 degraded mangrove areas where Rhizophora stands dominated. Crabs were collected during the period of low tide, during day and night times in the 4 x 4 m(2) quadrant plots delimited inside each belt zonation throughout transects. In total, 27 crab morphospecies were recorded with global sampling effort equals to 87.5%. Eleven morphospecies were recorded for the first time in Cameroon. Sesarmid crabs were most represented (10 species) with abundant taxa (72.9% of individuals). Crab community has low species richness and diversity indices (d = 0.004; H' = 3.3 +/- 0.1; J' = 0.8). Hill evenness are close to 1, confirms that one species (Guinearma kamermani) tends to dominate the whole community. Armases elegans, Chiromantes buettikoferi, Goniopsis pelii, Metagrapsus curvatus, Guinearma alberti, G.huzardi and G. kamermani were the common species in the study areas. The Center mangrove stands appeared most diverse (E(S-n=401) = 18 +/- 1.1species), followed by the South (E(S-n=401) = 16 +/- 0.5species) and the North (E(S-n=401) = 11 +/- 0.0species).

193,mang,Properties of ecotones: Evidence from five ecotones objectively determined from a coastal vegetation gradient,"Several properties have been suggested to be characteristic of ecotones, but their prevalence has rarely been tested. We sampled five ecotones to seek evidence on seven generalizations that are commonly made about ecotones: vegetational sharpness. physiognomic change, Occurrence of a spatial community mosaic, many exotic species, ecotonal species. spatial mass effect, and species richness higher or lower than either side of the ecotone. The ecotones were in a sequence from scattered mangroves, through salt marsh, rush-marsh. scrub, woodland, to pasture. We developed a method to objectively define, by rapid vegetational change, the position and depth of an ecotone. identifying five ecotones. Their positions were consistent across three sampling schemes and two spatial grain sizes. One ecotone is a switch ecotone, produced by positive feedback between community and environment. Another is anthropogenic, due to clearing for agriculture. Two others are probably environmental in cause, and one may be largely a relict environmental ecotone. Sharp changes in species composition occurred. Three ecotones were associated with a change in plant physiognomy. In two, the ecotone was located just outside a woodland canopy. in the zone influenced by the canopy. Community mosaicity was evident at only one ecotone. There were few strictly ecotonal species, many species occurred more frequently within ecotones than in adjacent vegetation, but there were never significantly more ecotonal species than expected at random. There was little evidence for the spatial mass effect reducing ecotonal sharpness, or leading to higher species richness within ecotones. Species richness was higher than in the adjacent habitat in only one ecotone.

201,mang,The effect of the surrounding landscape matrix on mangrove bird community assembly in north Australia,"Mangroves are highly threatened ecosystems yet their community ecology is poorly understood. We examined the ecological determinants of bird community assemblage in floristically depauperate mangroves. Birds were surveyed using line transect methods. Large mangrove patches supported fewer species than smaller patches. Patches did not comprise nested species subsets and the bird species richness of several small patches combined was greater than a single large area. The number of mangrove dependent species in a patch was area-dependent suggesting these species may be resource limited, although there was no species density compensation. There was a clear effect of the surrounding habitat, with matrix species accounting for similar to 45% of bird species in a patch. Patches surrounded by tropical savanna were relatively species-poor, while regardless of size, patches including monsoon rainforest were relatively species rich. Null model analysis of non-random assemblage structure (nestedness and species co-occurrence) revealed no deterministic structure to the overall mangrove species assemblage. These analyses described a random pattern of bird distribution and with no evidence of density compensation this suggests that competition is a weak structuring force of mangrove bird assemblages. The lack of nestedness and the random co-occurrence of species are consistent with the matrix-dependence of bird community composition. Conservation plans should treat mangrove patches as part of a habitat mosaic and incorporate many smaller mangrove patches rather than just big ones. Consideration of the nature, extent and diversity of the surrounding matrices is vital in managing and conserving mangrove bird communities. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To our knowledge no study has looked at the long-term consequences of tropical forest fragmentation on the three main components of plant diversity simultaneously: taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. We sampled the vascular flora using belt transects (50 x 4 m) in a continuous tropical semi-evergreen forest (16 transects) and in an adjacent naturally fragmented forest (fragments of 1.7-My-old semi-evergreen forest immersed in a mangrove/sedge matrix) (18 transects), and compared their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic plant diversity. There were 36 species in the continuous forest and 28 in the fragmented forest. Continuous forest was taxonomically more diverse (25%) than the fragmented forest. All functional diversity metricswere greater (6-33%) in the continuous than in the fragmented forest. Phylogenetic diversity was 19% greater and phylogenetically more overdispersed in the continuous forest than in the fragmented forest. The results suggest that in the fragmented forest not only is taxonomic plant diversity lower, but functional and phylogenetic diversity are as well.

We investigated the environmental factors influencing tree abundance and regeneration in diverse forest types growing in the riparian area of an urbanizing landscape along the Chao Phraya River. We established 252 0.1-ha circular plots in remnant forest patches along 372 km of the river. Cluster analysis was applied to classify the forest types. The relationships between environmental variables and tree abundance were assessed with ordination analysis, and generalized linear models were used to assess seedling/sapling abundance. The cluster analysis revealed five forest types, including floodplain forest with three sub-forest types, swamp forest, and mangrove forest. The ordination indicated that tree abundance in the floodplain forest was positively affected by distance to the ocean and the proportion of forested area. Swamp forest was positively influenced by the proportion of urbanized area and mean rainfall. Mangrove forest was negatively related to distance to the river. Seedling/sapling abundance of the dominant species in the floodplain forests was positively affected by lowland plain topography and negatively affected by the proportion of urbanized area, whereas swamp and mangrove forest species were positively influenced by the proportion of urbanized area and estuarine topography. Mature tree density influenced seedling/sapling abundance of all forest types. Tree abundance and regeneration of the riparian landscape was prevented by the urbanized area, floodplain, estuarine topography, and mature tree densities in remnant forests. These results suggest that remnant forest patches of conserved riparian forests along the urbanized landscape of the Chao Phraya River must be protected and the factors determining their colonization must be considered to enhance restoration practices.",WOS:000418471500017,47,0.9009449540000001,0,veget commun and fact that affect the woody specy composit of rip forest grow in an urb landscap along the chao phraya riv cent thailand improv knowledg of the environ fact that affect woody composit is urg requir for specy conserv in rip zon of urb landscap we investig the environ fact influ tre abund and reg in divers forest typ grow in the rip are of an urb landscap along the chao phraya riv we est ha circul plot in remn forest patch along km of the riv clust analys was apply to class the forest typ the rel between environ vary and tre abund wer assess with ordin analys and gen linear model wer us to assess seedl sapl abund the clust analys rev fiv forest typ includ floodplain forest with three sub forest typ swamp forest and mangrov forest the ordin ind that tre abund in the floodplain forest was posit affect by dist to the oc and the proport of forest are swamp forest was posit influ by the proport of urb are and mean rainfal mangrov forest was neg rel to dist to the riv seedl sapl abund of the domin specy in the floodplain forest was posit affect by lowland plain topograph and neg affect by the proport of urb are wherea swamp and mangrov forest specy wer posit influ by the proport of urb are and estuarin topograph mat tre dens influ seedl sapl abund of al forest typ tre abund and reg of the rip landscap was prev by the urb are floodplain estuarin topograph and mat tre dens in remn forest thes result suggest that remn forest patch of conserv rip forest along the urb landscap of the chao phraya riv must be protect and the fact determin their colon must be consid to enh rest pract,new,0.9099148432835601,0.8510320202956559,0.801782963490538,0.7629780850577751,0.7317848289838562,0.705926598301841,0.683853830847107,0.6645308910209183,0.6471555827194335,0.6309951789478129,0.6151525587455041
49,mang,"Bird Community Dynamics and Habitat Associations in Karst, Mangrove and Pterocarpus Forest Fragments in an Urban Zone in Puerto Rico","Puerto Rico's forest cover decreased to less than 10% in the early 1900's leaving few forest patches available for migrant and resident birds. In this process of deforestation karst hills and coastal wetlands have been some of the most severely modified forest types; however, we know little about their bird community dynamics and their relation with habitat variables. To address this issue we studied bird species composition and habitat characteristics in karst forest and two coastal forested wetlands (mangrove and Pterocarpus forest) in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. In each forest type, we conducted 10 point counts monthly for two years and characterized habitat variables. We performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination and a multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) for each year to determine the similarity of bird species composition among monthly censuses and the relation between species composition and habitat variables. This ordination technique grouped censuses into three groups: karst forest, Pterocarpus and mangrove in the migratory period, and Pterocarpus and mangrove in the non-migratory period. The high tree species richness in the karst forest, and the presence of standing water in coastal wetlands were the most important habitat variables associated with the different bird communities. Our results demonstrate that the karst and coastal wetlands forests, even if they are small patches surrounded by a mixed matrix of pasture and urban settlements may be important habitat for both residents and migrants, and suggest that the protection and restoration of these habitats should be high management and conservation priorities.",WOS:000262542100014,49,0.825155414,0,bird commun dynam and habit assocy in karst mangrov and pterocarp forest frag in an urb zon in puerto rico puerto rico s forest cov decreas to less than in the ear s leav few forest patch avail for migr and resid bird in thi process of deforest karst hil and coast wetland hav been som of the most sev mod forest typ howev we know littl about their bird commun dynam and their rel with habit vary to address thi issu we study bird specy composit and habit charact in karst forest and two coast forest wetland mangrov and pterocarp forest in the carib island of puerto rico in each forest typ we conduc point count month for two year and charact habit vary we perform a non met multidimend scal nms ordin and a mult respons permut proc mrpp for each year to determin the simil of bird specy composit among month census and the rel between specy composit and habit vary thi ordin techn group census into three group karst forest pterocarp and mangrov in the migr period and pterocarp and mangrov in the non migr period the high tre specy rich in the karst forest and the pres of stand wat in coast wetland wer the most import habit vary assocy with the diff bird commun our result demonst that the karst and coast wetland forest ev if they ar smal patch surround by a mix matrix of past and urb settl may be import habit for both resid and migr and suggest that the protect and rest of thes habit should be high man and conserv pri,new,0.8320587843917575,0.7751102780077695,0.7363670753566386,0.7104777760437911,0.6929668433043715,0.6813408807378243,0.6743437080332959,0.671592552058611,0.6735155541949359,0.6820088544085189,0.7029401749188843

In the southern area of the bay, 82,120 ha of mangrove forest are actively undergoing a management regime conducted by PT. Bintuni Utama Murni Wood Industries (PT. BUMWI). Operations are focused upon woodchip production; however, sustainable forest management is also a priority as the area is Forest Stewardship Council (R) (FSC (R)) certified. Currently, PT BUMWI is approaching the completion of a 25-year rotation (with stands ranging from 0 to 25 years) which presents a good time to examine and evaluate current management practices and their effects on the forest concession. Part of a successful regeneration of a forest stand is attaining the range of ecological integrity and ecosystem functions similar to baseline forests. Forest structure and complexity, along with biodiversity at the stand level could function as regeneration criteria to evaluate the success of a sustainable forest management program. The objective of the study was to observe if the forest structure and biodiversity in secondary stands, considered as proxies for ecological integrity, would regenerate to similar levels within the 25 years as baseline forests. Post-harvest forest regeneration was evaluated in different aged secondary forest stands by measuring biomass, species composition and forest structure in circular plots along transects. Nonlinear regression was used to determine and predict different forest structure dynamics (sapling and stem densities, tree height, DBH), diversity and volumes throughout and beyond the 25-year rotation period. Dynamics in species composition and diversity of tree species was observed. Results suggest that the forest structure in secondary stands follows a natural regeneration dynamic over the rotation period but had not yet attained the same structure and composition as baseline forests at 25 years. Furthermore, growth models suggest that the harvest rotation may need to be extended to 30-40 years for secondary stands to attain similar ranges of forest structure, compositions and volumes to that of baseline forests. These observations will help future forest management of the concession as the company strives to manage secondary forests to keep the same ecosystem functions and high volumes observed in baseline forests.

Thirty-two study sites, >2000 ha each, were surveyed throughout the country, including all major vegetation types from 1981 to 2003 during >5472 hr of effective daylight raptor searches. Census techniques took into account the behavior and detectability of every species to assess their abundance and habitat associations. The French Guiana raptor community included 27 forest species, five species restricted to forest edges and large gaps, five species of wetlands and mangroves, eight coastal grassland specialists, four nearctic migrants, and seven occasional taxa of unconfirmed status. In the 19 undisturbed primary forest sites, the most common raptor was the Lined Forest-Falcon (Micrastur gilvicollis). Many species were rare or patchily distributed: 15% of all species were found in only 5-11% of the 32 localities sampled and <30% were present in almost all of them. The abundance index was correlated with site occupancy frequency. There was no significant difference in species richness among parts of the country. Some taxa widespread in Latin America (Cathartes, Accipiter, Micrastur) were comparatively rare and local in French Guiana, where more typical Amazonian species were present.

These variations provide a platform to explore species diversity, distribution, abundance, microhabitat, and other ecological parameters to understand the distribution patterns and to facilitate conservation and management of sensitive or important species and areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity and distribution of anuran species in different types of habitat on Langkawi Island. Specimens were collected based on active sampling using the Visual Encounter Survey (VES) method. We surveyed anuran species inhabiting seven types of habitat, namely agriculture (AG), coastal (CL), forest (FT), pond (PD), mangrove (MG), riparian forest (RF) and river (RV). A total of 775 individuals were sampled from all localities, representing 23 species from 12 genera and included all six families of frogs in Malaysia. FT and RF showed high values of Shannon Index, H', 2.60 and 2.38, respectively, followed by the other types of habitat, CL (1.82), RV (1.71), MG (1.56), PD (1.54), and AG (1.53). AG had the highest abundance (156 individuals) compared to other habitat types.

78,mang,Responses of avian guilds to urbanisation in a tropical city,"Avian ecology in tropical urban area is poorly understood. We determined, through surveys in 29 sites, how birds with different dietary and nesting requirements responded in terms of guild richness and abundance to various facets of urbanisation in Singapore. The sites selected were representative of the full range of urbanisation outside of the undisturbed native forests. Among the dietary guilds, we found that insectivores and carnivores were adversely affected by increased urbanisation. Frugivores were favoured by low-density housing, probably because more fruit-bearing ornamental plants were planted in such estates. Richness and abundance of shrub and shrub/tree nesters, and primary cavity excavators declined with increased urbanisation. We believe that the availability of nesting sites was an important factor in their decline. Exotic species accounted for only 13% of the total species richness detected in our surveys but they were numerically dominant (accounting for 61 % of overall bird abundance). Abundance of native resident birds declined monotonically with increasing amount of built-up environment while birds of exotic species appeared to be more abundant in sites with intermediate amount of built-up environment. While urban greenery serves architectural and other functions, it has little effect on overall bird community assembly. The preponderance of exotic species in Singapore city suggests that birds of tropical rainforests are poor colonisers of this relatively novel environment. Many of the native urban species originated from mangrove and coastal scrub forests, so the maintenance of rainforests is necessary for the preservation of many native bird species.

Our study provides valuable comparative analysis between two areas of disturbed mangroves at Kisap Forest Reserve, Langkawi Island. The two study sites were swamp forest at C5 which was disrupted by harvesting activities for charcoal production and C7 was disturbed by lightning strikes. A total of 1,217 and 390 trees measuring 1 cm diameter and above were enumerated in 0.25 ha plots at both sites. Seven mangrove plant species in C5 and eight in C7 were recorded. Ceriops tagal and Rhizophora apiculata were the most prominent species in the C5 and C7, respectively, whereby the Rhizophoraceae was the densest family at both sites. The major contributor of total basal area at C5 and C7 were C. tagal (5.02 m(2)/ha) and R. apiculata (11.14 m(2)/ha). Similarly, C. tagal (22.41 t/ha) and R. apiculata (111.75 t/ha) also contributed the highest biomass in C5 and C7, respectively. Diversity and species richness were higher at C7 H'=1.22; R'=1.17 compared to C5 H'=0.76; R'=0.85 and low evenness at both sites. High similarity was indicated between the two sites by 93%. The distribution of individuals in C7 was homogenous than that of C5, which had more saplings.

113,mang,"Human disturbance and forest diversity in the Tansa Valley, India","We assessed the diversity of woody plants at 15 forested sites in the Tansa Valley of Thane District, in Maharashtra, India. The fewest species (11) were seen at a degraded mangrove site near the river mouth, and the greatest number (150) in the rich semi-evergreen forest on Tungar Hill. For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km(2) each, had woody floras of 89 +/- 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources ( 92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley.

136,mang,"Mangrove rehabilitation and intertidal biodiversity: A study in the Ranong mangrove ecosystem, Thailand","The diversity, abundance, biomass and community structure of crustacean and molluscan macrofauna were studied in the Ranong mangrove forest ecosystem on the Andaman Sea coast of southern Thailand. After a history of commercial exploitation the mangroves along the Klong Ngao tidal creek have been assigned conservation status within a new Ranong Biosphere Reserve established in 1997. Over the past 12 years, several areas of mangrove destroyed or degraded by wood harvesting, tin mining and aquaculture, have been rehabilitated on a pilot basis by planting monocultures of mangrove seedlings using four common local species (Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Bruguiera cyclindrica and Ceriops tagal). These plantation forests with different past management histories were compared with a natural, mixed, mature mangrove forest which has been conserved for about 40 years. Macrofauna were sampled within a 100 m(2) vegetation quadrat in each study site. Crustaceans were sampled quantitatively by 3 x 15 min timed hand catches per site. Molluscs were sampled in 3 x m(2) quadrats positioned around three randomly selected trees in each vegetation quadrat. The lowest crustacean and molluscan diversity was recorded from the former tin mining site. The highest diversity was recorded from a Rhizophora plantation in the natural mixed forest area for both crustaceans and molluscs. The vegetation community structure was not correlated with the environmental variables measured, or with macrofauna community structure. Of the environmental parameters chosen, the crustacean community structure was best expressed by shore level, while for molluscan diversity and abundance it was soil moisture content. The macrofauna community structure at the tin mining site was significantly different to the other sites, and was dominated by a single species of crab, Metaplax elegans. Grapsid crabs, especially sesarmid species, dominated over ocypodid crabs in the mature forest site, whereas Uca species and other ocypodids were more abundant than grapsids in the degraded concession forest area. Snails of the families Neritidae and Ellobiidae were the most abundant molluscs in the mature forest, whereas Littoriinidae, Assimineidae and Potamidae species were more representative of the younger plantation sites. The findings from this study suggest that some of these well represented families of mangrove macrofauna could be used as indicators of ecological change as part of a long term environmental monitoring programme in Ranong and other areas in Southeast Asia where mangroves are being rehabilitated.

214,mang,Mangrove fish: a comparison of community structure between forested and cleared habitats,"The fish communities of mangrove and cleared sites were investigated in Gazi Bay, Kenya. Five forested sites were compared with paired sites that had been cleared of mangroves by human activity. Forested sites included plantations and natural stands of Sonneratia alba and natural Rhizophora mucronata stands. Two methods of stake netting were used to take quantitative samples; method one used a single 100-m-long, 18-mm mesh net, method two used paired 24-m-long, 1-mm mesh nets-samples were taken during seven different months in 2002. Mean abundances of fish found in mangrove and cleared sites, respectively, were 0.004 m(-2) and 0.014 m(-2) (method 1) and 0.21 m(-2) and 0.25 m(-2) (method 2). Thirty species were sampled, 12 of which were found exclusively in mangrove habitats and 10 of which were limited to cleared sites. The most abundant species in mangrove plots was Atherina afra (although it was only found in two, large catches); the most abundant in cleared plots was Gerres oyena (found frequently). Mean abundance (using data pooled for all sites) was significantly higher in cleared, compared with forested, sites, and multivariate analysis showed significantly different community structures in the two habitat types. There was large variation in catch rates between dates and sites, with one forested site recording no catches at all. These results do not support the predator refuge hypothesis (which predicts higher abundance of juvenile fish inside mangroves). The low abundance of fish recorded in the mangrove sites may have been due to site-specific factors determining fish abundance within mangrove forests, to the sampling techniques used or to relatively high turbidities at these sites.

267,mang,Composition and structure of a diverse tree community at the edges of a Brazilian Amazon rainforest island surrounded by marshes and mangroves,"Man-made forest edges affect tree community composition and structure, but there is little information on the effects of natural edges. To detect tree community changes related to natural edges, we investigated a terrestrial forest island, bordered by grassland and mangrove landscapes, on the Brazilian Amazon coast. Forest structure and tree species composition were examined in 10-m-wide and 100-m-long plots from the forest edge to the interior in relation to both landscapes (8 grassland and 4 mangrove plots). Elevation and soil quality did not reveal strong spatial variability; tidal inundation established a boundary for forest expansion without influencing the forest interior. The tree community consisted of 82 species. No distinct changes in vegetation structure and composition with distance from the border were detected. Ordination procedures gave weak indications for shifts in community composition with distance from the edge and in respect to edge type. Single species occurred more frequently either close to or more distant from the grassland-forest interface. No such tendencies were detected at the mangrove-terrestrial forest interface, probably because the lack of structural differences between terrestrial forest and mangrove canopies did not permit the establishment of edge-related microclimatic gradients. Due to the isolation of the forest island and the harsh coastal environment, the tree community was dominated by generalist species which are well adapted to the conditions at the grassland-forest edge. Furthermore, the patchy distribution of frequent species and the high number of rare species made it difficult to detect spatial patterns related to the forest edge.",WOS:000344810900009,267,0.880079352,0,composit and structure of a divers tre commun at the edg of a brazil amazon rainforest island surround by marsh and mangrov man mad forest edg affect tre commun composit and structure but ther is littl inform on the effect of nat edg to detect tre commun chang rel to nat edg we investig a terrest forest island bord by grassland and mangrov landscap on the brazil amazon coast forest structure and tre specy composit wer examin in m wid and m long plot from the forest edg to the intery in rel to both landscap grassland and mangrov plot elev and soil qual did not rev strong spat vary tid inund est a bound for forest expand without influ the forest intery the tre commun consist of specy no distinct chang in veget structure and composit with dist from the bord wer detect ordin proc gav weak ind for shift in commun composit with dist from the edg and in respect to edg typ singl specy occur mor frequ eith clos to or mor dist from the grassland forest interfac no such tend wer detect at the mangrov terrest forest interfac prob becaus the lack of structural diff between terrest forest and mangrov canop did not permit the est of edg rel microclim grady due to the isol of the forest island and the harsh coast environ the tre commun was domin by gen specy which ar wel adapt to the condit at the grassland forest edg furtherm the patchy distribut of frequ specy and the high numb of rar specy mad it difficult to detect spat pattern rel to the forest edg,new,0.8898120411314007,0.7970817157809572,0.7165248924667472,0.6527992332430808,0.6020009724049102,0.5603823426255269,0.525239348267645,0.4946784771827642,0.4671349585221523,0.4409712201883017,0.4134159472005891
274,mang,"Ecological Structure of a Tropical Urban Forest in the Bang Kachao Peninsula, Bangkok","Rapid urbanization has changed the structure and function of natural ecosystems, especially floodplain ecosystems in SE Asia. The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area: rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area.

421,mang,"Altitudinal distribution and habitat preferences of forest birds on Halmahera and Buru, Indonesia: implications for conservation of Moluccan avifaunas","The BOU Indonesia Expedition, with BirdLife International, carried out surveys on the Moluccan Islands of Buru and Halmahera in 1994-96 as part of a process of protected area identification. Data on resident forest birds were collected during ten-minute sampling periods at points along altitudinal gradients, in primary and modified forests and in rainforests on different geology. While all species ever reported from Halmahera have been recorded down to near sea level, many of the forest birds of Buru, including a number of restricted-range and endemic species, are largely confined to montane forest, and only common above 800-900 m altitude. The existence of a distinct montane bird community on Buru, but not on Halmahera, is attributed to the relatively large, continuous area of forest at high altitude on this island. Forest on Halmahera at such altitudes is limited and fragmented. While most species survive in modified forests, some were significantly rarer in this habitat and may depend on adjacent areas of primary forest. Mangroves supported impoverished forest bird communities, typically of more adaptable species. On Halmahera, rainforest on ultrabasic rock appears to be impoverished when compared with rainforest on other rock formations, in particular supporting very low numbers of two species of threatened parrot. Implications for conservation concern lowland forests on Halmahera.

459,mang,Mangrove plantation over a limestone reef - Good for the ecology?,"There have been efforts to restore degraded tropical and subtropical mangrove forests. While there have been many failures, there have been some successes but these were seldom evaluated to test to what level the created mangrove wetlands reproduce the characteristics of the natural ecosystem and thus what ecosystem services they can deliver. We provide such a detailed assessment for the case of Olango and Banacon Islands in the Philippines where the forest was created over a limestone reef where mangroves did not exist in one island but they covered most of the other island before deforestation in the 1940s and 1950s. The created forest appears to have reached a steady state after 60 years. As is typical of mangrove rehabilitation efforts worldwide, planting was limited to a single Rhizophora species. While a forest has been created, it does not mimic a natural forest. There is a large difference between the natural and planted forests in terms of forest structure and species diversity, and tree density. The high density of planted trees excludes importing other species from nearby natural forests; therefore the planted forest remains mono-specific even after several decades and shows no sign of mimicking the characteristics of a natural forest. The planted forests provided mangrove propagules that invaded nearby natural forests. The planted forest has also changed the substratum from sandy to muddy. The outline of the crown of the planted forest has become smooth and horizontal, contrary to that of a natural forest, and this changes the local landscape. Thus we recommend that future mangrove restoration schemes should modify their methodology in order to plant several species, maintain sufficient space between trees for growth, include the naturally dominant species, and create tidal creeks, in order to reproduce in the rehabilitated areas some of the key ecosystem characteristics of natural mangrove forests.

114,medit,"Understorey plant species richness and composition in metropolitan forest archipelagos: effects of forest size, adjacent land use and distance to the edge","Aim To address the relative role of adjacent land use, distance to forest edge, forest size and their interactions on understorey plant species richness and composition in perimetropolitan forests. Location The metropolitan area of Barcelona, north-eastern Spain. Methods Twenty sampling sites were distributed in two forest size-categories: small forest patches (8-90 ha) and large forest areas (> 18,000 ha). For each forest-size category, five sites were placed adjacent to crops and five sites adjacent to urban areas. Vascular plant species were recorded and human frequentation was scored visually in 210 10 x 10 m plots placed at 10, 50 and 100 m from the forest edge, and additionally at 500 m in large forest areas. Plant species were grouped according to their ecology and rarity categories. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was carried out to detect patterns of variation in species assemblage, and to explore the relationships between these patterns and the richness of the species groups and the studied factors. Factorial ANOVAS were used to test the significance of the studied factors on the richness of species groups. Relationships between human frequentation and the studied variables were assessed through contingency tables. Results Forest-size category was the main factor affecting synanthropic species (i.e. those thriving in man-made or man-disturbed habitats). Synanthropic species richness decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge and, when forests were adjacent to crops, it was higher in small forest patches than in large forest areas. Richness of rare forest species was lower in small forest patches than in large forest areas when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Richness of common forest species and of all forest species together were higher close to the forest edge than far from it when forests were adjacent to urban areas. Forests adjacent to urban areas were more likely to experience high human frequentation, particularly in those plots nearest to the forest edge. Main conclusions Forest-size category and adjacent land use were the most important factors determining species richness and composition. The preservation of large forests adjacent to crops in peri-urban areas is recommended, because they are less frequented by humans, are better buffered against the percolation of nonforest species and could favour the persistence of rare forest species.",WOS:000234412300006,340,0.955944502,1,understorey plant specy rich and composit in metropolit forest archipelago effect of forest siz adjac land us and dist to the edg aim to address the rel rol of adjac land us dist to forest edg forest siz and their interact on understorey plant specy rich and composit in perimetropolit forest loc the metropolit are of barcelon nor eastern spain method twenty sampl sit wer distribut in two forest siz categ smal forest patch ha and larg forest area ha for each forest siz categ fiv sit wer plac adjac to crop and fiv sit adjac to urb area vascul plant specy wer record and hum frequ was scor vis in x m plot plac at and m from the forest edg and addit at m in larg forest area plant specy wer group accord to their ecolog and rar categ a nonmet multidimend scal nms ordin was carry out to detect pattern of vary in specy assembl and to expl the rel between thes pattern and the rich of the specy group and the study fact fact anova wer us to test the sign of the study fact on the rich of specy group rel between hum frequ and the study vary wer assess through cont tabl result forest siz categ was the main fact affect synanthrop specy i e thos thriving in man mad or man disturb habit synanthrop specy rich decreas with increas dist from the forest edg and when forest wer adjac to crop it was high in smal forest patch than in larg forest area rich of rar forest specy was low in smal forest patch than in larg forest area when forest wer adjac to urb area rich of common forest specy and of al forest specy togeth wer high clos to the forest edg than far from it when forest wer adjac to urb area forest adjac to urb area wer mor lik to expery high hum frequ particul in thos plot nearest to the forest edg main conclud forest siz categ and adjac land us wer the most import fact determin specy rich and composit the preserv of larg forest adjac to crop in per urb area is recommend becaus they ar less frequ by hum ar bet buff against the percol of nonforest specy and could favo the persist of rar forest specy,new,0.9674397642798168,0.9385452591848837,0.909417027857787,0.8824157524227123,0.857323210579121,0.8333161447803109,0.8094735077944437,0.7846206739248216,0.7569467286424918,0.722786641784201,0.6723916274740848
28,medit,Breeding bird species diversity in the Negev: effects of scrub fragmentation by planted forests,"1. Afforestation of the Northern Negev, Israel, from 1956 resulted in patches of primarily coniferous trees that fragmented large scrubland areas. This alteration in landscape pattern was followed by immigration of mediterranean bird species to the Negev. 2. We counted breeding birds, and measured various environmental variables in scrubland and planted forest patches, to test whether bird assemblages were random subsets of the regional species pool, and whether area or habitat structure was the major correlate with species abundance and distribution. 3. Of 22 bird species recorded, only three appeared in both scrub and forest, showing that these two habitats were occupied by different species assemblages. In both habitats, species richness increased with area at a rate greater than that expected by random sampling. In the scrub this increase was related to area per se, while in the forest it was related to habitat diversity in terms of stand age and tree type. 4. The density of forest species was unaffected by area, but specialist scrubland species declined as area decreased. We suggest that edge effects might reduce species abundance in small scrubland patches. 5. Nested subset analysis indicated that, at the community level, species composition was not random. However, at the species level, the distribution of three forest-dwelling species appeared as random, as it was associated with habitat rather than with patch size. 6. Our results indicate that increased diversity of breeding birds in the Northern Negev will require scrub patches larger than 50 ha among the increasingly forested landscape. In contrast, increasing forest area would hardly increase species diversity in the whole landscape. Future forest management regimes should also aim to increase habitat diversity by adding foliage layers, especially in the understorey. Exotic coniferous forests support fewer species than deciduous forests in mediterranean zones around the world. The suggested management regime may improve such forests as habitat for species-rich bird communities.",WOS:000171692900021,53,0.94881238,1,bree bird specy divers in the negev effect of scrub frag by plant forest afforest of the northern negev israel from result in patch of prim con tre that frag larg scrubland area thi alt in landscap pattern was follow by immigr of mediter bird specy to the negev we count bree bird and meas vary environ vary in scrubland and plant forest patch to test wheth bird assembl wer random subset of the reg specy pool and wheth are or habit structure was the maj correl with specy abund and distribut of bird specy record on three appear in both scrub and forest show that thes two habit wer occupy by diff specy assembl in both habit specy rich increas with are at a rat gre than that expect by random sampl in the scrub thi increas was rel to are per se whil in the forest it was rel to habit divers in term of stand ag and tre typ the dens of forest specy was unaffect by are but spec scrubland specy declin as are decreas we suggest that edg effect might reduc specy abund in smal scrubland patch nest subset analys ind that at the commun level specy composit was not random howev at the specy level the distribut of three forest dwel specy appear as random as it was assocy with habit rath than with patch siz our result ind that increas divers of bree bird in the northern negev wil requir scrub patch larg than ha among the increas forest landscap in contrast increas forest are would hard increas specy divers in the whol landscap fut forest man regim should also aim to increas habit divers by ad foly lay espec in the understorey exot con forest support few specy than decidu forest in mediter zon around the world the suggest man regim may improv such forest as habit for specy rich bird commun,new,0.9622722418380377,0.9302674896545425,0.898240719975766,0.8683480795327415,0.8403093570283096,0.8132723039832023,0.7862602166720332,0.7579731839250928,0.7263404722797062,0.6870635456726364,0.6285414490637162
34,medit,RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FOREST LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND AVIAN SPECIES RICHNESS IN NE SPAIN,"Aims: To examine how forest landscape structure (including composition and configuration features) affects forest bird species richness at the scale of 10 x 10 km in Catalonia (NE Spain), considering degrees of specialization of forest birds. Location: NE Spain. Methods: Bird presence data were obtained from the Atlas of Spanish Breeding Birds and forest landscape variables were extracted from the Spanish Forest Map developed within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. The analyses were carried out through multiple linear regressions and considering multicollinearity and spatial autocorrelation problems. Results: Forest landscape characteristics influenced more on specialist than on generalist bird species richness, explaining 62% and 52% of total variation, respectively. Forest area was the most important landscape factor, although bird species richness was also considerably favoured by trees species diversity and by the abundance of coniferous forest. Forests with too closed canopy cover (equal or bigger than 80 %) supported less bird species. The effects of forest landscape configuration were weak compared to composition; the only significant configuration index was the mean circumscribing circle index, as a potential indicator of the naturalness of forest landscapes. Conclusions: Forest landscape management should focus on forest habitat availability and forest structure features rather than on a particular forest landscape configuration, promoting an amalgam of forest tree species and avoiding an excessively closed canopy. However, and especially for generalists, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of other non-forest land cover types for an adequate management and conservation of forest bird communities.",WOS:000260441400003,146,0.944993018,0,rel between forest landscap structure and av specy rich in ne spain aim to examin how forest landscap structure includ composit and config feat affect forest bird specy rich at the scal of x km in catalon ne spain consid degr of spec of forest bird loc ne spain method bird pres dat wer obtain from the atla of span bree bird and forest landscap vary wer extract from the span forest map develop within the third span nat forest inv the analys wer carry out through multipl linear regress and consid multicollinear and spat autocorrel problem result forest landscap charact influ mor on spec than on gen bird specy rich explain and of tot vary respect forest are was the most import landscap fact although bird specy rich was also consid favo by tre specy divers and by the abund of con forest forest with too clos canop cov eq or big than support less bird specy the effect of forest landscap config wer weak comp to composit the on sign config index was the mean circumscrib circ index as a pot ind of the nat of forest landscap conclud forest landscap man should foc on forest habit avail and forest structure feat rath than on a particul forest landscap config promot an amalgam of forest tre specy and avoid an excess clos canop howev and espec for gen it is necess to consid the charact of oth non forest land cov typ for an adequ man and conserv of forest bird commun,new,0.9519862286989563,0.9123973925004522,0.8733474630299847,0.8382040413654728,0.8069110661871893,0.7785834137022897,0.7523014533640826,0.7270955795171998,0.7017984383756601,0.6744544843687482,0.6404433109170983
53,medit,Effects of forest composition and structure on bird species richness in a Mediterranean context: Implications for forest ecosystem management,"There is a growing need to manage forest ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on which forest characteristics have a greater influence on biological diversity, particularly in Mediterranean forests. To provide further insights in this respect, we analyzed how different characteristics related to forest composition and structure (forest area, canopy cover, canopy cover diversity, development stage, development stage diversity, coniferous species percentage, tree species diversity, and mono-specific forest percentage) influence the richness of forest breeding bird species (considering 22 specialist and 31 generalist species) in a large dataset comprising 2923 UTM I km x I km cells in Catalonia (NE Spain). Bird species richness was estimated through presence/absence data obtained from surveys conducted within the framework of the Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1999-2002). Forest characteristics were obtained from the Spanish Forest Map (scale 1:50,000), which was developed within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. Best regression models for forest specialists accounted for up to 53% of the variability in species richness, while models for generalist and total species richness accounted for 34% and 49% of total variability, respectively. Species richness was favoured by more developed forest stages and by tree species diversity, but very dense, closed forest canopies (> 70%) decreased species richness for both groups. For specialist species richness the percentage of coniferous forest cover had a slightly negative influence, while generalists were favoured by more diverse canopy closure. We discuss the implications of these results for Mediterranean forest management considering the current situation of Catalan forests. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

64,medit,QUANTIFYING BEETLE AND BIRD DIVERSITY IN A MEDITERRANEAN MOUNTAIN AGRO-ECOSYSTEM,"In cultivated landscapes, the peculiar mosaic structure creates several types of habitat. Defining which habitats favor rich biodiversity is of increasing importance. Beetle and bird diversity was monitored in seven different habitats (cereals, corn, fallow, Robinia pseudoacacia plantations, grassland, cultivation-oak forest ecotone, and oak forest) in central Greece aiming at (a) quantifying the alpha and beta diversity using biotic indicators, (b) evaluating species richness, (c) identifying the most important habitats for beetle and bird species assemblages, and (d) examining species generalism or specialism in habitat use. To assess the impact of habitat type on biodiversity we estimated the abundance (A), species richness (S), the Shannon diversity index (H'), the Simpson dominance index (D), and the Shannon evenness index (E'). During the sampling period a total of 21,647 individuals of ground-dwelling beetles were captured in pitfall traps, classified into 63 species, while 21 bird species were recorded as breeders. The maximum beetle abundance and diversity was observed in grassland, fallow, and cereals. The highest breeding bird density and diversity were recorded in ecotone and oak forest, with the lowest ones in fallow. Cluster analysis demonstrated that the species assemblages were classified into two categories, open agricultural and closed wooded, while following the ""IndVal"" analysis a set of three species were identified as characteristic species of a specific habitat type.

74,medit,Saproxylic beetle assemblages in the Mediterranean region: Impact of forest management on richness and structure,"Forests cover almost 30% of the Mediterranean region today, yet forest management activities have influenced structure and composition of both natural and planted forests. To date no study has been conducted to evaluate the impact of forest management on saproxylic beetle assemblages, although it is known that the Mediterranean is a biodiversity hotspot with a long-lasting human pressure on natural habitats. We provide an overview of saproxylic beetle assemblages of three forest types (mature Pinus halepensis forests, mature Pinus brutia forests, young Quercus calliprinos forests) in the East Mediterranean region using a one-year sample from 12 forest plots located in the north of Israel. The studied forest types differed in forest structure, but we found no significant difference in saproxylic beetle species richness. Aleppo pine forests showed the largest number of saproxylic beetle species. Forests dominated by P. brutia, a non-native tree species in Israel, show the lowest species number of all three forest types. Species composition differs substantially between oak and pine forests. A third of the species found either in P. halepensis or in Q. calliprinos forests being unique to these habitats, while a smaller proportion of unique beetle species is found in P. brutia forests. Several beetle species that were found both in oak and pine plots in our study develop exclusively on broadleaved shrubs or trees. This may be explained by the small distances between the studied pine trees and oaks in their proximity. Biodiversity in pine forests can be increased when these are mixed with broad-leaved trees, e.g. oaks in the understorey layer, as can be observed the natural regrowth in most of the planted pine stands in our research area. There is some evidence from other studies that older successional stages of oak forests are likely to host more species overall than the mature pine forests studied here. In order to enhance structural diversity foresters should allow for aging of single trees or stands, regardless of the tree species. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

83,medit,Bird assemblages in forest fragments within Mediterranean mosaics created by wild fires,"The role of habitat heterogeneity as a key factor in determining species pools in habitat mosaics has been acknowledged, but we still know little on the relative importance of the different ecological processes acting within such complex landscapes. We compared species richness and distribution in forest fragments imbedded in shrub-lands to those in continuous forests or in continuous shrublands. We examined the consistency of our data with the predictions of two hypotheses: 1) the Habitat fragmentation hypothesis which states that fragmentation has negative effects on the species from the original continuous habitat; 2) the Habitat supplementation /complementation hypothesis which stipulates that the presence of a matrix habitat around the fragments will mitigate negative effects on the species from the original habitat (supplementation) or allow the presence of species that depend on the presence of both the fragment and matrix habitats (complementation). We show that: 1) species richness in forest fragments did not differ from species richness in segments of continuous forests of equal area; 2) the bird community of forest fragments got impoverished in some forest species but a higher proportion of species common in continuous forests were not affected by fragmentation; 3) fragment communities had a significant proportion of common species that were scarce in, or absent from both continuous forests and shrublands. While, a few forest species supported predictions from the fragmentation hypothesis, occurrence patterns observed in several other species were consistent with either the supplementation or the complementation hypotheses. Our results suggest that there is no single hypothesis that properly captures the consequences of a shift from continuous forests to a mosaic of forest fragments and shrublands and that different ecological mechanisms act in conjunction to determine species pools in habitat mosaics.

93,medit,CONSERVATION STATUS AND POTENTIAL THREATS TO NATURA 2000 FOREST HABITATS IN SLOVENIA,"An example of the possible use of selected forest-stand based indicators for evaluation of conservation status was shown in case of the Natura 2000 forest habitats of Slovenia, and the potential threats to habitat types were identified. Using the existing forest-management system, and two levels of ICP Forests monitoring as sources of data on the size of habitat, tree composition, developmental phase and stand regeneration, growing stock and increment, dead wood, and level of naturalness of habitat, an attempt of evaluation of the conservation status of the forest habitat types of EU community interest (Habitat Directive 1992, Natura 2000) is presented. In total, the Natura 2000 forest habitat types in Slovenia represent almost one third of all forest area, and the prevailing forest habitat types are Illyrian Fagus sylvatica forests, Luzulo-Fagetum beech forests and Illyrian oak-horn-beam forests. Considering the direct influences of human activities and potential effects of climate change the floodplain and lowland forests of Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior, Riparian mixed forests of Quercus robur and other broadleaves, as well as Illyrian oak-hornbeam forest, are among the most threatened forest habitat types. Taking into account the small area of habitat type and the set of different threats, the priority habitat types of Tilio-Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines, (Sub-) Mediterranean pine forests and Bog woodland are also endangered. Despite the large number of factors threatening the Slovenian forests, the high level of studied parameters indicates the favourable conservation status of forest habitat types.

103,medit,Effects of Previous Land-Use on Plant Species Composition and Diversity in Mediterranean Forests,"At some point in their history, most forests in the Mediterranean Basin have been subjected to intensive management or converted to agriculture land. Knowing how forest plant communities recovered after the abandonment of forest- management or agricultural practices (including livestock grazing) provides a basis for investigating how previous land management have affected plant species diversity and composition in forest ecosystems. Our study investigated the consequences of historical ""land management"" practices on present-day Mediterranean forests by comparing species assemblages and the diversity of (i) all plant species and (ii) each ecological group defined by species' habitat preferences and successional status (i.e., early-, mid-, and late-successional species). We compared forest stands that differed both in land-use history and in successional stage. In addition, we evaluated the value of those stands for biodiversity conservation. The study revealed significant compositional differentiation among stands that was due to among-stand variations in the diversity (namely, species richness and evenness) of early-, intermediate-, and late-successional species. Historical land management has led to an increase in compositional divergences among forest stands and the loss of late- successional forest species.",WOS:000361797500134,49,0.911413631,1,effect of prevy land us on plant specy composit and divers in mediter forest at som point in their hist most forest in the mediter basin hav been subject to intend man or convert to agricult land know how forest plant commun recov aft the abandon of forest man or agricult pract includ livestock graz provid a bas for investig how prevy land man hav affect plant specy divers and composit in forest ecosystem our study investig the consequ of hist land man pract on pres day mediter forest by comp specy assembl and the divers of i al plant specy and ii each ecolog group defin by specy habit pref and success stat i e ear mid and lat success specy we comp forest stand that diff both in land us hist and in success stag in addit we evalu the valu of thos stand for biodivers conserv the study rev sign composit differenty among stand that was due to among stand vary in the divers nam specy rich and ev of ear intermedy and lat success specy hist land man has led to an increas in composit diverg among forest stand and the loss of lat success forest specy,new,0.9341190190104576,0.9070734315947782,0.8859843717542252,0.8694040109341458,0.8558333870995737,0.8442391185086738,0.8339419787802865,0.8244117978844633,0.8151493008904963,0.8054617659239355,0.79391506859442
115,medit,Effect of landscape structure on the spatial distribution of Mediterranean dung beetle diversity,"Landscape structure influences the distribution of animals, altering their movements and their ability to reach habitat patches. We analysed the spatial patterns of dung beetle species diversity in three differently structured natural landscapes in a Mediterranean protected area in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. Cabaneros National Park, Central Spain. Diversity components within (alpha) and among (beta) the three main vegetation types in the reserve were compared by using a hierarchical nested design. These were forests, scrublands and grasslands embedded in three different landscapes, where each was the most dominant and structurally connected habitat. Species richness of grassland habitat did not vary across landscapes, but forest habitat showed lower species richness in the grassland-dominated landscape. Scrubland was the least species-rich habitat, but here again there was no significant variation across landscapes. However, in all cases, there was a significant influence of habitat context (configuration of habitat patches within landscape matrix) on similarity of species composition. These tended to be more similar to the dominant landscape matrix where they were embedded, rather than to the same habitat type in other landscapes. Additive partitioning of diversity showed higher than expected values of beta in all landscapes, which indicated a structured response. Highest values of beta in the grassland-dominated landscape suggest that this was the least connected landscape for dung beetles. Our results suggest that in homogeneous conditions of climate and trophic resources, landscape structure may well be more important than habitat type as a determinant of dung beetle distribution in the Mediterranean.",WOS:000265070400013,137,0.909823079,0,effect of landscap structure on the spat distribut of mediter dung beetl divers landscap structure influ the distribut of anim alt their mov and their abl to reach habit patch we analys the spat pattern of dung beetl specy divers in three diff structured nat landscap in a mediter protect are in the cent of the ib peninsul cabanero nat park cent spain divers compon within alph and among bet the three main veget typ in the reserv wer comp by us a hierarch nest design thes wer forest scrublands and grassland embed in three diff landscap wher each was the most domin and structurally connect habit specy rich of grassland habit did not vary across landscap but forest habit show low specy rich in the grassland domin landscap scrubland was the least specy rich habit but her again ther was no sign vary across landscap howev in al cas ther was a sign influ of habit context config of habit patch within landscap matrix on simil of specy composit thes tend to be mor simil to the domin landscap matrix wher they wer embed rath than to the sam habit typ in oth landscap addit partit of divers show high than expect valu of bet in al landscap which ind a structured respons highest valu of bet in the grassland domin landscap suggest that thi was the least connect landscap for dung beetl our result suggest that in homog condit of clim and troph resourc landscap structure may wel be mor import than habit typ as a determin of dung beetl distribut in the mediter,new,0.9156488893887333,0.8794638777823263,0.8500841931768046,0.8263414615255212,0.8065183381730604,0.789309069321946,0.7738512979890059,0.7594509171073309,0.7454393362250972,0.7308559099195178,0.7137515262639498
123,medit,THE IMPACT OF HUMAN LAND USE ON THE COMPOSITION AND RICHNESS OF GROUND AND DUNG BEETLE ASSEMBLAGES,"This paper presents the results of a survey on the habitat and seasonal variation in activity density and richness of ground and dung beetle assemblages in a heterogeneous landscape of central Greece. Beetles were collected using 2,646 pitfall traps across an area of 138 ha representative of the Mediterranean mountainous landscape. Sampling was performed in cereal fields, corn fields, fallow land, grassland, Robinia pseudoacacia plantations, oak forest - farmland ecotone and oak forest using pitfall traps. A total of 18,275 individuals belonging to 38 species were collected, whereas only seven species constituted the 82.64% of the overall captures. Onthophagus ovatus was the most common species in all habitats. Beetle assemblages varied markedly regarding the number of species, while higher densities were reported during June. Significant differences in beetle richness were found considering habitat preferences with the lowest species richness in corn fields. Carabidae assemblages were both most abundant and diverse in plantations, whereas Scarabaeidae assemblages were most abundant and diverse in fallow land. Among estimated diversity indices, Margalef's index generated similar results with the observed diversity, likewise non parametric estimators. Overall, the results obtained in the present study suggest that agricultural areas in mountainous heterogeneous landscape might be the important factor for conserving rich beetle diversity, whereas supplementary biotic factors should be explored.",WOS:000342047200006,175,0.909507823,1,the impact of hum land us on the composit and rich of ground and dung beetl assembl thi pap pres the result of a survey on the habit and season vary in act dens and rich of ground and dung beetl assembl in a heterog landscap of cent greec beetl wer collect us pitfal trap across an are of ha repres of the mediter mountain landscap sampl was perform in cer field corn field fallow land grassland robin pseudoacac plant oak forest farmland ecoton and oak forest us pitfal trap a tot of individ belong to specy wer collect wherea on sev specy constitut the of the overal capt onthophag ovat was the most common specy in al habit beetl assembl vary mark regard the numb of specy whil high dens wer report dur jun sign diff in beetl rich wer found consid habit pref with the lowest specy rich in corn field carabida assembl wer both most abund and divers in plant wherea scarabaeida assembl wer most abund and divers in fallow land among estim divers ind margalef s index gen simil result with the observ divers likew non paramet estim overal the result obtain in the pres study suggest that agricult area in mountain heterog landscap might be the import fact for conserv rich beetl divers wherea suppl biot fact should be expl,new,0.9187012024491507,0.8938744693062652,0.8753123143164137,0.8608937285435783,0.849100764719234,0.838980240726224,0.8299467742705549,0.8215559667812447,0.8134026399528531,0.8049405991745041,0.7951688275949107
133,medit,Effects of forest fragmentation on European birds: implications of regional differences in species richness,"Aim In this paper, we adopted a large-scale approach to evaluate the effect of regional richness of forest birds on the number of bird species retained by forest fragments in several localities across Europe. Location We studied bird assemblages in fourteen forest archipelagos embedded in agricultural matrices from southern Norway to central Spain. Tree composition varied from oak and beech forests of the northern localities to oak and pine xerophitic woodlands of the southern ones. The number of fragments in each forest archipelago ranged from eighteen to 211. Methods We used the Gleason equation (s = a + z log A; where s and A are, respectively, the species richness and size of forest fragments and z the rate of species loss) to estimate the species richness for 1- and 15-ha fragments in each archipelago. The regional richness of forest birds was estimated by modelling the geographical distribution of species richness in the European atlas of breeding birds. Results The latitudinal distribution of regional richness displayed a convex form, with the highest values being in central Europe. Along this gradient, the number of species retained by fragments and the rate of species loss was positively related to regional richness. In addition, the percentage of the regional pool of species sampled by fragments decreased in the southern localities. Main conclusions Relationships between regional richness of forest birds and richness in fragments seem to explain why fragments in central Europe shelter more species than their southern counterparts. The decreased ability of southern forest fragments to sample the regional richness of forest birds, could be explained as an effect of the low abundance of many species in the Mediterranean, which could depress their ability to prevent extinction in fragments by a rescue effect. Alternatively, high beta diversity in the Mediterranean could produce undersampling by fragments of the regional pool of species. These regional differences in the response of bird assemblages to forest fragmentation are used to discuss the usefulness of large-scale, biogeographical approaches in the design of conservation guidelines.",WOS:000182456800012,22,0.906663342,1,effect of forest frag on europ bird imply of reg diff in specy rich aim in thi pap we adopt a larg scal approach to evalu the effect of reg rich of forest bird on the numb of bird specy retain by forest frag in sev loc across europ loc we study bird assembl in fourteen forest archipelago embed in agricult mat from southern norway to cent spain tre composit vary from oak and beech forest of the northern loc to oak and pin xerophit woodland of the southern on the numb of frag in each forest archipelago rang from eighteen to method we us the gleason equ s a z log a wher s and a ar respect the specy rich and siz of forest frag and z the rat of specy loss to estim the specy rich for and ha frag in each archipelago the reg rich of forest bird was estim by model the geograph distribut of specy rich in the europ atla of bree bird result the latitudin distribut of reg rich display a convex form with the highest valu being in cent europ along thi grady the numb of specy retain by frag and the rat of specy loss was posit rel to reg rich in addit the perc of the reg pool of specy sampl by frag decreas in the southern loc main conclud rel between reg rich of forest bird and rich in frag seem to explain why frag in cent europ shelt mor specy than their southern counterpart the decreas abl of southern forest frag to sampl the reg rich of forest bird could be explain as an effect of the low abund of many specy in the mediter which could depress their abl to prev extinct in frag by a rescu effect altern high bet divers in the mediter could produc undersampl by frag of the reg pool of specy thes reg diff in the respons of bird assembl to forest frag ar us to discuss the us of larg scal biogeograph approach in the design of conserv guidelin,new,0.9297537358118576,0.8945757337543556,0.8653319562585668,0.8413507145461402,0.8211399886883285,0.8034905554813155,0.7875561885977362,0.7726266691075228,0.7579858999668473,0.7425535876196608,0.7239406137415261
143,medit,Comparing the role of site disturbance and landscape properties on understory species richness in fragmented periurban Mediterranean forests,"We hypothesized that the spatial configuration and dynamics of periurban forest patches in Barcelona (NE of Spain) played a minor role in determining plant species richness and assemblage compared to site conditions, and particularly to both direct (measured at plot level) and potential (inferred from landscape metrics) human-associated site disturbance. The presence of all understory vascular plants was recorded on 252 plots of 100 m(2) randomly selected within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 ha to 218 ha. Species were divided into 6 groups, according to their ecology and conservation status. Site condition was assessed at plot level and included physical attributes, human-induced disturbance and Quercus spp. tree cover. Landscape structure and dynamics were assessed from patch metrics and patch history. We also calculated a set of landscape metrics related to potential human accessibility to forests. Results of multiple linear regressions indicated that the variance explained for non-forest species groups was higher than for forest species richness. Most of the main correlates corresponded to site disturbance variables related to direct human alteration, or to landscape variables associated to indirect human effects on forests: Quercus tree cover (a proxy for successional status) was the most important correlate of non-forest species richness, which decreased when Quercus tree cover increased. Human-induced disturbance was an important correlate of synanthropic and total species richness, which were higher in recently managed and in highly frequented forests. Potential human accessibility also affected the richness of most species groups. In contrast, patch size, patch shape and connectivity played a minor role, as did patch history. We conclude that human influence on species richness in periurban forests takes place on a small scale, whereas large-scale effects attributable to landscape structure and fragmentation are comparatively less important. Implications of these results for the conservation of plant species in periurban forests are discussed.",WOS:000243619800011,284,0.90647791,1,comp the rol of sit disturb and landscap property on underst specy rich in frag periurb mediter forest we hypothes that the spat config and dynam of periurb forest patch in barcelon ne of spain play a min rol in determin plant specy rich and assembl comp to sit condit and particul to both direct meas at plot level and pot infer from landscap met hum assocy sit disturb the pres of al underst vascul plant was record on plot of m random select within forest patch rang in siz from ha to ha specy wer divid into group accord to their ecolog and conserv stat sit condit was assess at plot level and includ phys attribut hum induc disturb and querc spp tre cov landscap structure and dynam wer assess from patch met and patch hist we also calc a set of landscap met rel to pot hum access to forest result of multipl linear regress ind that the vary explain for non forest specy group was high than for forest specy rich most of the main correl correspond to sit disturb vary rel to direct hum alt or to landscap vary assocy to indirect hum effect on forest querc tre cov a proxy for success stat was the most import correl of non forest specy rich which decreas when querc tre cov increas hum induc disturb was an import correl of synanthrop and tot specy rich which wer high in rec man and in high frequ forest pot hum access also affect the rich of most specy group in contrast patch siz patch shap and connect play a min rol as did patch hist we conclud that hum influ on specy rich in periurb forest tak plac on a smal scal wherea larg scal effect attribut to landscap structure and frag ar comp less import imply of thes result for the conserv of plant specy in periurb forest ar discuss,new,0.9056712140589603,0.8430085217534053,0.7885156178904354,0.7437387335722867,0.7066111802266886,0.6750561600853006,0.6475658043129532,0.6229934640957946,0.6003927493414359,0.5787673788464233,0.5565476054354789
153,medit,The effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities in Mediterranean pine forests: the benefits for declining species,"1. Postfire salvage logging is the most commonly applied forestry practice in burned forests world-wide, mainly for economic reasons. However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes. Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. 2. We surveyed breeding birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird community during the first three springs after fire. 3. Most bird species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to the third. 4. Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species, although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. 5.

164,medit,Forest bird diversity in Mediterranean areas affected by wildfires: a multi-scale approach,"Fire is a key mechanism creating and maintaining habitat heterogeneity in Mediterranean landscapes by turning continuous woody landscapes into mosaics of forests and shrublands. Due to the long historical role of fires in the Mediterranean, we hypothesised a moderate negative effect of this type of perturbation on forest bird distribution at a landscape level. We conducted point bird censuses in Aleppo pine forest patches surrounded by burnt shrublands and studied the relationships between three ecological groups of bird species (forest canopy species, forest understorey species, and ubiquitous species) and the features of local habitat, whole patch and surrounding landscape. We used a multi-scale approach to assess the effects of landscape variables at increasing spatial scales on point bird richness. Regarding local habitat components, canopy species were positively associated with tall pines while understorey species with the cover of shrubs and plants from holm-oak forests. Forest birds were positively related to patch size and irregular forest shapes, that is, with high perimeter/size ratios. Thus, these species did not seem to perceive edges as low quality but rather favourable microhabitats. We did not detect any negative effect of isolation or cover of woodlands in the landscape on the presence of forest species after local habitat factors had been accounted for. Finally, only local habitat factors entered the model for ubiquitous species. We suggest that mosaic-like landscapes shaped by fires in the Mediterranean basin are not strongly associated with negative effects fragmentation on forest birds other than those related with habitat loss.",WOS:000174928500004,234,0.897832361,0,forest bird divers in mediter area affect by wildfir a mult scal approach fir is a key mech cre and maintain habit heterog in mediter landscap by turn continu woody landscap into mosa of forest and shrublands due to the long hist rol of fir in the mediter we hypothes a mod neg effect of thi typ of perturb on forest bird distribut at a landscap level we conduc point bird census in aleppo pin forest patch surround by burnt shrublands and study the rel between three ecolog group of bird specy forest canop specy forest understorey specy and ubiquit specy and the feat of loc habit whol patch and surround landscap we us a mult scal approach to assess the effect of landscap vary at increas spat scal on point bird rich regard loc habit compon canop specy wer posit assocy with tal pin whil understorey specy with the cov of shrubs and plant from holm oak forest forest bird wer posit rel to patch siz and irregul forest shap that is with high perimet siz ratio thu thes specy did not seem to perceiv edg as low qual but rath favo microhabit we did not detect any neg effect of isol or cov of woodland in the landscap on the pres of forest specy aft loc habit fact had been account for fin on loc habit fact ent the model for ubiquit specy we suggest that mosa lik landscap shap by fir in the mediter basin ar not strongly assocy with neg effect frag on forest bird oth than thos rel with habit loss,new,0.9026249970220428,0.8532157825845968,0.8137724623479761,0.7831023209878185,0.7586874100329273,0.7386569776084778,0.7218441346806452,0.7074846679981406,0.6951172790937739,0.6845408312108135,0.6760947919669092
173,medit,"Effects of reforestation with Quercus species on selected arthropod assemblages (Isopoda Oniscidea, Chilopoda, Coleoptera Carabidae) in a Mediterranean area","Arthropod assemblages (Isopoda Oniscidea, Chilopoda, Coleoptera Carabidae) were studied in three 20-year-old reforestations with native oak species (holm-oak Quercus ilex, Turkey-oak Quercus cerris, and downy-oak Quercus pubescens) and in a natural mixed oak forest (Q cerris and Quercus frainetto) in Latium (central Italy). The three reforested areas had been previously used for agricultural purposes. Samples were collected monthly by pitfall traps for a period of 1 year (March 2009-February 2010). Structural parameters and the arthropod assemblage compositions of the four studied areas were compared. The effects of the different forest types and the influence of environmental variables on the activity density of each species were analyzed, with particular emphasis to forest species. Contrary to centipedes and ground beetles, woodlice showed lower values of richness, diversity and equitability in reforestations than in the natural forest. According to Canonical Correspondence Analysis, forest species of woodlice and centipedes resulted mainly associated with forests characterized by a high structural heterogeneity (natural forest and reforestation with Q. pubescens). In these two forests the activity density of centipede forest species is mainly influenced by the coverage of both shrub and leaf litter layer, and woodlice forest species only by the coverage of the latter. The ground beetle forest species were mainly associated with forests characterized by low structural heterogeneity and an almost total closure of the canopy throughout the year (reforestation with Q. ilex). However, some ground beetle forest species are present also in the natural forest. Our results suggest that reforestations with different native broadleaf species belonging to the local ""potential"" vegetation can contribute to the conservation of the diversity of forest arthropod assemblages in the extremely fragmented agricultural landscape of the middle Tyrrhenian area.

183,medit,"Spatial and temporal analysis of the distribution of forest specialists in an urban-fragmented landscape (Madrid, Spain) - Implications for local and regional bird conservation","Management strategies for the regional conservation of forest birds sometimes do not consider explicitly their applicability to areas with different degrees of urbanization. I studied the spatial and temporal distribution of forest passerines in wooded parks in the city of Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons to identify factors relevant to local conservation, and compared these results to previous studies in rural-fragmented forests in central Spain to derive recommendations for local and regional management guidelines. Five independent factors were considered: park size, isolation, density of potential corridors, vegetation structure, and pedestrian rate as an indicator of human disturbance within parks. Species richness and species temporal persistence was positively influenced by park size, shrub and tree cover, number of shrub and tree species, number of thick tree trunks, and negatively by the number of thin tree trunks. Species turnover was negatively affected by park size, such that the temporal persistence of species was enhanced in large parks. The pattern of guild assembly was not random but nested (parks with few species were subsets of progressively richer parks); the accumulation of species being affected mainly by park size and human disturbance, and to a lesser degree by isolation and vegetation structure. With regard to the spatial distribution of individual species, park size and vegetation structure positively influenced five species each, whereas isolation and human disturbance negatively influenced two and one species, respectively. Fragment size and habitat structure were the most relevant factors affecting species richness of forest specialists in both rural and urban fragmented landscapes; therefore, regional conservation strategies to protect these species may also be applicable to urbanized areas in central Spain. However, some specific recommendations should be considered in urban and suburban landscapes: (1) habitat quality ought to be enhanced to meet specific habitat requirements, particularly in large parks; (2) the mechanisms and rates of dispersal of forest birds through the urban matrix should be further studied to improve the movements between regional and local populations; and (3) species-specific variations in tolerance to pedestrians and thresholds levels of human visitation within parks should be determined to minimize human disturbance effects.

195,medit,Influence of secondary forest succession on plant diversity patterns in a Mediterranean landscape,"AimAs a consequence of multiple cycles of deforestation and reforestation, most forest landscapes in Europe consist of a complex mosaic of patches of different successional ages. Despite the biogeographical distinctiveness of the Mediterranean region, studies on the effects of forest age on plant species diversity and composition are almost lacking for this area. This paper evaluates the influence of forest successional age on plant species richness and composition in various forest types of Mediterranean Italy. LocationThe Natura 2000 network of Siena Province, Tuscany, Italy. MethodsOccurrence data on vascular plant species in 208 forest plots were obtained from a larger data set sampled with a stratified random design. The forest successional age of each plot was quantified through a series of historical maps. Species richness and composition were related to the age of the forest by means of GIS techniques and univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. ResultsTotal species richness markedly decreased with increasing successional age due to a significant decrease in the richness of open-habitat species which was not matched by increasing richness of mature forest species. Successional age was the key factor in controlling species richness, while local environmental properties emerged as the main factors shaping community composition. The different forest types showed different temporal trends of species richness and composition and different hierarchies of explanatory factors. Main conclusionsForest successional age emerged as an important factor affecting both species richness and composition, even within the same forest type. Thus, the classification and prioritization of Mediterranean forests exclusively based on present physiognomy or environmental variables causes loss of information about species richness and composition; this could be detrimental for biodiversity conservation.",WOS:000330102600012,81,0.892722282,1,influ of second forest success on plant divers pattern in a mediter landscap aima a consequ of multipl cyc of deforest and reforest most forest landscap in europ consist of a complex mosa of patch of diff success ag despit the biogeograph distinct of the mediter reg study on the effect of forest ag on plant specy divers and composit ar almost lack for thi are thi pap evalu the influ of forest success ag on plant specy rich and composit in vary forest typ of mediter ita locationth natur network of sien provint tuscany ita methodsoccur dat on vascul plant specy in forest plot wer obtain from a larg dat set sampl with a stratified random design the forest success ag of each plot was quant through a sery of hist map specy rich and composit wer rel to the ag of the forest by mean of gis techn and un and mult stat analys resultstot specy rich mark decreas with increas success ag due to a sign decreas in the rich of op habit specy which was not match by increas rich of mat forest specy success ag was the key fact in control specy rich whil loc environ property emerg as the main fact shap commun composit the diff forest typ show diff temp trend of specy rich and composit and diff hierarchy of expl fact main conclusionsforest success ag emerg as an import fact affect both specy rich and composit ev within the sam forest typ thu the class and priorit of mediter forest exclud bas on pres physiognom or environ vary caus loss of inform about specy rich and composit thi could be detry for biodivers conserv,new,0.9234262170811268,0.8738274040041868,0.8317071132910638,0.7974351961116394,0.7689875003581688,0.7446178214772926,0.7230981006988135,0.7034641866075885,0.6848313465543199,0.6660218267661442,0.6445075889441341
48,medit,Can native plant species be preserved in an anthro-pogenic forest landscape dominated by aliens? A case study from Mediterranean Chile,"Plantations with fast growing exotic tree species can negatively affect native plant species diversity and promote the spread of alien species. Mediterranean Chile experienced major landscape changes with a vast expansion of industrial plantations of Pinus radiata in the past. However, with increasing knowledge of biodiversity effects on ecosystem services Chilean forest owners now aim to integrate the conservation of native biodiversity into forest management, but data on native species diversity and establishment within a plantation landscape is scarce. Here we investigated plant species diversity and composition in four forest management options applied within a landscape dominated by P. radiata plantations in comparison to an unmanaged reference: (i) a clear cut, (ii) a strip cut, (iii) a native canopy of Nothofagus glauca and (iv) a young P. radiata plantation. We wanted to assess if native plant species can be maintained either by natural regeneration or by planting of native tree species (Nothofagus glauca, N. obliqua, Quillaja saponaria) within this landscape. Results show a high diversity of native and forest plant species within the different management options indicating a high potential for native biodiversity restoration within an anthropogenic landscape. In particular, herbaceous species can benefit from management. They are rare in unmanaged natural forests that are characterized by low light conditions and a thick litter layer. Management, however, also promoted a diversity of alien species. The rapid spread of alien grass species after management can deter an initial establishment of native tree species or the survival and growth after planting mainly under dry but less under sufficient moisture conditions. The most unsuccessful option for promoting native plant species was clear cutting in a dry area where alien grasses were abundant. For drought-tolerant tree species such as Quillaja saponaria, though, even a joint establishment with Pinus radiata seems possible.",WOS:000381649500006,4,0.859796566,1,can nat plant specy be preserv in an anthro pog forest landscap domin by aly a cas study from mediter chil plant with fast grow exot tre specy can neg affect nat plant specy divers and promot the spread of aly specy mediter chil expery maj landscap chang with a vast expand of indust plant of pin radiat in the past howev with increas knowledg of biodivers effect on ecosystem serv chil forest own now aim to integr the conserv of nat biodivers into forest man but dat on nat specy divers and est within a plant landscap is scarc her we investig plant specy divers and composit in four forest man opt apply within a landscap domin by p radiat plant in comparison to an unm ref i a clear cut ii a strip cut ii a nat canop of nothofag glauc and iv a young p radiat plant we want to assess if nat plant specy can be maintain eith by nat reg or by plant of nat tre specy nothofag glauc n obliqu quillaj saponar within thi landscap result show a high divers of nat and forest plant specy within the diff man opt ind a high pot for nat biodivers rest within an anthropog landscap in particul herbac specy can benefit from man they ar rar in unm nat forest that ar charact by low light condit and a thick lit lay man howev also promot a divers of aly specy the rapid spread of aly grass specy aft man can det an init est of nat tre specy or the surv and grow aft plant main und dry but less und sufficy moist condit the most unsuccess opt for promot nat plant specy was clear cut in a dry are wher aly grass wer abund for drought tol tre specy such as quillaj saponar though ev a joint est with pin radiat seem poss,new,0.8916976449858974,0.8406587475597467,0.8005400660221813,0.7687564073573256,0.7425725229964865,0.72013672605603,0.7002228439065918,0.6818709900162164,0.6641488042945504,0.6456965608011648,0.6234376800094688
56,medit,"Post-fire salvage logging alters species composition and reduces cover, richness, and diversity in Mediterranean plant communities","An intense debate exists on the effects of post-fire salvage logging on plant community regeneration, but scant data are available derived from experimental studies. We analyzed the effects of salvage logging on plant community regeneration in terms of species richness, diversity, cover, and composition by experimentally managing a burnt forest on a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, S Spain). In each of three plots located at different elevations, three replicates of three treatments were implemented seven months after the fire, differing in the degree of intervention: ""Non-Intervention"" (all trees left standing), ""Partial Cut plus Lopping"" (felling 90% of the trees, cutting the main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ), and ""Salvage Logging"" (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody debris). Plant composition in each treatment was monitored two years after the fire in linear point transects. Post-fire salvage logging was associated with reduced species richness, Shannon diversity, and total plant cover. Moreover, salvaged sites hosted different species assemblages and 25% lower cover of seeder species (but equal cover of resprouters) compared to the other treatments. Cover of trees and shrubs was also lowest in Salvage Logging, which could suggest a potential slow-down of forest regeneration. Most of these results were consistent among the three plots despite plots hosting different plant communities. Concluding, our study suggests that salvage logging may reduce species richness and diversity, as well as the recruitment of woody species, which could delay the natural regeneration of the ecosystem.

73,medit,Spontaneous restoration of epiphytic lichen biota in managed forests planted on habitats typical for temperate deciduous forest,"The study examines the changes of epiphytic lichen diversity in differently aged stands developing after clear cutting and pine planting on fertile habitats typical for deciduous forests. The study was conducted within one large complex consisting of pine, mixed pine-hornbeam and typical old oak-linden-hornbeam forests in northern Poland. Epiphytic lichens were recorded in 50 study plots randomly selected within 5 forest stand classes of a different structure and age, ranging from 80 to over 220 years. Altogether 143 lichen species were recorded, of which only 41 were entirely nonspecific, and were occurring in all the studied forest stand classes. Significant differences in lichen species richness between stand classes were found and the number of species increases with the forest age. Lichen species composition also differs and its changes progress towards restoration of lichen biota typical for deciduous forest consistent with the habitat. The age of the forest has the most significant effect on the biodiversity of lichen biota. Microhabitat space provided by oaks is highly desirable since it greatly enriches lichen biota in forests. Phorophyte specificity of particular lichens were assessed. Hornbeam and oak have the greatest number of species mostly confined to them and constitute a main refuge for lichens with a high conservation value. The changes of lichen biota are basically parallel with the changes of the forest stand structure. The selection of some parts within managed pine forests that should not be assigned for cutting in the future can be a simple procedure which helps to restore and preserve forest biodiversity.",WOS:000380111500008,16,0.83341312,1,spont rest of epiphys lich biot in man forest plant on habit typ for temp decidu forest the study examin the chang of epiphys lich divers in diff ag stand develop aft clear cut and pin plant on fertil habit typ for decidu forest the study was conduc within on larg complex consist of pin mix pin hornbeam and typ old oak lind hornbeam forest in northern poland epiphys lich wer record in study plot random select within forest stand class of a diff structure and ag rang from to ov year altogeth lich specy wer record of which on wer entir nonspec and wer occur in al the study forest stand class sign diff in lich specy rich between stand class wer found and the numb of specy increas with the forest ag lich specy composit also diff and it chang progress toward rest of lich biot typ for decidu forest consist with the habit the ag of the forest has the most sign effect on the biodivers of lich biot microhabit spac provid by oak is high desir sint it gre enrich lich biot in forest phorophyt spec of particul lich wer assess hornbeam and oak hav the greatest numb of specy most confin to them and constitut a main refug for lich with a high conserv valu the chang of lich biot ar bas parallel with the chang of the forest stand structure the select of som part within man pin forest that should not be assign for cut in the fut can be a simpl proc which help to rest and preserv forest biodivers,new,0.8722522677129347,0.797280632364407,0.7374935677552275,0.6911906127742131,0.6543765614210114,0.6241828780447638,0.5987637248058542,0.5769060745131233,0.5577926786931092,0.5409000121352228,0.5260210673075684
88,medit,"Response of plant functional groups within plantations and naturally regenerated forests in southern New Brunswick, Canada","We examined the composition of understory vascular plant species in managed forests to determine how life-history attributes influence plant response to disturbance. Forest types investigated were plantations on old fields (31-77 years old, n = 6), plantations on cutover land (19-64 years old, n = 8), young forests naturally regenerated after clear-cutting (27-66 years old, n = 6), and mature natural forests with no recent harvesting activity (80-100 years old, n = 6). Species were categorized by habitat preference (forest, intermediate, disturbed), growth form (12 categories), and life form (15 categories). Forest-habitat species dominated both natural stand types, whereas disturbed-habitat species dominated both plantation types. Mature natural stands contained higher frequency and cover of many herb growth forms, and cutover plantations contained higher values for shrubs. Old-field plantations contained low values for all growth forms. Two life forms, geophytes and rosette hemicryptophytes, were not well represented in either plantation type.

1301,medit,Vegetation structure of planted versus natural Aleppo pine stands along a climatic gradient in Spain,"Reforestation programmes have been widely used in many forest areas worldwide but scarcely compared to nearby natural woodlands. As an example, we selected a Pinus species devoted to the Mediterranean basin in order to validate the naturalness of the plantations. We found that natural Aleppo pine stands are more structurally complex with more developed and diverse understory compared to planted stands. Maintaining a large biodiversity is a major concern for reforestation programmes in the Mediterranean basin, which displays a large area of planted forests. We compared mature planted forests (over 50 years old) to nearby natural forests in relation to the structure, composition and diversity of the understory vegetation. An efficient comparison method should provide guidelines to improve the effectiveness of reforestation management programmes. We selected three pairs of nearby planted and natural Pinus halepensis Mill. stands in southeastern Spain along a precipitation gradient and compared stand overstory structure (density, basal area and canopy cover), and understory vegetation (plant cover, species richness and evenness index). Pine tree density was lower but basal area was higher in natural stands than in the nearby planted stands. Natural stands displayed also higher understory plant cover and species richness, but no difference was found regarding evenness. These differences were larger in the most mesic sites and were due to the density and arrangement of the pine tree cover. These results provide (i) valuable information for evaluating the success of reforestation programmes to recreate natural forest ecosystems and (ii) guidelines for silviculture and management.",WOS:000356794100013,12,0.8051742909999999,1,veget structure of plant vers nat aleppo pin stand along a clim grady in spain reforest program hav been wid us in many forest area worldwid but scarc comp to nearby nat woodland as an exampl we select a pin specy devot to the mediter basin in ord to valid the nat of the plant we found that nat aleppo pin stand ar mor structurally complex with mor develop and divers underst comp to plant stand maintain a larg biodivers is a maj concern for reforest program in the mediter basin which display a larg are of plant forest we comp mat plant forest ov year old to nearby nat forest in rel to the structure composit and divers of the underst veget an efficy comparison method should provid guidelin to improv the effect of reforest man program we select three pair of nearby plant and nat pin halepens mil stand in southeastern spain along a precipit grady and comp stand overst structure dens bas are and canop cov and underst veget plant cov specy rich and ev index pin tre dens was low but bas are was high in nat stand than in the nearby plant stand nat stand display also high underst plant cov and specy rich but no diff was found regard ev thes diff wer larg in the most mes sit and wer due to the dens and arrang of the pin tre cov thes result provid i valu inform for evalu the success of reforest program to recr nat forest ecosystem and ii guidelin for silvicult and man,new,0.850852089293471,0.8011749544766474,0.7676033575171077,0.7442402597284532,0.7272355315284638,0.7145636590154961,0.7051882113361425,0.6986555492761086,0.6950354169109846,0.6951965107739848,0.7021377020188827
145,medit,"Effects of different site preparation treatments on species diversity, composition, and plant traits in Pinus halepensis woodlands","Biodiversity maintenance is a key component of Mediterranean forest management, yet studies on the effects of silvicultural treatments on plant diversity are scarce. Our experiment assessed the impact of five different site preparation treatments on the composition, diversity, ecological traits (life-form, pollination mode, leaf morphology, seed dispersal mode), indicator values (shade tolerance, nutrients demand) of the understory vegetation in a mature thinned Pinus halepensis stand in southern France. The treatments-chopping, chopping followed by scarification in one or two directions, prescribed burning, control-were replicated four times and applied on a total of 40 plots. Vegetation relev,s were performed on each plot in the first, second and fourth year following treatment applications. Plant diversity, measured by the species richness or Shannon's index, increased in the non-control treatment plots in the first year but then decreased through time. Vegetation composition differed between treatments, with the chopping treatment exhibiting composition and ecological trait values more comparable to those of control plots than the other treatments. The burning and scarification treatments led to higher abundance of therophytes, plants with malacophyllous leaves and insect-pollinated plants, and shade-intolerant and nutrient-demanding species. However, these changes were transient in time, the shade-intolerant species remained abundant but the ruderal species decreased while the ligneous species increased indicating a gradual return to a forest vegetation composition. For the Mediterranean area, most of the findings were similar to those in temperate forests subjected to the same site preparation treatments.",WOS:000288557700010,14,0.799258224,1,effect of diff sit prep tre on specy divers composit and plant trait in pin halepens woodland biodivers maint is a key compon of mediter forest man yet study on the effect of silvicult tre on plant divers ar scarc our expery assess the impact of fiv diff sit prep tre on the composit divers ecolog trait lif form pollin mod leaf morpholog see dispers mod ind valu shad tol nutry demand of the underst veget in a mat thin pin halepens stand in southern frant the tre chop chop follow by scar in on or two direct prescrib burn control wer reply four tim and apply on a tot of plot veget relev s wer perform on each plot in the first second and four year follow tre apply plant divers meas by the specy rich or shannon s index increas in the non control tre plot in the first year but then decreas through tim veget composit diff between tre with the chop tre exhibit composit and ecolog trait valu mor comp to thos of control plot than the oth tre the burn and scar tre led to high abund of therophyt plant with malacophyl leav and insect pollin plant and shad intol and nutry demand specy howev thes chang wer transy in tim the shad intol specy remain abund but the rud specy decreas whil the lign specy increas ind a grad return to a forest veget composit for the mediter are most of the find wer simil to thos in temp forest subject to the sam sit prep tre,new,0.8173475461427656,0.7487663602913958,0.700656846792697,0.6659747885556109,0.639808518362463,0.6194643427368701,0.6034624968809168,0.5910192875893859,0.5818838107294101,0.5764951881036064,0.5769301953291375

269,medit,Plant species diversity changes in abandoned chestnut (Castanea sativa) groves in southern France,"Over the last few decades, marked land use changes have taken place in many Mediterranean ecosystems. For example, many chestnut groves in France are now abandoned and have turned into 'natural' coppice stands while others are now dear-cut every 10 or 15 years for wood. Species composition and life form diversity of the plant communities have changed markedly both in the abandoned groves and in the periodically clear-cut coppice stands. What are the consequences of these changes on biodiversity at local and regional scales, and what are the implications for 'new Forestry' management intended to conserve biodiversity at the same time as it optimizes productivity and profitability? To answer these questions we studied plant species diversity in the understorey strata along a successional gradient including cultivated grove; abandoned grove: young (15 years old), medium (40 years), and old (>55 years) coppice stands. The results showed that species richness decreased quickly but not steadily along this gradient. but life-form spectra data highlighted that the high levels of plant species biodiversity in cultivated groves were due primarily to the large number of therophytes (annual plants). Ar a shorter time scale, we also studied the consequences of experimental clear-cutting on plans species biodiversity. Direct measurements over four years showed that species richness and diversity in the understorey increased in the first two years after clear-cutting, but decreased during the 3rd and 4th years. This decrease corresponded closely with a steady increase in Leaf Area Index of the forest canopy. These results have been used to suggest some possible ways to manage the biodiversity in these ecosystems.",WOS:000167731900004,2,0.746401012,1,plant specy divers chang in abandon chestnut castane sativ grov in southern frant ov the last few decad mark land us chang hav tak plac in many mediter ecosystem for exampl many chestnut grov in frant ar now abandon and hav turn into nat cop stand whil oth ar now dear cut every or year for wood specy composit and lif form divers of the plant commun hav chang mark both in the abandon grov and in the period clear cut cop stand what ar the consequ of thes chang on biodivers at loc and reg scal and what ar the imply for new forestry man intend to conserv biodivers at the sam tim as it optim produc and profit to answ thes quest we study plant specy divers in the understorey strata along a success grady includ cult grov abandon grov young year old med year and old year cop stand the result show that specy rich decreas quick but not steady along thi grady but lif form spectr dat highlight that the high level of plant specy biodivers in cult grov wer due prim to the larg numb of therophyt an plant ar a short tim scal we also study the consequ of expery clear cut on plan specy biodivers direct meas ov four year show that specy rich and divers in the understorey increas in the first two year aft clear cut but decreas dur the rd and th year thi decreas correspond clos with a steady increas in leaf are index of the forest canop thes result hav been us to suggest som poss way to man the biodivers in thes ecosystem,new,0.7981007439506889,0.7380085171351827,0.6976286093177488,0.6690944042183709,0.647966894075595,0.6319772134486299,0.619969145423695,0.6114594467441319,0.6065822511492703,0.6064755295709173,0.6149501650933866

We evaluated the impact of eucalypt plantations on native bats in a Mediterranean area, taking Portugal as a case study. We compared the overall bat activity, species richness and Kuhl's bat Pipistrellus kuhlii (the most abundant bat species in the area) activity between eucalypt plantations and native montado habitat, and examined the influence of stand, landscape and survey variables within plantations on the response variables. A set of 11 plantation stands, three landscape and two survey variables were employed as predictor variables using a zero-inflated Poisson generalized linear mixed model. Hawking and generalist bats of the genus Pipistrellus were the most frequently detected species. Bat activity, species richness and P.kuhlii activity were higher in native montado than in any of the eucalypt stands. Mature eucalypt plantations showed the highest bat activity, while clear-cut areas showed the lowest. Generally, within eucalypt stands, complex high-level vegetation structure, from the ground level up to 3m high, and proximity to water points were associated with higher levels of bat and P.kuhlii activity and species richness. The results suggest that in order to promote bat diversity and activity in exotic eucalypt plantations in the Mediterranean region, it is important to provide a high density of water points, maintain plots of mature plantations and promote understorey clutter.",WOS:000369174200007,10,0.746016861,1,bat lik vint man exot eucalypt plant for bat conserv in a mediter landscap the transform of nat habit into forest plant for indust purpos frequ has neg consequ for biodivers we evalu the impact of eucalypt plant on nat bat in a mediter are tak portug as a cas study we comp the overal bat act specy rich and kuhl s bat pipistrell kuhli the most abund bat specy in the are act between eucalypt plant and nat montado habit and examin the influ of stand landscap and survey vary within plant on the respons vary a set of plant stand three landscap and two survey vary wer employ as predict vary us a zero infl poisson gen linear mix model hawk and gen bat of the gen pipistrell wer the most frequ detect specy bat act specy rich and p kuhli act wer high in nat montado than in any of the eucalypt stand mat eucalypt plant show the highest bat act whil clear cut area show the lowest gen within eucalypt stand complex high level veget structure from the ground level up to m high and proxim to wat point wer assocy with high level of bat and p kuhli act and specy rich the result suggest that in ord to promot bat divers and act in exot eucalypt plant in the mediter reg it is import to provid a high dens of wat point maintain plot of mat plant and promot understorey clut,new,0.76921614725489,0.7446324255875418,0.7318423717742217,0.7254051768050619,0.7230013687979459,0.723664105743936,0.7271306721168276,0.7336527219359888,0.7441556932205323,0.7609403138710512,0.7900236069193687
318,medit,Influence of harvesting intensity on the floristic composition of natural Mediterranean maritime pine forest,"Understorey plant species composition is an important part of forest ecosystems and its conservation is becoming an increasingly frequent objective in forest management plans. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the effect of timber harvesting on the characteristic understorey species in the Mediterranean region. We investigated the effects of three different harvest intensities on the short-term dynamics of understorey vegetation in a natural Maritime pine forest in Spain, and compared the results with uncut controls. Clear-cutting induced both qualitative and quantitative differences with respect to the controls, but intermediate levels of harvesting (25% and 50% removal) induced only quantitative differences. Harvesting reduced the frequency and cover of 56% of characteristic forest species, but only 22% showed an increase. Of the most abundant plant families only the Fabaceae showed a significant response with respect to harvesting intensity. Our findings suggest that Light- and Medium-harvest regimes are better management options than clear-cutting if the aim is to conserve the understorey vegetation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

453,medit,"Elevation and exposition rather than soil types determine communities and site suitability in Mediterranean mountain forests of southern Anatolia, Turkey","The forest resources of south Anatolia (Turkey) are characterized by historical degradation due to wood extraction, overgrazing and fire. In a context of forest restoration, natural vegetation distribution patterns and plant community compositions need to be known and integrated in a framework for site classification. Accordingly, we sampled 153 plots at random along 20 transects perpendicular to the contour lines. In every plot we recorded biotic variables (plant species covers) to describe the vegetation composition; abiotic variables (encompassing landscape and soil characteristics) to assess the site quality; and tree population characteristics to define site index of Pinus brutia and Pinus nigra. Five communities were identified using MRPP and indicator species analysis. Indirect gradients were analysed with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). In the ordination, the first NMDS axis (explaining 27% of the variation) separated three groups along an elevation gradient and the second axis (23%) two groups with contrasting exposition at the highest altitudes. Litter characteristics were the main environmental gradient according to PCA, but were only relevant to discriminate between two communities at intermediate altitude. P brutia performed best below 800 m in a Eu-Mediterranean climate. Sites above 1000 m were more suitable for P. nigra. Abies cilicica and Cedrus libani were identified as potential climax species of mountainous Mediterranean communities at the highest elevations, more specifically at the colder, wetter expositions and at the dryer, warmer expositions, respectively. Threats to the survival of A. cilicica, caused by clear cutting in the present silvicultural system, may be alleviated by adopting a shelterwood system in the higher altitudinal range.

We investigated the effect of three different harvest intensities, respect to uncut controls, on understory plant species functional groups, richness, diversity and pine seedlings in a natural Maritime pine stand in Spain, three years after harvesting. The harvest treatments produced a reduction of the number of Pinus pinaster seedlings and woody species cover, and an increase of species richness (total and of annual species) and plant cover of annual species respect to control plots (CO). The Shannon diversity values showed no differences between treatments. These results emphasize that the tree harvest treatments analyzed are not suitable for the management of this P. pinaster stand.

504,medit,SEED BANKS AND FOREST RECRUITMENT AFTER DISTURBANCE: THE COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE OF SEED AFTER THE CLEAR-CUT OF STONE PINE (PINUS PINEA L.) PLANTATIONS,"Seed banks play a key role in the recruitment of forest vegetation after severe disturbance, but can originate an undesired plant community. Thus, investigations on seed bank structure, and early changes occurring after clear-cut, are of primary interest for sustainable forest management. Researches were carried out in two mature stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) plantations located in Tuscany (Italy), along the Mediterranean coast. Soil samples were collected in March, July and October of the 2nd and 3rd year after clear-cut, in cut strips and adjacent intact stands. Seed bank size and composition were evaluated through the number of seedlings and species emerged from soil samples. Intact plantations differed in seed bank richness and composition, but not in abundance that was approximately 1,200 seeds m(-2). Clear-cut doubled seed density in soil, did not change seed bank richness, and affected markedly composition. Seed banks of cut strips were richer in annual and open space species, and poorer in perennial, forest and disturbed sites species. Seeds of Erica scoparia dominated the seed bank, with a relative abundance of 60% in intact stands and 43% in cut strips. Proportion of annual seeds was slightly less than 20% in intact stands, but increased up to 50% after clear-cut.

551,medit,Forest management and plant species diversity in chestnut stands of three Mediterranean areas,"Over many centuries, chestnut fruits had an important role as food, while chestnut wood was used for local purposes. Today sweet chestnut stands are very common around the western Mediterranean Basin, and it is necessary to analyze the dynamic of plant species diversity in different chestnut stand types (groves and coppices) to guide management strategies that will allow the conservation of biodiversity. Our objective was to analyze consequences on plant species diversity of various management strategies in chestnut stands of three Mediterranean areas, Salamanca (Spain), the Cevennes (France), and Etna volcano (Italy). We found that plant species diversity is different according to management types; it is higher in groves than in coppice stands. We also demonstrated that Castanea sativa cultivated groves were characterized by small heliophillous therophytes. C. sativa abandoned groves, mixed C. sativa-Quercus pyrenaica coppice stands, Q. pyrenaica coppice stands, and young C. sativa coppice stands were characterized by hemicryptophytes with anemochorous dispersal mode and chamaephytes. Medium and old C. sativa coppice stands (that differ by the shoot age) were characterized by phanerophytes with zoochorous dispersal mode. Human perturbations maintain a quite high level of species diversity. In contrast, the abandonment of chestnut stands leads to homogeneous vegetation with decreasing diversity. One solution could be to maintain a landscape mosaic constituted of diverse chestnut stands modified by human activities (groves, cultivated or abandoned, and coppice stands). This could enhance regional plant diversity.",WOS:000238453600005,15,0.659512703,1,forest man and plant specy divers in chestnut stand of three mediter area ov many century chestnut fruit had an import rol as food whil chestnut wood was us for loc purpos today sweet chestnut stand ar very common around the western mediter basin and it is necess to analys the dynam of plant specy divers in diff chestnut stand typ grov and cop to guid man strategies that wil allow the conserv of biodivers our object was to analys consequ on plant specy divers of vary man strategies in chestnut stand of three mediter area salamanc spain the ceven frant and etn volcano ita we found that plant specy divers is diff accord to man typ it is high in grov than in cop stand we also demonst that castane sativ cult grov wer charact by smal heliophil therophyt c sativ abandon grov mix c sativ querc pyrenaic cop stand q pyrenaic cop stand and young c sativ cop stand wer charact by hemicryptophyt with anemoch dispers mod and chamaephyt med and old c sativ cop stand that diff by the shoot ag wer charact by phanerophyt with zooch dispers mod hum perturb maintain a quit high level of specy divers in contrast the abandon of chestnut stand lead to homog veget with decreas divers on solv could be to maintain a landscap mosa constitut of divers chestnut stand mod by hum act grov cult or abandon and cop stand thi could enh reg plant divers,new,0.682017491826667,0.6571873736509141,0.6462772195348148,0.6423616962836627,0.6428780415981177,0.6469318564543624,0.6544207251312912,0.6658817328563913,0.6827535767080398,0.7083794176951249,0.7511752578419304
593,medit,Lack of thinning effects over inter-annual changes in soil fungal community and diversity in a Mediterranean pine forest,"Predicted changes in global climate might negatively affect the soil microbiome and associated ecosystem processes in Mediterranean forests. Forest treatments, such as forest thinning, have been suggested to mitigate climate change impacts on vegetation by reducing competition between trees, thus increasing water availability. Studies addressing the combined effects of climate and forest thinning on belowground fungal communities are still scarce, being fundamental to elaborate adaptive strategies to global warming. he aim of this study was to evaluate the tree density reduction effects on soil fungal communities and their response to inter-annual changes in weather conditions. The temporal dynamics of soil fungal communities in relation to these two drivers (i.e., forest management and weather conditions) were studied from 2009 until 2014 in a set of 12 pairs of thinned and un-thinned plots dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. Thinning (from 30% up to 70% reduction in stand basal area) was conducted in 2009 and soil fungal community composition was studied during 4 years. Here, we used autumn precipitation and temperature to describe the impact of inter annual weather changes. We used Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons to study fungal communities in soil samples. Forest thinning did not significantly affect fungal community composition nor fungal species richness and diversity, indicating that the soil fungal community is resistant to forest thinning regardless of its intensity. However, fungal species composition changed progressively across years, both at the species level and with regards to functional guilds. These changes in community composition were partly driven by inter-annual variation in precipitation and temperature, with free-living fungi increasing in abundance under wetter conditions, and symbiotic fungi being more prominent under drier and colder conditions. The results indicate that mycorrhizal communities in Mediterranean forest ecosystems can resist forest thinning, if enough trees and functional roots from thinned trees are retained.",WOS:000437967900039,18,0.646032611,1,lack of thin effect ov int an chang in soil fung commun and divers in a mediter pin forest predict chang in glob clim might neg affect the soil microbiom and assocy ecosystem process in mediter forest forest tre such as forest thin hav been suggest to mitig clim chang impact on veget by reduc competit between tre thu increas wat avail study address the combin effect of clim and forest thin on belowground fung commun ar stil scarc being funda to elab adapt strategies to glob warm he aim of thi study was to evalu the tre dens reduc effect on soil fung commun and their respons to int an chang in weath condit the temp dynam of soil fung commun in rel to thes two driv i e forest man and weath condit wer study from until in a set of pair of thin and un thin plot domin by pin pinast ait thin from up to reduc in stand bas are was conduc in and soil fung commun composit was study dur year her we us autumn precipit and temp to describ the impact of int an weath chang we us pac bioscy sequ of fung it amplicon to study fung commun in soil sampl forest thin did not sign affect fung commun composit nor fung specy rich and divers ind that the soil fung commun is resist to forest thin regardless of it intens howev fung specy composit chang progress across year both at the specy level and with regard to funct guild thes chang in commun composit wer part driv by int an vary in precipit and temp with fre liv fung increas in abund und wet condit and symbiot fung being mor promin und dri and cold condit the result ind that mycorrh commun in mediter forest ecosystem can resist forest thin if enough tre and funct root from thin tre ar retain,new,0.7056203156043576,0.6207621087415341,0.5672528554723398,0.5322809187266992,0.5084686957771898,0.49217662160122155,0.4816296141107061,0.4761844883017683,0.4762175716601922,0.4838083760217834,0.5057542866315715
879,medit,Plant functional types: a promising tool for management and restoration of degraded lands,"Throughout the Mediterranean region, vegetation dynamics are affected by human activities which are either 'stresses' or 'disturbances', depending on their frequency, intensity and spatial distribution. To minimize or reduce anthropogenic degradation caused by land use and other disturbances, it is necessary to understand and predict the various responses of plant communities to disturbances. In particular, detailed but integrative approaches are required to assimilate large databases on vegetation and to make them directly useful for managers and restorers. We describe two case studies undertaken to evaluate the effects of logging or overgrazing on plant species diversity in pine forests of southern France and steppe ecosystems of southern Tunisia. Both studies employed the same methodology to identify plant functional traits (morphological, life history and regeneration traits) associated with community response to disturbance. The results of these analyses allowed us to develop state and transition models that could be used to plan and predict ecosystem trajectories, assess ongoing degradation processes and monitor community and ecosystem responses to management and restoration practices. We discuss the relevance and the use of plant functional types (PFTs) as tools for ecosystem management and planning and for monitoring restoration in southern Europe, northern Africa and elsewhere.

1227,medit,Ecology and classification of forests in Turkey,"Turkey possesses all types of parent materials or bedrocks like metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic belonging to different geological era and periods. Some parent materials contain evaporitic sediments with salt, gypsum and high contents of alkaline materials which mostly prevent the growth of climax vegetation. The country has a rugged and high topography, related to tectonic movements, and volcanic activities which mainly occurred in Tertiary and Quaternary eras. The mountains are divided into three groups in terms of formation and ecological importance namely; orogenic mountains, volcanic mountains and uplifted blocks or horst mountains. The ecological importance of the topography is fully stressed by altitude, aspect and climate. The forests in Turkey can be classified on the basis of ecological features as: humid-mild deciduous, humid-cold coniferous on the north facing slopes of coastal belt of Northern Anatolian Mountains; subhumid-cold continental coniferous in the north facing slopes of backward part of Northern Anatolian Mountains; subhumid-semiarid semi continental coniferous on the plateau and mountains of southern basins of northern Anatolian Mountains; semiarid continental timer Anatolia Quercus spp. - Juniper spp. - Pinus nigra, semiarid-subhumid Quercus spp., Mediterranean Pinus brutia and oro-Mediterranean coniferous. The excessive cutting, wrong silvicultural practices, opening of agricultural fields inside the forests, and clear-cutting system are changing the vegetation structure of forests. Some of the forests in the country are accepted as relict forests. (C) 2013 The Authors.

1317,medit,Past tree range dynamics in the Iberian Peninsula inferred through phylogeography and palaeodistribution modelling: A review,"The forests in the Iberian Peninsula have been strongly influenced by past climatic changes, but reconstructing their historical distributions and dynamics is very difficult due to the complex climatic characteristics and relief of the region. Research disciplines such as phylogeography and species distribution modelling can describe the past range dynamics of individual tree species in relatively great detail and help elucidate how these species have reacted to climatic changes. Here we review phylogeographical and modelling studies from species representative of the major Iberian forest types and attempt to extract general trends from the diversity of individual species histories in the Peninsula. To date most studies focus on geographical range dynamics during the Pleistocene, but an increasing body of evidence shows that some species have also retained the genetic imprints of much more ancient processes. Many widespread Iberian species show a deep and often remarkably clear-cut divide between populations from the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic regions of the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting that both areas have independently sustained viable populations over extended periods. In fact, phylogeographical studies commonly find that species had several glacial refugia across the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, distribution models help identifying further suitable areas that could have sustained so far undetected refugia. Such studies are of interest for species conservation, because refugium populations are high-priority targets due to their long-term persistence and unique evolutionary trajectory. Overall, we conclude that palaeoecology, phylogeography and species distribution modelling have a great potential to inform each other because of their complementary perspectives and results. A true integration of these approaches is therefore fundamental for further progress in our understanding of past Iberian environments and the organisms they harboured. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this work is to compare plant diversity, bare soil percentage, biomass and botanical composition between grazed and non-grazed areas at different times following grazing exclusion. Methods - Vegetation was assessed on exclosures established in 2006 and on nearby areas open to grazing by feral horses in December 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2009 we added 15 year old exclosures to the analysis. Key results - Species richness declined 24 months after grazing exclusion, mainly due to a decrease in the abundance of forb species. Bare soil percentage was significantly reduced 12 months after exclosures were built. Above-ground biomass showed a 3-fold increase 12 months after grazing exclusion. After three years, species richness and biomass were similar to those corresponding to older exclosures (15-years old). The composition of plant communities also changed following horse exclusion, with three and 15-years old exclosures dominated by perennial grasses typical of late seral stages. Conclusions - Our results support the hypothesis that natural montane grasslands in the Southern Pampas of Argentina may recover fast from grazing by large herbivores without application of specific restoration techniques.",WOS:000309900100003,1,0.6948965890000001,1,veget chang in respons to graz exclud in mont grassland argentin background and aim nat mont grassland in the southern pampa of argentin ar expect to show a high pot for recovery aft heavy graz due to their evolv hist in the pres of larg herb and their high produc the object of thi work is to comp plant divers bar soil perc biomass and bot composit between graz and non graz area at diff tim follow graz exclud method veget was assess on exclos est in and on nearby area op to graz by fer hors in decemb and in we ad year old exclos to the analys key result specy rich declin month aft graz exclud main due to a decreas in the abund of forb specy bar soil perc was sign reduc month aft exclos wer built abov ground biomass show a fold increas month aft graz exclud aft three year specy rich and biomass wer simil to thos correspond to old exclos year old the composit of plant commun also chang follow hors exclud with three and year old exclos domin by peren grass typ of lat ser stag conclud our result support the hypothes that nat mont grassland in the southern pampa of argentin may recov fast from graz by larg herb without apply of spec rest techn,new,0.7542977569090598,0.6811946585494351,0.63441132313023,0.6027148870165576,0.5800611861822124,0.5635601665264981,0.5518057064640992,0.5442575052299821,0.541188495266397,0.5442003904654257,0.5585425362798916

Here, we seek to understand how grazing intensity influences swamp vegetation, with an emphasis on their diversity, structure and function. Six swamps were selected, two each in high, moderate and low intensity grazing sites, from the tropical montane swamps of the Upper Nilgiri Mountains, southern India. We recorded a total of 78 species belonging to 63 genera and 31 families. Our results showed that species richness, abundance and species composition differed significantly across grazing treatments. Moreover, mean vegetation cover and mean height differed significantly across grazing treatments, indicating that grazing significantly affected the vegetation structure and growth of swamp plant communities. Species compositional patterns showed that moderately grazed plant communities were significantly different from low and high grazing sites. In summary, grazing intensity influenced swamp species richness, abundance, and swamp plant communities. Specifically, high grazing pressure reduced vegetation cover causing changes in swamp community structure leading to the gradual conversion of the swamp habitat into grasslands.",WOS:000387850600015,2,0.798948772,1,influ of graz intens on swamp plant commun in the trop mont wetland ecosystem nilgir southern ind livestock graz is a maj anthropog impact influ both grassland and wetland of the world which oft result in the alt of the structure divers and funct of the plant commun her we seek to understand how graz intens influ swamp veget with an emphas on their divers structure and funct six swamp wer select two each in high mod and low intens graz sit from the trop mont swamp of the up nilgir mountain southern ind we record a tot of specy belong to gener and famy our result show that specy rich abund and specy composit diff sign across graz tre moreov mean veget cov and mean height diff sign across graz tre ind that graz sign affect the veget structure and grow of swamp plant commun specy composit pattern show that mod graz plant commun wer sign diff from low and high graz sit in sum graz intens influ swamp specy rich abund and swamp plant commun spec high graz press reduc veget cov caus chang in swamp commun structure lead to the grad convert of the swamp habit into grassland,new,0.8634205558094773,0.7876459259563282,0.7277762531259161,0.6806966385822623,0.6423243447531854,0.6099894403779759,0.5819282343082222,0.5568752128878817,0.5337803634245428,0.5114859465879638,0.48799850651756305
310,montgrass,Diversity and guild structure of insect assemblages under grazing and exclusion regimes in a montane grassland from Central Argentina,"The effects of grazing disturbance on insect communities were examined at a montane grassland in Central Argentina, by comparing two grazed sites differing in cattle load (heavy and continuous or moderate and discontinuous) and two cattle exclusions differing in age (7 and 19 years). Two aspects of insect diversity (taxonomic and guild structure) and two levels of taxonomic resolution (family and species) were considered. Four monthly samples were taken with a suction sampler in two 1 m(2) areas at each site. Collected specimens were counted, identified to family (all insects) or species (Coleoptera) level, and allocated to trophic guilds. Abundance, richness, diversity and biomass of the insect assemblages had minimum values in the most intensely grazed habitat, which also differed from the other sites in terms of insect families and Coleoptera species composition. It also showed a distinct guild structure, with fewer secondary consumers, and chewers replacing suckers as the most abundant herbivore group. According to these observations, intense grazing in montane grasslands in Central Argentina could result in taxonomic and guild changes in the associated insect communities, but such effects would not be noticeable with less intensive use.

44,montgrass,"Cattle grazing, raptor abundance and small mammal communities in Mediterranean grasslands","Abundance and diversity of small mammals are usually affected strongly by grazing either due to decreased food availability or quality, decreased suitability of soil for building burrow systems due to trampling and/or due to increased predation risk in the structurally simpler grazed areas. We estimated the effects of grazing-induced changes in vegetation and soil and of increased predation on small mammals in a Mediterranean grassland landscape. We measured vegetation structure, soil compaction and small mammal abundance and species composition in 22 plots of 8 Sherman live traps each, arranged according to an unbalanced two-way ANOVA design with two grazing levels (grazed areas and cattle exclosures) and two predator abundance levels (increased densities of Eurasian kestrets Falco tinnunculus by means of nest boxes and control). Plots were sampled during 2 consecutive years in early summer and earty fall. Exclosure from cattle increased significantly vegetation height and volume and decreased soil compaction. Grazing-induced changes in vegetation height and volume and in soil compaction produced strong effects on small mammal abundance and species richness. Increased kestrel. densities did not have significant additive or interactive effects, with the effects of grazing-induced vegetation and soil gradients on abundance or richness of small mammals. Our results suggest that the effects of grazing on small mammal communities in Mediterranean montane grasslands were mainly due to reduced food availability and by negative effects of trampling on the suitability of soils for building burrow systems. Decreased food quality and increased predation in grazed areas seemed to play a minor rote, if any. Reductions in stock densities would then favor generalist predator populations in Mediterranean grasslands through the expected positive effects of such reductions on the availability of food and burrows for small mammals.

54,montgrass,Livestock grazing affects vernal pool specialists more than habitat generalists in montane vernal pools,"Questions: Do livestock grazing and seasonal precipitation structure species composition in montane vernal pools? Which grazing and precipitation variables best predict cover of vernal pool specialists and species with broader habitat requirements? Is vernal pool species diversity correlated with livestock exclosure, and at what spatial scales? Location: Montane vernal pools, northeast California, USA. Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 20 vernal pools, including pools where livestock had been excluded for up to 20years We compared plant species composition, functional group composition and species diversity among sites that varied in grazing history and seasonal precipitation using CCA and LMM. Results: Although vernal pool specialists were dominant in montane vernal pools, over a third of plant cover was comprised of species that occur over a broad range of wetland or upland environments. The species composition of vernal pool plant communities was influenced by both livestock grazing and precipitation patterns, however the relative effects of these environmental variables differed by functional group. Livestock exclosures favoured perennial vernal pool specialists over annual vernal pool specialists. In contrast, the cover of habitat generalists was more strongly influenced by seasonal precipitation than livestock grazing. At small spatial scales, species richness and diversity decreased as the number of years a pool had been fenced increased, but this relationship was not significant at a larger spatial scale. Conclusions: Both livestock grazing and seasonal precipitation structure the montane vernal pool plant community. We found that livestock grazing promotes the cover of annual vernal pool specialists, but at the expense of perennial vernal pool specialists.

65,montgrass,"The influence of grassland management on ground beetles (Carabidae, Coleoptera) in Swiss montane meadows","Effects of grassland management type and intensity on carabid species richness, number of individuals and species composition were studied in the Swiss Prealps. Carabids were censused in 2001 and 2002 in 21 mown and 20 grazed meadows by means of pitfall traps. Mean species richness was significantly higher in mown plots than in grazed plots and species composition was significantly different between these two management types. Additionally, different species characteristic for mown and grazed plots were found. These results suggest that mown meadows and grazed meadows represent two habitat types for carabid beetles. Within both habitats, management intensity was quantified by fertilizing intensity, the number of cuts, cattle density and/or grazing intensity. The relationship between management intensity and the number of individuals and species was positive. Higher fertilizing intensity was the most important factor for higher species richness and had a significant influence on species composition in both habitats. Other variables positively related to the number of individuals, were the number of cuts in mown meadows and grazing intensity and altitude in grazed meadows. Additionally to fertilizing intensity, cattle density was positively related to the number of species in grazed meadows. These results illustrate that in the extensive management systems found in the Swiss Alps and Prealps, even intensively managed meadows can sustain high carabid diversity and abundance.

75,montgrass,"The relation between unpalatable species, nutrients and plant species richness in Swiss montane pastures","In agriculturally marginal areas, the control of unpalatable weeds on species rich pastures may become problematic due to agricultural and socio-economic developments. It is unclear how increased dominance of unpalatable species would affect the botanical diversity of these grasslands. We investigated whether there was any relationship between plant species diversity and the abundance of unpalatable species and whether soil conditions affected this relationship. In three species-rich montane pastures in western Switzerland, we related plant species richness to soil attributes, the relative cover of all unpalatable species and the relative cover of the locally dominant, toxic Veratrum album in 25 plots of 4 m(2). We furthermore determined species richness in small transects through patches of V. album. Species richness was significantly lower in and near (<= 0.3 m) patches of V. album. At the field scale, plant species richness was best described by total soil N:P ratio (positive relation) in one site and the relative abundance of unpalatable species (negative relation) and soil N:P ratio (positive relation) in a second site. In the third site, species richness was not significantly related to any measured variable. Vegetation diversity (Simpson's D) was negatively related to the relative abundance of unpalatable species in one site and positively related to pH in another site. The results suggest that no single factor can explain plant species richness and diversity in montane pastures. At very high densities unpalatable species can have adverse effects but soil nutrient status appears to be a more general determinant of plant species richness.

Conservation of arthropod diversity in montane wetlands: effect of altitude, habitat quality and habitat fragmentation on butterflies and grasshoppers. journal of Applied Ecology, 36, 363-373]. Community composition may be influenced by habitat variation at patch and/or landscape-scales depending on the body size, home range area, and dispersal distances of the focal taxa [Calder III, WA., 1984.

Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B 267, 139-145], not merely their phylogenetic affinity. We investigated the importance of habitat variables at different scales on the richness and abundance of bumble bees both annually and seasonally in Sierran montane meadows over two years. We found that both patch and landscape factors influence the species richness and abundance of bumblebees and these factors have a seasonal component to their importance. The proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat was the most consistent positive influence on both species richness and abundance across years. In the second year, 2003, patch factors, plant species richness and current livestock grazing also influenced bumblebee species richness; plant species richness was positively correlated and current livestock grazing was negatively correlated with bumble bee species richness. Bumblebee abundance was positively influenced by meadow wetness and proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat in both years. These data suggest conservation of pollinators depends on conservation planning with attention to the quality and context of the landscape. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

94,montgrass,Viable seed banks under grazing and exclosure conditions in montane mesic grasslands of Argentina,"Grazing by large herbivores affects the composition of established vegetation and seed banks. Montane Pampas grasslands are highly productive and have evolved with the influence of grazing by native herbivores. Thus we proposed, firstly that grazing by feral horses would increase seed bank diversity, without changing seed density in grazed areas and secondly that there is a greater similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation in exclosure areas. The study area is located in sub-humid montane grassland in mid-eastern Argentina. Sampling took place at the beginning and end of summer in 2008 and 2009, in three one-year-old exclosures and grazed areas. Soil and litter samples were collected and established vegetation cover was visually recorded in every area. Each sample was elutriated and sieved. Seed composition was recorded using a dissecting microscope. Seed density and species richness of the samples was analyzed using ANOVA and species composition was analyzed by multivariate analysis. Grazing reduces the seed density and richness of grasses, but forb species are not affected. The seed density of grasses increases in soil samples at the end of summer, while the density of forb species does not change. Similarity between the established vegetation and the seed bank was low. Grazing affects seed bank composition which could limit restoration time after the removal of herbivores. However, grass seed availability increases considerably during a short period after exclosure establishment, showing high potential for recovery in sub-humid grasslands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

117,montgrass,"The effect of grazing pressure on species richness, composition and productivity in North Adriatic Karst pastures","We studied the effects of sheep grazing intensity and abandonment on plant species richness and composition, plant life forms and the productivity of North Adriatic Karst pastures. The experimental sites were under controlled grazing regimes (heavy, moderate, light and abandonment) for 10 years. Data were collected during one season; plant species composition, the number of species and above-ground and below-ground biomass were evaluated. Species richness was significantly reduced with increasing grazing intensity and abandonment. The greatest differences in species composition were recorded for the heavily grazed site owing to the appearance of a group of grasslands species typical of nutrient-rich soil. Heavy grazing increased therophytes and decreased the proportion of chamaephytes and geophytes. Above-ground productivity at the season's peak was typical of subhumid grasslands (up to 500 g m-2) and was significantly the highest in the abandoned pasture. Below-ground biomass was significantly the lowest in the heavily grazed sites and the highest in those that were moderately or lightly grazed. We could conclude that grazing intensification and abandonment have significant effects on the structure of these pastures. Low- or moderate-intensity (4-7 sheep ha-1) grazing seems to be the most appropriate treatment since it can maintain the species richness and typical floristic composition of those pastures.

124,montgrass,Effects of management and altitude on bryophyte species diversity and composition in montane calcareous fens,"We examined patterns of bryophyte species richness and communities in 36 montane calcareous fens in Switzerland. Sites differed in management regime (grazing vs, mowing) and altitude. In addition, several environmental variables were measured. Bryophyte diversity was determined as species density (mean of 5 plots per site), as species richness (number of all species of a site) and as beta -diversity. Species richness was 20% higher at grazed than at mown sites. We interpret this as the result of higher environmental heterogeneity at grazed sites. This could also be the cause for the significantly higher beta -diversity at grazed sites. However, there was a significant management x altitude interaction caused by species-poor sites at low altitudes under grazing. This interaction might be caused by more intensive grazing at low altitude. Grazed sites contained the higher overall species richness (117 vs. 79), more exclusive species (47 vs. 9), and more Red List-species (12 vs. 6). Altitude had only an effect on the number of exclusive species, which was highest at high-altitude sites. No differences could be found for species densities both between management regimes and between altitude classes. This result indicates no differences in habitat heterogeneity at the within-plot scale. For analysis of effects of environmental variables on bryophyte communities, we used a direct ordination technique (CCA). The variables pH, amount of total carbon in the soil and management turned out to be the most important in explaining variation in the species data. However, variation explained by total carbon could also be explained in terms of total nitrogen or moisture. For preserving bryophyte diversity in montane wet meadows, extensive grazing by cattle is crucial. Due to slightly different bryophyte communities under the different management regimes, however, bryophyte diversity at the landscape level will be highest when both types of management are maintained.",WOS:000169385700002,12,0.850293981,1,effect of man and altitud on bryophyt specy divers and composit in mont calc fen we examin pattern of bryophyt specy rich and commun in mont calc fen in switzerland sit diff in man regim graz vs mow and altitud in addit sev environ vary wer meas bryophyt divers was determin as specy dens mean of plot per sit as specy rich numb of al specy of a sit and as bet divers specy rich was high at graz than at mown sit we interpret thi as the result of high environ heterog at graz sit thi could also be the caus for the sign high bet divers at graz sit howev ther was a sign man x altitud interact caus by specy poor sit at low altitud und graz thi interact might be caus by mor intend graz at low altitud graz sit contain the high overal specy rich vs mor exclud specy vs and mor red list specy vs altitud had on an effect on the numb of exclud specy which was highest at high altitud sit no diff could be found for specy dens both between man regim and between altitud class thi result ind no diff in habit heterog at the within plot scal for analys of effect of environ vary on bryophyt commun we us a direct ordin techn cca the vary ph amount of tot carbon in the soil and man turn out to be the most import in explain vary in the specy dat howev vary explain by tot carbon could also be explain in term of tot nitrog or moist for preserv bryophyt divers in mont wet meadow extend graz by cattl is cruc due to slight diff bryophyt commun und the diff man regim howev bryophyt divers at the landscap level wil be highest when both typ of man ar maintain,new,0.879826754006919,0.8376433967247212,0.807249390785933,0.7843803068339806,0.7661654582790546,0.7510276108319252,0.7380205969242133,0.7265177471651493,0.7160461443000046,0.7061442592639229,0.6961945716437502
134,montgrass,Low-intensity management promotes bryophyte diversity in grasslands,"Bryophytes constitute an important and permanent component of the grassland flora and diversity in Europe. As most bryophyte species are sensitive to habitat change, their diversity is likely to decline following land-use intensification. Most previous studies on bryophyte diversity focused on specific habitats of high bryophyte diversity, such as bogs, montane grasslands, or calcareous dry grasslands. In contrast, mesic grasslands are rarely studied, although they are the most common grassland habitat in Europe. They are secondary vegetation, maintained by agricultural use and thus, are influenced by different forms of land use. We studied bryophyte species richness in three regions in Germany, in 707 plots of 16 m(2) representing different land-use types and environmental conditions. Our study is one of the few to inspect the relationships between bryophyte richness and land use across contrasting regions and using a high number of replicates. Among the managed grasslands, pastures harboured 2.5 times more bryophyte species than meadows and mown pastures. Similarly, bryophyte cover was about twice as high in fallows and pastures than in meadows and mown pastures. Among the pastures, bryophyte species richness was about three times higher in sheep grazed plots than in the ones grazed by cattle or horses. In general, bryophyte species richness and cover was more than 50% lower in fertilized than in unfertilized plots. Moreover, the amount of suitable substrates was linked to bryophyte diversity. Species richness of bryophytes growing on stones increased with stone cover, and the one of bryophytes growing on bark and deadwood increased with larger values of woody plant species and deadwood cover. Our findings highlight the importance of low-intensity land use and high structural heterogeneity for bryophyte conservation. They also caution against an intensification of traditionally managed pastures. In the light of our results, we recommend to maintain low-intensity sheep grazing on sites with low productivity, such as slopes on shallow soils.",WOS:000447356800019,13,0.8524573240000001,1,low intens man promot bryophyt divers in grassland bryophyt constitut an import and perm compon of the grassland flor and divers in europ as most bryophyt specy ar sensit to habit chang their divers is lik to declin follow land us intens most prevy study on bryophyt divers focus on spec habit of high bryophyt divers such as bog mont grassland or calc dry grassland in contrast mes grassland ar rar study although they ar the most common grassland habit in europ they ar second veget maintain by agricult us and thu ar influ by diff form of land us we study bryophyt specy rich in three reg in germany in plot of m repres diff land us typ and environ condit our study is on of the few to inspect the rel between bryophyt rich and land us across contrast reg and us a high numb of reply among the man grassland past harbo tim mor bryophyt specy than meadow and mown past simil bryophyt cov was about twic as high in fallow and past than in meadow and mown past among the past bryophyt specy rich was about three tim high in sheep graz plot than in the on graz by cattl or hors in gen bryophyt specy rich and cov was mor than low in fertil than in unfertil plot moreov the amount of suit subst was link to bryophyt divers specy rich of bryophyt grow on ston increas with ston cov and the on of bryophyt grow on bark and deadwood increas with larg valu of woody plant specy and deadwood cov our find highlight the import of low intens land us and high structural heterog for bryophyt conserv they also caut against an intens of tradit man past in the light of our result we recommend to maintain low intens sheep graz on sit with low produc such as slop on shallow soil,new,0.883832574058072,0.8382210755902779,0.8024617367856126,0.774271661786827,0.7513110193857874,0.7320304415405262,0.7154128851516507,0.7007753360385808,0.6876312687295234,0.6756188639803125,0.6645792973905738
144,montgrass,Impacts of management intensification on ground-dwelling beetles and spiders in semi-natural mountain grasslands,"Agricultural intensification is one of the major threats to the biodiversity of montane and subalpine grasslands. This calls for regional agriculture policies that efficiently protect their flora and fauna without jeopardizing agricultural viability. We experimentally sought a sustainable management, testing the effects of fertilisation (slurry) and aerial irrigation (sprinklers) separately and in combination (at different levels of intensity) on the arthropod communities occurring in extensively-managed montane and subalpine meadows in the SW Swiss Alps. Four years after the start of the intensification experiment, we measured the abundance, species richness, community composition and variability (beta-diversity) of ground-dwelling beetles and spiders. The abundance of both taxa showed a curvilinear relationship with management intensity. Spider abundance peaked at a moderate level of intensification while ground beetle abundance appeared to be more resilient to intensification, peaking at a high level of intensification. These responses were mainly driven by fertilisation, while irrigation played a minor role. For both taxa, we found no impact of irrigation or fertilisation, either when applied separately or in combination on species richness. Community composition was altered by management intensification in both taxa, but community variability was not. Given these taxon-specific patterns for abundance, applying organic fertiliser and water at levels corresponding to two-thirds of the quantity necessary to achieve local maximum hay yield appears to be compatible with the maintenance of rich ground-dwelling arthropod communities in mountain grasslands.",WOS:000414880300006,14,0.725250955,0,impact of man intens on ground dwel beetl and spid in sem nat mountain grassland agricult intens is on of the maj threats to the biodivers of mont and subalpin grassland thi cal for reg agricult policy that efficy protect their flor and faun without jeopard agricult viabl we expery sought a sustain man test the effect of fertil slurry and aer irrig sprinklers sep and in combin at diff level of intens on the arthropod commun occur in extend man mont and subalpin meadow in the sw swiss alp four year aft the start of the intens expery we meas the abund specy rich commun composit and vary bet divers of ground dwel beetl and spid the abund of both tax show a curvilinear rel with man intens spid abund peak at a mod level of intens whil ground beetl abund appear to be mor resy to intens peak at a high level of intens thes respons wer main driv by fertil whil irrig play a min rol for both tax we found no impact of irrig or fertil eith when apply sep or in combin on specy rich commun composit was alt by man intens in both tax but commun vary was not giv thes taxon spec pattern for abund apply org fertil and wat at level correspond to two third of the quant necess to achiev loc maxim hay yield appear to be compat with the maint of rich ground dwel arthropod commun in mountain grassland,new,0.7403801618140937,0.6986838067415736,0.6729253262223024,0.6566114309153711,0.646478872830467,0.6410087915370216,0.6396159838828906,0.6424207000182639,0.6504305181324249,0.6664205258137904,0.6981117214028386
154,montgrass,Large-scale heterogeneous cattle grazing affects plant diversity and forage value of Alpine species-rich Nardus pastures,"In Europe, the decline in agriculture in traditional mountain farming areas has caused abandonment, or irregular grazing, of less accessible pastures. In the Italian Alps, we studied plant diversity, forage value and trophic traits in six large-scale heterogeneously grazed Nardus pastures, in their central and peripheral parts, and across the montane, lower and upper subalpine zones. Seventy cover-abundance floristic releves were performed in randomly located permanent plots, half at the pasture edge (M-plots) and half in their central part (C-plots). Plant diversity varied significantly with respect to the distance from the edge, being higher in M-plots because of shrub invasion as a consequence of reduced cattle pressure. Nardus cover was slightly higher in C-plots and negatively related to plant diversity. Forage value was lower in M-plots and negatively correlated with the cover of Nardus and woody species, implying that different grazing pressure was negatively influencing sward productivity. Differences in trophic traits of swards between C- and M-plots existed mostly as trends. Forage value significantly decreased in the lower subalpine and montane pastures, which are further grazed in late summer. Heterogeneous grazing management was therefore exerting positive effects on plant diversity and negative effects on forage value.

165,montgrass,"Floristic composition, plant species abundance, and soil properties of montane savannas in the Gran Sabana, Venezuela","Floristic composition, species abundance, and soil properties were studied in slope, flat and disturbed savannas in the northern part of the Gran Sabana, Venezuela. All savannas presented shallow soils (<30cm depth) with high content of sand and low content of clay. In general, the soils were poor in nutrients and strongly acidified. The major difference between the soils was the content of the stony fraction, which was significantly higher (P<0.05) in the slope savannas than in the flat savannas. A total of 57 dicot, 42 monocot, and 7 fern species were recorded in all studied savannas. In the flat and slope savannas predominated the monocot species, while in the disturbed savanna predominated the dicots. The families with the largest number of species were Poaceae (19.8%), Cyperaceae (13.2%), Asteraceae (10.4%) and Melastomataceae (8.5%). The number of species in the flat savannas was higher than that of the slope savannas. The lowest plant species richness was associated to slope savannas and their high content of stony fraction of the soils. The highest floristic similarity was found between slope savannas, and the lowest between disturbed savanna and slope savannas. The most. abundant life forms in the studied savannas were perennial (42.4%) and annual (24.5%) herbs, followed by suffruticoses (16.0%) and shrubs (12.3%), and the less frequent was lianas (4.7%).

174,montgrass,Bird community composition across an Andean tree-line ecotone,"Few studies have found strong evidence to suggest that ecotones promote species richness and diversity. In this study we examine the responses of a high-Andean bird community to changes in vegetation and topographical characteristics across an Andean tree-line ecotone and adjacent cloud forest and puna grassland vegetation in southern Peru. Over a 6-month period, birds and vegetation were surveyed using a 100 m fixed-width Distance Sampling point count method. Vegetation analyses revealed that the tree-line ecotone represented a distinctive high-Andean vegetation community that was easily differentiated from the adjacent cloud forest and puna grassland based on changes in tree-size characteristics and vegetation cover. Bird community composition was strongly seasonal and influenced by a pool of bird species from a wider elevational gradient. There were also clear differences in bird community measures between tree-line vegetation, cloud forest and puna grassland with species turnover (beta-diversity) most pronounced at the tree-line. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that the majority of the 81 bird species were associated with tree-line vegetation. Categorizing patterns of relative abundance of the 42 most common species revealed that the tree-line ecotone was composed primarily of cloud forest specialists and habitat generalists, with very few species from the puna grassland. Only two species, Thlypopsis ruficeps and Anairetes parulus, both widespread Andean species more typical of montane woodland vegetation edges, were categorized as ecotone specialists. However, our findings were influenced by significant differences in species detectability between all three vegetation communities.

184,montgrass,"Disturbance changes arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal phenology and soil glomalin concentrations but not fungal spore composition in montane rainforests in Veracruz and Chiapas, Mexico","Mexican montane rainforests and adjacent disturbed areas were studied for disturbance-related spatio-temporal changes to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community and soil glomalin concentration. The AMF community functions to both improve plant growth and soil conditions and is thus an important component to the restoration of this forest type to disturbed areas. The study areas included mature rainforests that were converted to pine forests, milpas, pastures and shrub/herbaceous plant communities via burning and logging. Seasonal patterns in AMF spore species richness and sporulation significantly differed across disturbance types at two of the three sites surveyed. Contrasting patterns of sporulation among AMF families across different disturbance types helped to explain how species richness and composition were maintained despite dramatic changes to the host plant community. Meaning, in most cases, disturbance induced changes in when different AMF taxa sporulated but not what taxa sporulated. Only conversion from mature pine-oak-Liquidambar-Persea forests to pine-dominated stands severely reduced AMF spore richness and total sporulation. Surprisingly, in pine-dominant stands no concomitant negative impacts on soil glomalin (MAb32B11 immunoreactive soil protein) concentrations were detected. However, soils of mature forests containing no pines had the highest concentration of glomalin. Conversion to pasture and milpa (diverse cornfield) had a strong negative impact on the concentration of soil glomalin concentrations. In sharp contrast, the same disturbance types improved AMF sporulation and AMF spore richness. It appears that disturbance type, and not AMF community measures used herein, best predicts changes in soil glomalin concentration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

202,montgrass,"Seed arrival, ecological filters, and plant species richness: a meta-analysis","Theoretical models predict that effects of dispersal on local biodiversity are influenced by the size and composition of the species pool, as well as ecological filters that limit local species membership. We tested these predictions by conducting a meta-analysis of 28 studies encompassing 62 experiments examining effects of propagule supply (seed arrival) on plant species richness under contrasting intensities of ecological filters (owing to disturbance and resource availability). Seed arrival increased local species richness in a wide range of communities (forest, grassland, montane, savanna, wetland), resulting in a positive mean effect size across experiments. Mean effect size was 70% higher in disturbed relative to undisturbed communities, suggesting that disturbance increases recruitment opportunities for immigrating species. In contrast, effect size was not significantly influenced by nutrient or water availability. Among seed-addition experiments, effect size was positively correlated with species and functional diversity within the pool of added seeds (species evenness and seed-size diversity), primarily in disturbed communities.

212,montgrass,"Do climate, resource availability, and grazing pressure filter floristic composition and functioning in Alpine pastures?","We studied the floristic composition in the pastures of the Southern Alps (Trento Province, Italy). One hundred and five plots in seven different pasture plant communities were sampled: (1) nitrophilous, (2) montane mesic, (3) subalpine mesic, (4) calcareous montane, (5) calcareous subalpine, (6) acid montane, and (7) acid subalpine pastures. Forward selection and variation partitioning were applied to identify the most important factors controlling the species composition and plant traits in the pastures. Aggregated weighted averages were calculated for each plot using the published values of average height, specific leaf area, and seed mass for each species. Explanatory variables were recorded for each site to reflect climate, soil properties, and grazing pressure. We hypothesised that species composition and functional variation in pastures of the Southern Alps are controlled by three main environmental filters: climate, resource availability, and grazing pressure. We found that variables of climate and soil properties had a major role in explaining the species composition and variations in plant traits, while grazing pressure showed a lower independent effect. Species composition and plant traits depended mainly on temperature, soil fertility, and variables of bedrock type - soil pH.

221,montgrass,Effect of breed of cattle and season on diet selection and defoliation of competitive plant species in semi-natural grasslands,"To maintain biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands, the choice of breed of livestock and season of grazing can be important. The objective was to determine the effects of breed and season on the composition of plant fragments in the faeces of cattle grazing a heterogeneous semi-natural grassland. Twelve heifers of the traditional Swedish Vaneko breed (live weight 309 kg) and twelve heifers of the Charolais breed (live weight 431 kg) were allocated to three pastures per breed. Faeces samples were collected in spring, summer and autumn for micro-histological examination of plant fragments. On the same occasion, defoliation of four competitive plant species was recorded. Faecal plant fragments mainly consisted of grasses but also herbs, whereas Cyperaceae, despite their abundance on the pastures, only composed a small proportion of fragments. Season affected the composition of plant fragments in the faeces, with a higher proportion of Cyperaceae and herbs in spring than later in the grazing period (P < 0.001), and the heifers ingesting more grasses and woody plants in autumn. In spite of a clear difference in live weight between the two breeds, no effects of breed on the composition of plant fragments in faeces were observed, although Vaneko heifers defoliated more Filipendula ulmaria in spring than the Charolais heifers (P < 0.01). In addition, defoliation of Alnus glutinosa increased later in the grazing period (P < 0.05), especially for the Vaneko heifers, indicating control of pernicious brushwood by grazing may be more effective in autumn.",WOS:000253121000008,22,0.615345368,0,effect of bree of cattl and season on diet select and defo of competit plant specy in sem nat grassland to maintain biodivers in sem nat grassland the cho of bree of livestock and season of graz can be import the object was to determin the effect of bree and season on the composit of plant frag in the faec of cattl graz a heterog sem nat grassland twelv heif of the tradit swed vaneko bree liv weight kg and twelv heif of the charola bree liv weight kg wer alloc to three past per bree faec sampl wer collect in spring sum and autumn for micro histolog examin of plant frag on the sam occas defo of four competit plant specy was record faec plant frag main consist of grass but also herb wherea cyperacea despit their abund on the past on compos a smal proport of frag season affect the composit of plant frag in the faec with a high proport of cyperacea and herb in spring than lat in the graz period p and the heif ingest mor grass and woody plant in autumn in spit of a clear diff in liv weight between the two bree no effect of bree on the composit of plant frag in faec wer observ although vaneko heif defo mor filipendul ulmar in spring than the charola heif p in addit defo of aln glutinos increas lat in the graz period p espec for the vaneko heif ind control of pernicy brushwood by graz may be mor effect in autumn,new,0.6573088587821684,0.6004338411634169,0.5680264579035793,0.548969272300527,0.5381364008019149,0.5333468435346782,0.5338516112835104,0.5399222270933648,0.5531003539598345,0.5774925396648459,0.6243563107331735
231,montgrass,Comparison and origin of forest and grassland ant assemblages in the high plateau of Madagascar (Hymenoptera : Formicidae),"We assessed species richness and composition of ant assemblages in adjacent montane forest and secondary (anthropogenic) grassland habitats in the central plateau of Madagascar. We used five quantitative methods (leaf litter sifting, two types of pitfall traps, beating low vegetation, and soil digging) and compared methods within and across habitats. Sample-based and occurrence-based accumulation curves demonstrated that the efficiency of ant inventory methods is habitat specific. Litter sifting, however, was the single most efficient method in both habitats. Overall, our analyses of the relative efficiency of methods recommend the use of sifting and beating in the montane forest site, and sifting alone in the grassland site. In four of five methods, more species were collected in the grassland site (31 spp.) than in the forest site (26 spp.). Occurrence-based accumulation curves based on all methods demonstrated that species richness was similar in the two habitats, reaching a maximum difference of approximately one species. Only five species were shared between the grassland and forest sites. The presence of a high number of ant species restricted to the grassland site (18 spp.) is the first record of high endemism in this habitat in Madagascar and may have strong implications for the reconstruction of the natural vegetation types at the time humans arrived. Their presence suggests that a comparable open habitat, such as montane woodland, shrubland, or thicket, was present on Madagascar long before humans developed the secondary grasslands less than 2000 years ago. These results are contrary to the ""classical hypothesis"" that the central plateau was a continuous region of closed forest. These results support the hypothesis that the montane regions, including the central plateau, once contained areas of habitat with an open structure and that the endemic ants now found in the secondary grasslands were originally native to such a habitat.",WOS:000175063600015,23,0.874787482,1,comparison and origin of forest and grassland ant assembl in the high plateau of madagasc hymenopter formicida we assess specy rich and composit of ant assembl in adjac mont forest and second anthropog grassland habit in the cent plateau of madagasc we us fiv quantit method leaf lit sift two typ of pitfal trap beat low veget and soil dig and comp method within and across habit sampl bas and occur bas accum curv demonst that the efficy of ant inv method is habit spec lit sift howev was the singl most efficy method in both habit overal our analys of the rel efficy of method recommend the us of sift and beat in the mont forest sit and sift alon in the grassland sit in four of fiv method mor specy wer collect in the grassland sit spp than in the forest sit spp occur bas accum curv bas on al method demonst that specy rich was simil in the two habit reach a maxim diff of approxim on specy on fiv specy wer shar between the grassland and forest sit the pres of a high numb of ant specy restrict to the grassland sit spp is the first record of high endem in thi habit in madagasc and may hav strong imply for the reconstruct of the nat veget typ at the tim hum ar their pres suggest that a comp op habit such as mont woodland shrubland or thicket was pres on madagasc long bef hum develop the second grassland less than year ago thes result ar cont to the class hypothes that the cent plateau was a continu reg of clos forest thes result support the hypothes that the mont reg includ the cent plateau ont contain area of habit with an op structure and that the endem ant now found in the second grassland wer origin nat to such a habit,new,0.8838799594406676,0.8364180219074397,0.8003679394645679,0.7728327459374486,0.7509585738229759,0.7329906005439295,0.7178560210049431,0.7049102616743502,0.6937750132584211,0.6843284163122467,0.6769395683279207
311,montgrass,Consequences of pastoral abandonment for the structure and diversity of the alpine avifauna,"1. There is a long-term trend of depopulation of rural areas and pasture abandonment throughout the Alps. This trend peaked after the Second World War and is now omnipresent. Its ecological consequences are evident mostly below the timberline, where grassland gradually turns into shrub and, ultimately, to forest. This study addresses the consequences of land abandonment and the decline of pastoral practices on the diversity and structure of the bird communities of the Italian Alps. 2. The breeding birds of Gran Paradiso Natural Park in north-western Italy were surveyed, and bird diversity, abundance of grassland, ecotone, woodland and shrub species were analysed using regression in relation to a set of explanatory variables including elevation, local habitat variables, landscape variables and grazing intensity. 3. Avian diversity increased in abandoned pastures as higher numbers of shrub species followed tree and shrub encroachment. Conversely, open habitat species that benefited from grazing were mostly confined to pure grasslands and high altitudes. 4. The effects of grazing were more evident in the montane belt. Grazing maintained open habitats by limiting tree and scrub encroachment, thereby favouring grassland bird species. At higher altitudes, however, grazing had little effect on typical open habitat alpine species (choughs Pyrrhocorax spp., water pipit Anthus spinoletta, alpine accentor Prunella collaris, wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe, snow finch Montifringilla nivalis, rock thrush Monticola saxatilis) and only skylark Alauda arvensis and linnet Carduelis cannabina preferred grazed meadows. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that the abandonment of grazing in the Alps has significant effects on bird species diversity and abundance, especially below the timberline where pastoral decline leads to significant changes in vegetation structure. However, grazing importance differs markedly depending on whether the focus is avian alpha-diversity or grassland bird abundance. Pastoral abandonment leads to an overall increase in avian diversity, but most species invading abandoned pastures are already common, whereas several grassland bird species that are dependent upon grazed pastures have an unfavourable conservation status. Overall, in terms of bird conservation objectives, large-scale abandonment of long-established pastoral habitats and their complete replacement with scrub, or even forest, is likely to be detrimental.",WOS:000220587800009,31,0.877301588,1,consequ of past abandon for the structure and divers of the alpin avifaun ther is a long term trend of depop of rur area and past abandon throughout the alp thi trend peak aft the second world war and is now omnipres it ecolog consequ ar evid most below the timberlin wher grassland grad turn into shrub and ultim to forest thi study address the consequ of land abandon and the declin of past pract on the divers and structure of the bird commun of the it alp the bree bird of gran paradiso nat park in nor western ita wer survey and bird divers abund of grassland ecoton woodland and shrub specy wer analys us regress in rel to a set of expl vary includ elev loc habit vary landscap vary and graz intens av divers increas in abandon past as high numb of shrub specy follow tre and shrub encroach convers op habit specy that benefit from graz wer most confin to pur grassland and high altitud the effect of graz wer mor evid in the mont belt graz maintain op habit by limit tre and scrub encroach thereby favo grassland bird specy at high altitud howev graz had littl effect on typ op habit alpin specy chough pyrrhocorax spp wat pipit anth spinolett alpin acc prunell coll wheatear oenanth oenanth snow finch montifringill niv rock thrush monticol saxatil and on skylark alaud arvens and linnet carduel cannabin prefer graz meadow synthes and apply thi study show that the abandon of graz in the alp has sign effect on bird specy divers and abund espec below the timberlin wher past declin lead to sign chang in veget structure howev graz import diff mark depend on wheth the foc is av alph divers or grassland bird abund past abandon lead to an overal increas in av divers but most specy invad abandon past ar already common wherea sev grassland bird specy that ar depend upon graz past hav an unfavo conserv stat overal in term of bird conserv object larg scal abandon of long est past habit and their complet replac with scrub or ev forest is lik to be detry,new,0.9000566388991239,0.8555367858619387,0.8205634608120421,0.7929292942818107,0.7702271932090519,0.7509082436672914,0.7339438119498034,0.7186074458848086,0.7042824436751315,0.6902837814431745,0.6754852701329542
36,montgrass,Breeding bird community composition in different successional vegetation in the montane coniferous forests zone of Taiwan,"To examine the relationship between forest succession following fire and the composition of bird communities, we investigated the vegetation structure, bird population density, foraging behavior and guild structure in bamboo grasslands (11 years since the last fire), pine savanna (41 years), pine woodland (58 years), old-growth hemlock forest (never burned), and old-growth spruce forest (never burned) in the Tatachia area of central Taiwan. Canopy height, total foliage cover, tree density, total basal area of tree, total basal area of snags, foliage height diversity, and tree species richness all increased with successional age. However, shrub cover peaked in intermediate successional stages. The vertical profile of foliage cover was more diverse in later successional forests, which had more breeding bird species and ecological guilds. All the breeding bird species recorded in early and intermediate stages were also found distributed in the late successional forests. Because Taiwan has high precipitation and humidity, and most forest fires in Taiwan are caused by human activities, forest fires and large areas of early successional vegetation were probably rare in the mountain areas of Taiwan prior to the arrival of humans. Therefore, bird species have not had enough time to adapt to areas with early or intermediate successional vegetation. Moreover, late successional forests host all the major plant species found in the early and intermediate stages and have higher foliage height diversity index, which was positively correlated with the bird species richness and bird species diversity index in this study. As a result, all breeding bird species and guilds in the area can be found in late successional forests. Efforts for conserving avian diversity in Taiwan should focus on protecting the remaining native old-growth forests. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

37,montgrass,"Effects of grazing and cultivation on forest plant communities in Mount Elgon National Park, Uganda","Plant communities in the montane forest of Mount Elgon National Park were studied in order to assess the impact of grazing and cultivation on species composition. Present and former land uses, tree, shrub and herb species, soil properties and the percentage cover and height of trees, shrubs and herbs were determined in 40 plots. An indirect ordination of these plots showed that species composition was primarily determined by successional stage and agricultural disturbance. In forest plots (ordinated separately) where the widest range of former and current grazing intensities had occurred, evidence of grazing history, soil phosphorus and vegetation height correlated negatively with the strongest ordination axis. Least grazed forest plots had fewer tree seedlings and saplings than more intensively grazed plots. This may be due to the increase in Mimulopsis alpina (Acanthaceae) in less grazed forest where tree regeneration might otherwise be more advanced. Tree seedlings and saplings were uncommon in the forest, rarely exceeding 30 cm in height and there was no tree understorey.

561,montgrass,Vegetation structure and composition along an interior-edge-exterior gradient in a Costa Rican montane cloud forest,"A study was carried out in the Costa Rican Cordillera de Talamanca in order to assess changes in vegetation structure and floristic composition along a gradient from the interior of tropical upper montane cloud forest into adjacent pastureland. At four sites a 150 x 10 m belt transect was established perpendicular to the forest/pasture edge. Vegetation transect censusing included recording of seed plane species presence and abundance (aerial crown/shoot cover), as well as assessment of seedling sapling and tree stem diameter and height. A total of 290 seed plant species were found in 159 genera and 85 families. Asteraceae is with 47 species the most speciose family. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index showed no significant difference between forest and pastureland, with the exception of a pastureland site which had experienced intensive land use. Sorensen's similarity index showed significant differences in species composition between forest and pastureland. Vegetation at the forest edge consisted mainly of secondary shrub and tree species. From the forest interior towards the edge, numbers of seedlings, saplings and secondary trees increased, while numbers of mature forest trees declined. Edge effects are expressed in a reduction of canopy height and an increase in subcanopy stature from the forest interior towards the edge, causing thr merging of forest canopy and subcanopy layers at the edge. Intensively used pasturelands only harboured a low herbaceous vegetation, while their abandoned equivalents showed the presence of patches of secondary shrub vegetation and recovering forest in a grassland matrix. Expected spatio-temporal changes at the forest edge include the encroachment of secondary vegetation and the levelling of the forest/pasture border as time advances and land use becomes less intense. Transitional second,growth edge vegetation may buffer the remaining mature forest core and simultaneously induce forest recovery processes in adjacent abandoned pasturelands. It is recommended to include forest edge tree species in programs focused at the ecological restoration of tropical montane cloud forests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

57,montgrass,"Ecological management of a Mediterranean mountainous reserve (Pindos National Park, Greece) using the bird community as an indicator","We used the community of passerines and woodpeckers as a target group for the conservation management of Pindos National Park (NW Greece). We conducted bird point counts twice during springtime in 72 plots that represented the main vegetation types (16 sites). We recorded 56 species (14 of conservation concern-SPEC). The montane grasslands were the most important habitats in terms of species of conservation concern, whereas the agricultural mosaics were the most species-rich habitats. The mixed pine-beech woods were significantly richer than the pinewoods, whereas pinewoods and broad-leaved woods did not differ significantly between them. The bird diversity was significantly correlated with the number of tree layers, the vertical structural complexity and the maximum height of trees. The presence of grassland, forest and agricultural habitat type, as well as the altitude and the vegetation structural complexity were the main environmental parameters determining species composition (Canonical Correspondence Analysis). We identified a set of 17 typical species (IndVal analysis) to be used in the monitoring scheme of the Park, which were characteristic of the main bird habitat types distinguished by Ward's hierarchical clustering.

631,montgrass,Sub-montane semi-natural grassland communities in the Eastern Carpathians (Ukraine),"We performed a survey of grassland communities in the Ukrainian Carpathians with the aim of: (1) syntaxonomically classifying the meso- and subxerophilous grassland vegetation; (2) analysing the main gradients in their species composition; (3) estimating the effect of selected environmental factors on grassland species composition; (4) assessing the species richness of vascular plants and bryophytes in relation to the measured environmental variables. We collected 46 phytosociological releves during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011. Species composition and species richness were studied at two spatial scales (1 m(2) and 16 m(2)) in relation to soil parameters (soil depth, pH (KCl), content of P, K, mg, N and C), management regime (mowing, grazing, ploughing in the past and burning), and other factors (altitude, litter cover, open soil, inclination, solar radiation and animal excrement). Seven grassland types were distinguished belonging to 3 classes and 4 alliances, namely the Nardetea strictae including the Violion caninae (mesic pastures at altitudes of 400-600 m mostly on moderate slopes) and the Nardo strictae-Agrostion tennis (grasslands on moderate slopes at altitudes of 700-900 m usually managed by mowing and grazing the aftermath); the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, including the Arrhenatherion elatioris (submontane grasslands originated mostly on former fields after their abandonment in the past) and the Cynosurion cristati (intensive pastures); and the Festuco-Brometea including the Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati (abandoned grasslands dominated by Brachypodium pinnatum and Inula salicina). Detrended correspondence analysis indicated that the major compositional turnover was related to altitude and soil reaction. A canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that altitude had the strongest effect on species composition in the analysed dataset, followed by management treatments (former ploughing, grazing intensity). For vascular plant species richness, regression tree analysis identified grazing intensity as the most important predictor at the 1 m(2) scale. At the 16 m(2) scale, soil humus content was evaluated as the most important predictor of vascular plant species richness, followed by litter cover and grazing intensity. The number of bryophytes was not determined by the studied environmental factors at either of the two spatial scales. Although the number of analysed releves in this study was limited, our results significantly contribute to the understanding of submontane grasslands in the Ukrainian Carpathians.",WOS:000362046000017,63,0.8242982729999999,1,sub mont sem nat grassland commun in the eastern carpath ukrain we perform a survey of grassland commun in the ukrain carpath with the aim of syntaxonom class the meso and subxerophil grassland veget analys the main grady in their specy composit estim the effect of select environ fact on grassland specy composit assess the specy rich of vascul plant and bryophyt in rel to the meas environ vary we collect phytosociolog relev dur the grow season of and specy composit and specy rich wer study at two spat scal m and m in rel to soil paramet soil dep ph kcl cont of p k mg n and c man regim mow graz plough in the past and burn and oth fact altitud lit cov op soil inclin sol rady and anim excr sev grassland typ wer distinct belong to class and al nam the nardete strictae includ the viol canina mes past at altitud of m most on mod slop and the nardo strictae agrost ten grassland on mod slop at altitud of m us man by mow and graz the afterma the molinio arrhenatherete includ the arrhenath elaty submont grassland origin most on form field aft their abandon in the past and the cynos cristat intend past and the festuco bromete includ the cirsio brachypod pinnat abandon grassland domin by brachypod pinnat and inul salicin detrend correspond analys ind that the maj composit turnov was rel to altitud and soil react a canon correspond analys confirm that altitud had the strongest effect on specy composit in the analys dataset follow by man tre form plough graz intens for vascul plant specy rich regress tre analys ident graz intens as the most import predict at the m scal at the m scal soil hum cont was evalu as the most import predict of vascul plant specy rich follow by lit cov and graz intens the numb of bryophyt was not determin by the study environ fact at eith of the two spat scal although the numb of analys relev in thi study was limit our result sign contribut to the understand of submont grassland in the ukrain carpath,new,0.8475139761667051,0.7758245733521812,0.7219816773148234,0.6814725196389113,0.649722439253831,0.6239725495135978,0.6025469096845377,0.5843941853846379,0.5688385715192803,0.5554422777895816,0.5439887831868307
66,montgrass,"Vegetation changes in an abandoned montane grassland, compared to changes in a habitat with low-intensity sheep grazing - a case study in Styria, Austria","In protected areas maintaining existing phytodiversity is an important conservation target. In this study we analysed the effects of abandonment on plant species composition and species richness over a period of nine years in a montane grassland in the Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) region Eisenwurzen (Styria, Austria). Additional investigations concerned the number of Red Data List species, plant strategy types, Ellenberg indicator values, indicator values for mowing, grazing and trampling tolerance, temporal sequence of phenological phases and seven plant traits. We differentiated two topography-related habitat types: an initially species-rich sheep pasture on a steep, south-facing slope and a less species-rich meadow on a flat site immediately below, with a comparatively higher nutrient and water supply in the topsoil. Testing a possible management alternative, the effects of continued low-intensity sheep grazing on the slope were also analysed. In spring 2001, one permanent plot of 50 m(2) was established in the centre of each habitat type and treatment. Our results show that the long-term effects of abandonment on grassland vegetation depend largely on local site conditions. Nutrient availability in the soil seems to be an especially important factor. On the abandoned flat site, floristic composition and physiognomy changed dramatically within four years; a high species turnover and a decline in phytodiversity could be observed. In contrast, we found only minor effects on the abandoned slope site even nine years after abandonment. If the maintenance of existing phytodiversity is a conservation target, suitable management operations have to be carried out at shorter intervals (at least every 3 years) in habitats with nutrient-rich soils than in nutrient-poor habitats (approx. 5 to 10 years). From a nature conservation point of view, low-intensity sheep grazing may be a suitable management alternative to mowing.",WOS:000312525200002,66,0.820003667,1,veget chang in an abandon mont grassland comp to chang in a habit with low intens sheep graz a cas study in styr austr in protect area maintain ex phytodivers is an import conserv target in thi study we analys the effect of abandon on plant specy composit and specy rich ov a period of nin year in a mont grassland in the long term ecosystem research lter reg eisenwurz styr austr addit investig concern the numb of red dat list specy plant strategy typ ellenberg ind valu ind valu for mow graz and trampl tol temp sequ of phenolog phas and sev plant trait we differenty two topograph rel habit typ an init specy rich sheep past on a steep sou fac slop and a less specy rich meadow on a flat sit immedy below with a comp high nutry and wat supply in the topsoil test a poss man altern the effect of continu low intens sheep graz on the slop wer also analys in spring on perm plot of m was est in the cent of each habit typ and tre our result show that the long term effect of abandon on grassland veget depend larg on loc sit condit nutry avail in the soil seem to be an espec import fact on the abandon flat sit flor composit and physiognom chang dram within four year a high specy turnov and a declin in phytodivers could be observ in contrast we found on min effect on the abandon slop sit ev nin year aft abandon if the maint of ex phytodivers is a conserv target suit man op hav to be carry out at short interv at least every year in habit with nutry rich soil than in nutry poor habit approx to year from a nat conserv point of view low intens sheep graz may be a suit man altern to mow,new,0.8438436337256762,0.7944358042331944,0.7601564482905321,0.7354134326208391,0.7166397603373816,0.7019699249788666,0.6903908535173406,0.681390804637988,0.6748629518323658,0.6712573280621782,0.6724791603379415
68,montgrass,Diversity of dry forest epiphytes along a gradient of human disturbance in the tropical Andes,"Disturbance effects on dry forest epiphytes are poorly known. How are epiphytic assemblages affected by different degrees of human disturbance, and what are the driving forces? An inter-Andean dry forest landscape at 2300 m elevation in northern Ecuador. We sampled epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants on 100 trees of Acacia macracantha in five habitats: closed-canopy mixed and pure acacia forest (old secondary), forest edge, young semi-closed secondary woodland, and isolated trees in grassland. Total species richness in forest edge habitats and on isolated trees was significantly lower than in closed forest types. Species density of vascular epiphytes (species per tree) did not differ significantly between habitat types. Species density of bryophytes, in contrast, was significantly lower in edge habitat and on isolated trees than in closed forest. Forest edge showed greater impoverishment than semi-closed woodland and similar floristic affinity to isolated trees and to closed forest types. Assemblages were significantly nested; habitat types with major disturbance held only subsets of the closed forest assemblages, indicating a gradual reduction in niche availability. Distance to forest had no effect on species density of epiphytes on isolated trees, but species density was closely correlated with crown closure, a measure of canopy integrity. Microclimatic changes but not dispersal constraints were key determinants of epiphyte assemblages following disturbance. Epiphytic cryptogams are sensitive indicators of microclimate and human disturbance in montane dry forests. The substantial impoverishment of edge habitat underlines the need for fragmentation studies on epiphytes elsewhere in the Tropics.",WOS:000263701500008,68,0.914106619,1,divers of dry forest epiphyt along a grady of hum disturb in the trop and disturb effect on dry forest epiphyt ar poor known how ar epiphys assembl affect by diff degr of hum disturb and what ar the driv forc an int and dry forest landscap at m elev in northern ecuad we sampl epiphys bryophyt and vascul plant on tre of acac macracanth in fiv habit clos canop mix and pur acac forest old second forest edg young sem clos second woodland and isol tre in grassland tot specy rich in forest edg habit and on isol tre was sign low than in clos forest typ specy dens of vascul epiphyt specy per tre did not diff sign between habit typ specy dens of bryophyt in contrast was sign low in edg habit and on isol tre than in clos forest forest edg show gre impov than sem clos woodland and simil flor affin to isol tre and to clos forest typ assembl wer sign nest habit typ with maj disturb held on subset of the clos forest assembl ind a grad reduc in nich avail dist to forest had no effect on specy dens of epiphyt on isol tre but specy dens was clos correl with crown clos a meas of canop integr microclim chang but not dispers constraint wer key determin of epiphyt assembl follow disturb epiphys cryptogam ar sensit ind of microclim and hum disturb in mont dry forest the subst impov of edg habit underlin the nee for frag study on epiphyt elsewh in the trop,new,0.9263202005804347,0.880903319635294,0.8429538298412036,0.8125030673157968,0.7873138237926212,0.7656538101906213,0.7462928888689977,0.7283044900626257,0.7107663198468375,0.6924073129552536,0.6705739001359132

A total of 51 soil samples were collected from the rhizospheres of the dominant plant species, and AM fungal structures were observed in 18 (82%) of 22 plant species examined. Vesicles and aseptate hyphae were the structures most frequently observed in the plant roots. After trap culture for 5 months, 25 AM fungal taxa were identified in the soil samples collected, of which nine belonged to Glomus, ten to Acaulospora, one to Entrophospora and five to Scutellospora. The frequency of occurrence of different genera and species varied greatly. Glomus was the dominant genus, and the most frequent and abundant species was Glomus mosseae. Over the whole sampling area, spore density in the rhizosphere soil of different host plant species ranged from 2 to 66 per 20 g air-dried soil. Overall AM fungal species richness was 2.10 and species diversity was 2.35. AM fungal diversity was also compared among the four different land use types (farmland and normal, disturbed and highly disturbed montane scrub grassland). Spore densities in the farmland and normal grassland were much higher than in the grasslands that had been degraded to varying degrees. The species richness in normal grassland was the highest of the four land use types examined.

781,montgrass,"Conservation genetics of two threatened frogs from the Mambilla highlands, Nigeria","Amphibians are the vertebrate group with the highest number of species threatened with extinction, and habitat loss and fragmentation are considered to be among the leading causes of their declines and extinctions. Little is known of the population biology of amphibian species inhabiting montane forests in Central and West Africa, where anthropogenic activities such as farming and cattle raising are major threats to native biodiversity. We used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) to assess the population genetic structure of two poorly known species, Cardioglossa schioetzi and Leptodactylodon bicolor (both in the Arthroleptidae), in and around Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve on the Mambilla Plateau in eastern Nigeria. The landscape comprises continuous forest on steep slopes and small riparian forest fragments in a grassland matrix. While increased fragmentation is well documented for these and other forests in the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria over the past century, there are no previous assessments of the impact of forest fragmentation on montane amphibian populations in this region. Our estimates of genetic diversity are similar across populations within each species with levels of heterozygosity values consistent with local population declines. Except for a pair of populations (C. schioetzi) we did not observe genetic differentiation between forest and riparian forest fragment populations, nor across sites within continuous forest (L. bicolor). Our results demonstrate recent gene flow between forest fragments and the adjacent protected forests and suggest that small forest corridors connecting these may lessen the genetic consequences of at least 30 years of intense and severe fragmentation in Ngel Nyaki.",WOS:000441738000047,78,0.836403267,1,conserv genet of two threatened frog from the mambill highland niger amphib ar the vertebr group with the highest numb of specy threatened with extinct and habit loss and frag ar consid to be among the lead caus of their declin and extinct littl is known of the pop biolog of amphib specy inhabit mont forest in cent and west afric wher anthropog act such as farm and cattl rais ar maj threats to nat biodivers we us ampl frag leng polymorph aflp to assess the pop genet structure of two poor known specy cardiogloss schioetzi and leptodactylodon bicol both in the arthroleptida in and around ngel nyak forest reserv on the mambill plateau in eastern niger the landscap compr continu forest on steep slop and smal rip forest frag in a grassland matrix whil increas frag is wel docu for thes and oth forest in the mountain of cameroon and niger ov the past century ther ar no prevy assess of the impact of forest frag on mont amphib pop in thi reg our estim of genet divers ar simil across pop within each specy with level of heterozygos valu consist with loc pop declin exceiv for a pair of pop c schioetzi we did not observ genet differenty between forest and rip forest frag pop nor across sit within continu forest l bicol our result demonst rec gen flow between forest frag and the adjac protect forest and suggest that smal forest corrid connect thes may less the genet consequ of at least year of intens and sev frag in ngel nyak,new,0.8202368674971574,0.7624885043630457,0.7230392795488881,0.6960455909762718,0.6770844674074856,0.6637680503155862,0.6549160989773952,0.6501983472840422,0.6501046814283502,0.6566465098883124,0.6760477640454107
96,montgrass,The value of semi-natural grasslands for the conservation of carabid beetles in long-term managed forested landscapes,"Species rich semi-natural grasslands are disappearing across Europe, affecting invertebrate diversity negatively. In NW Spain, the recent abandonment of traditional farming practices and the gradual decrease in grazing pressures are reducing the number and extent of montane grasslands. In this context, we investigated the composition of carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages that inhabit semi-natural grasslands situated in long-term managed oak and beech forested landscapes. According to their spatial arrangement, the studied grasslands were classified into: (1) interior or gap grasslands (small and completely surrounded by continuous forest) and (2) exterior grasslands (large and connected to a variety of habitat types). Our results indicate that, within each forested landscape, the gap and exterior grasslands harboured particular carabid assemblages (i. e. exclusive or abundantly collected species), which were also distinct from the surrounding forest carabid fauna. Dissimilarities between gap and exterior grasslands in each landscape suggest great carabid diversity at the regional scale. We also detected species-specific responses as several carabids were mainly associated with gap or exterior grasslands. Consequently, in highly modified forested landscapes, semi-natural grassland remnants may constitute great value for the protection of the carabid fauna. Specifically, we recommend conservation strategies that preserve variety in grassland features and maintain proper management activities to prevent the loss of specialised species and a decrease in regional carabid diversity.",WOS:000294460300007,96,0.872483153,0,the valu of sem nat grassland for the conserv of carabid beetl in long term man forest landscap specy rich sem nat grassland ar disappear across europ affect invertebr divers neg in nw spain the rec abandon of tradit farm pract and the grad decreas in graz press ar reduc the numb and ext of mont grassland in thi context we investig the composit of carabid beetl coleopter carabida assembl that inhabit sem nat grassland situ in long term man oak and beech forest landscap accord to their spat arrang the study grassland wer class into intery or gap grassland smal and complet surround by continu forest and extery grassland larg and connect to a vary of habit typ our result ind that within each forest landscap the gap and extery grassland harbo particul carabid assembl i e exclud or abund collect specy which wer also distinct from the surround forest carabid faun dissimil between gap and extery grassland in each landscap suggest gre carabid divers at the reg scal we also detect specy spec respons as sev carabid wer main assocy with gap or extery grassland consequ in high mod forest landscap sem nat grassland remn may constitut gre valu for the protect of the carabid faun spec we recommend conserv strategies that preserv vary in grassland feat and maintain prop man act to prev the loss of spec specy and a decreas in reg carabid divers,new,0.8884678753636698,0.8266945374585366,0.775828161355637,0.7358500342785538,0.703876480408671,0.6776288720210876,0.6555635630411625,0.6367011050540209,0.6204331170034484,0.6065128737403791,0.5954095930559438
104,montgrass,"Assessment of swaps and persistence in land cover changes in a subtropical periurban region, NW Argentina","A detailed spatial analysis of land cover changes was carried out in the periurban area of Great San Miguel de Tucuman and Sierra de San Javier, subtropical Argentina. Post-classification comparison of land cover maps of 1972 and 2010 was used to quantify the level of persistence, net gains, losses and swaps among urban, natural vegetation, and agriculture categories; framed in a hierarchical land use/cover classification. The spatial distribution of land cover changes was related to environmental and socio-economic variables. The overall land cover change pattern of ""periurban forest transition"" was characterized by urban expansion, agriculture adjustment and associated forest recovery. Montane forests showed a net increase of 10%, expanding over mountain grasslands, which in turn lost 66% of their original area. Dry forests experienced high levels of swaps, being relocated into more humid areas and further away from access roads. Simultaneously, herbaceous agriculture was concentrated in flat areas more suitable for modern mechanized agriculture. In the foothills of the San Javier range, urban areas tripled their original extension replacing fertile agricultural lands.(mainly sugar cane). Forest recovery and land-use intensification patterns are usually considered as an opportunity for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, these new forests are characterized by the abundance of exotic species with little known ecological properties. Also, the replacement of highly productive agriculture by urban developments, and of natural montane grasslands by forests, imply negative changes in terms of agriculture production, the conservation of grassland biodiversity and landscape configuration with high recreational value.

Therefore, the response of ants to clear-cutting and the time it takes for an ant community to recover after clear-cutting are important indicators of the effect of this harvesting technique on the forest ecosystem. We investigated ground-dwelling ant communities during secondary succession of deciduous forests in Transylvania, Romania. Using space-for-time substitution, we explored a chronosequence from clear-cuts to mature forests (> 120 years). The object was to determine if cutting has measurable effects on ant community structure, and if ant species richness differs between successional stages. We recorded a total of 24 species of ants, 11 characteristic of forests and seven of open landscape. Ant species richness was higher in clear-cuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands. Number of ant individuals was highest in young age classes and lowest in closed-canopy age classes. There was no drastic change in species richness during the succession, however differences in community composition at different stages were recorded. Open landscape species are able to rapidly colonize following disturbance but disappear when the forest sites mature and many forest ant species are capable of surviving clear cutting.",WOS:000396466400012,2,0.8875492629999999,1,success in ant commun hymenopter formicida in decidu forest clear cut an eastern europ cas study clear cut the main method of harvest in many forest in the world caus a sery of dram environ chang to the forest habit and remov habit resourc for arb and epig specy it result in consid chang in the composit of both plant and anim commun ant hav many crit rol in the maint and funct of forest ecosystem theref the respons of ant to clear cut and the tim it tak for an ant commun to recov aft clear cut ar import ind of the effect of thi harvest techn on the forest ecosystem we investig ground dwel ant commun dur second success of decidu forest in transylvan roman us spac for tim substitut we expl a chronosequence from clear cut to mat forest year the object was to determin if cut has meas effect on ant commun structure and if ant specy rich diff between success stag we record a tot of specy of ant charact of forest and sev of op landscap ant specy rich was high in clear cut comp to clos canop and old stand numb of ant individ was highest in young ag class and lowest in clos canop ag class ther was no drast chang in specy rich dur the success howev diff in commun composit at diff stag wer record op landscap specy ar abl to rapid colon follow disturb but disappear when the forest sit mat and many forest ant specy ar cap of surv clear cut,new,0.9340870393521833,0.9044313391617921,0.8812383058663766,0.8624869014330586,0.846374433043015,0.8317454788381785,0.8177783428476464,0.8037185658560662,0.7886155922718123,0.7707455823858582,0.7456832171510213

Knowledge on the biology and habitat demands of individual species is generally limited. We examined the influence on flat bugs of stand-age and clear-cutting, comparing five classes of spruce stands. The five classes were: clear-cut, unthinned, and thinned (all three products of current clear-cutting forestry), mature managed and old-growth stands (these two had never been clear-cut). We also compared unburned and recently burned mature pine forest. Fire, but not stand age, had a pronounced effect on species richness and total abundance. Aradus depressus showed a significant association with older forest stands. Aradus betulae occurred only in clear-cuts and burned forest indicating that this species is favored by disturbance in general.

45,taiga,Proportions of saproxylic beetle populations that utilise clear-cut stumps in a boreal landscape - Biodiversity implications for stump harvest,"Many saproxylic insects (insects dependent on deadwood) are threatened because the amounts of suitable substrate, coarse woody debris (CWD), are low in managed forests. Harvesting clear-cut stumps for bioenergy will decrease these amounts further and may therefore contribute to loss of biodiversity. Earlier studies have demonstrated that many saproxylic beetle species utilise clear-cut stumps. However, the importance of stumps compared with other kinds of deadwood remains unknown. In particular, some species adapted to sun-exposed deadwood created by disturbances might, in managed forest landscapes, be dependent on stumps in clear-cuts. In the present study we quantify the proportions of landscape-wide populations of saproxylic beetles that are recruited from clear-cut stumps in a managed boreal forest landscape. The amount of bark on clear-cut stumps and population densities (beetles per m(2) bark) were estimated for a 24,499 ha landscape in Sweden. Our data were pooled with estimates from a similar study in the same landscape, including all other types of CWD and beetle densities. The clear-cut stumps were estimated to contribute 15.5% of total bark to CWD in the landscape. For spruce, clear-cut stumps contributed 37.9% of the total bark. Of 39 analysed beetle species, 13 were estimated to have more than 10% of their populations in clear-cut stumps, 9 more than 50%, and 5 more than 80%. Clear-Cut stumps are thus an important breeding substrate for many beetle species and consequently, intensive stump harvest risks decreasing biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

55,taiga,Does the decline of red wood ants after clear-cutting favour epigeic arthropods?,"In forest ecosystems in the temperate and boreal zones in Europe, red wood ants (RWA, Formica rufa group) have a significant affect as predators and competitors in communities of ground-dwelling arthropods. Therefore, the spatiotemporal distribution and abundance of RWA affect the distribution of many other species. The hypothesis that a reduction in the abundance of RWA in clear-cut areas enables other arthropods to increase in abundance was tested. The study was conducted in NW Poland in 2007 and 2008. A total of 276 1x1 m plots were sampled and 1,696 individuals recorded. The probability of the occurrence of RWA decreased significantly towards the center of clear-cut areas and increased with increasing plant cover. The frequency of Lasius platythorax, Formica fusca and spiders in the plots significantly increased towards the edge of a clear-cut area. Moreover, the occurrence of L. platythorax was negatively associated with the presence of RWA, while that of the Myrmica species was positively associated. The effect of the distance to the edge of a clear-cut area seems to be much more pronounced than the effect of RWA. This suggests that the arthropods studied prefer habitats close to the edge that are utilized by RWA than RWA-free sites located in the centre of clear-cut areas.",WOS:000291955100013,5,0.7160810040000001,1,doe the declin of red wood ant aft clear cut favo epig arthropod in forest ecosystem in the temp and bor zon in europ red wood ant rwa formic ruf group hav a sign affect as pred and competit in commun of ground dwel arthropod theref the spatiotemp distribut and abund of rwa affect the distribut of many oth specy the hypothes that a reduc in the abund of rwa in clear cut area en oth arthropod to increas in abund was test the study was conduc in nw poland in and a tot of x m plot wer sampl and individ record the prob of the occur of rwa decreas sign toward the cent of clear cut area and increas with increas plant cov the frequ of lasi platythorax formic fusc and spid in the plot sign increas toward the edg of a clear cut are moreov the occur of l platythorax was neg assocy with the pres of rwa whil that of the myrmic specy was posit assocy the effect of the dist to the edg of a clear cut are seem to be much mor pronount than the effect of rwa thi suggest that the arthropod study pref habit clos to the edg that ar util by rwa than rwa fre sit loc in the cent of clear cut area,new,0.7908400085533033,0.7243562087573218,0.6779953895908502,0.6442993951768887,0.6185505561045248,0.5982481892643039,0.5820489863315554,0.5692834622941375,0.5598334113349431,0.5543710859085498,0.5556081384022168
67,taiga,Effects of low severity burning after clear-cutting on mid-boreal ant communities in the two years after fire,"Fire is important in maintaining a diversity of communities and landscapes in boreal ecosystems, but, in recent times, forest management has suppressed fires. Managers now commonly burn a proportion of clear-cuts in Sweden to conserve components of the fire-favoured fauna, but effects of these treatments on the ant fauna are unknown. We compared ant communities between burned and control clear-cuts to determine their value for this important faunal group. Ants were collected in 1995 and 1996 from 5 burned and 5 control clear-cuts in mid-boreal Sweden. We compared abundances of workers and reproductive females of common species between the treatments. Burned and control clear-cuts supported similar abundances of common species, differing only in the abundance of Leptothorax acervorum queens collected in 1995. This suggests that L. acervorum was attracted to the burning, but we did not detect an increase in the abundance of its workers the following year. The abundance of dominant red wood ants (E rufa group) was not correlated with that of any other species, suggesting that their patchy occurrence did not conceal differences between treatments. Our findings suggest that nests of many ant species survive low severity fires. Habitat structure is likely to be important in determining ant community structure and low severity burning in disturbed open habitats, such as the clear-cuts examined in this study, may not significantly alter habitat structure relative to unburned habitats in the short term.",WOS:000245699800009,6,0.794995068,1,effect of low sev burn aft clear cut on mid bor ant commun in the two year aft fir fir is import in maintain a divers of commun and landscap in bor ecosystem but in rec tim forest man has suppress fir man now common burn a proport of clear cut in swed to conserv compon of the fir favo faun but effect of thes tre on the ant faun ar unknown we comp ant commun between burn and control clear cut to determin their valu for thi import faun group ant wer collect in and from burn and control clear cut in mid bor swed we comp abund of work and reproduc fem of common specy between the tre burn and control clear cut support simil abund of common specy diff on in the abund of leptothorax acervor queen collect in thi suggest that l acervor was attract to the burn but we did not detect an increas in the abund of it work the follow year the abund of domin red wood ant e ruf group was not correl with that of any oth specy suggest that their patchy occur did not cont diff between tre our find suggest that nest of many ant specy surv low sev fir habit structure is lik to be import in determin ant commun structure and low sev burn in disturb op habit such as the clear cut examin in thi study may not sign alt habit structure rel to unburn habit in the short term,new,0.8487355743053837,0.8166365178590359,0.7953046413087486,0.7798028236751561,0.767743472324913,0.7579846305455188,0.749932508107675,0.7432885469369566,0.7380008021746882,0.7343517205102653,0.7335493239400529
76,taiga,Pelagic food webs of humic lakes show low short-term response to forest harvesting,"Forest harvest in the boreal zone can increase the input of terrestrial materials such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) into nearby aquatic ecosystems, with potential effects on phytoplankton growth through enhanced nutrient (i.e., positive) or reduced light availability (i.e., negative), which may affect ecosystem productivity and consumer resource use. Here, we conducted forest clear-cutting experiments in the catchments of four small, humic, and nitrogen-limited unproductive boreal lakes (two controls and two clear-cut, 18% and 44% of area cut) with one reference and two impact years. Our aim was to assess the effects of forest clear-cutting on pelagic biomass production and consumer resource use. We found that pelagic biomass production did not change after two years of forest clear-cutting: Pelagic primary and bacterial production (PP, BP), PP:BP ratio, chl a, and seston carbon (seston C) were unaffected by clear-cutting; neither did tree harvest affect seston stoichiometry (i.e., N:phosphorus [P], C:P) nor induce changes in zooplankton resource use, biomass, or community composition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that pelagic food webs of humic lakes (DOC > 15 mg/L) might be resilient to a moderate form of forest clear-cutting, at least two years after tree removal, before mechanical site preparation (e.g., mounding, plowing) and when leaving buffer strips along lakes and incoming streams. Thus, pelagic food web responses to forest clear-cutting might not be universal, but could depend on factors such as the time scale, share of catchment logged, and the forest practices involved, including the application of buffer strips and site preparation.",WOS:000454685500002,7,0.565383057,0,pel food web of hum lak show low short term respons to forest harvest forest harvest in the bor zon can increas the input of terrest mat such as dissolv org carbon doc and nit no into nearby aqu ecosystem with pot effect on phytoplankton grow through enh nutry i e posit or reduc light avail i e neg which may affect ecosystem produc and consum resourc us her we conduc forest clear cut expery in the catch of four smal hum and nitrog limit unproduc bor lak two control and two clear cut and of are cut with on ref and two impact year our aim was to assess the effect of forest clear cut on pel biomass produc and consum resourc us we found that pel biomass produc did not chang aft two year of forest clear cut pel prim and bact produc pp bp pp bp ratio chl a and seston carbon seston c wer unaffect by clear cut neith did tre harvest affect seston stoichiometry i e n phosphor p c p nor induc chang in zooplankton resourc us biomass or commun composit in conclud our find suggest that pel food web of hum lak doc mg l might be resy to a mod form of forest clear cut at least two year aft tre remov bef mech sit prep e g mound plow and when leav buff strips along lak and incom streams thu pel food web respons to forest clear cut might not be univers but could depend on fact such as the tim scal shar of catch log and the forest pract involv includ the apply of buff strips and sit prep,new,0.6231093394303887,0.5680095887845489,0.5379551300898281,0.5212635500942544,0.512623964946074,0.5098584508598085,0.5122503939703822,0.5201331409813806,0.5351463412709014,0.5615569439151938,0.6109247403736963
87,taiga,Resilience of bryophyte communities to clear-cutting of boreal stream-side forests,"We asked if short-term changes in bryophyte communities in response to clear-cutting of boreal stream-side forests are persistent and whether species with low resilience may survive in narrow riparian buffer strips. To assess short-term changes and the function of buffer strips we compared the bryophyte community in permanent 0.1 ha plots of mature forest before and after clear-cutting. Persistent changes were inferred by pair-wise comparisons of 0.1 ha plots of mature forests with carefully matched 0.1 ha plots in stands established after clear-cutting 30-50 years earlier. Total bryophyte species richness did not respond significantly to clear-cutting. However, richness changed in many subgroups defined by phylogenetic, habitat or substrate affinity. Numbers of both liverwort and forest species were significantly reduced on clear-cuts and these differences remained significant, although smaller, 30-50 years after clear-cutting. In contrast, there were short-term increases in richness of mosses and of species growing on disturbed mineral soil, but these species numbers returned to mature-forest levels in the young stands. Number of species associated with convex substrates, especially woody debris species, was strongly reduced by clear-cutting and showed no significant recovery after 30-50 years. Hence, most of the negative effects of clear-cutting on bryophyte species persist almost halfway into the next forestry rotation period. However, narrow buffer strips (10 m on each side) prevented most of the short-term extirpations of species with low resilience on clear-cuts. Buffer strips may thus be effective in conserving the bryophyte flora of stream-side forests, but their longterm function as refugia and their contribution to population recovery in other parts of the landscape need further evaluation.

95,taiga,"Forestry Alters Foraging Efficiency and Crop Contents of Aphid-Tending Red Wood Ants, Formica aquilonia","Forest management alters species behaviours, distributions and interactions. To evaluate forestry effects on ant foraging performance, we compared the quality and quantity of honeydew harvested by ants among clear-cuts, middle-aged and mature spruce-dominated stands in boreal forests in Sweden. Honeydew quality was examined using honeydew collected by squeezing the gasters of laden Formica aquilonia workers. We used fifteen laden individuals at each study site (four replicates of each stand age) and analysed honeydew chemical composition with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. To compare the quantity of honeydew collected by individual ants, we collected and weighed five ants moving up and five ants moving down each of ten trees at the twelve sites (totally 1200 ants). The concentration of trehalose in honeydew was lower in clear-cuts compared with middle aged and mature stands, and similar trends were shown for sucrose, raffinose and melezitose, indicating poorer honeydew quality on clear cuts. Concentrations of the amino acid serine were higher on clear-cuts. The same trend occurred for glutamine, suggesting that increased N-uptake by the trees after clear cutting is reflected in the honeydew of aphids. Ants in mature stands had larger heads and carried proportionally more honeydew and may therefore be more efficient foragers. Human alternation of habitats through clear-cutting thus affects food quality and worker condition in F. aquilonia. This is the first study to show that honeydew quality is affected by anthropogenic disturbances, likely contributing to the reduction in size and abundance of F. aquilonia workers and mounds after clear cutting.",WOS:000303129700016,9,0.61125085,0,forestry alt for efficy and crop cont of aphid tend red wood ant formic aquilon forest man alt specy behavio distribut and interact to evalu forestry effect on ant for perform we comp the qual and quant of honeydew harvest by ant among clear cut middl ag and mat spruce domin stand in bor forest in swed honeydew qual was examin us honeydew collect by squeez the gast of lad formic aquilon work we us fifteen lad individ at each study sit four reply of each stand ag and analys honeydew chem composit with gas chromatography mass spectroscop to comp the quant of honeydew collect by individ ant we collect and weigh fiv ant mov up and fiv ant mov down each of ten tre at the twelv sit tot ant the cont of trehalos in honeydew was low in clear cut comp with middl ag and mat stand and simil trend wer shown for sucros raffinos and melezitos ind poor honeydew qual on clear cut cont of the amino acid serin wer high on clear cut the sam trend occur for glutamin suggest that increas n uptak by the tre aft clear cut is reflect in the honeydew of aphid ant in mat stand had larg head and carry proport mor honeydew and may theref be mor efficy for hum altern of habit through clear cut thu affect food qual and work condit in f aquilon thi is the first study to show that honeydew qual is affect by anthropog disturb lik contribut to the reduc in siz and abund of f aquilon work and mound aft clear cut,new,0.6926761417170975,0.6759481821098642,0.6696170473206183,0.668341934591156,0.6703460420679971,0.6751330616268154,0.68275992151318,0.6937952650456702,0.7096009750023232,0.7332089445759715,0.7720628875509351
106,taiga,Saproxylic beetles in high stumps and residual downed wood on clear-cuts and in forest edges,"This study evaluates how the placement and the different possible outcomes of a spruce retention tree affected species richness and assemblages of spruce-associated saproxylic beetles. In a field experiment in the boreal zone of central Norway, high stumps were created and compared with residual wood pieces (i.e. top boles with branches), in clear-cuts versus in forest edges. Flight interception traps were mounted close to the substrate. The results were analysed using rarefaction techniques, ordination (DCA) and ANOVA. It was found that the placement of retention trees of spruce does matter: beetle assemblages were significantly different in stumps in the four treatments. For all species pooled, the species richness was higher in stumps in clear-cuts than in stumps or boles in the forest edge. Four red-listed species were more abundant near stumps than boles, and two red-listed species were more abundant in clear-cuts than forest edge.

1110,taiga,Comparison of moth communities following clear-cutting and wildfire disturbance in the southern boreal forest,"Nocturnal macrolepidopteran fauna (moths) of the southern boreal forest of Ontario, Canada, were compared between forests clear-cut or burned by wildfire approximately 5 years previously to assess whether their assemblages differed following disturbance. Moths were light-trapped for 27 days during the summer in three burned and three clear-cut sites that had been formerly mature mixed jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest. The dominant species varied throughout the summer (Protorthodes oviduca dominated in June, Orthodes cynica in July and Idia americalis in August), but they were similar between disturbance types. Diversity indices were similar although ordinations showed significant differences between the two disturbance types. Nine species were more significantly abundant in burn than clearcut sites (Callopistra cordata, Cyclophora pendulinaria, Gluphisia septentrionis, Hyppa nr. xylinoides, Nemoria rubrifrontaria, Semiothisa neptaria, Spiramater lutra, and Tacparia detersata), whereas the converse was true for three species (Acronicta innotata. Phyllodesma Americana, and Euxoa comosa). Vegetation composition, disturbance age, percentage of jack pine pre-disturbance, and amount of downed woody debris and snags were the most important environmental correlates of moth community composition. Our study supports that of previous work on the effects of forest disturbance and biodiversity suggesting that clear-cutting may emulate wildfire for some organisms, but not for others. Thus, forest managers must consider multiple aspects of forest structure in attempting to use clear-cuts to mimic fire. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

125,taiga,History matters: Impact of historical land use on butterfly diversity in clear-cuts in a boreal landscape,"In Swedish boreal landscapes, the loss of species-rich semi-natural grasslands is largely due to a long history of agricultural abandonment. Large areas historically managed as meadows have become mature coniferous forest. This study focused on the potential biological legacy following a long period of grassland abandonment. The butterfly fauna in clear-cuts which was historically meadows and abandoned long enough to allow a generation of conifers to mature (70-90 years) was compared with clear-cuts which were historically coniferous forest. The results showed that clear-cuts historically managed as meadows were: (i) much richer in individuals, (ii) more species-rich, and (iii) contained many more grassland specialists than clear-cuts with a history as forest, with many of these species threatened in other parts of Europe. The results from our study demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the legacy of historical land-use in remnant plant communities can affect butterfly diversity in clear-cuts and hence the large-scale dynamics over a timescale of a full tree rotation. The results of this study have implications for forest management practices. Replanting clear-cuts on land that was previously meadows with deciduous trees or allowing the forest to regenerate naturally instead of planting conifers would make it possible to preserve a greater diversity of habitats for butterflies and other organisms.

135,taiga,Relative importance of thinned and clear-cut stands for bryophyte diversity on stumps,"The interest in harvesting logging residues in the form of stumps has recently increased markedly in the Nordic countries of Europe due to the steadily growing market for bio-fuel from forestry. Yet, stumps are currently harvested without a solid knowledge of their importance for forest organisms. To assess the relative importance of thinned, clear-cut, and burned clear-cut stands for the diversity of bryophytes on stumps we investigated bryophyte species composition and richness on 755 spruce stumps in 27 forest stands in southern-boreal Finland. Stumps were sampled within both wet and dry sites. For comparison we also surveyed bryophytes on 669 ground plots in the same stands to assess if patterns were consistent regardless of substrate type. Stand type (i.e. thinned, clear-cut, or burned clear-cut) was the main predictor of both species richness and composition on stumps. Stumps in thinned stands were more species rich than in clear-cuts, and the lowest richness was found on stumps in burned clear-cuts. Differences in species composition were explained by higher frequency of occurrence of species in thinned than in clear-cut stands. Thus, stumps in clear-cut stands tended to host a subset of species from the thinned stands, but there was also a pattern of turnover where different species were present in thinned and clear-cut stands, respectively. The results were similar for bryophytes on ground indicating that canopy cover strongly affected the diversity of bryophytes regardless of substrate. We conclude that stump harvest in open, clear-cut stands will probably have minor effects on bryophyte diversity on dead wood in the managed forest landscape. Conservation efforts in thinned stands (e.g. retention and creation of dead wood) may be important for promoting the diversity of bryophytes in managed forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

146,taiga,Time-lagged lichen extinction in retained buffer strips 16.5 years after clear-cutting,"Tree retention on clear-cuts is a relatively new measure in forestry aimed at lifeboating' forest species during young seral periods. However, the effectiveness of tree retention for maintaining biodiversity for more than a few years is still poorly known. We investigated lichen persistence in retained buffer strips along small streams after clear-cutting of the surrounding forest, and compared with clear-cuts and un-cut references. Specifically, we compared richness and frequency of red-listed/signal species, calicioids and pendulous species before clear cutting with 2.5 years and 16.5 years after clear-cutting, and also analysed their colonization-extinction dynamics over time. The results show that the richness of red-listed/signal species and calicioids in buffer strips had declined significantly after 16.5 years, but not after 2.5 years, while frequency displayed a significant difference already after 2.5 years. The richness of pendulous lichens remained relatively stable over time, but the frequency had declined significantly after 16.5 years. In clear-cuts all groups declined more than in buffer-strips (-2-3.5 times more) and the main decline had occurred already after 2.5 years. References remained stable over time. The colonization-extinctions dynamics reflected the richness declines, with high early extinction in clear cuts and lower but late extinction in buffer-strips, and low (re)colonization. We conclude that retained buffer strips cannot maintain lichen richness over time due to time-lagged extinction, but they are clearly more effective than clear-cuts. Wider buffer strips could potentially reduce tree mortality and decrease lichen extinction. The large amounts of standing dead wood makes buffer strips potential future colonization targets.",WOS:000442003900006,14,0.574325272,0,tim lag lich extinct in retain buff strips year aft clear cut tre ret on clear cut is a rel new meas in forestry aim at lifebo forest specy dur young ser period howev the effect of tre ret for maintain biodivers for mor than a few year is stil poor known we investig lich persist in retain buff strips along smal streams aft clear cut of the surround forest and comp with clear cut and un cut ref spec we comp rich and frequ of red list sign specy calicioid and pend specy bef clear cut with year and year aft clear cut and also analys their colon extinct dynam ov tim the result show that the rich of red list sign specy and calicioid in buff strips had declin sign aft year but not aft year whil frequ display a sign diff already aft year the rich of pend lich remain rel stabl ov tim but the frequ had declin sign aft year in clear cut al group declin mor than in buff strips tim mor and the main declin had occur already aft year ref remain stabl ov tim the colon extinct dynam reflect the rich declin with high ear extinct in clear cut and low but lat extinct in buff strips and low re colon we conclud that retain buff strips cannot maintain lich rich ov tim due to tim lag extinct but they ar clear mor effect than clear cut wid buff strips could pot reduc tre mort and decreas lich extinct the larg amount of stand dead wood mak buff strips pot fut colon target,new,0.6656730464622146,0.6242082087960539,0.6017629798831357,0.5888258449804415,0.5816476374877259,0.5787985118937355,0.5798457026677045,0.5850835737083322,0.5957559536302433,0.6150379607538902,0.6515237627228658
155,taiga,"Responses of boreal carabid beetle assemblages (Coleoptera, Carabidae) to clear-cutting and top-soil preparation","Today, forestry is the most important disturbance force in Fennoscandian boreal forests, having remarkably altered fauna and flora in this biome. However, since the late 1900s, forest-management practices have been modified to better consider biodiversity while harvesting timber. For example, green-tree retention, gap felling, and lighter top-soil preparation methods (harrowing) have been introduced, but little is known about the ecological effects of these changes. We sampled carabid beetles in seven clear-cut stands that were subsequently harrowed. We studied the effects of (1) clear-cut size by comparing carabid catches of small gaps (ca. 0.16 ha) with those of larger clear-cuts (ca. 2 ha), and (2) microsite type within stands by comparing carabid catches of strips of bare soil to those of drifted humus (adjacent to bare-soil strips) and undisturbed (not scarified) forest floor. We detected only slight effects of clear-cut size on the assemblage structure, but clearer differences at species and ecological-group levels among the three compared micro-site types. The catches of forest carabids, and flightless carabids, were higher in the undisturbed micro-sites as compared to bare-soil ones, whereas open-habitat carabids showed the opposite abundance pattern. The variation among study blocks, and logging per se (compared to un-logged mature stands), had more pronounced effects on carabid assemblage structure than either clear-cut size or micro-site.

166,taiga,Effects of stump extraction on saproxylic beetle diversity in Swedish clear-cuts,"1. Stump extraction for bio energy is a new forestry activity and before large-scale implementation occurs, it is important to analyse its consequences. Saproxylic beetles depend on dead trees and stump extraction will reduce the amount of habitat available for this group. 2. Early warning signs of impending regional species extinctions were looked for in areas where stump harvest has only been conducted for about 3years. In a paired design (N=8), the beetle fauna was sampled in stumps on ordinary clear-cuts and on clear-cuts from which stumps had been extracted. Sampling in extraction clear-cuts was possible because 25% of the stump volume was retained. Samples were collected by bark sieving ten Norway spruce, Picea abies, stumps per clear-cut. 3. In total, 6959 individuals of 46 species were found. Several early warning signs were seen: stump extraction reduced the number of species per stump and per clear-cut and reduced the species evenness in individual stumps. 4. Species at higher trophic levels (predators and fungivores), in particular, suffered negative effects. Stump extraction reduced the number of species of fungivores and facultative predators/fungivores at the clear-cut level and reduced the relative abundance of predators at the stump level. 5. These results indicate that if stumps are extracted from a high proportion of the clear-cuts in a region, the present recommendations of leaving 15-25% of the stump volume will be insufficient for preserving the beetle fauna in the stumps. Further studies are needed to identify levels of stump retention that do not lead to species loss.",WOS:000321501800004,16,0.618646063,1,effect of stump extract on saproxyl beetl divers in swed clear cut stump extract for bio energy is a new forestry act and bef larg scal impl occ it is import to analys it consequ saproxyl beetl depend on dead tre and stump extract wil reduc the amount of habit avail for thi group ear warn sign of impend reg specy extinct wer look for in area wher stump harvest has on been conduc for about year in a pair design n the beetl faun was sampl in stump on ordin clear cut and on clear cut from which stump had been extract sampl in extract clear cut was poss becaus of the stump volum was retain sampl wer collect by bark siev ten norway spruce pice aby stump per clear cut in tot individ of specy wer found sev ear warn sign wer seen stump extract reduc the numb of specy per stump and per clear cut and reduc the specy ev in individ stump specy at high troph level pred and fung in particul suff neg effect stump extract reduc the numb of specy of fung and facult pred fung at the clear cut level and reduc the rel abund of pred at the stump level thes result ind that if stump ar extract from a high proport of the clear cut in a reg the pres recommend of leav of the stump volum wil be insufficy for preserv the beetl faun in the stump furth study ar nee to ident level of stump ret that do not lead to specy loss,new,0.5557863439925834,0.5234682839043495,0.5078602362937918,0.501217711405352,0.5004888035202424,0.5045987038417402,0.513487241372393,0.5280089109430339,0.5503878600365288,0.585788896482559,0.6473619910171198
175,taiga,Slope aspect modifies community responses to clear-cutting in Boreal forests,"Slope aspect modifies microclimate and influences ecological processes and spatial distribution of species across forest landscapes, but the impact of slope aspect on community responses to disturbance is poorly understood. Such insight is necessary to understand landscape community dynamics and resilience. We compared bryophyte (liverworts and mosses) communities in matched 0.02-ha plots of four boreal stand types in central Sweden: recently clear-felled and mature stands dominated by Norway spruce in south-facing and north-facing slopes. Differences between forests and clear-cuts were interpreted as effects of clear-cutting, and differences between south- and north-facing slopes as effects of aspect. In response to clear-cutting, bryophyte cover and composition changed more in south-facing slopes. Only one out of ten significantly declining species in south- facing slopes also declined significantly in north-facing slopes. North-facing slopes lost fewer bryophyte species, and among those, fewer forest species and fewer species associated with wood and bark. In north-facing slopes, the average proportions of mosses and liverworts shared between the forest and the clear-cut plot were 88% and 74%, respectively. Corresponding numbers for south- facing slopes were 79% and 33%. In addition, more bryophyte species were added in north-than south- facing slopes after clear-cutting, somewhat reducing the difference in compositional change between aspects. South- and north-facing mature forests differed in species composition, mostly due to higher richness of mosses in south- facing slopes. The smaller changes in bryophyte communities on north-facing slopes in response to clear- cutting have implications for ecosystem dynamics and management as high local survival may enhance landscape-level resilience.",WOS:000245668500024,17,0.698354923,1,slop aspect mod commun respons to clear cut in bor forest slop aspect mod microclim and influ ecolog process and spat distribut of specy across forest landscap but the impact of slop aspect on commun respons to disturb is poor understood such insight is necess to understand landscap commun dynam and resy we comp bryophyt liverwort and moss commun in match ha plot of four bor stand typ in cent swed rec clear fel and mat stand domin by norway spruce in sou fac and nor fac slop diff between forest and clear cut wer interpret as effect of clear cut and diff between sou and nor fac slop as effect of aspect in respons to clear cut bryophyt cov and composit chang mor in sou fac slop on on out of ten sign declin specy in sou fac slop also declin sign in nor fac slop nor fac slop lost few bryophyt specy and among thos few forest specy and few specy assocy with wood and bark in nor fac slop the av proport of moss and liverwort shar between the forest and the clear cut plot wer and respect correspond numb for sou fac slop wer and in addit mor bryophyt specy wer ad in nor than sou fac slop aft clear cut somewh reduc the diff in composit chang between aspect sou and nor fac mat forest diff in specy composit most due to high rich of moss in sou fac slop the smal chang in bryophyt commun on nor fac slop in respons to clear cut hav imply for ecosystem dynam and man as high loc surv may enh landscap level resy,new,0.6881970908793987,0.6142168831045838,0.5682459905777673,0.5380907023238024,0.5174295184075356,0.503275948339252,0.49425099353432905,0.4899785435376449,0.4910829579260202,0.4999678474399872,0.5239971579531498
185,taiga,Clear-cuts in production forests: From matrix to neo-habitat for butterflies,"Butterfly conservation in Europe is mainly focused on well-defined grassland habitat patches. Such an approach ignores the impact of the surrounding landscape, which may contain complementary resources and facilitate dispersal. Here, we investigated butterfly species richness and abundance in a habitat normally regarded as unsuitable matrix: production forestry clear-cuts. Butterflies were recorded in 48 clear-cuts in southern Sweden differing with regards to the time since clear-cutting and land-use history (meadow or forest based on historical maps from the 1870s). All clear-cuts had been managed as production forests for at least 80-120 years. A total of 39 species were found in clear-cuts of both land-use histories, but clear-cuts with a history as meadow had on average 34% higher species richness and 19% higher abundance than did clear-cuts with a history as forest. No effect of the time since clear-cutting was found, irrespective of land-use history, which was likely due to the narrow timespan sampled (<8 years). The absence of temporal effect suggests that clear-cuts may provide butterflies with valuable resources for 10-15 years. Assuming a 100 year forest rotational cycle, this means that 10-15% of the total forested area are made up by clear-cuts valuable to butterflies, which corresponds to an area about four times as large as that of species-rich semi-natural grasslands. The study illustrates the importance of considering land-use legacies in ecological research and question the landscape-ecological view that clear-cuts make up an unsuitable matrix for butterflies. Moreover, forest conservation management with special attention to land-use history may increase the quality of the landscape, thus facilitating butterfly metapopulation persistence. Given their large area and assets of nectar and host plant resources, clear-cuts must be considered as a butterfly habitat in its own right. Being a man-made environment with short history, we might call it a neo-habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

197,taiga,The effect of clear-cutting and wildfire on soil Oribatida (Acari) in windthrown stands of the High Tatra Mountains (Slovakia),"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of clear-cutting and wildfire on soil Oribatida in spruce forest stands in the High Tatra Mts. (Slovakia), which were heavily damaged by windthrow in 2004. Additionally, a part of the clear-cut area was subsequently damaged by wildfire in 2005. The investigation was carried out in 2007 in following treatments: clear-cut stands (EXT), wildfire stands (FIR) and control spruce stands (REF). Significantly lower abundance of Oribatida was found in FIR and EXT compared to REF stands. REF stands had clearly higher total species richness followed by EXT and FIR stands (47, 34, 29 species, respectively). NMS ordination showed considerable differences in the composition of Oribatida communities between treatments. The abundance of dominant Hermannia gibba, Oppiella nova and Tectocepheus velatus velatus was significantly lower in EXT and FIR compared to REF stands. The abundances of surface living H. gibba and Liacarus corracinus were low in EXT stands, whereas in FIR stands, H. gibba was rare and L. coracinus was totally absent. On the other hand, Oribatula tibialis had higher abundance in FIR stands than in others.

203,taiga,Edge effects created by wildfire and clear-cutting on boreal forest ground-dwelling spiders,"The response of ground-dwelling spider assemblages to edges created by wildfire was compared to their response to clear-cut edges in black spruce forests in eastern Canada. For each disturbance six edge transects 100 m long were established. Spiders were collected with pitfall traps 10 m apart from 50 m inside the disturbances to 50 m in the forest interior. Measurements of the forest floor structure and the habitat around the traps were also taken. Most habitat variables varied similarly across both wildfire and clear-cut edges but two variables, coarse woody debris and shrub cover changed more abruptly at edges of clear-cuts than at wildfire edges. Two separate CA analyses of the burned and clear-cut edge transects showed that changes in spider community species composition were more abrupt at clear-cut edges than at burn edges. A species indicator analysis (INDVAL) was used to identify species that were significantly associated with specific edge zones. Eight species were significantly associated with open (disturbed) habitats, one species was significantly associated with both burned and clear-cut edges, and four species were significantly associated with the forest interior. T-tests of slope coefficients from separate simple regressions of abundance and richness over distance showed that open habitat specialist's abundance and richness changed significantly more abruptly at clear-cut edges than at wildfire edges. Locally weighted smoothed regressions showed that the extent of edge influence on ground-dwelling spider guilds (open habitat and forest interior specialist) penetrated 20-30 m into the disturbances, 30 m into the forest interior at clear-cut edges, and at least 50 m into the forest interior for wildfire edge transects. Our results suggest that a minimum width of 100 m is necessary to maintain characteristics of forest interior spider assemblages in forest remnants, riparian or road buffers, and forest strips between cut-blocks.

273,taiga,Habitat composition and bird diversity in managed boreal forests,"This study investigated the occurrence of 25 forest bird species in relation to stand and landscape habitat composition in managed boreal forests in central Sweden. The number of species in 10 km transects was positively correlated to the proportions of forest > 40 yrs and Mixed forest > 40 yrs, as well as the number of fragments of the latter, while negatively correlated to the proportions of clear-cuts and young forest. Transects with > 60% older forest including > 6% mixed habitats showed the highest number of bird species and individuals. The positive effect on species numbers of mixed forest was stronger in the study area where deciduous rich habitats were generally less abundant. Bird species richness in points of similar habitat was negatively correlated to the degree of fragmentation of the surrounding older forest. However, in a species-by-species analysis at the transect level no effects of fragmentation were found. The number of bird species at points was positively influenced by the increase from 0 to 5% deciduous trees, while no effect of higher deciduous site proportions showed. The hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) appeared as a significant indicator of high bird diversity at the transect ( landscape) level, by all methods used. However, the conclusion was reached that forests where the hazel grouse, blue tit (Parus caeruleus), treecreeper (Certia familiaris), jay (Garrulus glandarius) and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) are present are most likely to hold the potential for high bird species richness.",WOS:000183612100004,273,0.916255328,1,habit composit and bird divers in man bor forest thi study investig the occur of forest bird specy in rel to stand and landscap habit composit in man bor forest in cent swed the numb of specy in km transect was posit correl to the proport of forest yr and mix forest yr as wel as the numb of frag of the lat whil neg correl to the proport of clear cut and young forest transect with old forest includ mix habit show the highest numb of bird specy and individ the posit effect on specy numb of mix forest was stronger in the study are wher decidu rich habit wer gen less abund bird specy rich in point of simil habit was neg correl to the degr of frag of the surround old forest howev in a specy by specy analys at the transect level no effect of frag wer found the numb of bird specy at point was posit influ by the increas from to decidu tre whil no effect of high decidu sit proport show the hazel grous bonas bonas appear as a sign ind of high bird divers at the transect landscap level by al method us howev the conclud was reach that forest wher the hazel grous blu tit par caerule treecreep cert famili jay garrul glandari and capercail tetrao urogall ar pres ar most lik to hold the pot for high bird specy rich,new,0.9355971412966169,0.900909842594893,0.8719897179948244,0.8484812314755967,0.8288346532756993,0.8117726250981493,0.796396539367134,0.7819878686448648,0.7678171007328272,0.7528384420681337,0.7347873966996992
445,taiga,Comparison of breeding bird and vegetation communities in primary and secondary forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We compared breeding bird communities and vegetation characteristics at paired point locations in primary (undisturbed) and mature secondary forest (70-100 years old) sites in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA to understand how sites logged prior to creation of the park compare to undisturbed sites following 70 years of protection from human disturbance. We found that bird and vegetation communities are currently similar, but retain some differences in species composition. Rank abundance curves for primary and secondary forest bird communities showed very similar patterns of species dominance. Species composition was also similar on the two sites which shared 24 of the 25 most frequently recorded species. Nonetheless, comparisons of density estimates derived from distance sampling showed three bird species were more abundant on primary forest sites and that one bird species was significantly more abundant on secondary forest sites. Notably, comparisons based on raw counts (unadjusted for potential differences in detectability) produced somewhat different results. Analyses of vegetation samples for the paired sites also showed relative similarity, but with some differences between primary and secondary forests. Primary forest sites had more large trees (trees greater than 50 cm diameter at breast height) and late successional species. Primary forest sites had a denser tall shrub layer while secondary forest sites had a denser canopy layer. Nonetheless, tree species richness, basal area of live trees and number of standing snags did not differ between primary and secondary forest sites. Results indicate that breeding bird communities on sites within the park that were logged commercially 70 years ago are currently quite similar to bird communities on sites with no history of human disturbance. Similarities between the bird communities on previously disturbed and undisturbed sites in Great Smoky Mountains National Park may exceed those on more fragmented landscapes because large patches of primary forest, adjacent to commercially logged sites, remained in the park when it was established in 1935. These patches of primary forest may have served as source areas for commercially logged sites.

474,taiga,Forest edges have high conservation value for bird communities in mosaic landscapes,"A major conservation challenge in mosaic landscapes is to understand how trait-specific responses to habitat edges affect bird communities, including potential cascading effects on bird functions providing ecosystem services to forests, such as pest control. Here, we examined how bird species richness, abundance and community composition varied from interior forest habitats and their edges into adjacent open habitats, within a multi-regional sampling scheme. We further analyzed variations in Conservation Value Index (CVI), Community Specialization Index (CSI) and functional traits across the forest-edge-open habitat gradient. Bird species richness, total abundance and CVI were significantly higher at forest edges while CSI peaked at interior open habitats, i.e., furthest from forest edge. In addition, there were important variations in trait-and species-specific responses to forest edges among bird communities. Positive responses to forest edges were found for several forest bird species with unfavorable conservation status. These species were in general insectivores, understorey gleaners, cavity nesters and long-distance migrants, all traits that displayed higher abundance at forest edges than in forest interiors or adjacent open habitats. Furthermore, consistently with predictions, negative edge effects were recorded in some forest specialist birds and in most open-habitat birds, showing increasing densities from edges to interior habitats. We thus suggest that increasing landscape-scale habitat complexity would be beneficial to declining species living in mosaic landscapes combining small woodlands and open habitats. Edge effects between forests and adjacent open habitats may also favor bird functional guilds providing valuable ecosystem services to forests in long-standing fragmented landscapes.",WOS:000381216300007,474,0.924742352,0,forest edg hav high conserv valu for bird commun in mosa landscap a maj conserv challeng in mosa landscap is to understand how trait spec respons to habit edg affect bird commun includ pot cascad effect on bird funct provid ecosystem serv to forest such as pest control her we examin how bird specy rich abund and commun composit vary from intery forest habit and their edg into adjac op habit within a mult reg sampl scheme we furth analys vary in conserv valu index cvi commun spec index csi and funct trait across the forest edg op habit grady bird specy rich tot abund and cvi wer sign high at forest edg whil csi peak at intery op habit i e furthest from forest edg in addit ther wer import vary in trait and specy spec respons to forest edg among bird commun posit respons to forest edg wer found for sev forest bird specy with unfav conserv stat thes specy wer in gen insect understorey gle cav nest and long dist migr al trait that display high abund at forest edg than in forest intery or adjac op habit furtherm consist with predict neg edg effect wer record in som forest spec bird and in most op habit bird show increas dens from edg to intery habit we thu suggest that increas landscap scal habit complex would be benef to declin specy liv in mosa landscap combin smal woodland and op habit edg effect between forest and adjac op habit may also fav bird funct guild provid valu ecosystem serv to forest in long stand frag landscap,new,0.9357375195134182,0.8965710074368008,0.8632358280002311,0.8362016892901943,0.8138107024657619,0.7945868899742898,0.7775042975303348,0.7617769618133647,0.7466378929851675,0.7310771213972067,0.7130705431180719
511,taiga,Distribution of carabid beetles among 40-year-old regenerating plantations and 100-year-old naturally regenerated forests in Southwestern China,"Effects of reforestation by native tree species on species assemblages of carabid beetles were studied between 40-year-old regenerating plantations and 100-year naturally regenerated forests in Southwestern China. Two old naturally regenerated forest types (ca. 100 years old) were chosen: hemlock-spruce forests (Tsuga chinensis and Picea brachytyla) and birch forests (Betula albo-sinensis). Three young regenerating forest types (ca. 40 years old), including spruce plantations (P. brachytyla), larch plantations (Larix kaempferi and Larix mastersian), and natural broad-leaved forests, were established after the logging of the old naturally regenerated forests. Using pitfall traps, we compared the distribution of carabid beetles in the five forest types. Three replicated plots for each forest type were chosen, and each plot was investigated with four trap sites twice each month during the growing season (May to October) in 2004. Our results showed that species richness and abundance were significantly higher in the young regenerating forests than in the old naturally regenerated forests. Analysis of complementarity in carabid species lists across the forest ages and types showed that the old naturally regenerated birch forests had the lowest similarity with the young regenerating larch plantations, and the highest similarity was shown between the two young regenerating plantations. Although PCoA ordination grouped the carabid assemblages according to forest type and forest age, the overall similarity among all forest types was high. Moreover, quantitative character species analysis did not detect significant species associated with forest types and ages. Based on the specificity and fidelity, most carabid species were abundant in all habitats, and only a few species were restricted in one or two forest types. Multiple linear regression between the species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity of carabids and of five environmental variables showed that the cover of canopy and herbaceous layer, and the depth of leaf litter had significant effects in determining richness, abundance and diversity of carabid beetles. Thus, the young regenerating forests at the mature stage could provide an appropriate habitat for most forest species of carabids survived in adjacent old naturally regenerated forests and might replace the role in part of the old-growth forests in sustaining the diversity of carabid assemblages. But some species are still restricted in old naturally regenerated forests, so in order to protect the diversity of carabid assemblages, it is necessary to sustain the intact old naturally regenerated forests when reforesting with some native tree species following natural succession.

514,taiga,Effects of forest floor disturbances by mechanical site preparation on floristic diversity in a central Ontario clearcut,"The effects of forest floor disturbance by six mechanical site preparation (MSP) treatments on structural and compositional diversity of early successional communities were examined in a clearcut in central Ontario. Periodic assessment of floristic diversity and abundance was performed to quantify treatment effects on species richness and abundance of three discrete plant life forms (cryptogam, herbaceous and woody) in the first five growing seasons after MSP. Botanical surveys of the surrounding uncut forest provided an estimate of pre-harvest forest species composition of the clearcut study site. Intensity of forest floor disturbance differed significantly among MSP treatments, creating a variety of microsites. The percentage of mineral soil exposure and abundance of downed woody material ranged from 7% to 52% and 18% to 1%, respectively, from the least to most severe treatments. Five years after MSP, 134 species (50 cryptogams, 47 herbaceous, 37 woody) were present in the clearcut study site, compared with 102 species (54 cryptogams, 25 herbaceous, 23 woody) in the uncut forest. Species richness and abundance of cryptogam, herbaceous and woody plant species increased with time after MSP, except for herbaceous species richness. MSP treatment significantly influenced species richness of cryptogams, herbaceous and woody plants, and abundance (percent cover) of woody plants. Treatment differences in richness and abundance were strongly correlated with intensity of forest floor disturbance. Scalping treatments that created the most mineral soil exposure and removed the most downed woody material typically supported the lowest species diversity and lacked several native forest species. Cryptogams were most affected by MSP, with higher richness and abundance where forest floor disturbance was relatively low. MSP did not affect the incidence of alien plant species: only two alien species were observed on the study site, representing less than 1% of total cover. Evaluation of MSP effects on early successional plant communities based on beta diversity in an ordination analysis revealed several distinct species groups associated with specific treatments. The relative amount of forest floor disturbance and downed woody material among treatments were strong predictors of species groupings within the ordination. Plant communities in slash piles were distinct from those resulting from MSP and contained several remnant forest species. Examination of species' autecology provided supporting evidence that the displacement of downed woody material and forest floor organic layers was the leading cause of changes in species richness and abundance on this site.

545,taiga,Bryophyte Species Diversity in Secondary Forests Dominated by the Introduced Species Spathodea campanulata Beauv. in Puerto Rico,"The introduced tree species Spathodea campanulata (Bignoniaceae) forms novel forests in Puerto Rico, these having emerged after the abandonment of fields in the mid-20th century and resulting in forests with a new species composition. We assessed bryophyte species richness in these novel forests and sought correlations with geological substrate, past land use, forest edge and patch area, forest structure, elevation, microhabitat diversity, tree species richness, and microclimatic conditions. Transects were established (edge and forest interior) in nine moist forest patches dominated by Spathodea in north-central Puerto Rico. These Spathodea forest patches ranged from 0.6 to 9 ha. ANOVA, Chi-square, correlation, and cluster analyses were used in data analyses. We found 57 bryophyte species. There was a significant difference in bryophyte richness among patches. Those on karst exhibited highest bryophyte richness due to microhabitat diversity, past land use, and shorter hydroperiods. Alluvial sites scored lowest in bryophyte species richness, and forest structure was important for bryophyte communities on these sites. Significant differences in temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity were observed between edge and forest interior. These appeared important for establishing bryophyte species cover but not richness and composition. Microhabitat diversity, patch area, and forest age were more related to bryophyte species richness than elevation, exposed edge, and tree species richness, regardless of geologic substrate. Collectively, Spathodea patches were similar to mature forests on the Island with respect to bryophyte species richness and composition.

We used 2 French data sets on saproxylic beetles and landscape cover of forest reserves (LCFR) to test this hypothesis: national standardized data derived from 252 assessment plots in managed and reserve stands in 9 lowland and 5 highland forests and data from the lowland Rambouillet forest, a forested landscape where a pioneer conservation policy led to creation of a dense network of reserves. Abundance of rare and common saproxylic species and total saproxylic species richness were higher in forest reserves than in adjacent managed stands only in highland forests. In the lowland regional case study, as LCFR increased total species richness and common species abundance in reserves increased. In this case study, when there were two or more reserve patches, rare species abundance inside reserves was higher and common species richness in managed stands was higher than when there was a single large reserve. Spillover and habitat amount affected ecological processes underlying these landscape reserve effects. When LCFR positively affected species richness and abundance in reserves or managed stands, >12-20% reserve cover led to the highest species diversity and abundance. This result is consistent with the target of 17% forested land area in reserves set at the Nagoya biodiversity summit in 2010. Therefore, to preserve biodiversity we recommend at least doubling the current proportion of forest reserves in European forested landscapes.",WOS:000368938000011,547,0.916850697,1,effect of landscap design of forest reserv on saproxyl beetl divers increas the dens of nat reserv in the forest landscap may provid conserv benefit for biodivers within and beyond reserv bord we us french dat set on saproxyl beetl and landscap cov of forest reserv lcfr to test thi hypothes nat standard dat der from assess plot in man and reserv stand in lowland and highland forest and dat from the lowland rambouillet forest a forest landscap wher a pion conserv policy led to cre of a dens network of reserv abund of rar and common saproxyl specy and tot saproxyl specy rich wer high in forest reserv than in adjac man stand on in highland forest in the lowland reg cas study as lcfr increas tot specy rich and common specy abund in reserv increas in thi cas study when ther wer two or mor reserv patch rar specy abund insid reserv was high and common specy rich in man stand was high than when ther was a singl larg reserv spillov and habit amount affect ecolog process und thes landscap reserv effect when lcfr posit affect specy rich and abund in reserv or man stand reserv cov led to the highest specy divers and abund thi result is consist with the target of forest land are in reserv set at the nagoy biodivers summit in theref to preserv biodivers we recommend at least doubl the cur proport of forest reserv in europ forest landscap,new,0.9329479360584244,0.8864289336716743,0.84330013883611,0.8058641156628058,0.7732566803278906,0.7441536258972232,0.7173982436397401,0.6919160027762499,0.6664693013581042,0.6391047355534845,0.60536773763873
578,taiga,"Effects of forest management on ground-dwelling beetles (Coleoptera; Carabidae, Staphylinidae) in Central Europe are mainly mediated by changes in forest structure","Forest management is known to influence species diversity of various taxa but inconsistent or even contrasting effects are reported for arthropods. Regional differences in management as well as differences in regional species pools might be responsible for these inconsistencies, but, inter-regional replicated studies that account for regional variability are rare. We investigated the effect of forest type on the abundance, diversity, community structure and composition of two important ground-dwelling beetle families, Carabidae and Staphylinidae, in 149 forest stands distributed over three regions in Germany. In particular we focused on recent forestry history, stand age and dominant tree species, in addition to a number of environmental descriptors. Overall management effects on beetle communities were small and mainly mediated by structural habitat parameters such as the cover of forest canopy or the plant diversity on forest stands. The general response of both beetle taxa to forest management was similar in all regions: abundance and species richness of beetles was higher in older than in younger stands and species richness was lower in unmanaged than in managed stands. The abundance ratio of forest species-to-open habitat species differed between regions, but generally increased from young to old stands, from coniferous to deciduous stands and from managed to unmanaged stands. The response of both beetle families to dominant tree species was variable among regions and staphylinid richness varied in the response to recent forestry history. Our results suggest that current forest management practices change the composition of ground-dwelling beetle communities mainly by favoring generalists and open habitat species. To protect important forest beetle communities and thus the ecosystem functions and services provided by them, we suggest to shelter remaining ancient forests and to develop near-to-nature management strategies by prolonging rotation periods and increasing structural diversity of managed forests. Possible geographic variations in the response of beetle communities need to be considered in conservation-orientated forest management strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

604,taiga,Effects of forest composition and structure on bird species richness in a Mediterranean context: Implications for forest ecosystem management,"There is a growing need to manage forest ecosystems for biodiversity conservation. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on which forest characteristics have a greater influence on biological diversity, particularly in Mediterranean forests. To provide further insights in this respect, we analyzed how different characteristics related to forest composition and structure (forest area, canopy cover, canopy cover diversity, development stage, development stage diversity, coniferous species percentage, tree species diversity, and mono-specific forest percentage) influence the richness of forest breeding bird species (considering 22 specialist and 31 generalist species) in a large dataset comprising 2923 UTM I km x I km cells in Catalonia (NE Spain). Bird species richness was estimated through presence/absence data obtained from surveys conducted within the framework of the Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (1999-2002). Forest characteristics were obtained from the Spanish Forest Map (scale 1:50,000), which was developed within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. Best regression models for forest specialists accounted for up to 53% of the variability in species richness, while models for generalist and total species richness accounted for 34% and 49% of total variability, respectively. Species richness was favoured by more developed forest stages and by tree species diversity, but very dense, closed forest canopies (> 70%) decreased species richness for both groups. For specialist species richness the percentage of coniferous forest cover had a slightly negative influence, while generalists were favoured by more diverse canopy closure. We discuss the implications of these results for Mediterranean forest management considering the current situation of Catalan forests. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

615,taiga,Landscape-scale disturbances and changes in bird communities of boreal mixed-wood forests,"Bird community response to both landscape-scale and local (forest types) changes in forest cover was studied in three boreal mixed-wood forest landscapes modified by different types of disturbances: (1) a pre-industrial landscape where human settlement, agriculture, and logging activities date back to the early 1930s, (2) an industrial timber managed forest, and (3) a forest dominated by natural disturbances. Birds were sampled at 459 sampling stations distributed among the three landscapes. Local habitat and landscape characteristics of the context surrounding each sampling station (500-m and 1-km radius) were also computed. Bird communities were influenced by landscape-scale changes in forest cover. The higher proportion of early-successional habitats in both human-disturbed landscapes resulted in significantly higher abundance of early-successional bird species and generalists. The mean number of mature forest bird species was significantly lower in the industrial and pre-industrial landscapes than in the natural landscape. Landscape-scale conversion of mature forests from mixed-wood to deciduous cover in human-disturbed landscapes was the main cause of changes in mature forest bird communities. In these landscapes, the abundance of species associated with mixed and coniferous forest cover was lower, whereas species that preferred a deciduous cover were more abundant. Variation in bird community composition determined by the landscape context was as important as local habitat conditions, suggesting that predictions on the regional impact of forest management on songbirds with models solely based on local scale factors could be misleading. Patterns of bird species composition were related to several landscape composition variables (proportions of forest types), but not to configuration variables (e.g., interior habitat, amount of edge). Overall, our results indicated that the large-scale conversion of the southern portion of the boreal forest from a mined to a deciduous cover may be one of the most important threats to the integrity of bird communities in these forest mosaics. Negative effects of changes in bird communities could be attenuated if current forestry practices are modified toward maintaining forest types (deciduous, mixed-wood, and coniferous) at levels similar to those observed under natural disturbances.",WOS:000088529100004,615,0.95174587,1,landscap scal disturb and chang in bird commun of bor mix wood forest bird commun respons to both landscap scal and loc forest typ chang in forest cov was study in three bor mix wood forest landscap mod by diff typ of disturb a pre indust landscap wher hum settl agricult and log act dat back to the ear s an indust timb man forest and a forest domin by nat disturb bird wer sampl at sampl stat distribut among the three landscap loc habit and landscap charact of the context surround each sampl stat m and km radi wer also comput bird commun wer influ by landscap scal chang in forest cov the high proport of ear success habit in both hum disturb landscap result in sign high abund of ear success bird specy and gen the mean numb of mat forest bird specy was sign low in the indust and pre indust landscap than in the nat landscap landscap scal convert of mat forest from mix wood to decidu cov in hum disturb landscap was the main caus of chang in mat forest bird commun in thes landscap the abund of specy assocy with mix and con forest cov was low wherea specy that prefer a decidu cov wer mor abund vary in bird commun composit determin by the landscap context was as import as loc habit condit suggest that predict on the reg impact of forest man on songbird with model sol bas on loc scal fact could be mislead pattern of bird specy composit wer rel to sev landscap composit vary proport of forest typ but not to config vary e g intery habit amount of edg overal our result ind that the larg scal convert of the southern port of the bor forest from a min to a decidu cov may be on of the most import threats to the integr of bird commun in thes forest mosa neg effect of chang in bird commun could be attenu if cur forestry pract ar mod toward maintain forest typ decidu mix wood and con at level simil to thos observ und nat disturb,new,0.9633034035935207,0.9257443254740608,0.8856859349424696,0.8474530203224142,0.8115643324018901,0.7773300403827675,0.7437576148022205,0.7095509782670439,0.672716024169601,0.62940910834325,0.5699300469995001
716,taiga,Local and landscape-scale forest attributes differ in their impact on bird assemblages across years in forest production landscapes,"Forest management practices and forest fragmentation are commonly recognised as factors influencing species distribution and diversity, but it remains largely unknown how species turnover and fluctuations across years might affect generalisations from short-term predictions. There is also much uncertainty about how compositional heterogeneity within forests, through their partitioning into differently managed stands, influences species occurrence and diversity. We aimed to investigate bird species richness in different forest stands in a heterogeneous landscape and asked whether short-term studies commonly used are sufficient to describe diversity habitat relationships. Breeding birds were monitored in 50 stands of differing forest types and management regimes in 2008 and 2009 in the heterogeneous forest production landscape of the Schwabische Alb in SW Germany. Based on a database of 25 and 21 species observed in 2008 and 2009, respectively, we estimated local species richness and species turnover with Bayesian hierarchical multi-species occupancy models to account for imperfect detection. A suite of forest attributes at stand level (from local field inventories) and landscape level, between 100 and 2000 in in extent, which were derived from forest management maps, were screened for their explanatory power regarding bird species richness. The most meaningful variables were included in a final set of models to account for effects of forest attributes on species occurrence and resulting gradients in species richness and turnover. Bird species richness in 2008 was mostly explained by stand composition heterogeneity over a distance of 800 m around sample locations, whereas in 2009 local stand features like stand succession type and stand age mostly explained species richness. Species turnover was significantly higher in young forest stands of thicket and pole-wood stages compared with old forest stands of timber stages. Variable multi-scale impacts of forest attributes on local species richness and turnover, together with year-to-year fluctuations in the regional species pool, emphasise that the relative importance of local versus landscape-scale factors in determining bird species richness may vary across years. Long-term and multiple-scale investigations that take structural and compositional forest heterogeneity into account are necessary for improved prediction of species habitat relationships.",WOS:000290502800001,716,0.9377977829999999,1,loc and landscap scal forest attribut diff in their impact on bird assembl across year in forest produc landscap forest man pract and forest frag ar common recogn as fact influ specy distribut and divers but it remain larg unknown how specy turnov and fluctu across year might affect gen from short term predict ther is also much uncertainty about how composit heterog within forest through their partit into diff man stand influ specy occur and divers we aim to investig bird specy rich in diff forest stand in a heterog landscap and ask wheth short term study common us ar sufficy to describ divers habit rel bree bird wer monit in stand of diff forest typ and man regim in and in the heterog forest produc landscap of the schwabische alb in sw germany bas on a databas of and specy observ in and respect we estim loc specy rich and specy turnov with bayes hierarch mult specy occup model to account for imperfect detect a suit of forest attribut at stand level from loc field inv and landscap level between and in in ext which wer der from forest man map wer screened for their expl pow regard bird specy rich the most mean vary wer includ in a fin set of model to account for effect of forest attribut on specy occur and result grady in specy rich and turnov bird specy rich in was most explain by stand composit heterog ov a dist of m around sampl loc wherea in loc stand feat lik stand success typ and stand ag most explain specy rich specy turnov was sign high in young forest stand of thicket and pol wood stag comp with old forest stand of timb stag vary mult scal impact of forest attribut on loc specy rich and turnov togeth with year to year fluctu in the reg specy pool emphas that the rel import of loc vers landscap scal fact in determin bird specy rich may vary across year long term and multipl scal investig that tak structural and composit forest heterog into account ar necess for improv predict of specy habit rel,new,0.9572218098866703,0.9323068335916014,0.9106274938217518,0.8922210528689428,0.87609434607459,0.8613084299203613,0.8470936539756823,0.8326602413625127,0.8169218726214582,0.797823525048425,0.7699938521733076
780,taiga,No difference in plant species diversity between protected and managed ravine forests,"The influence of management practices on forest ecosystems is usually analyzed by a comparison of species composition and richness. Different types of management practices increase plant species richness, mainly due to an increase in the number of ruderal and open habitat species. So far, most of the studies have been performed in the forest types that were most common in the studied regions. In this study we focused on broadleaved ravine forests that are spatially limited to specific habitat conditions, including steep rocky slopes with skeletal soil and unstable ground. These forests are local biodiversity hotspots, and, due to limited accessibility, have been subject to only limited management practices, mainly removal of single trees. We collected a dataset of 215 plots sampled between 1991 and 2015 in both managed forests and protected areas. We used multivariate techniques to compare the differences in the overall species composition. In addition, we compared differences in diversity, structural and habitat indices to find any possible differences. There were no differences in both the plot level and accumulative species richness and diversity indices between protected and managed forests. In addition, a comparison of habitat conditions and different ecological groups, including ruderal and open habitat species, alien species and ancient forest indicator species also revealed no differences. The only significant differences between the protected and managed forests related to the evenness and shrub cover. We concluded that low intensity forest management in ravine forests resembles natural disturbances, which are characteristic of natural ravine forests. The species composing these communities are adapted to frequent natural disturbances and thus forest management did not influence significant habitat conditions. However, to fully understand the effect of these practices on biodiversity, a comparison of structural characteristics is needed.",WOS:000449137300057,780,0.9191594759999999,1,no diff in plant specy divers between protect and man ravin forest the influ of man pract on forest ecosystem is us analys by a comparison of specy composit and rich diff typ of man pract increas plant specy rich main due to an increas in the numb of rud and op habit specy so far most of the study hav been perform in the forest typ that wer most common in the study reg in thi study we focus on broadleav ravin forest that ar spat limit to spec habit condit includ steep rocky slop with skelet soil and unst ground thes forest ar loc biodivers hotspot and due to limit access hav been subject to on limit man pract main remov of singl tre we collect a dataset of plot sampl between and in both man forest and protect area we us mult techn to comp the diff in the overal specy composit in addit we comp diff in divers structural and habit ind to find any poss diff ther wer no diff in both the plot level and accum specy rich and divers ind between protect and man forest in addit a comparison of habit condit and diff ecolog group includ rud and op habit specy aly specy and ant forest ind specy also rev no diff the on sign diff between the protect and man forest rel to the ev and shrub cov we conclud that low intens forest man in ravin forest resembl nat disturb which ar charact of nat ravin forest the specy compos thes commun ar adapt to frequ nat disturb and thu forest man did not influ sign habit condit howev to ful understand the effect of thes pract on biodivers a comparison of structural charact is nee,new,0.9383028075820258,0.9011290518496626,0.8693311807053092,0.8428461208969193,0.8201093212010533,0.7997850064719182,0.7808627764197388,0.7624190293667319,0.7433316874949402,0.7216745432241838,0.6927075319605673
952,taiga,Biodiversity Differences between Managed and Unmanaged Forests: Meta-Analysis of Species Richness in Europe,"Past and present pressures on forest resources have led to a drastic decrease in the surface area of unmanaged forests in Europe. Changes in forest structure, composition, and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species. The possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management (i.e., anthropogenic pressures related to direct forest resource use), however, have never been assessed at a pan-European scale. We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe. We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management. Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests. Species dependent on forest cover continuity, deadwood, and large trees (bryophytes, lichens, fungi, saproxylic beetles) and carabids were negatively affected by forest management. In contrast, vascular plant species were favored. The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns. The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity. Clearcut forests in which the composition of tree species changed had the strongest effect on species richness, but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes. Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others, but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations. Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests.",WOS:000273686700015,952,0.927226667,0,biodivers diff between man and unm forest met analys of specy rich in europ past and pres press on forest resourc hav led to a drast decreas in the surfac are of unm forest in europ chang in forest structure composit and dynam inevit lead to chang in the biodivers of forest dwel specy the poss biodivers gain and loss due to forest man i e anthropog press rel to direct forest resourc us howev hav nev been assess at a pan europ scal we us met analys to review publ pap contain individ comparison of specy rich between unm and man forest throughout europ we expl the respons of diff taxonom group and the vary of their respons with respect to tim sint abandon and intens of forest man specy rich was slight high in unm than in man forest specy depend on forest cov continu deadwood and larg tre bryophyt lich fung saproxyl beetl and carabid wer neg affect by forest man in contrast vascul plant specy wer fav the respons for bird was heterog and prob depend mor on fact such as landscap pattern the glob diff in specy rich between unm and man forest increas with tim sint abandon and ind a grad recovery of biodivers clearcut forest in which the composit of tre specy chang had the strongest effect on specy rich but the effect of diff typ of man on tax could not be assess in a robust way becaus of low numb of reply in the man intens class our result show that som tax ar mor affect by forestry than oth but ther is a nee for research into poor study specy group in europ and in particul loc our met analys support the nee for a coordin europ research network to study and monit the biodivers of diff tax in man and unm forest,new,0.9405164983275225,0.9012273895806175,0.8661317316826569,0.8361489819133142,0.8100638046869428,0.7865945460103224,0.7647022772300921,0.7434090192782686,0.7215203855675477,0.6970087134128706,0.6649240398122831
982,taiga,Avian communities of managed and wilderness hemiboreal forests,"We compared breeding bird communities of hemiboreal forests in multiple-use managed forests and relatively unmanaged wilderness forests in northern Minnesota. A total of 240 point-count locations, 120 in each of the managed and wilderness areas, were sampled three times across ten paired transects in 2010 and 2011. Transects were paired near lotic systems that cross each management type, with half of the points adjacent to (100 m) or distant (400 m) from the riparian corridor. Total number of individuals and species richness detected per count were higher within the unmanaged forest (F-1,(9) = 9.76, p = 0.01; F-1,F-9 = 11.17, p < 0.01) and forest adjacent to the riparian corridor (F-1,F-9 = 28.30, p < 0.001; F-1,F-9 = 42.12, p < 0.001). These results were negatively correlated with increased area of regenerating forests (mainly from logging) within the managed forest and positively correlated with tree species richness and over-story height of forest stands within the wilderness forest. Of 35 species analyzed individually, Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Least Flycatcher (Empidonax minimus), Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), Winter Wren (Troglodytes hiemalis), and Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris) were more common in the wilderness forest. Only the Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) were more common in the managed forest. Species associated with mature or mixed forests tended to be found in the wilderness area at higher densities, but most species associated with early-successional habitats did not differ between the managed and wilderness landscapes. Results suggest that forests with natural disturbance and succession regimes provide habitat for a higher density and richness of bird species. Responses by breeding birds were similar in both management types regarding distance from riparian areas. To adequately provide for effective conservation of the avian community, forested regions should include wilderness forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

988,taiga,Response of fungal and plant communities to management-induced overstorey changes in montane forests of the Western Carpathians,"The effect of forest management on biodiversity is a crucial issue for sustainable forestry and nature conservation. However, the ways in which management affects macrofungal and plant communities and diversity of mountain temperate forests still remain poorly understood. We performed a random sampling stratified by stand age and stand type on the sites of temperate montane fir-beech forests. Diversity of macrofungi and the vascular plant understorey in beech- and spruce-dominated managed stands was investigated and compared to primeval forests located in the PoA 3/4 ana Biosphere Reserve, Western Carpathians. Both the vascular plant and the macrofungal communities were altered by management, and the response of the macrofungal species (especially wood-inhabiting fungi) was more pronounced in terms of species composition change. Species turnover evaluation seems to be an important tool of forest natural status assessment, because alpha diversity did not change as much as species composition. Certain species of Carpathian primeval forests were confirmed as good indicators for natural forest change; others were proposed. Species pool and mean number of species per plot were the highest in unmanaged fir-beech forests, and species diversity significantly decreased in spruce plantations. The number of species decreased significantly due to the change of canopy tree species composition only in the macrofungal communities. As an outcome for forest management, we recommend keeping mixed forests involving all natural tree species and providing at least a minimal amount of dead wood necessary for wood-inhabiting organisms and leaving some area of unmanaged natural forests within complexes of managed stands.",WOS:000433533500004,988,0.91626221,1,respons of fung and plant commun to man induc overstorey chang in mont forest of the western carpath the effect of forest man on biodivers is a cruc issu for sustain forestry and nat conserv howev the way in which man affect macrofung and plant commun and divers of mountain temp forest stil remain poor understood we perform a random sampl stratified by stand ag and stand typ on the sit of temp mont fir beech forest divers of macrofung and the vascul plant understorey in beech and spruce domin man stand was investig and comp to primev forest loc in the poa an biosph reserv western carpath both the vascul plant and the macrofung commun wer alt by man and the respons of the macrofung specy espec wood inhabit fung was mor pronount in term of specy composit chang specy turnov evalu seem to be an import tool of forest nat stat assess becaus alph divers did not chang as much as specy composit certain specy of carpath primev forest wer confirm as good ind for nat forest chang oth wer propos specy pool and mean numb of specy per plot wer the highest in unm fir beech forest and specy divers sign decreas in spruce plant the numb of specy decreas sign due to the chang of canop tre specy composit on in the macrofung commun as an outcom for forest man we recommend keep mix forest involv al nat tre specy and provid at least a minim amount of dead wood necess for wood inhabit org and leav som are of unm nat forest within complex of man stand,new,0.9416246205724792,0.8985109667145746,0.8589200306517922,0.8240990816759229,0.7928142530783482,0.7637268062149054,0.7356477024419764,0.7073073673332992,0.6769430898897656,0.6412485536536028,0.5918024435021135
992,taiga,High cover of forest increases the abundance of most grassland butterflies in boreal farmland,"1. High cover of forest in the landscape matrix has been shown to weaken the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on grassland butterflies. No studies have however focused on examining species-specific responses of grassland butterflies to forest. 2. The data from 3 years of butterfly monitoring in Southern Finland were used to test whether the amount of forest cover in the surrounding landscape affected the abundance of grassland butterfly species in semi-natural grasslands, field margins, and forest edges. 3. More than half of the studied species benefitted from high cover of forest. Species with the strongest preference for forested landscapes were Lycaena virgaureae, Argynnis adippe, Argynnis aglaja, and Boloria selene, which probably find suitable resources in herbaceous habitats at forest edges and clearings. 4. Several small-sized species were positively affected by surrounding forest cover in field margins but not in the other habitat types. Although field margins are suboptimal habitats for grassland butterflies, they provide important corridors for dispersal. High cover of forest in the landscape matrix may enhance butterfly dispersal along field margins by reducing windiness, which is likely to be most important for small-sized species with poor dispersal capacity. 5. The most abundant grassland species showed little or no preference for forested landscapes. 6. Our results suggest that high cover of forest enhances the persistence of most grassland butterflies, including declining species, in boreal agricultural landscapes. The responses to forest are however strongly dependent on species-specific properties and habitat types.",WOS:000404622500005,992,0.930001289,0,high cov of forest increas the abund of most grassland butterf in bor farmland high cov of forest in the landscap matrix has been shown to weak the neg effect of habit frag on grassland butterf no study hav howev focus on examin specy spec respons of grassland butterf to forest the dat from year of butterf monit in southern finland wer us to test wheth the amount of forest cov in the surround landscap affect the abund of grassland butterf specy in sem nat grassland field margin and forest edg mor than half of the study specy benefit from high cov of forest specy with the strongest pref for forest landscap wer lycaen virgaurea argyn adip argyn aglaj and bolor sel which prob find suit resourc in herbac habit at forest edg and clear sev smal siz specy wer posit affect by surround forest cov in field margin but not in the oth habit typ although field margin ar suboptim habit for grassland butterf they provid import corrid for dispers high cov of forest in the landscap matrix may enh butterf dispers along field margin by reduc windy which is lik to be most import for smal siz specy with poor dispers capac the most abund grassland specy show littl or no pref for forest landscap our result suggest that high cov of forest enh the persist of most grassland butterf includ declin specy in bor agricult landscap the respons to forest ar howev strongly depend on specy spec property and habit typ,new,0.939549891558896,0.8930941504269009,0.8491648903433199,0.8106956116010035,0.7769881193560909,0.7467299058016545,0.7187633778171431,0.6919849524572406,0.6650720323703491,0.6358661847359095,0.5993056736734748
1077,taiga,Old rural parks support higher biodiversity than forest remnants,"One of the main challenges in biodiversity conservation is to curb a further degradation and loss of high-quality habitats. In agricultural matrix landscapes, the detection of alternative habitats for habitat specialists may be a solution. Historic old parks or landscape gardens around manor houses and castles are cultural heritage of nobles, but their value in harbouring biodiversity is poorly acknowledged. Therefore we evaluated the potential of old rural parks to serve as a habitat for nemoral forest species. We recorded stand structure and the presence of forest biodiversity indicators in 74 closed-canopy stands of historic parks and compared them with 93 neighbouring mature forest remnants on ancient forest land. We estimated the importance of stand structure in relation to habitat type on biodiversity indicators. Finally we suggest single-value indicator-complexes for the cost-efficient assessment of the conservation value of forests and forest-like habitats. Park stands outclassed reference forests in several individual structural characteristics, and in combined indicators of habitat quality and biodiversity. Forests had higher estimates for the combined indicator of dead wood, but large-diameter dead wood types were more abundant in parks. Woodpeckers, several old-growth indicator epiphytes and forest herbs had successfully become established in planted forest-like park fragments. Old rural parks resemble high-conservation-value forests more than the best preserved contemporary forest remnants. After the century needed to overcome immigration delay, old parks do provide a refugium for temperate deciduous forest species. Consequently, biodiversity-targeted management should retain and enhance old-growth attributes in forests and on the peripheries of parks: e.g. preserving old trees to provide service for epiphytes, hollow trees and an understorey mosaic for birds and bats; dead wood elements for saproxylic insects and fungi; limited mowing frequency and increased cutting height for forest herbs. Forestry should enhance the recovery of mixed deciduous stands and avoid conifer plantations.",WOS:000317352100008,1077,0.920520771,1,old rur park support high biodivers than forest remn on of the main challeng in biodivers conserv is to curb a furth degrad and loss of high qual habit in agricult matrix landscap the detect of altern habit for habit spec may be a solv hist old park or landscap gard around man hous and castl ar cult herit of nobl but their valu in harbo biodivers is poor acknowledg theref we evalu the pot of old rur park to serv as a habit for nem forest specy we record stand structure and the pres of forest biodivers ind in clos canop stand of hist park and comp them with neighbo mat forest remn on ant forest land we estim the import of stand structure in rel to habit typ on biodivers ind fin we suggest singl valu ind complex for the cost efficy assess of the conserv valu of forest and forest lik habit park stand outclass ref forest in sev individ structural charact and in combin ind of habit qual and biodivers forest had high estim for the combin ind of dead wood but larg diamet dead wood typ wer mor abund in park woodpeck sev old grow ind epiphyt and forest herb had success becom est in plant forest lik park frag old rur park resembl high conserv valu forest mor than the best preserv contemp forest remn aft the century nee to overcom immigr delay old park do provid a refug for temp decidu forest specy consequ biodivers target man should retain and enh old grow attribut in forest and on the periphery of park e g preserv old tre to provid serv for epiphyt hollow tre and an understorey mosa for bird and bat dead wood el for saproxyl insect and fung limit mow frequ and increas cut height for forest herb forestry should enh the recovery of mix decidu stand and avoid con plant,new,0.9358655165042621,0.9111125779504927,0.8917974707281644,0.8767056695878748,0.8644214435213717,0.8539682641151091,0.8447036150954147,0.8361462871485787,0.8278470326861113,0.8192127967018804,0.8090559028745419
1312,taiga,"Rove beetles and ground beetles (Coleoptera : Staphylinidae, Carabidae) as indicators of harvest and regeneration practices in western Canadian foothills forests","Staphylinid beetle assemblages from coniferous foothills forest in west-central Alberta, Canada were studied via pitfall trapping to examine the effects of stand age and possible edge effects. Sites included a chronosequence of stands from 1 to 27 years post-harvest, and four types of mature forest that had not been disturbed by fire for at least 80 years. In all, 19 sites were sampled between 1989 and 1991. A total of 98 species were identified, nine of which are reported for the first time in Alberta. Staphylinids were more abundant in mature forest stands but assemblages were more diverse in regenerating stands. Thirty-four rove beetle species showed significant indicator value for particular stands or groups of stands, including mature forest, young forest, and open ground specialists. After harvesting, the catch rate of many forest species decreased dramatically, and open ground species were more commonly collected. Populations of some forest species remained active on logged sites for one or 2 years before disappearing. As stands regenerated, they were colonized by species characteristic of young stands, but true forest species were found only in older unharvested stands. The beetle assemblages from regenerating stands became more similar to those from mature stands as they aged, but still differed considerably from them 27 years after harvesting. Transects across forest-clearcut edges revealed a significant beetle response to habitat edges. Staphylinids assemblages were compared to the ground beetle (Carabidae) assemblage sampled via the same pitfall trapping regime. Mature forest specialists are threatened by fragmentation and loss of habitat. In order to conserve these beetle assemblages, forest managers should retain adequate patches of older successional stages on working landscapes. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1790,taiga,Habitat associations of old forest bird species in managed boreal forests characterized by forest inventory data,"Conservation areas are important for many species associated with old forests, but most individuals still occur in commercially-used forest landscapes. We conducted three-visit breeding bird surveys in a total of 37 study squares of 1 km(2), and used National Forest Inventory data to evaluate habitat associations of birds linked with old forests in three geographical regions: southern, eastern and northern Finland. All study squares were located within managed forests. Out of the total of 23 pre-selected old-forest species, 12 were recorded in the study squares of all three study regions; the number of species varied between 16 and 21 among the regions. The total abundance did not significantly vary among the regions, but the abundances of many single species varied significantly among the regions. Forest-patch size was the single most important factor, positively affecting the abundance of most of the species considered. Development class affected most species in the south and east, and species associated with mature and old forest stands in general. Tree height and stand age were included into the models more often than tree species and diameter. In general, forest patch size, developmental class, age and tree height were among the most important factors in explaining the abundance of old-forest bird species in commercially-used forests. These stand characteristics appeared particularly important for resident species and cavity nesters. Our results indicate that the responses of old-forest bird species to environmental variation in managed, forested landscapes are individualistic, and different factors may affect them in different regions. Variables included in the patch-level forest-inventory data well explained abundance variation of species associated with old forests. Our results underscore the importance of integrating national forest-inventory and bird-survey data to obtain information about species habitat requirements and forest-sector related information about the effects of forestry on birds.",WOS:000291964800001,1790,0.916757658,1,habit assocy of old forest bird specy in man bor forest charact by forest inv dat conserv area ar import for many specy assocy with old forest but most individ stil occ in commerc us forest landscap we conduc three visit bree bird survey in a tot of study squ of km and us nat forest inv dat to evalu habit assocy of bird link with old forest in three geograph reg southern eastern and northern finland al study squ wer loc within man forest out of the tot of pre select old forest specy wer record in the study squ of al three study reg the numb of specy vary between and among the reg the tot abund did not sign vary among the reg but the abund of many singl specy vary sign among the reg forest patch siz was the singl most import fact posit affect the abund of most of the specy consid develop class affect most specy in the sou and east and specy assocy with mat and old forest stand in gen tre height and stand ag wer includ into the model mor oft than tre specy and diamet in gen forest patch siz develop class ag and tre height wer among the most import fact in explain the abund of old forest bird specy in commerc us forest thes stand charact appear particul import for resid specy and cav nest our result ind that the respons of old forest bird specy to environ vary in man forest landscap ar individ and diff fact may affect them in diff reg vary includ in the patch level forest inv dat wel explain abund vary of specy assocy with old forest our result undersc the import of integr nat forest inv and bird survey dat to obtain inform about specy habit requir and forest sect rel inform about the effect of forestry on bird,new,0.9377197676588046,0.9017953209848926,0.8709040915692834,0.8455154529732283,0.8242703194890706,0.8058763914716406,0.7893711712915541,0.7739651404190457,0.7588395796539017,0.7428004324482497,0.7232122369287751
120,tempbroad1,Land use types influenced avian assemblage structure in a forest-agriculture landscape in Ghana,"The conservation of biodiversity within tropical forest regions does not lie only in the maintenance of natural forest areas, but on conservation strategies directed toward agricultural land types within which they are embedded. This study investigated variations in bird assemblages of different functional groups of forest-dependent birds in three agricultural land types, relative to distance from the interior of 34 tropical forest patches of varying sizes. Point counts were used to sample birds at each study site visited. Data from counts were used to estimate species richness, species evenness, and Simpson's diversity of birds. Mean species richness, evenness, and diversity were modeled as responses and as a function of agricultural land type, distance from the forest interior and three site-scale vegetation covariates (density of large trees, fruiting trees, and patch size) using generalized linear mixed-effect models. Mean observed species richness of birds varied significantly within habitat types. Mean observed species richness was highest in forest interior sites while sites located in farm centers recorded the lowest mean species richness. Species richness of forest specialists was strongly influenced by the type of agricultural land use. Fallow lands, density of large trees, and patch size strongly positively influenced forest specialists. Insectivorous and frugivorous birds were more species-rich in fallow lands while monoculture plantations favored nectarivorous birds. Our results suggest that poor agricultural practices can lead to population declines of forest-dependent birds particularly specialist species. Conservation actions should include proper land use management that ensures heterogeneity through retention of native tree species on farms in tropical forest-agriculture landscapes.",WOS:000414873600002,2389,0.9615295759999999,1,land us typ influ av assembl structure in a forest agricult landscap in ghan the conserv of biodivers within trop forest reg doe not lie on in the maint of nat forest area but on conserv strategies direct toward agricult land typ within which they ar embed thi study investig vary in bird assembl of diff funct group of forest depend bird in three agricult land typ rel to dist from the intery of trop forest patch of vary siz point count wer us to sampl bird at each study sit visit dat from count wer us to estim specy rich specy ev and simpson s divers of bird mean specy rich ev and divers wer model as respons and as a funct of agricult land typ dist from the forest intery and three sit scal veget cov dens of larg tre fruit tre and patch siz us gen linear mix effect model mean observ specy rich of bird vary sign within habit typ mean observ specy rich was highest in forest intery sit whil sit loc in farm cent record the lowest mean specy rich specy rich of forest spec was strongly influ by the typ of agricult land us fallow land dens of larg tre and patch siz strongly posit influ forest spec insect and frug bird wer mor specy rich in fallow land whil monocult plant fav nect bird our result suggest that poor agricult pract can lead to pop declin of forest depend bird particul spec specy conserv act should includ prop land us man that ens heterog through ret of nat tre specy on farm in trop forest agricult landscap,new,0.9699384864513275,0.9496854772226753,0.930563678848505,0.9133811903006848,0.8976575493705201,0.8826948118198121,0.8677959333237956,0.8521381218602427,0.8344436426324531,0.8121480508451527,0.7783368295831901
213,tempbroad1,Land use and conservation value for forest birds in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia),"Unprecedented deforestation is currently underway in Southeast Asia. Since this trend is likely to continue, it is critical to determine the value of human-modified habitats (e.g., mixed-rural habitat) for conserving the regional native forest avifauna. The impacts of ongoing deforestation on the highly endemic avifauna (33%) of Sulawesi (Indonesia) are poorly understood. We sampled birds in primary and secondary forests in the Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi, as well as the surrounding plantation and mixed-rural habitats. Species richness, species density and population density of forest birds showed a consistent decreasing trend in the following order: primary forests > secondary forests > mixed-rural habitat > plantations. Although primary forests contained the highest proportion (85%) of a total of 34 forest species recorded from our point count surveys, 40-yr old secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat showed high conservation potential, containing 82% and 76% of the forest species, respectively. Plantations recorded only 32% of the forest bird species. Fifteen forest species had the highest abundance in primary forests, while two species had higher abundance outside primary forests. Our simulations revealed that all forest birds that were sensitive to native tree cover could be found in areas with at least 20% continuous native tree cover. Our study shows that although primary forests have the highest conservation value for forest avifauna, the potential of degraded habitats, such as secondary forests and the mixed-rural habitat, for conserving forest species can be enhanced with appropriate land use and management decisions.

313,tempbroad1,Landscape-scale disturbances and changes in bird communities of boreal mixed-wood forests,"Bird community response to both landscape-scale and local (forest types) changes in forest cover was studied in three boreal mixed-wood forest landscapes modified by different types of disturbances: (1) a pre-industrial landscape where human settlement, agriculture, and logging activities date back to the early 1930s, (2) an industrial timber managed forest, and (3) a forest dominated by natural disturbances. Birds were sampled at 459 sampling stations distributed among the three landscapes. Local habitat and landscape characteristics of the context surrounding each sampling station (500-m and 1-km radius) were also computed. Bird communities were influenced by landscape-scale changes in forest cover. The higher proportion of early-successional habitats in both human-disturbed landscapes resulted in significantly higher abundance of early-successional bird species and generalists. The mean number of mature forest bird species was significantly lower in the industrial and pre-industrial landscapes than in the natural landscape. Landscape-scale conversion of mature forests from mixed-wood to deciduous cover in human-disturbed landscapes was the main cause of changes in mature forest bird communities. In these landscapes, the abundance of species associated with mixed and coniferous forest cover was lower, whereas species that preferred a deciduous cover were more abundant. Variation in bird community composition determined by the landscape context was as important as local habitat conditions, suggesting that predictions on the regional impact of forest management on songbirds with models solely based on local scale factors could be misleading. Patterns of bird species composition were related to several landscape composition variables (proportions of forest types), but not to configuration variables (e.g., interior habitat, amount of edge). Overall, our results indicated that the large-scale conversion of the southern portion of the boreal forest from a mined to a deciduous cover may be one of the most important threats to the integrity of bird communities in these forest mosaics. Negative effects of changes in bird communities could be attenuated if current forestry practices are modified toward maintaining forest types (deciduous, mixed-wood, and coniferous) at levels similar to those observed under natural disturbances.",WOS:000088529100004,138,0.95174587,1,landscap scal disturb and chang in bird commun of bor mix wood forest bird commun respons to both landscap scal and loc forest typ chang in forest cov was study in three bor mix wood forest landscap mod by diff typ of disturb a pre indust landscap wher hum settl agricult and log act dat back to the ear s an indust timb man forest and a forest domin by nat disturb bird wer sampl at sampl stat distribut among the three landscap loc habit and landscap charact of the context surround each sampl stat m and km radi wer also comput bird commun wer influ by landscap scal chang in forest cov the high proport of ear success habit in both hum disturb landscap result in sign high abund of ear success bird specy and gen the mean numb of mat forest bird specy was sign low in the indust and pre indust landscap than in the nat landscap landscap scal convert of mat forest from mix wood to decidu cov in hum disturb landscap was the main caus of chang in mat forest bird commun in thes landscap the abund of specy assocy with mix and con forest cov was low wherea specy that prefer a decidu cov wer mor abund vary in bird commun composit determin by the landscap context was as import as loc habit condit suggest that predict on the reg impact of forest man on songbird with model sol bas on loc scal fact could be mislead pattern of bird specy composit wer rel to sev landscap composit vary proport of forest typ but not to config vary e g intery habit amount of edg overal our result ind that the larg scal convert of the southern port of the bor forest from a min to a decidu cov may be on of the most import threats to the integr of bird commun in thes forest mosa neg effect of chang in bird commun could be attenu if cur forestry pract ar mod toward maintain forest typ decidu mix wood and con at level simil to thos observ und nat disturb,new,0.9675442647239655,0.9307423156448624,0.8893157348944539,0.8484413864872078,0.8092785168988114,0.7714357870578515,0.7339946212409626,0.6956242513449794,0.6541525969243197,0.6053387895625981,0.5385214899228928
510,tempbroad1,"Effects of habitat type, vegetation structure, and proximity to forests on bird species richness in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, Indonesia","To halt biodiversity loss in the humid tropics of developing countries, it is crucial to understand the roles and effects of human-modified landscapes with fragmented forest remnants in maintaining biodiversity while fulfilling the demands of local communities and reducing poverty. To implement appropriate landscape planning for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, appropriate information is required about parameters of habitat suitability among various anthropogenic habitats with a range of distances to forests and vegetation characteristics, but such information is limited. We examined differences in avian communities between a remnant forest and four types of man-made forest (two mature plantations and two agroforests) in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, and we analyzed the effects of both local and landscape factors on various types of species richness in this landscape. The results from non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed avifauna in the two types of agroforest was clustered separately from that in the remnant forest, mainly because drastic declines in the abundance of forest specialists (including IUCN red-listed species) and their replacement with open-habitat generalists. The mixed-tree agroforests were colonized by 30 % of forest specialists and forest-edge species found in the remnant forest, and maintained the highest richness of species endemic to Indonesia among man-made forests, implying that some forest specialists and endemics might have adapted to ancient landscape heterogeneity. High proportion of insectivorous birds was found in the remnant forest (more than 50 %) and drastically decline in man-made forests, although the species richness of insectivores did not decline significantly in broad-leaved plantations. We concluded that protection of remnant forests should be prioritized to conserve forest bird diversity. However, as different environmental factors affected the richness values of different ecological groups, appropriate landscape design and habitat management could improve functional diversity in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.",WOS:000327080000003,1079,0.948134774,1,effect of habit typ veget structure and proxim to forest on bird specy rich in a forest agricult landscap of west jav indones to halt biodivers loss in the humid trop of develop country it is cruc to understand the rol and effect of hum mod landscap with frag forest remn in maintain biodivers whil fulfil the demand of loc commun and reduc poverty to impl appropry landscap plan for conserv biodivers and ecosystem funct appropry inform is requir about paramet of habit suit among vary anthropog habit with a rang of dist to forest and veget charact but such inform is limit we examin diff in av commun between a remn forest and four typ of man mad forest two mat plant and two agroforest in a forest agricult landscap of west jav and we analys the effect of both loc and landscap fact on vary typ of specy rich in thi landscap the result from non met multidimend scal rev avifaun in the two typ of agroforest was clust sep from that in the remn forest main becaus drast declin in the abund of forest spec includ iucn red list specy and their replac with op habit gen the mix tre agroforest wer colon by of forest spec and forest edg specy found in the remn forest and maintain the highest rich of specy endem to indones among man mad forest imply that som forest spec and endem might hav adapt to ant landscap heterog high proport of insect bird was found in the remn forest mor than and drast declin in man mad forest although the specy rich of insect did not declin sign in broad leav plant we conclud that protect of remn forest should be priorit to conserv forest bird divers howev as diff environ fact affect the rich valu of diff ecolog group appropry landscap design and habit man could improv funct divers in forest agricult landscap in the trop,new,0.9581183914884366,0.9247592229239708,0.8919799932685174,0.8622310466346114,0.8352318079497982,0.8100942478859928,0.7858829884808731,0.7615606118576504,0.7356386078403856,0.7053501210983909,0.6636536628264786
69,tempbroad1,Effects of surrounding landscape composition on the conservation value of native and exotic habitats for native forest birds,"The contribution of different production land uses to the conservation of native forest birds in modified, fragmented landscapes is a question of increasing relevance worldwide. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the abundance of native forest birds increases with increasing area of exotic plantation forests surrounding native forest remnants due to a reduction of negative effects of forest fragmentation and the provision of additional habitat. Conversely, farmland was not expected to provide such benefits to the same extent. Nine species of native birds were sampled in 238 plots in native forests, exotic plantation forests and mixed farmland on Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand, where these land cover types are highly interspersed in a variety of spatial configurations. Around each sampling plot we determined the cover of native forest, plantation forest and mixed farmland within seven buffer zones ranging in radius from 200 m to 3000 m, using the New Zealand Land Cover Database 2. In native forests, the abundance of all but one species was negatively correlated with the amount of farmland surrounding points whereas the opposite applied when points were surrounded by native forest. There was a variable effect for native forest surrounded by plantation forest. In exotic plantation forests and farmland, the abundance of most species was positively correlated with the amount of native forest surrounding points. By contrast, for most species there was a small or moderate negative correlation with surrounding plantation forest. In farmland plots, bird abundance was positively correlated with native forest cover whereas plantation forest and farmland cover negatively affected most species. These results suggest that exotic plantation forests may mitigate effects of forest fragmentation for some native forest birds but not for others, and this appeared to depend on the landscape context. The maintenance of native forest remnants and forest restoration across the landscape, including within production land areas are important for the long-term conservation of the New Zealand's forest avifauna.

77,tempbroad1,Conservation value of degraded habitats for forest birds in southern Peninsular Malaysia,"Clearance of tropical forest for agricultural purposes is generally assumed to seriously threaten the survival of forest species. In this study, we quantified the conservation value, for forest bird species, of three degraded habitat types in Peninsular Malaysia, namely rubber tree plantations, oil palm plantations, and open areas. We surveyed these degraded habitats using point counts to estimate their forest bird species richness and abundance. We assessed whether richness, abundance, and activities of different avian dietary groups (i.e. insectivores and frugivores) varied among the habitats. We identified the critical habitat elements that accounted for the distribution of forest avifauna in these degraded habitats. Our results showed that these habitats harboured a moderate fraction of forest avifauna (approximately 46-76 species) and their functions were complementary (i.e. rubber tree plantations for moving; open habitats for perching; shrubs in oil palm plantations for foraging). In terms of species richness and abundance, rubber tree plantations were more important than oil palm plantations and open habitats. The relatively high species richness of this agricultural landscape was partly due to the contiguity of our study areas with extensive forest areas. Forecasts of forest-species presence under various canopy cover scenarios suggest that leaving isolated trees among non-arboreal crops could greatly attract relatively tolerant species that require tree canopy. The conservation value of degraded habitats in agricultural landscapes seems to depend on factors such as the type of crops planted and distance to primary forest remnants.",WOS:000239798200012,143,0.9403711459999999,1,conserv valu of degrad habit for forest bird in southern peninsul malays clear of trop forest for agricult purpos is gen assum to sery threaten the surv of forest specy in thi study we quant the conserv valu for forest bird specy of three degrad habit typ in peninsul malays nam rub tre plant oil palm plant and op area we survey thes degrad habit us point count to estim their forest bird specy rich and abund we assess wheth rich abund and act of diff av diet group i e insect and frug vary among the habit we ident the crit habit el that account for the distribut of forest avifaun in thes degrad habit our result show that thes habit harbo a mod fract of forest avifaun approxim specy and their funct wer compl i e rub tre plant for mov op habit for perch shrubs in oil palm plant for for in term of specy rich and abund rub tre plant wer mor import than oil palm plant and op habit the rel high specy rich of thi agricult landscap was part due to the contigu of our study area with extend forest area forecast of forest specy pres und vary canop cov scenario suggest that leav isol tre among non arb crop could gre attract rel tol specy that requir tre canop the conserv valu of degrad habit in agricult landscap seem to depend on fact such as the typ of crop plant and dist to prim forest remn,new,0.9478678137092733,0.9290083176125223,0.9143129346844092,0.902746147700665,0.8932329154957619,0.8850032861485625,0.877523441236232,0.870357451144127,0.8630152866217998,0.8547201186412372,0.8436440612474854
89,tempbroad1,Dung beetles as indicators of change in the forests of northern Borneo,"1. We reviewed the use of dung beetles as indicators of environmental change, highlighting the influence of natural forest dynamics on species distributions in primary forest and suggesting new ways in which this can be used to understand and interpret the effects of disturbance such as logging. These ideas were applied to rainforest dung beetle communities in Sabah, Malaysia. 2. Dung beetle samples, using baited pitfall and flight intercept traps, were examined from primary, logged and plantation forests. Cluster analysis on dung beetle assemblages from primary forest samples showed clear species associations that had a high degree of fidelity to a particular biotope or vegetation type. Beetles were grouped into riverine-edge, riverine, interior-primary and 'even' (equitable distribution between biotopes) associations. Although biotope-specific associations were spatially separate in primary forest, these associations overlapped at forest margins (riverine forest) and in logged forest (to form 'composite assemblages'). 3. Species associations showed different responses to disturbance: the riverine association included many species that showed a positive response to at least some types of disturbance, whereas others were neutral or negative in response; the even association species were mostly neutral; the primary forest associations were almost entirely negative in response. 4. The greatest faunal similarities were found between logged forest and riverine assemblages. Diversity was lower in logged compared with primary forest, and the lowest species richness and diversity were recorded in plantation forest. Small-scale species richness in logged forest was generally higher than in individual transects from primary forest due to the presence of overlapping species ranges (composite assemblages) that were usually spatially separate in primary forest. Data suggested that increased species richness at a fine scale does not necessarily mean that species richness is greater at a larger scale, and that species mixing in derived ecosystems is dependent on the type of disturbance. Forest management should aim to minimize the mixing of the components of different biotopes, by implementing low impact (i.e. reduced-impact logging) harvesting techniques.",WOS:000169479900009,139,0.940350895,1,dung beetl as ind of chang in the forest of northern borneo we review the us of dung beetl as ind of environ chang highlight the influ of nat forest dynam on specy distribut in prim forest and suggest new way in which thi can be us to understand and interpret the effect of disturb such as log thes idea wer apply to rainforest dung beetl commun in sabah malays dung beetl sampl us bait pitfal and flight interceiv trap wer examin from prim log and plant forest clust analys on dung beetl assembl from prim forest sampl show clear specy assocy that had a high degr of fidel to a particul biotop or veget typ beetl wer group into riverin edg riverin intery prim and ev equit distribut between biotop assocy although biotop spec assocy wer spat sep in prim forest thes assocy overlap at forest margin riverin forest and in log forest to form composit assembl specy assocy show diff respons to disturb the riverin assocy includ many specy that show a posit respons to at least som typ of disturb wherea oth wer neut or neg in respons the ev assocy specy wer most neut the prim forest assocy wer almost entir neg in respons the greatest faun simil wer found between log forest and riverin assembl divers was low in log comp with prim forest and the lowest specy rich and divers wer record in plant forest smal scal specy rich in log forest was gen high than in individ transect from prim forest due to the pres of overlap specy rang composit assembl that wer us spat sep in prim forest dat suggest that increas specy rich at a fin scal doe not necess mean that specy rich is gre at a larg scal and that specy mix in der ecosystem is depend on the typ of disturb forest man should aim to minim the mix of the compon of diff biotop by impl low impact i e reduc impact log harvest techn,new,0.948881611547203,0.9163997790488747,0.8868735554753132,0.8611306483731186,0.8383002497215897,0.8173891144203407,0.7975200170873479,0.7778166354049194,0.7571106225769851,0.7333066482282383,0.7011607758839095
97,tempbroad1,INTERACTION OF BISCHOFIA JAVANICA AND ITS EFFECT ON SPECIES DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION OF SECONDARY AND PLANTATION FORESTS IN A KENYA RAINFOREST,"We studied the effects of Bischofia javanica on species diversity and structural composition of plantation and secondary forests in Kakamaga rainforest in western Kenya. The invasive exotic tree species was introduced to the area in 1960s and planted as a pure plantation stand to assist in rehabilitating logged primary forest sites. By 1990s, the species had established in nearby secondary and plantation forest stands in which it was not planted. The study sought to determine how invasion of the exotic species had affected species diversity, species evenness and stand density in plantation and secondary forests within the rainforest. The study w'as carried out in nine forest types. namely: old-growth secondary forest, middle-aged secondary forest, young secondary forest, mixed indigenous plantation, Maesopsis, Cupressus, Pinus and Bischofia monoculture plantations, and disturbed primary forest. These forest types were nested as sub-blocks in three forest blocks. The results indicated that B. javanica was the only non-native woody species among several native woody species that recruited naturally in plantation and secondary forests. It did not grow in the disturbed primary forest. Its recruitment was significantly more aggressive than that of native species. It lowered species diversity but increased species evenness in all plantation and secondary forests. Its relative abundance was 30.6%, dominating the seedling, sapling and tree densities of plantation and secondary forests.

108,tempbroad1,Dynamics of avian species and functional diversity in secondary tropical forests,"Deforestation for agriculture in the tropics, followed by abandonment, has resulted in large areas of secondary forest. Some authors have suggested that this secondary regrowth could help prevent mass extinction in the tropics by providing habitat for forest species. However, there is little generalised understanding of the biodiversity value of secondary forest. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an analysis of avian responses to secondary forest succession, comparing data from 44 tropical secondary forest sites with nearby primary forest sites and investigating both species and functional diversity based metrics. Total species richness in secondary forests was 12% lower than in primary forests and was not related to secondary forest age. In contrast, forest specialist species richness increased with time since disturbance, reaching 99% of primary forest values after 100 years. In terms of functional diversity, functional dispersion (FDis) and functional divergence (FDiv) were similar in primary and secondary forests. However, functional evenness (FEve) was 5% higher in secondary than in primary forests. The standardized effect size of functional diversity (sesFD) was higher in young secondary forests than primary forests and declined with time since disturbance. Overall, these results suggest that secondary tropical forests can support provision of ecosystem services but that these services may be less stable in young forests. Therefore, secondary tropical forests, particularly older regrowth, have biodiversity value and can support important ecosystem functions. These secondary forests should be protected from further disturbance but preserving primary forest is vital for supporting overall and forest specialist species richness.",WOS:000404809900001,898,0.937918398,1,dynam of av specy and funct divers in second trop forest deforest for agricult in the trop follow by abandon has result in larg area of second forest som auth hav suggest that thi second regrow could help prev mass extinct in the trop by provid habit for forest specy howev ther is littl gen understand of the biodivers valu of second forest to address thi knowledg gap we conduc an analys of av respons to second forest success comp dat from trop second forest sit with nearby prim forest sit and investig both specy and funct divers bas met tot specy rich in second forest was low than in prim forest and was not rel to second forest ag in contrast forest spec specy rich increas with tim sint disturb reach of prim forest valu aft year in term of funct divers funct dispers fdi and funct diverg fdiv wer simil in prim and second forest howev funct ev fev was high in second than in prim forest the standard effect siz of funct divers sesfd was high in young second forest than prim forest and declin with tim sint disturb overal thes result suggest that second trop forest can support provid of ecosystem serv but that thes serv may be less stabl in young forest theref second trop forest particul old regrow hav biodivers valu and can support import ecosystem funct thes second forest should be protect from furth disturb but preserv prim forest is vit for support overal and forest spec specy rich,new,0.946539490184244,0.9156789897241958,0.8887073222049269,0.8657854196647773,0.8458144380284619,0.8277890786215906,0.8108906480728741,0.7943747983229016,0.7773281309990656,0.7582191239094463,0.733362851864961
1111,tempbroad1,"Does forest tenure influence forest vegetation characteristics? A comparative analysis of private, local and central government forest reserves in central Uganda","This paper investigated the influence of forest tenure on vegetation characteristics for selected forests under private, District Forestry Services of local governments and National Forestry Authority in central Uganda. Two hundred and twelve plant species in 65 families and 168 genera were recorded. The family Moracette was the most species rich in Central Forest Reserves (CFRs), while Euphorbiaceae were the most species rich in private forests and Local Forest Reserves (LFRs), respectively. There were 174 species in CFRs, 144 species in LFRs and 112 species in private forests. Our findings indicated a remarkable shift in floristic composition among the studied forests from Albizia-Piptadeniastrum-Celtis species primary dominance by 1964 report to current secondary and colonising species of Trilepisium-madagascariensis-Funtumia africana-Pseudospondias macrocarpa and Macaranga schweinfurthii. Diversity measured by two indices, i.e., the Shannon diversity and evenness for the different growth forms differed significantly among the forest ownership categories. The CFRs were the most diverse for the trees, while the private forests were the most diverse for the ground flora species. Plant species richness also expressed by the two indices: Species density and Margalef's diversity index followed the same trend, with CFRs being the most species rich for the trees, followed by the private forests and LFRs. The population structure characteristics i.e. stem densities, mean DBH and basal area of saplings and trees were higher in private forests than CFRs and LFRs. Diameter size for all species combined followed the inverse J-shape, typical of mixed-age stands. LFRs and CFRs were highly affected by human disturbances which may be an indicator that government agencies are not as much in control as private forest owners. We found that the composition and distribution of species in the Mpigi forests is complex because it is influenced by two conflicting factors i.e. ecological stability versus human disturbances. We conclude that human activities influenced by forest tenure reduced plant species diversity and composition at different sites; confirming the argument by common property theorists that open access resources are not compatible with biodiversity conservations. There is thus a need for forest managers to regulate human activities for effective conservation of forests.",WOS:000287635100002,2032,0.9377077779999999,1,doe forest ten influ forest veget charact a comp analys of priv loc and cent govern forest reserv in cent ugand thi pap investig the influ of forest ten on veget charact for select forest und priv district forestry serv of loc govern and nat forestry auth in cent ugand two hundr and twelv plant specy in famy and gener wer record the famy moracet was the most specy rich in cent forest reserv cfrs whil euphorbiacea wer the most specy rich in priv forest and loc forest reserv lfrs respect ther wer specy in cfrs specy in lfrs and specy in priv forest our find ind a remark shift in flor composit among the study forest from albiz piptadeniastr celt specy prim domin by report to cur second and colon specy of trilepis madagascariens funtum african pseudospondia macrocarp and macarang schweinfurthii divers meas by two ind i e the shannon divers and ev for the diff grow form diff sign among the forest own categ the cfrs wer the most divers for the tre whil the priv forest wer the most divers for the ground flor specy plant specy rich also express by the two ind specy dens and margalef s divers index follow the sam trend with cfrs being the most specy rich for the tre follow by the priv forest and lfrs the pop structure charact i e stem dens mean dbh and bas are of sapl and tre wer high in priv forest than cfrs and lfrs diamet siz for al specy combin follow the invers j shap typ of mix ag stand lfrs and cfrs wer high affect by hum disturb which may be an ind that govern ag ar not as much in control as priv forest own we found that the composit and distribut of specy in the mpig forest is complex becaus it is influ by two conflict fact i e ecolog stabl vers hum disturb we conclud that hum act influ by forest ten reduc plant specy divers and composit at diff sit confirm the argu by common property the that op access resourc ar not compat with biodivers conserv ther is thu a nee for forest man to reg hum act for effect conserv of forest,new,0.9492025579903861,0.9096250738586498,0.8723674397528348,0.8393592284342571,0.8097376657083465,0.7823168027463171,0.7559897077156672,0.7295948475819357,0.70152759947782,0.668837444332213,0.6241075421927105
126,tempbroad1,High value of short rotation coppice plantations for phytodiversity in rural landscapes,"The demand for wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations as a renewable energy source is currently increasing and could affect biodiversity in agricultural areas. The objective was to evaluate the contribution of SRC plantations to phytodiversity in agricultural landscapes assessed as species richness, speciesarea relationships, Shannon indices, detrended correspondence analysis on species composition, Sorensen similarities, habitat preference proportions, and species proportions found in only one land use. Vegetation surveys were conducted on 12 willow (Salix spp.) and three poplar (Populus spp.) coppice sites as well as on surrounding arable lands, grasslands and forests in central Sweden and northern Germany. SRC plantations were richer in plant species (mean: 30 species per 100 m(2)) than arable land (10), coniferous forests (13) and mixed forests in Germany (12). Comparing SRC plantations with other land uses, we found lowest similarities in species composition with arable lands, coniferous forests and German mixed forests and highest similarities with marginal grassland strips, grasslands and Swedish mixed forests. Similarity depended on the SRC tree cover: at increased tree cover, SRC plantations became less similar to grasslands but more similar to forests. The SRC plantations were composed of a mixture of grassland (33%), ruderal (24%) and woodland (15%) species. Species abundance in SRC plantations was more heterogeneous than in arable lands. We conclude that SRC plantations form novel habitats leading to different plant species composition compared to conventional land uses. Their landscape-scale value for phytodiversity changes depending on harvest cycles and over time. As a structural landscape element, SRC plantations contribute positively to phytodiversity in rural areas, especially in land use mosaics where these plantations are admixed to other land uses with dissimilar plant species composition such as arable land, coniferous forest and, at the German sites, also mixed forest.",WOS:000309450100014,403,0.936349012,1,high valu of short rot cop plant for phytodivers in rur landscap the demand for wood from short rot cop src plant as a renew energy sourc is cur increas and could affect biodivers in agricult area the object was to evalu the contribut of src plant to phytodivers in agricult landscap assess as specy rich speciesare rel shannon ind detrend correspond analys on specy composit sorens simil habit pref proport and specy proport found in on on land us veget survey wer conduc on willow salix spp and three popl popul spp cop sit as wel as on surround ar land grassland and forest in cent swed and northern germany src plant wer rich in plant specy mean specy per m than ar land con forest and mix forest in germany comp src plant with oth land us we found lowest simil in specy composit with ar land con forest and germ mix forest and highest simil with margin grassland strips grassland and swed mix forest simil depend on the src tre cov at increas tre cov src plant becam less simil to grassland but mor simil to forest the src plant wer compos of a mixt of grassland rud and woodland specy specy abund in src plant was mor heterog than in ar land we conclud that src plant form novel habit lead to diff plant specy composit comp to conv land us their landscap scal valu for phytodivers chang depend on harvest cyc and ov tim as a structural landscap el src plant contribut posit to phytodivers in rur area espec in land us mosa wher thes plant ar admix to oth land us with dissimil plant specy composit such as ar land con forest and at the germ sit also mix forest,new,0.9475398357123034,0.9137392849158981,0.8834832516540808,0.8573255358807604,0.8341358571871588,0.8127624219411597,0.7922320581166676,0.7715368130356335,0.7492798738338238,0.7228329307964665,0.6854220757268386
137,tempbroad1,Tree species diversity relative to human land uses in tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi,"The large-scale exploitation and conversion of tropical forests causes growing concern about the continued existence of the rich biodiversity of these forests. In the framework of the interdisciplinary STORMA project in Lore Lindu National Park area in Central Sulawesi, we studied tree diversity in six different land use types in the margins of submontane rain forest: undisturbed forest, forest with rattan extraction, selectively logged forest, cacao forest gardens, cacao plantations with mixed canopy of planted trees, and cacao plantations with a monospecific canopy. By analyzing such a finely subdivided use gradient it was attempted to answer the question how human usage and biodiversity conservation in the study area may be reconciled. Tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were sampled in 24 plots of 0.25 ha in all six land use types (4 replicates each). In total, 251 tree species (143 genera, 59 families) were recorded. Number of tree species per 0.25 ha was 51-63 in primary forest and gradually decreased towards the studied cacao systems. However, when native and cultivated tree species were considered separately, significant differences were detected among plantation types in terms of tree diversity. Tree endemism in forest plots totalled ca. 15% and was in good accordance with endemism in woody plants of Sulawesi. The number of endemic species was strongly reduced in cacao systems, although percentage endemism did not decline significantly in cacao forest gardens. Roughly one third of tree species in the forest plots were of economic importance as commercial timber trees; timber diversity was little affected by moderate human use of the forest but was significantly reduced in cacao forest gardens and dropped to near zero in other plantation types. The mean basal area of 57 m(2) (36-80 m(2)) per ha in natural forest was lower than the previously recorded value from the study area but is still almost double as high as the mean value typical for tropical lowland forests in Southeast Asia. The results of this study support the notion that tree diversity in the sub-montane forests of Central Sulawesi is unusually high and rich in large-sized timber trees, although tree size varies locally. Moderate human use of the forest ecosystems does not significantly affect tree diversity. We conclude that conservation of tropical tree diversity is compatible with human exploitation of tropical forest as long as a canopy of native trees is maintained. Future conservation policies in rain forest margin areas should therefore focus on developing measures aimed at sustainable use of the natural resources. Promotion of such activities may help to stabilize tropical rain forest margins in Central Sulawesi.",WOS:000248525000016,932,0.9362427209999999,1,tre specy divers rel to hum land us in trop rain forest margin in cent sulawes the larg scal exploit and convert of trop forest caus grow concern about the continu ex of the rich biodivers of thes forest in the framework of the interdisciplin storm project in lor lindu nat park are in cent sulawes we study tre divers in six diff land us typ in the margin of submont rain forest undisturb forest forest with rat extract select log forest cacao forest gard cacao plant with mix canop of plant tre and cacao plant with a monospec canop by analys such a fin subdivid us grady it was attempt to answ the quest how hum us and biodivers conserv in the study are may be reconcil tre specy dbh cm wer sampl in plot of ha in al six land us typ reply each in tot tre specy gener famy wer record numb of tre specy per ha was in prim forest and grad decreas toward the study cacao system howev when nat and cult tre specy wer consid sep sign diff wer detect among plant typ in term of tre divers tre endem in forest plot total ca and was in good accord with endem in woody plant of sulawes the numb of endem specy was strongly reduc in cacao system although perc endem did not declin sign in cacao forest gard rough on third of tre specy in the forest plot wer of econom import as commerc timb tre timb divers was littl affect by mod hum us of the forest but was sign reduc in cacao forest gard and drop to near zero in oth plant typ the mean bas are of m m per ha in nat forest was low than the prevy record valu from the study are but is stil almost doubl as high as the mean valu typ for trop lowland forest in southeast as the result of thi study support the not that tre divers in the sub mont forest of cent sulawes is unus high and rich in larg siz timb tre although tre siz vary loc mod hum us of the forest ecosystem doe not sign affect tre divers we conclud that conserv of trop tre divers is compat with hum exploit of trop forest as long as a canop of nat tre is maintain fut conserv policy in rain forest margin area should theref foc on develop meas aim at sustain us of the nat resourc promot of such act may help to stabl trop rain forest margin in cent sulawes,new,0.9458693129388143,0.9146859296902136,0.8878302762335973,0.8653729352825014,0.8459716279850459,0.8284532230084299,0.8118788042261249,0.7953661218863985,0.7777696064451872,0.7570183758310085,0.7278960882268024
147,tempbroad1,The importance of agricultural lands for Himalayan birds in winter,"The impacts of land-use change on biodiversity in the Himalayas are poorly known, notwithstanding widespread deforestation and agricultural intensification in this highly biodiverse region. Although intact primary forests harbor many Himalayan birds during breeding, a large number of bird species use agricultural lands during winter. We assessed how Himalayan bird species richness, abundance, and composition during winter are affected by forest loss stemming from agriculture and grazing. Bird surveys along 12 elevational transects within primary forest, low-intensity agriculture, mixed subsistence agriculture, and intensively grazed pastures in winter revealed that bird species richness and abundance were greatest in low-intensity and mixed agriculture, intermediate in grazed pastures, and lowest in primary forest at both local and landscape scales; over twice as many species and individuals were recorded in low-intensity agriculture than in primary forest. Bird communities in primary forests were distinct from those in all other land-use classes, but only 4 species were unique to primary forests. Low-, medium-, and high-intensity agriculture harbored 32 unique species. Of the species observed in primary forest, 80% had equal or greater abundance in low-intensity agricultural lands, underscoring the value of these lands in retaining diverse community assemblages at high densities in winter. Among disturbed landscapes, bird species richness and abundance declined as land-use intensity increased, especially in high-intensity pastures. Our results suggest that agricultural landscapes are important for most Himalayan bird species in winter. But agricultural intensificationespecially increased grazingwill likely result in biodiversity losses. Given that forest reserves alone may inadequately conserve Himalayan birds in winter, comprehensive conservation strategies in the region must go beyond protecting intact primary forests and ensure that low-intensity agricultural lands are not extensively converted to high-intensity pastures.",WOS:000395713800018,365,0.9350046000000001,1,the import of agricult land for himalay bird in wint the impact of land us chang on biodivers in the himalaya ar poor known notwithstand widespread deforest and agricult intens in thi high biodivers reg although intact prim forest harb many himalay bird dur bree a larg numb of bird specy us agricult land dur wint we assess how himalay bird specy rich abund and composit dur wint ar affect by forest loss stem from agricult and graz bird survey along elev transect within prim forest low intens agricult mix subsist agricult and intend graz past in wint rev that bird specy rich and abund wer greatest in low intens and mix agricult intermedy in graz past and lowest in prim forest at both loc and landscap scal ov twic as many specy and individ wer record in low intens agricult than in prim forest bird commun in prim forest wer distinct from thos in al oth land us class but on specy wer un to prim forest low med and high intens agricult harb un specy of the specy observ in prim forest had eq or gre abund in low intens agricult land undersc the valu of thes land in retain divers commun assembl at high dens in wint among disturb landscap bird specy rich and abund declin as land us intens increas espec in high intens past our result suggest that agricult landscap ar import for most himalay bird specy in wint but agricult intensificationespec increas grazingwil lik result in biodivers loss giv that forest reserv alon may inadequ conserv himalay bird in wint comprehend conserv strategies in the reg must go beyond protect intact prim forest and ens that low intens agricult land ar not extend convert to high intens past,new,0.9481350942510341,0.9306033485159917,0.916627037458349,0.9052084631090688,0.895440598365458,0.8866608917300145,0.8783849312191833,0.8701688084046667,0.8614556525235194,0.851286038201179,0.8373624740986907
156,tempbroad1,Within-territory use of different land cover types by tropical forest birds in a fragmented landscape,"Many terrestrial species of birds have been observed to depend on large contiguous areas of forest; in the tropics this appears to be especially true for terrestrial insectivores. Far less is understood about how more-common species, that are less dependent on interior forests, use both forested and non-forested habitat in fragmented landscapes. Using both behavioral observations and radio-tracking relocation data, I quantified the within-territory use of different land cover types for three tropical songbird species, the dusky antbird (Cercomacra tyrannina), red-throated ant-tanager (Habia fuscicauda), and cocoa woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus susurrans). Small forest fragments (<50 ha) were also surveyed for these same species. Territories of all three species were mostly forest (>75%), with different amounts of non-forested land cover. As predicted, all three species had increased use in forest cover and decreased use where neighboring territories overlapped. In addition all three species had higher use of areas where there were more forest gaps and/or 'soft edges' in the vicinity. Dusky antbirds were less likely to use monocultures of non-native grass and impervious surfaces, while the other two species had mixed responses to non-forested habitats. Dusky antbirds and cocoa woodcreepers were observed foraging at higher-than-expected frequencies along 'hard edges' of forested habitat. All three species were found in forest fragments even smaller than a minimal home range area estimate. Conservation of more-common bird species in fragmented landscapes can include secondary forests and small remnants but for these three species non-forested land cover alone would not be expected to provide breeding habitat.

167,tempbroad1,Are small sedentary species affected by habitat fragmentation? Local vs. landscape factors predicting species richness and composition of land molluscs in Swedish conservation forests,"Aim To investigate the relative role of local versus landscape factors for local species diversity of snails and slugs in conservation forests. In landscapes with small, isolated patches of semi-natural habitats, many species that require large habitat areas have disappeared or are threatened. We asked whether small sedentary taxa that depend on local conditions, such as molluscs, are affected if total habitat area decreases in the landscape. Location Temperate broadleaved and oak-rich forest in southern Sweden. Methods We sampled molluscs in 25 small conservation forests that are well-spaced out over a large region. In each forest, sampling was conducted in two plots, each of 1 ha, separated by about 25-100 m. Factors potentially influencing local diversity of molluscs were measured in the plots and in the surrounding landscape at different scales (in space and time) and were analysed by stepwise multiple regression and ordination (PCA and NMS). Results We recorded 53 species, and mean species richness per forest (plots pooled) was 22.6. The pH of the plant litter predicted both species richness and composition; other local (plot) factors of lower importance were canopy openness, stony ground and tree species. The area of conservation forest (woodland key habitat) within 10 km of plots was positively associated with species richness, and was also related to species composition. Openness of the landscape (agriculture) was a negative factor, but historical plot openness (1938-59) seemed to be unimportant. In addition, climate/topography (temperature and altitude) also predicted species composition of the sites. Main conclusions We rejected the hypothesis that microhabitat factors alone, or mainly, determine local species richness and composition of land molluscs. These representatives of small, sedentary organisms seem to be substantially influenced by the surrounding landscape, which should be considered in conservation work and in plans for the protection of forest biodiversity.",WOS:000255714800008,250,0.933824019,1,ar smal sed specy affect by habit frag loc vs landscap fact predict specy rich and composit of land mollusc in swed conserv forest aim to investig the rel rol of loc vers landscap fact for loc specy divers of snail and slug in conserv forest in landscap with smal isol patch of sem nat habit many specy that requir larg habit area hav disappear or ar threatened we ask wheth smal sed tax that depend on loc condit such as mollusc ar affect if tot habit are decreas in the landscap loc temp broadleav and oak rich forest in southern swed method we sampl mollusc in smal conserv forest that ar wel spac out ov a larg reg in each forest sampl was conduc in two plot each of ha sep by about m fact pot influ loc divers of mollusc wer meas in the plot and in the surround landscap at diff scal in spac and tim and wer analys by stepw multipl regress and ordin pca and nms result we record specy and mean specy rich per forest plot pool was the ph of the plant lit predict both specy rich and composit oth loc plot fact of low import wer canop op stony ground and tre specy the are of conserv forest woodland key habit within km of plot was posit assocy with specy rich and was also rel to specy composit op of the landscap agricult was a neg fact but hist plot op seem to be unimport in addit clim topograph temp and altitud also predict specy composit of the sit main conclud we reject the hypothes that microhabit fact alon or main determin loc specy rich and composit of land mollusc thes repres of smal sed org seem to be subst influ by the surround landscap which should be consid in conserv work and in plan for the protect of forest biodivers,new,0.9404053891623937,0.8976642758624309,0.8576983246291926,0.822546105649297,0.7913684551461735,0.7629021523037618,0.736005237322004,0.7095160274019426,0.6818990924361408,0.6504289877517035,0.6083889620745242
176,tempbroad1,Native forest management in subtropical South America: long-term effects of logging and multiple-use on forest structure and diversity,"If logging and forest multiple-use are to be compatible with biodiversity conservation, then forest structure, composition and diversity must be expected to recover from the disturbance and eventually return to their former levels. Here we evaluate the long-term effects of selective logging and forest multiple-use on Southern Brazilian subtropical Araucaria mixed conifer-hardwood forest resilience at the landscape-scale. Long-term effects of different management regimes were compared between control undisturbed forests and forest stands subjected to early (55 years before this study) and recent (13 years) selective logging followed by undisturbed postharvest periods, and forest fragments subjected to selective logging followed by unregulated multiple-use by private landowners. Forest structure (tree density, basal area and height, and regeneration density) in early-logged areas was indistinguishable from control areas. Fragmentation and chronic disturbance, however, degraded forest fragments and kept them at early successional stages, with higher tree density, reduced basal area and scarce or absent regeneration. Mixed forests showed compositional resilience in the angiosperm component but not in the conifer component. Chronic disturbance kept forest fragments floristically away from mature and undisturbed secondary forests. Species richness in control and recently-logged plots did not differ significantly and was higher than richness in early-logged plots. Species richness was much reduced in degraded forest fragments. Density of the conifer Araucaria angustifolia, characteristic of the mature forest, was reduced in the fragments and in logged stands. We discuss how native forest management practices can be implemented to contribute positively to the conservation of the Araucaria mixed forest biodiversity.",WOS:000305228400004,232,0.932809366,1,nat forest man in subtrop sou americ long term effect of log and multipl us on forest structure and divers if log and forest multipl us ar to be compat with biodivers conserv then forest structure composit and divers must be expect to recov from the disturb and ev return to their form level her we evalu the long term effect of select log and forest multipl us on southern brazil subtrop araucar mix con hardwood forest resy at the landscap scal long term effect of diff man regim wer comp between control undisturb forest and forest stand subject to ear year bef thi study and rec year select log follow by undisturb postharvest period and forest frag subject to select log follow by unreg multipl us by priv landown forest structure tre dens bas are and height and reg dens in ear log area was indistinct from control area frag and chronic disturb howev degrad forest frag and kept them at ear success stag with high tre dens reduc bas are and scarc or abs reg mix forest show composit resy in the angiosperm compon but not in the con compon chronic disturb kept forest frag flor away from mat and undisturb second forest specy rich in control and rec log plot did not diff sign and was high than rich in ear log plot specy rich was much reduc in degrad forest frag dens of the con araucar angustifol charact of the mat forest was reduc in the frag and in log stand we discuss how nat forest man pract can be impl to contribut posit to the conserv of the araucar mix forest biodivers,new,0.9458223235073021,0.913661024556334,0.8858839528528686,0.8626303847455596,0.8425521606689061,0.8244909828893107,0.8075270971434517,0.7908390272892417,0.7734211083879524,0.7535748312110675,0.7272593939452481
186,tempbroad1,Bird assemblages in a mixed woodland-farmland landscape: The conservation value of silviculture-dependant open areas in plantation forest,"Although considered by some as a less ""ecologically suitable"" forestry model than ""near-natural"" stand management, even-aged plantation forest management, with regeneration procedure involving clearcutting, creates temporary habitat for many early-successional birds. The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a ""conservation value index"", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities.

198,tempbroad1,Changes in Collembola richness and diversity along a gradient of land-use intensity: A pan European study,"Changes in Collembola richness and diversity along a land-use intensity gradient were studied in eight European countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Switzerland, Hungary, UK, Ireland and Finland). In each country a set of six 1 km(2) (and-use units (LUUs) were selected forming a gradient ranging from natural forest to agricultural dominated landscapes, passing through mixed-use ones. In addition to data on Collembola, detailed information regarding landscape diversity and structure was collected for each LUU. A total of 47,774 individuals were identified from 281 species. Collembola reacted not only to changes in the diversity of the landscape, but also to the composition of that diversity and the area occupied by each land-use type at each LUU. Although species richness patterns were not concordant among the different countries, the total number of species per LUU (landscape richness) was generally higher in natural forests and mixed-used landscapes, and lower in agricultural dominated landscapes. Moreover, high richness and diversity of Collembola at each LUU were associated with a diverse landscape structure, both in terms of number of patches and patch richness. Despite this comparable species richness between mixed-use landscapes and those dominated by natural forests, average species richness on forested areas (local richness) decreased along the gradient, showing that forest patches on mixed-use landscapes support a lower richness than in landscapes dominated by forest. This aspect is important when addressing the role of native forests in structuring biodiversity in disturbed and fragmented landscapes.

204,tempbroad1,Effects of forest height and vertical complexity on abundance and biodiversity of bats in Amazonia,"Anthropogenic activities have accelerated habitat change, loss, and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity over large portions of the tropics. The resulting anthropogenically created landscape mosaics often include forests of different successional stages or that have experienced different levels of anthropogenic use, which affect the physical structure of the forest (e.g., forest height, vertical complexity of vegetation). These physical characteristics of forests may affect the abundance and biodiversity of forest inhabitants, and obscure effects of landscape changes (e.g., percent forest cover) on animal species. Because bats are ecologically diverse and include seed dispersers, pollinators, and top predators, they contribute to the structure and function of forests, and directly affect forest integrity and regeneration. Thus, understanding how variation in the vegetative structure of forests affects the abundance and biodiversity of bats may provide important information to effectively manage and conserve forest fragments. We surveyed bats at 24 sites in the southern Brazilian Amazon, and quantified vegetation structure (density, height, and basal area of trees, density of understory, and canopy openness). Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we tested simple relationships of each structural characteristic with community- (taxonomic and phylogenetic dimensions of biodiversity), guild-, and population-level attributes of bats. Models for total abundance, taxonomic biodiversity (species diversity and dominance), and phylogenetic diversity were significant, increasing with tree height and basal area, and decreasing with canopy openness. At the population level, abundances of frugivores (Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Artibeus planirostris, A. obscurus, A. lituratus, Uroderma bilobatum) and nectarivores (Lonchopylla thomasi, Glossophaga soricina) were related significantly to vegetation structure. Abundances of some understory frugivores exhibited negative relationships with tree height, choosing younger forests, whereas abundances of canopy frugivores were highest in closed canopy forests. Of the nectarivores, L. thomasi was more abundant in older forests (negative relationship with density of trees), whereas G. soricina was more abundant in areas with low canopies and low basal area (i.e., earlier successional forest). Consequently, effective management of forest fragments should include consideration of local forest age and vegetation structure, as well as forest connectivity and patch size. In general, protecting areas with large trees and closed canopies enhances the persistence of pollinators and seed dispersers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

215,tempbroad1,Effects of forest management practices on the diversity of ground-occurring beetles in mixed northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region,"Ground-occurring Coleoptera were sampled over 2 years using pitfall traps in 23 northern hardwood or eastern hemlock-dominated sites representing even-aged, uneven-aged, or old growth forests. Overall, 65,586 individuals were obtained, representing 33 families and 192 species. Carabids comprised 54% of the total catch in 1996, when all the families were tallied. There was little variation in the number and relative abundance of carabid species caught between seasons. No differences in overall species richness or abundance were observed among forest management regimes or habitat types. However, there were substantial differences in species composition. Thirteen species showed significant habitat associations among the five forest management regimes, and 21 species were associated with specific habitat features of the sites, such as dominant tree species or canopy structure. More species (16) were affected by the presence of forest management than by tree species dominance (6) or canopy structure (5). Halpalus fulvilabris, Pterostichus coracinus, Carabus nemoralis, Glischrochilus siepmanni, Nicrophorus orbicollis, and Nicrophorus sayi were more commonly caught in managed than in old growth forest sites, while Carabus sylvosus, Platynus decentis and Oiceoptoma novaboracensis were more commonly associated with old growth sites. Calosoma frigidum and Necrophila americana were associated with northern hardwood sites, while Platynus decentis was significantly associated with sites dominated by eastern hemlock. Calosoma frigidum,, Necrophila americana, and Nicrophorus vespilloides were more common in even-aged sites, while a lampyrid and a leiodid morphospecies were more common in sites with an uneven-aged canopy structure. The importance of microsite features was reflected in the high variability observed among sites and among traps within sites. Results indicate that conservation of a range of forest types is required in order to maintain the diversity of ground-occurring beetles on a regional scale. This will be quite challenging, since forest types such as old growth hemlock-hardwood are rare across the landscape due to habitat fragmentation and logging. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

222,tempbroad1,Bird assemblages in secondary forests developing after slash-and-burn agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon,"Although indigenous farmers and other traditional peoples have disturbed Amazonian forests for centuries, few studies investigate the effects of these disturbances on biodiversity. This short-term study investigates how bird assemblages are affected by agricultural practices adopted by the residents of a national park in the Brazilian Amazon. Twelve sites in secondary forest (four sites in three age categories) and 12 sites in primary forest were selected for bird sampling. Audio-visual censuses of birds were conducted in small plots (1 ha) of young secondary growth (4-5 y), middle-aged (7-15 y), and old (20-3 5 y) secondary forests. Each site in secondary forest had a corresponding control site in adjacent primary forest. Young secondary growth had fewer species than old secondary and primary forests. Bird species richness was similar in middle-aged, old secondary and primary forests. Bird communities of young secondary habitat were dominated by species normally found in open habitats, such as agricultural fields and igapo flooded forests. The bird species composition of young secondary growth was more similar to that of middle-aged forest, which in turn was more similar to that of old secondary forests. Bird species composition differed between young secondary growth and old secondary forests and primary forests and between middle-aged secondary and primary forests. Nectarivore/insectivores and frugivore/insectivores of monospecific flocks are significantly associated with secondary forests, especially in initial stages of forest regeneration. In contrast. specialized insectivorous birds that join mixed-flocks show a significant association with primary forest.",WOS:000248398700009,208,0.927356415,1,bird assembl in second forest develop aft slash and burn agricult in the brazil amazon although indig farm and oth tradit peopl hav disturb amazon forest for century few study investig the effect of thes disturb on biodivers thi short term study investig how bird assembl ar affect by agricult pract adopt by the resid of a nat park in the brazil amazon twelv sit in second forest four sit in three ag categ and sit in prim forest wer select for bird sampl audio vis census of bird wer conduc in smal plot ha of young second grow y middl ag y and old y second forest each sit in second forest had a correspond control sit in adjac prim forest young second grow had few specy than old second and prim forest bird specy rich was simil in middl ag old second and prim forest bird commun of young second habit wer domin by specy norm found in op habit such as agricult field and igapo flood forest the bird specy composit of young second grow was mor simil to that of middl ag forest which in turn was mor simil to that of old second forest bird specy composit diff between young second grow and old second forest and prim forest and between middl ag second and prim forest nect insect and frug insect of monospec flock ar sign assocy with second forest espec in init stag of forest reg in contrast spec insect bird that join mix flock show a sign assocy with prim forest,new,0.9414529345066386,0.9215372520223388,0.9067434243354654,0.8955478157914893,0.8866393799407896,0.8791961317146244,0.8726953131072315,0.8667818425607664,0.861153038141093,0.8554800493931487,0.8492533532114414
232,tempbroad1,Avian communities of managed and wilderness hemiboreal forests,"We compared breeding bird communities of hemiboreal forests in multiple-use managed forests and relatively unmanaged wilderness forests in northern Minnesota. A total of 240 point-count locations, 120 in each of the managed and wilderness areas, were sampled three times across ten paired transects in 2010 and 2011. Transects were paired near lotic systems that cross each management type, with half of the points adjacent to (100 m) or distant (400 m) from the riparian corridor. Total number of individuals and species richness detected per count were higher within the unmanaged forest (F-1,(9) = 9.76, p = 0.01; F-1,F-9 = 11.17, p < 0.01) and forest adjacent to the riparian corridor (F-1,F-9 = 28.30, p < 0.001; F-1,F-9 = 42.12, p < 0.001). These results were negatively correlated with increased area of regenerating forests (mainly from logging) within the managed forest and positively correlated with tree species richness and over-story height of forest stands within the wilderness forest. Of 35 species analyzed individually, Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Least Flycatcher (Empidonax minimus), Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), Winter Wren (Troglodytes hiemalis), and Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris) were more common in the wilderness forest. Only the Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) were more common in the managed forest. Species associated with mature or mixed forests tended to be found in the wilderness area at higher densities, but most species associated with early-successional habitats did not differ between the managed and wilderness landscapes. Results suggest that forests with natural disturbance and succession regimes provide habitat for a higher density and richness of bird species. Responses by breeding birds were similar in both management types regarding distance from riparian areas. To adequately provide for effective conservation of the avian community, forested regions should include wilderness forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

1191,tempbroad1,Beetle diversity in timberline forests: a comparison between old-growth and regeneration areas in Finnish Lapland,"We compared beetle fauna among six types of forests: (1) old-growth pine, (2) old-growth spruce and (3) old-growth mixed forests; (4) 1-year-old and (5) 15-year-old seed-tree cut pine forests, and (6) 15-year-old clear-cut spruce forests using window trapping. In the old-growth forests, species richness was explained by site productivity, amount and quality of coarse woody debris (CWD), and tree species composition. Many of the explaining variables, e.g., site productivity, volume of living timber and volume of CWD were intercorrelated. Beetle assemblages varied according to the site fertility and successional stage. The species compositions of non-saproxylic species were rather similar in the seed-tree-cut areas and in the old-growth pine forests, but the species composition of saproxylics differed between the two forest types. On the contrary, the species compositions of both saproxylics and non-saproxylics differed distinctly between the old-growth spruce forest and clear-cut sites. Species colonising recently died trees, soil-dwelling open-habitat species and some polypore-living cisids were more abundant in regeneration areas than in old-growth forests, whereas species of many other mycetophagous beetle fan-dlies were practically absent from the logged sites. Compared with old-growth forests, the proportion of nationally rare saproxylic species was high at the recently cut sites, but clearly lower at the old regeneration sites. This indicates that in the long run the changes in the amount and quality of CWD may have detrimental effects to rare saproxylic species in the regeneration areas.",WOS:000174479300009,13,0.879916499,1,beetl divers in timberlin forest a comparison between old grow and reg area in fin lapland we comp beetl faun among six typ of forest old grow pin old grow spruce and old grow mix forest year old and year old see tre cut pin forest and year old clear cut spruce forest us window trap in the old grow forest specy rich was explain by sit produc amount and qual of coars woody debr cwd and tre specy composit many of the explain vary e g sit produc volum of liv timb and volum of cwd wer intercorrel beetl assembl vary accord to the sit fertil and success stag the specy composit of non saproxyl specy wer rath simil in the see tre cut area and in the old grow pin forest but the specy composit of saproxyl diff between the two forest typ on the cont the specy composit of both saproxyl and non saproxyl diff distinct between the old grow spruce forest and clear cut sit specy colon rec died tre soil dwel op habit specy and som polyp liv cisid wer mor abund in reg area than in old grow forest wherea specy of many oth mycetoph beetl fan dli wer pract abs from the log sit comp with old grow forest the proport of nat rar saproxyl specy was high at the rec cut sit but clear low at the old reg sit thi ind that in the long run the chang in the amount and qual of cwd may hav detry effect to rar saproxyl specy in the reg area,new,0.9259771589419634,0.8838052894478307,0.8475829289877186,0.8171531334682367,0.7908589375448418,0.7672866282595231,0.745326814023614,0.7239783955829829,0.7020413811457902,0.677461668851892,0.6452484834999025
127,tempbroad1,Effects of forest management on carabid beetles in Belgium: implications for biodiversity conservation,"We sampled the carabid beetles in 22 forests managed by six different silvicultural systems, defined by treatment and tree species composition: even-aged conifer, even-aged beech, even-aged oak, uneven-aged conifer, uneven-aged beech and group mixed (beech + conifer). In each of these forests, we placed pitfall traps in young, medium-aged and mature stands (3 stages). We evaluated the effect of treatment, tree species composition, silvicultural system, stage and habitat type (silvicultural system + stage) on indicators of community conservation value and ecological structure. The species composition and the ecological structure of carabid beetles of the managed stands were then compared to that of nine unmanaged stands (without tree exploitation). In the managed forests, species richness was highest in large young stands (3-10 years old) and in forests managed by even-aged systems (with large clear-cuts), mainly due to eurytopic and opportunist carabid species with high dispersal abilities. Oak and beech, uneven-aged, and mature stands were mainly inhabited by typical forest species, and even-aged conifer stands mainly by ubiquitous species. Several typical forest species recorded in unmanaged stands were lacking from the managed forests. Large scale clear-cutting allows open-habitat species to enter the forest, which increases the species richness at a landscape level but can disfavour typical forest species by competition. Long rotations should be implemented and more areas left unmanaged in Belgium, in order to help typical forest species to re-colonise managed forests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

1681,tempbroad1,"Silviculture as a disturbance regime: the effects of clear-cutting, planting and thinning on polypore communities in mixed forests","The structure of modern forest landscapes is profoundly affected by human-caused disturbances, particularly forest management; however, the effects and prospects of individual silvicultural techniques are insufficiently understood. This study distinguishes the effects of clear-cutting, planting and thinning on species richness and community composition of polypore fungi. In 2008-2009, 181 forest compartments (ranging from naturally regenerated deciduous stands to planted Picea abies stands and 0-137 years post clear-cutting) were explored in a hemi-boreal landscape subjected to even-aged management. Altogether 104 polypore species were recorded. For species richness, time since clear-cutting was the most influential factor at both stand and landscape scales, followed by thinning. Clear-cuts had distinct polypore communities (including several red-listed species) whose species richness declined in time. Following 20 years post clear-cutting, species richness started to increase along different community-composition pathways determined by regeneration type. The communities developed after planting were moderately species rich at stand scale but homogeneous over larger areas. Thus, at landscape scale, mature unmanaged naturally regenerated stands hosted most species; thinning reduced species richness by approximately 15%, and among thinned stands, planted areas had a further 9-22% fewer species than naturally regenerated areas. In such variably managed landscape, silviculture appeared to create particularly distinct communities in young stands on nutrient-rich soils, which naturally provide polypores with a rich supply of small deciduous snags absent from stands artificially planted with P. abies and intensively thinned.",WOS:000294712600005,11,0.8640071090000001,1,silvicult as a disturb regim the effect of clear cut plant and thin on polyp commun in mix forest the structure of modern forest landscap is profound affect by hum caus disturb particul forest man howev the effect and prospect of individ silvicult techn ar insufficy understood thi study distinct the effect of clear cut plant and thin on specy rich and commun composit of polyp fung in forest compart rang from nat reg decidu stand to plant pice aby stand and year post clear cut wer expl in a hem bor landscap subject to ev ag man altogeth polyp specy wer record for specy rich tim sint clear cut was the most influ fact at both stand and landscap scal follow by thin clear cut had distinct polyp commun includ sev red list specy whos specy rich declin in tim follow year post clear cut specy rich start to increas along diff commun composit pathway determin by reg typ the commun develop aft plant wer mod specy rich at stand scal but homog ov larg area thu at landscap scal mat unm nat reg stand host most specy thin reduc specy rich by approxim and among thin stand plant area had a furth few specy than nat reg area in such vary man landscap silvicult appear to cre particul distinct commun in young stand on nutry rich soil which nat provid polyp with a rich supply of smal decidu snag abs from stand art plant with p aby and intend thin,new,0.9306189368200447,0.8963405690597137,0.8675210538164922,0.8429438275067599,0.821136423992045,0.8009668537088603,0.7815184416530774,0.7618562647283578,0.7407089585006227,0.7156762002442115,0.6805964461705056

The objectives were to determine how plant composition, forest structure, and microenvironment differed among stand types and which environmental or structural features were related to understory species. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP) indicated that stand types differed in species composition and environments. Plantations were significantly lower in density of snags, deciduous canopy cover, and leaf substrate, and higher in coniferous canopy cover and needle, twig, and moss substrates than the natural stands. Old-field plantations had less cover of pits and mounds than all other stand types. Mature natural stands contained the greatest amount of coarse woody debris (CWD) in all decay classes and snags >14 cm diameter, and the lowest density of trees >5 cm diameter and moss cover. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that species in both natural stand types are associated with decayed CWD, deciduous cover, and leaf substrate. Species in cutover plantations were associated with coniferous cover and needle substrate. Species composition in old-field plantations Was distinct, with the lowest species richness and diversity of all stand types. We present a conceptual model illustrating the initial direct effects of previous land use and harvesting or postharvest treatments and the subsequent indirect effects associated with plantation or natural stand development on environmental features and understory vegetation. We recommend extending plantation harvest cycles to facilitate reestablishment and expansion of plant populations and maintaining diverse tree canopy composition, coarse woody debris, and pit and mound topography to sustain critical habitat for vascular understory plant species in managed forests.",WOS:000187616400015,12,0.8609545259999999,1,underst veget and environ respons to til forest harvest and con plant develop increas demand to conserv biodivers in man forest necessit bet understand of the impact of forestry pract on the specy rich herbac lay we comp composit and divers of underst veget environ feat and stand structure of forest in new brunswick canad und four diff man scenario includ young yr nat reg forest and con plant yr est aft clear cut mat yr nat reg forest origin from nat disturb insect defo and old field plant yr est on abandon agricult field the object wer to determin how plant composit forest structure and microenviron diff among stand typ and which environ or structural feat wer rel to underst specy detrend correspond analys dca and multirespons permut proc mrpp ind that stand typ diff in specy composit and environ plant wer sign low in dens of snag decidu canop cov and leaf subst and high in con canop cov and needl twig and moss subst than the nat stand old field plant had less cov of pit and mound than al oth stand typ mat nat stand contain the greatest amount of coars woody debr cwd in al decay class and snag cm diamet and the lowest dens of tre cm diamet and moss cov canon correspond analys cca show that specy in both nat stand typ ar assocy with decay cwd decidu cov and leaf subst specy in cutov plant wer assocy with con cov and needl subst specy composit in old field plant was distinct with the lowest specy rich and divers of al stand typ we pres a conceiv model illust the init direct effect of prevy land us and harvest or postharvest tre and the subsequ indirect effect assocy with plant or nat stand develop on environ feat and underst veget we recommend extend plant harvest cyc to facilit reest and expand of plant pop and maintain divers tre canop composit coars woody debr and pit and mound topograph to sustain crit habit for vascul underst plant specy in man forest,new,0.9107372060097557,0.8667149283758653,0.8322392411104754,0.8051291376099114,0.7828066457604651,0.7635766090056131,0.7463162612847425,0.730170900320399,0.7142953656950922,0.6974575458974691,0.6769578576457876
225,tempbroad1,Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. I. Diversity of stand structure,"1. Variable retention harvests or 'green-tree retention systems' are important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone. Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological processes. 2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation) and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than in clear-cut sites. 3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. 4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m(2) ha(-1), with significantly higher levels on patch-cut (23.4 m(2) ha(-1)) and uncut forest (39.0 m(2) ha(-1)) sites. Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha(-1) on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites, to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha(-1) on the patch-cut and uncut forest sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m(3) ha(-1)) of fallen wood (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from 116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs, shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites. 5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among the other sites. 6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest. The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites. 7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance, species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4 years post-harvest.",WOS:000173050100006,9,0.84935233,1,influ of vary ret harvest on forest ecosystem i divers of stand structure vary ret harvest or green tre ret system ar import to the man of con forest in the temp zon green tre ret leav larg liv tre aft harvest i e resid tre to increas structural divers of the reg stand and provid mat forest habit that develop soon than in typ ev ag man by clear cut the see tre system is on method of harvest that leav a few wind firm see tre stand sing or in group to provid see to reg an are nat green tre ret may increas biolog divers and help to enh funct link among forest structures or ecolog process thi study was design to test the hypothes that the abund e g bas are and dens of resid tre and amount of veget and divers e g specy divers and structural divers of the herb shrub and tre lay of vary aspect of stand structure wil declin with low level of tre ret in particul abund and divers should be gre in sit with green tre ret than in clear cut sit stand structure attribut wer meas from immedy aft harvest to in reply clear cut singl see tre group see tre patch cut and uncut forest sit in mix forest of dougla fir pseudotsug menziesi lodgepol pin pin contort in southern brit columb canad in term of abund clear cut singl see tre and group see tre sit had simil mean bas area of resid tre rang from to m ha with sign high level on patch cut m ha and uncut forest m ha sit mean dens of resid tre also follow thi pattern rang from to stem ha on the clear cut to group see tre sit to and stem ha on the patch cut and uncut forest sit respect howev mean volum m ha of fal wood i e dead wood or woody debr was simil among sit rang from in the singl see tre to in the patch cut sit cont to our hypothes the mean index of tot crown volum of herb shrubs moss and lich was simil among sit mean specy rich of herb shrubs and tot plant was simil among sit mean rich of tre in see tre sit was simil to that in uncut forest in three of four post harvest year the mean specy divers of herb was simil among sit but that of shrubs and tre was gen lowest in the patch cut sit and simil among the oth sit the mean structural rich and divers of herb was lowest in the uncut forest and simil at the oth sit and year post harvest the mean structural rich of tre and tot plant in the patch cut and uncut forest sit had mor veget lay than the oth sit our hypothes was part support in term of bas are and dens of resid tre and structural rich of tot veget lay across a grady of tre ret from uncut forest to clear cut sit howev thi pattern was not support for abund or divers of understorey veget thu the structural attribut of resid tre and lay of veget but not the abund specy rich or specy divers of understorey veget lend support to the aim of vary ret harvest at least up to year post harvest,new,0.8965234037590778,0.8346335270311654,0.7829957329996261,0.7404713570057447,0.70422778144401,0.6721605944642793,0.642737230901152,0.6146498609650642,0.5864399798874863,0.5557479555106024,0.5171249830372535
236,tempbroad1,Vegetation diversity and vertical structure as indicators of forest disturbance,"Plant species composition and vertical structure of oak-mixed Atlantic woodlands differing on disturbance regime were studied in the Basque Country, northern Spain. Four different disturbance groups were considered depending on the time since last thinning and the presence/absence of grazers. Plant species cover varied among disturbance groups for 17 out of the total 47 species present in the study area. In general, disturbance by clear-cutting favoured the cover of Betula alba, Castanea sativa and Quercus robur. The shrub species most affected by disturbance were heathers. Among these, the most drastic effect was found for Calluna vulgaris, Daboecia cantabrica and Erica vagans which disappeared in those woodlands subjected to grazing. Several nemoral species, such as Vaccinium myrtillus, Blechnum spicant and Lamiastrum galeobdolon, were absent in these same grazed forests. By contrast, generalist species, such as Ruscus aculeatus, Geranium robertianum and Veronica officinalis, were mostly present in the grazed woodlands. Diversity was measured as Species Richness as well as with the Shannon's and Simpson's indices. Plant species richness did not vary with disturbance treatment, however, it was highest for trees and shrubs at those woodlands in an advanced stage of regeneration, and for herbs in the lowest and highest disturbance groups. Besides, only the third vertical layer (2.5-10 m) was affected by disturbance treatment. Simpson's was the best index to explain the observed differences in the structure of woodlands subjected to unalike levels of disturbance. Species diversity was highest in woodlands with lowest disturbance or in an advanced state of regeneration. Woodlands with lowest disturbance had the highest diversity of trees and those woodlands in an advanced state of regeneration showed the highest diversity of shrub species. Regarding vertical structure, diversity was mostly affected in the intermediate layer (2.5-10 m), with highest values found in woodlands at the lowest disturbance group, i.e. at least 100 years of no disturbance. Two indices of evenness, i.e. Pielou's and Simpson's were also calculated in this study. Results here presented suggest that plant species composition, percent cover of individual plant species, and the Simpson's diversity index (applied considering the different growth-forms and vertical layers) are suitable and complementary indices to evaluate disturbance at the studied woodlands.

317,tempbroad1,Response of small mammals to clear-cutting and precommercial thinning in mixed forests of southeastern Quebec,"The impacts of forest management on habitat characteristics, species richness, and population dynamics of small mammals remain ambiguous. We studied the response of small-mammal populations, including snowshoe hares, to clear-cutting with protection of advanced regeneration and soils (CPRS) and precommercial thinning (PCT). We compared stands recently treated by CPRS or PCT with established stands dominated by deciduous or coniferous trees in two large blocks of mixed forests. We measured habitat components and abundance of small mammals in the four stand types. Trees (DBH >= 9 cm) became very rare in CPRS stands and remained at low density in PCT stands, which stimulated the growth of herbs and seedlings, resulting in increased lateral cover. Tree harvest also generated coarse woody debris in CPRS stands, which did not persist in PCT stands. Small mammals responded to these disturbances in a species-specific manner but, overall, relative abundance and species richness of small mammals were lower in PCT stands than in CPRS and closed stands.

320,tempbroad1,Residual tree retention ameliorates short-term effects of clear-cutting on some boreal songbirds,"Retention of residual trees in ""cutblocks,"" logged blocks of forest, has been proposed as a method to conserve songbirds in landscapes fragmented by clear-cut logging. We examined songbird communities in the boreal mixed-wood forest of Alberta, Canada, to investigate the effect on songbird abundance of (1) logging and (2) retaining variable densities of residual trees in cutblocks (10-133 trees/ha or basal area of 0.50-10.65 m(2)). We surveyed songbirds in logged and forested, aspen-dominated, mixed-wood stands in the year before, the year after, and three years after logging. We analyzed changes in abundance of 27 common songbird species: 23 present in the forest prior to logging and four that appeared after logging. Ten species declined with logging and were termed ""forest species."" Ten more species did not change with logging and were called ""habitat generalists."" The seven species that increased with logging were called ""cutblock species."" When the effect of residual tree retention was examined in terms of basal area (rather than density) of residual trees, more songbird species were found to be both positively and negatively affected by residual tree retention, despite the fact that the two tree measures were highly correlated. In the first year after logging, four bird species (two forest, one generalist, and one cutblock) increased, and none decreased with increasing residual tree retention in cutblocks. In the third year after logging, again four species increased with increasing retention, but these were different species than in the first year after logging (one forest and three generalist species). Furthermore, four cutblock species decreased with increasing retention. Based on these findings, we conclude that retention of residual trees may be beneficial to some species, although conservation of unlogged reserves is also important. Most importantly, we recommend that research be continued to examine a larger range of tree retention and longer term effects on the avifauna.",WOS:000172456700008,14,0.828924898,1,resid tre ret am short term effect of clear cut on som bor songbird ret of resid tre in cutblock log block of forest has been propos as a method to conserv songbird in landscap frag by clear cut log we examin songbird commun in the bor mix wood forest of albert canad to investig the effect on songbird abund of log and retain vary dens of resid tre in cutblock tre ha or bas are of m we survey songbird in log and forest asp domin mix wood stand in the year bef the year aft and three year aft log we analys chang in abund of common songbird specy pres in the forest pri to log and four that appear aft log ten specy declin with log and wer term forest specy ten mor specy did not chang with log and wer cal habit gen the sev specy that increas with log wer cal cutblock specy when the effect of resid tre ret was examin in term of bas are rath than dens of resid tre mor songbird specy wer found to be both posit and neg affect by resid tre ret despit the fact that the two tre meas wer high correl in the first year aft log four bird specy two forest on gen and on cutblock increas and non decreas with increas resid tre ret in cutblock in the third year aft log again four specy increas with increas ret but thes wer diff specy than in the first year aft log on forest and three gen specy furtherm four cutblock specy decreas with increas ret bas on thes find we conclud that ret of resid tre may be benef to som specy although conserv of unlog reserv is also import most import we recommend that research be continu to examin a larg rang of tre ret and long term effect on the avifaun,new,0.8655667030833525,0.822700729006822,0.7915950389093347,0.7682573300578317,0.7498932078164243,0.7349335202386671,0.7224577405620802,0.7119298814275917,0.7030650334780961,0.6958331455793979,0.6908047900966923
419,tempbroad1,Colonisation by vascular plants after soil disturbance in the Bavarian Forest - key factors and relevance for forest dynamics,"Tree uprooting and timber harvesting cause soil disturbances in forests. Plants colonise disturbed patches in two ways: generative (with germination of seeds) and vegetative (with ramets). In this study, the relative importance of the two means of colonisation was assessed and the influences of seed availability and site conditions on colonisation were explored. In a mixed mountain forest in southern Germany, topsoil was disturbed experimentally and colonisation with vascular plants was observed afterwards for 15 months. The compositions of the soil seed bank and the seed rain were investigated. Experiments were carried out in 12 forest stands with different canopy covers and forest management histories. In each stand between 10 and 18 soil disturbance plots were established. Species richness on experimental plots was significantly higher I year after soil disturbance than before the disturbance. The most numerous species emerging after soil disturbance was Rubus idaeus, followed by species of the genus Carex. R. idaeus colonised disturbed plots both generatively and vegetatively, but the vegetative colonisation of this species was important only on clear-cuts with high light intensities. The decisive factor for generative colonisation (considering all species) was the number of germinable seeds of R. idaeus in the soil seed bank, whereas the seed rain was unimportant. The factor with the highest explanatory power for vegetative colonisation was the cover of the adjacent vegetation. The results indicate that soil disturbances in forests increase germination rates, which are responsible for small-scale increases in species richness. R. idaeus on clear-cuts has high cover values because (1) soil disturbances by vehicle traffic and timber hauling during the harvest enhance its germination and (2) the high light intensities on clear-cuts favour the spread of this species vegetatively. Since R. idaeus is a potential competitor for tree seedlings, these findings are important for planning forest management. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

5141,tempbroad1,Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. II. Diversity and population dynamics of small mammals,"1. Variable retention harvests in temperate coniferous forests provide various intensities and sizes of disturbance across a gradient, from clear-cutting to single-tree harvesting. These 'green-tree retention systems' leave large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand. It is unclear what effect these harvesting patterns will have on wildlife in general, and small mammals in particular. 2. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that: (i) the abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals will decline with lower levels of tree retention; (ii) the abundance, reproduction and survival of Microtus spp. and southern red-backed vole Clethrionomys gapperi populations will decline and increase, respectively, with the basal area and density of residual trees after harvest; and (iii) habitat heterogeneity generated by variable retention harvesting will limit population size of Microtus, thereby reducing feeding damage to tree seedlings planted on harvested areas. 3. Small mammals were intensively live-trapped from 1996 to 1999 in replicated clearcut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed natural forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. The seed-tree harvesting system leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. The patch-cut system harvests timber from small (< 1-ha) units dispersed over a given area of forest. 4. Contrary to hypothesis (i), the mean total abundance of small mammals was similar among sites, and mean species richness and diversity of small mammals was lowest in the uncut forest but similar across the other four treatments. 5. The overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of Microtus spp. was higher on clear-cut (11.3) sites than single seed-tree (6.0), group seed-tree (3.9), patch-cut (1.8) or uncut forest (0.1) sites. Overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of C. gapperi was similar in uncut forest (16.2) and group seed-tree (10.0) sites, which were both higher than patch-cut (6.4), clear-cut (4.2) or single seed-tree (2.7) sites. 6. The recruitment of new Microtus spp. differed significantly among sites, declining from clear-cut to uncut forest. The recruitment of C. gapperi exhibited the opposite trend. The mean number of successful pregnancies was similar among treatments for Microtus spp. but for C. gapperi was highest in uncut forest, group seed-tree and patch-cut sites. The survival of each vole species was similar across treatment sites. 7. Hypothesis (ii) was supported. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was inversely, and that of C. gapperi positively, related to mean basal area and density of residual trees after harvest. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was also inversely related to percentage cover and crown volume index of residual trees, and positively related to number of lodgepole pine cones (seeds) in logging debris. 8.

583,tempbroad1,Effects of logging residue removal on ground-active beetles in temperate forests,"Logging residue (""slash"") left on clear-cuttings may affect the microhabitat complexity, and thereby indirectly the beetle (Coleoptera) populations. In three regions (West, North and East) of south and central Sweden, we studied short-term effects of slash removal on species richness and abundance of beetles, collected by pitfall trapping in 16 clear-cuttings (<1 year old) in coniferous and mixed forests. The sites were managed in two alternative ways, either slash was removed (SR), or slash was left (SL). Overall, the number of morphospecies per trap was significantly higher on SL sites than on SR sites. Species richness differed significantly between the regions, the Western region being the poorest in number of species per trap. Rarefaction plots of species richness in four sites suggested that accumulation rate of species differed between two SR sites but rates were similar for two SL sites. Microhabitat structure was measured by aboveground height of slash heaps. Slash height was positively correlated with the number of sticks in slash heap and fractal dimension, respectively. There was a positive relationship between the number of individuals per trap and slash height in SR sites in the Western and Eastern regions, but not in the Northern one. We concluded that extensive slash removal leads to impoverish species richness of Coleoptera. at a local scale. Slash heaps left on site may provide important refuges for ground-active beetles. Moreover, our results supported the general theory that microhabitat structure affects arthropod abundance and diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

653,tempbroad1,Arthropod responses to harvesting and wildfire: Implications for emulation of natural disturbance in forest management,"Although natural disturbance has been widely adopted as a template for forest management that protects biodiversity, this hypothesis has not been adequately tested. We compared litter-dwelling arthropod assemblages (Coleoptera: Carabidae and Staphylinidae; Araneae) in aspen-dominated stands originating as clear-cuts or wildfires across three age classes (1-2, 14-15, and 28-29 years old) to test whether the post-harvest and post-fire assemblages converged following disturbances, and to compare faunal succession. These findings were compared to data about epigaeic arthropods in old and mature pyrogenic aspen stands (> 70 years old) to determine whether diversity and community composition of arthropods from the younger age-classes approached what may have been typical predisturbance conditions. The resulting data-set of almost 27,000 arthropods and 230 species showed convergence in most taxa, and some general similarities between 28- and 29-year-old stands and old and mature stands. However, not all taxa responded similarly, and faunal succession following clear-cutting appeared to progress more rapidly than following wildfire. Rarefaction-estimated diversity was elevated in 1-2-year-old stands, compared to unharvested stands, reflecting a mix of closed-canopy and open-habitat species. Nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling ordinations showed that samples from young wildfire disturbed stands (1-2 years old) included more variable assemblages than all other study sites, and contained species that may depend on unique post-fire habitat characteristics. The fauna of old and mature stands exhibited low diversity, but contained species with limited dispersal abilities, and species tied to old-growth habitats such as dead wood. Harvesting systems that do not allow adequate recovery following a first harvesting pass, or do not maintain microhabitat features associated with older fire-origin forests, may threaten persistence of some elements of boreal arthropod faunas.

881,tempbroad1,Dynamics of soil meso- and macrofauna during a 5-year period after clear-cut burning in a boreal forest,"The aim of this study was to determine effects of clear-cutting and prescribed clear-cut burning on the abundance and diversity of soil meso- and macrofauna during the early (0-5 years) recovery/recolonisation phase. A 115-year-old stand of mixed Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in central Sweden was clear-cut in March 1999. Injune 1999, two plots on the clear-cut were burnt and two plots were left unburnt according to an experimental design with two blocks. Two plots of adjacent uncut forest were used as controls. The burning combusted the ground vegetation and the upper half of the 6-cm thick organic layer. In comparison with the unburnt clear-cut, burning decreased the abundances of Collembola, Protura, Mesostigmata, Araneae and Diptera larvae throughout the 5-year period, whereas Enchytraeidae, Lumbricidae, Oribatida, Prostigmata, Astigmata and Tardigrada decreased immediately after the fire but showed tendencies of recovery. Burning also decreased species richness. The majority of the species still absent after 5 years was surface-living species. Even animals with good ability to disperse (Diptera, Coleoptera and Araneae) had not recovered, which indicates a change of habitat or lack of food. Clear-cut burning was particularly detrimental to fungivores and predators, whereas microbidetritivores and herbivores were less affected. Prescribed burning, which is considered to increase aboveground biodiversity, dramatically reduced the soil fauna species richness for at least 5 years and did not add any species to those already present in the forest or clear-cut.

886,tempbroad1,Structure and composition of edges next to regenerating clear-cuts in mixed-wood boreal forest,"We investigated the spatial and temporal pattern of edge influence on primary (forest structure) and secondary (understory structure and composition) responses at forest edges next to regenerating clear-cuts in Populus-dominated boreal forest in Alberta, Canada. We used before/after-harvest comparisons to determine whether there were significant effects of edge creation in the first and second year after harvest. We also investigated 5- and 16-yr-old edges to determine whether their structure and composition were significantly different from interior forest. Distance of edge influence (20 - 60 m) was not extensive compared to findings from studies conducted in other forest types. In the first two years after harvest, there were significant primary responses to edge creation including increased tree mortality, snag breakage and amount of downed coarse woody debris; as well as secondary responses including prolific vegetative regeneration of Populus spp. and a decrease in total shrub cover. Significant edge effects were still detectable 5 and 16 yr after edge creation, despite the rapid regeneration of Poppidus-dominated forest in the adjacent clear-cuts. These older edges showed evidence of past primary and secondary responses, including a more heterogeneous canopy, along with additional changes in understory composition. At both younger and older edges the distance of edge influence was greater for secondary responses (up to 60 m) than for primary responses (10 - 20 m). We hypothesize that secondary responses to edge creation start later than primary responses and that the distance of edge influence is greater for secondary (vs. primary) responses.",WOS:000178961700009,4,0.7387872679999999,1,structure and composit of edg next to reg clear cut in mix wood bor forest we investig the spat and temp pattern of edg influ on prim forest structure and second underst structure and composit respons at forest edg next to reg clear cut in popul domin bor forest in albert canad we us bef aft harvest comparison to determin wheth ther wer sign effect of edg cre in the first and second year aft harvest we also investig and yr old edg to determin wheth their structure and composit wer sign diff from intery forest dist of edg influ m was not extend comp to find from study conduc in oth forest typ in the first two year aft harvest ther wer sign prim respons to edg cre includ increas tre mort snag break and amount of down coars woody debr as wel as second respons includ prol veget reg of popul spp and a decreas in tot shrub cov sign edg effect wer stil detect and yr aft edg cre despit the rapid reg of poppid domin forest in the adjac clear cut thes old edg show evid of past prim and second respons includ a mor heterog canop along with addit chang in underst composit at both young and old edg the dist of edg influ was gre for second respons up to m than for prim respons m we hypothes that second respons to edg cre start lat than prim respons and that the dist of edg influ is gre for second vs prim respons,new,0.7874180560079156,0.7063652634534785,0.6519151610115752,0.6153894519208897,0.5899758546761981,0.5720701371957307,0.559890728783497,0.5528077537307732,0.5512199221686317,0.5572561279176934,0.5777073103256348
945,tempbroad1,Short-term effects of selection and clear cutting on the shrub and herb layer vegetation during the conversion of even-aged Norway spruce stands into mixed stands,"The conversion of even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) H. Karst.) stands into more site adapted mixed stands is the main silvicultural goal in Germany and many other European countries. The conversion will primarily be achieved with the help of selection cutting, removing single target diameter trees and creating small gaps. At sites highly susceptible to windthrow, however, small scale clear cutting (up to 1 ha) might be an appropriate alternative. Both selection and clear cutting will affect the understorey vegetation, an important component of forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Thus, with the help of a BACI-experiment (before-after/control-impact), the short-term effects of selection and small scale clear cutting on the herb and shrub layer vegetation were studied at two sites in the Solling Hills (Lower Saxony, Germany). Both treatments led to an increase in herb and shrub layer species numbers, due to persistent and invading (mainly pioneer tree species and indicators of disturbance) species and to a shift in plant traits. Most responsible for the changes in vegetation was a higher light availability, and to a lesser degree soil disturbance. The number of annuals and ruderals, however, increased only immediately after clear cutting, whereas on selection cutting plots the numbers remained high. Gaining in number and coverage were competitive perennials (Epilobium angustifolium, Juncus effusus, Rubus idaeus) especially on the clear cuttings, fulfilling a nutrient retention function. The competitives did not deter tree species from regenerating in the clear cut plots, whereas on selection cutting plots the large expansion of R. idaeus appeared to be hindering tree colonisation. Suffering under clear cut conditions were predominantly shade-tolerant, closed-forest species, but no loss of these species could be detected. This indicates the potential for a fast recovery of these forest species, as soon as, pioneer trees expand. Although the vegetation changed in similar directions at both study sites, differences in species numbers and composition were found, indicating the importance of site conditions in the beginning of succession. In conclusion, our study shows no overall negative effects on shrub and herb layer biodiversity and trait composition after clear cutting. It is suggested that small scale clear cutting may be considered an appropriate alternative to silvicultural methods which cause a moderate rate of disturbance, to reach the goal of Norway spruce forest conversion.

1115,tempbroad1,Impact of soil surface disturbances on functional group diversity after clear-cutting in Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) forests in southern France,"The objective of this study was to analyze soil surface disturbances resulting from logging tractors, of different types (skidder and forwarder), used for clear-cutting in natural Aleppo pine forests and their consequences on plant species and functional group diversity. Results indicate that shallow disturbances (litter left in place or removed) were more frequent than deep disturbances (topsoil removed, subsoil exposed, rut exposed) regardless of the logging tractor used. The forests with previously cultivated terraces were the least disturbed. Moreover, with the aid of a functional group analysis we distinguished four plant species response groups to soil surface disturbance types. The mosaic created by these groups after clear-cutting and log removal probably contributes to a rapid auto-regeneration of a mixed plant community similar to that existing just prior to the clear-cutting.

1232,tempbroad1,The acceleration of succession for the restoration of the mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forests in Northeast China,"There are large amounts of clear-cuts and secondary forests in Northeast China. In order to preserve habitats of biodiversity and decrease ecological disasters, it now becomes urgent to restore them to the climax. An adapted forest dynamics model is used to simulate the change in tree species composition, density, and stem productivity of forests regenerating from clear-cuts of the mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forest (MKPF) and the introduction of species over 100 years in the region. The model shows that the restoration of climax forests on these sites can be accelerated by the introduction of proper tree species. For the current secondary forest of Quercus mongolica, Populus davidiana and Betula platyphylla, if the medium-type of shade tolerant tree species are introduced into the communities, the dynamics of tree species will change, and the stem productivity will decrease by 20%. If Larix olgensis is introduced into the forest communities, it will become dominant in the forests, with stem productivity increasing about 110%. If Pinus koraiensis is introduced, it will dominate the communities after 90-100 years, although the density and stem productivity will not change significantly. If P. koraiensis is introduced into the current secondary forest of medium-type trees, the dynamics of the forest will change significantly and the growth of medium-type trees will increase after 20 years. If the medium-type trees are introduced into the plantations of pure R koraiensis, both the tree density and stem productivity will increase dramatically, and the earlier stem divergence, earlier branching, of P. koraiensis can be improved.

2489,tempbroad1,Aboveground biomass and nutrient accumulation 20 years after clear-cutting a southern Appalachian watershed,"In 1975, we initiated a long-term interdisciplinary study of forest watershed ecosystem response to clear-cutting and cable logging in watershed 7 at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. This paper describes approximately 20 years of change in species composition, aboveground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and nutrient pools in the 59-ha mixed hardwood forest of watershed 7 following commercial clear-cutting in winter 1977. We measured woody species in 24 permanently marked plots before cutting in 1974 and during subsequent years (1977-1997). By 1997 (approximately 20 years after cutting), aboveground biomass was 81.7, 96.9, and 85.4 Mg.ha(-1) in the cove hardwood; mesic, mixed-oak; and dry, mixed-oak communities, respectively. Leaf biomass and LAI accumulated relatively faster than total aboveground biomass in all three communities.

2591,tempbroad1,Responses of ground vegetation species to clear-cutting in a boreal forest: aboveground biomass and nutrient contents during the first 7 years,"Rapid growth of ground vegetation following clear-cutting is important to site productivity because vegetation retains nutrients in the ecosystem and can decrease nutrient leaching prior to stand re-establishment. Aboveground biomass, nutrient contents (N, P, K and Ca) and species composition of ground vegetation were determined I year before and for 7 years after clear-cutting of a mixed forest dominated by Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.] in eastern Finland. The biomass of the feather mosses [Pleurozium schreberi Brid. and Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) B. S.& G.] and the dwarf shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus L. and V. vitisidaea L.), which had dominated the ground vegetation in the mature forest, significantly decreased after clear-cutting. However, with the exception of H. splendens, these species had recovered within 3-5 years. The biomass of Deschampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin. considerably increased soon after clear-cutting, and Epilobium angustfolium L. appeared 3-5 years after cutting. These species contributed to the retention of nutrients not simply because of their biomass but also because of higher nutrient concentrations in their tissues. Total biomass and nutrient contents of the ground vegetation exceeded those of the pre-cutting levels. The proportion of ground vegetation biomass and nutrient contents represented by mosses decreased after cutting, while V. myrtillus, although reduced after cutting, remained a marked nutrient sink. The results suggest that H. splendens is the most sensitive species to cutting, but the biomass of P. schreberi, V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea return to initial levels soon after clear-cutting as do the nutrient contents of ground vegetation.",WOS:000233245400004,1,0.520957431,1,respons of ground veget specy to clear cut in a bor forest aboveground biomass and nutry cont dur the first year rapid grow of ground veget follow clear cut is import to sit produc becaus veget retain nutry in the ecosystem and can decreas nutry leach pri to stand re est aboveground biomass nutry cont n p k and ca and specy composit of ground veget wer determin i year bef and for year aft clear cut of a mix forest domin by norway spruce pice aby l h karst in eastern finland the biomass of the feath moss pleuroz schreberi brid and hylocom splendens hedw b s g and the dwarf shrubs vaccin myrtill l and v vitisidae l which had domin the ground veget in the mat forest sign decreas aft clear cut howev with the exceiv of h splendens thes specy had recov within year the biomass of deschamps flexuos l trin consid increas soon aft clear cut and epilob angustfol l appear year aft cut thes specy contribut to the ret of nutry not simply becaus of their biomass but also becaus of high nutry cont in their tissu tot biomass and nutry cont of the ground veget excess thos of the pre cut level the proport of ground veget biomass and nutry cont repres by moss decreas aft cut whil v myrtill although reduc aft cut remain a mark nutry sink the result suggest that h splendens is the most sensit specy to cut but the biomass of p schreberi v myrtill and v vit idae return to init level soon aft clear cut as do the nutry cont of ground veget,new,0.6177052764315344,0.531190132290151,0.4793679366447955,0.4456706118459544,0.42244800061849963,0.40625355232713856,0.3954677292224428,0.3895441112322973,0.38894469396990006,0.39578113034188334,0.41673783141636855
128,tempconif,Effects of different forest management systems on plant species diversity in a Fagus crenata forested landscape of central Japan,"To clarify how different forest management systems affect the diversity of understory vascular plant species at the plot level and the forest-type level, we examined a forested landscape originally occupied by primary Japanese beech, Fagus crenata Blume, in central Japan. The landscape is currently composed of four types of forest: primary F. crenata forest, shelterwood logged F. crenata forest, abandoned coppice forest, and coniferous plantation. Species richness per plot (alpha diversity) and in each forest type (gamma diversity) and species turnover among plots in each forest type (beta diversity) reached their highest values in plantation forests. While the difference in species composition between primary and shelterwood logged forests was not significant, the other pairs of forest types showed significant differences. Ordination analysis revealed that variation in species composition within the plantations seemed to be related to the dominance of naturally regenerated tree species, which reflected the intensity of tending. Although the species composition of less intensively tended plantations was similar to that of abandoned coppice forests that had been repeatedly cut in the past, their species composition differed from that of the primary forests. This suggests that most of the plantation and coppice forests, which were clear-cut at least once, do not revert to primary forest conditions after management is abandoned.",WOS:000235231000008,13,0.96203042,1,effect of diff forest man system on plant specy divers in a fag crenat forest landscap of cent jap to clar how diff forest man system affect the divers of underst vascul plant specy at the plot level and the forest typ level we examin a forest landscap origin occupy by prim japanes beech fag crenat blum in cent jap the landscap is cur compos of four typ of forest prim f crenat forest shelterwood log f crenat forest abandon cop forest and con plant specy rich per plot alph divers and in each forest typ gamm divers and specy turnov among plot in each forest typ bet divers reach their highest valu in plant forest whil the diff in specy composit between prim and shelterwood log forest was not sign the oth pair of forest typ show sign diff ordin analys rev that vary in specy composit within the plant seem to be rel to the domin of nat reg tre specy which reflect the intens of tend although the specy composit of less intend tend plant was simil to that of abandon cop forest that had been rep cut in the past their specy composit diff from that of the prim forest thi suggest that most of the plant and cop forest which wer clear cut at least ont do not revert to prim forest condit aft man is abandon,new,0.978971002874019,0.9596827689347553,0.9391677901306094,0.9189650678094627,0.8990382789133572,0.87880125989221,0.8574066846966791,0.833552286492769,0.8049591217005059,0.7665923661168574,0.7041909960154814
216,tempconif,High plant species richness indicates management-related disturbances rather than the conservation status of forests,"There is a wealth of smaller-scale studies on the effects of forest management on plant diversity. However, studies comparing plant species diversity in forests with different management types and intensity, extending over different regions and forest stages, and including detailed information on site conditions are missing. We studied vascular plants on 1500 20 m x 20 m forest plots in three regions of Germany (Schwabische Alb, Hainich-Dun, Schorfheide-Chorin). In all regions, our study plots comprised different management types (unmanaged, selection cutting, deciduous and coniferous age-class forests, which resulted from clear cutting or shelterwood logging), various stand ages, site conditions, and levels of management-related disturbances. We analyzed how overall richness and richness of different plant functional groups (trees, shrubs, herbs, herbaceous species typically growing in forests and herbaceous light-demanding species) responded to the different management types. On average, plant species richness was 13% higher in age-class than in unmanaged forests, and did not differ between deciduous age-class and selection forests. In age-class forests of the Schwabische Alb and Hainich-Dun, coniferous stands had higher species richness than deciduous stands. Among age-class forests, older stands with large quantities of standing biomass were slightly poorer in shrub and light-demanding herb species than younger stands. Among deciduous forests, the richness of herbaceous forest species was generally lower in unmanaged than in managed forests, and it was even 20% lower in unmanaged than in selection forests in Hainich-Dun. Overall, these findings show that disturbances by management generally increase plant species richness. This suggests that total plant species richness is not suited as an indicator for the conservation status of forests, but rather indicates disturbances.",WOS:000324035600006,23,0.937075665,1,high plant specy rich ind man rel disturb rath than the conserv stat of forest ther is a weal of smal scal study on the effect of forest man on plant divers howev study comp plant specy divers in forest with diff man typ and intens extend ov diff reg and forest stag and includ detail inform on sit condit ar miss we study vascul plant on m x m forest plot in three reg of germany schwabische alb hainich dun schorfheide chorin in al reg our study plot compr diff man typ unm select cut decidu and con ag class forest which result from clear cut or shelterwood log vary stand ag sit condit and level of man rel disturb we analys how overal rich and rich of diff plant funct group tre shrubs herb herbac specy typ grow in forest and herbac light demand specy respond to the diff man typ on av plant specy rich was high in ag class than in unm forest and did not diff between decidu ag class and select forest in ag class forest of the schwabische alb and hainich dun con stand had high specy rich than decidu stand among ag class forest old stand with larg quant of stand biomass wer slight poor in shrub and light demand herb specy than young stand among decidu forest the rich of herbac forest specy was gen low in unm than in man forest and it was ev low in unm than in select forest in hainich dun overal thes find show that disturb by man gen increas plant specy rich thi suggest that tot plant specy rich is not suit as an ind for the conserv stat of forest but rath ind disturb,new,0.9598166262199943,0.9263335919474844,0.893197665578035,0.8625471152612056,0.8340926458949822,0.8069806494466434,0.7802548438660858,0.7527242037182459,0.7226139950438148,0.6864084554423787,0.6349439845343221
314,tempconif,Plant species diversity in abandoned coppice forests in a temperate deciduous forest area of central Japan,"We investigated plant species diversity as it related to stand structure and landscape parameters in abandoned coppice forests in a temperate, deciduous forest area of central Japan, where Fagus crenata was originally dominant. The species occurring in the study plots were classified into habitat types based on a statistical analysis of their occurrence bias in particular habitats (e.g., primary forest, coniferous plantation) in the landscape studied. The relationships between stand structure, which reflected the gradient of management, and forest floor plant species diversity (H' and J') and richness (number of species per unit area) were not significant. However, these factors did influence the forest floor plant composition of the different types of habitat. According to the multiple regression analysis, species diversity and the richness of forest floor plants was affected by landscape parameters rather than by stand structure. For trees, species richness was mainly affected by the relative dominance of F. crenata, which is one of the stand structure parameters that decreases with intensive management. This is probably because many of the tree species that are characteristic diversity (H' and J') of trees was positively correlated with some landscape parameters, including the road density around the study plot, which may be associated with the intensity of management activity. The number of disturbance-tolerant species increased with increasing road density. Stand structure mainly affected disturbance-intolerant forest floor plant species and disturbance-tolerant tree species. Thus, the species diversity responses differed between forest floor plants and trees. The impact of forest management on species diversity was more prominent for forest floor plants.",WOS:000182132400012,103,0.932983555,1,plant specy divers in abandon cop forest in a temp decidu forest are of cent jap we investig plant specy divers as it rel to stand structure and landscap paramet in abandon cop forest in a temp decidu forest are of cent jap wher fag crenat was origin domin the specy occur in the study plot wer class into habit typ bas on a stat analys of their occur bia in particul habit e g prim forest con plant in the landscap study the rel between stand structure which reflect the grady of man and forest flo plant specy divers h and j and rich numb of specy per unit are wer not sign howev thes fact did influ the forest flo plant composit of the diff typ of habit accord to the multipl regress analys specy divers and the rich of forest flo plant was affect by landscap paramet rath than by stand structure for tre specy rich was main affect by the rel domin of f crenat which is on of the stand structure paramet that decreas with intend man thi is prob becaus many of the tre specy that ar charact divers h and j of tre was posit correl with som landscap paramet includ the road dens around the study plot which may be assocy with the intens of man act the numb of disturb tol specy increas with increas road dens stand structure main affect disturb intol forest flo plant specy and disturb tol tre specy thu the specy divers respons diff between forest flo plant and tre the impact of forest man on specy divers was mor promin for forest flo plant,new,0.9578103366437085,0.9280468573020341,0.9000759446578571,0.8750270481554423,0.8522236415607519,0.8307075875044853,0.8095368041818443,0.7875917024046281,0.7632156792562297,0.7330643129151951,0.6882082040150563
512,tempconif,Old rural parks support higher biodiversity than forest remnants,"One of the main challenges in biodiversity conservation is to curb a further degradation and loss of high-quality habitats. In agricultural matrix landscapes, the detection of alternative habitats for habitat specialists may be a solution. Historic old parks or landscape gardens around manor houses and castles are cultural heritage of nobles, but their value in harbouring biodiversity is poorly acknowledged. Therefore we evaluated the potential of old rural parks to serve as a habitat for nemoral forest species. We recorded stand structure and the presence of forest biodiversity indicators in 74 closed-canopy stands of historic parks and compared them with 93 neighbouring mature forest remnants on ancient forest land. We estimated the importance of stand structure in relation to habitat type on biodiversity indicators. Finally we suggest single-value indicator-complexes for the cost-efficient assessment of the conservation value of forests and forest-like habitats. Park stands outclassed reference forests in several individual structural characteristics, and in combined indicators of habitat quality and biodiversity. Forests had higher estimates for the combined indicator of dead wood, but large-diameter dead wood types were more abundant in parks. Woodpeckers, several old-growth indicator epiphytes and forest herbs had successfully become established in planted forest-like park fragments. Old rural parks resemble high-conservation-value forests more than the best preserved contemporary forest remnants. After the century needed to overcome immigration delay, old parks do provide a refugium for temperate deciduous forest species. Consequently, biodiversity-targeted management should retain and enhance old-growth attributes in forests and on the peripheries of parks: e.g. preserving old trees to provide service for epiphytes, hollow trees and an understorey mosaic for birds and bats; dead wood elements for saproxylic insects and fungi; limited mowing frequency and increased cutting height for forest herbs. Forestry should enhance the recovery of mixed deciduous stands and avoid conifer plantations.",WOS:000317352100008,113,0.920520771,1,old rur park support high biodivers than forest remn on of the main challeng in biodivers conserv is to curb a furth degrad and loss of high qual habit in agricult matrix landscap the detect of altern habit for habit spec may be a solv hist old park or landscap gard around man hous and castl ar cult herit of nobl but their valu in harbo biodivers is poor acknowledg theref we evalu the pot of old rur park to serv as a habit for nem forest specy we record stand structure and the pres of forest biodivers ind in clos canop stand of hist park and comp them with neighbo mat forest remn on ant forest land we estim the import of stand structure in rel to habit typ on biodivers ind fin we suggest singl valu ind complex for the cost efficy assess of the conserv valu of forest and forest lik habit park stand outclass ref forest in sev individ structural charact and in combin ind of habit qual and biodivers forest had high estim for the combin ind of dead wood but larg diamet dead wood typ wer mor abund in park woodpeck sev old grow ind epiphyt and forest herb had success becom est in plant forest lik park frag old rur park resembl high conserv valu forest mor than the best preserv contemp forest remn aft the century nee to overcom immigr delay old park do provid a refug for temp decidu forest specy consequ biodivers target man should retain and enh old grow attribut in forest and on the periphery of park e g preserv old tre to provid serv for epiphyt hollow tre and an understorey mosa for bird and bat dead wood el for saproxyl insect and fung limit mow frequ and increas cut height for forest herb forestry should enh the recovery of mix decidu stand and avoid con plant,new,0.9343436906176112,0.9087234245182848,0.8880322179695089,0.8715617734125014,0.8580761054491775,0.8466181518866274,0.8365326856560615,0.8273190772107702,0.8185455780560299,0.8096604887649547,0.7996620352235256
610,tempconif,The effects of tree age and tree species composition on bird species richness in a Central European montane forest,"Large areas of montane forests are commercially harvested, while some other parts remain unmanaged. These conditions provide an opportunity to study the response of bird communities to forest management. Here we focused on the effects of tree species composition and tree age on bird species richness. We counted birds in two types of montane forest (beech and mixed) replicated in three age classes (managed 55-65 years, managed 85-95 years, unmanaged over 200 years) in the Vtacnik Mountains, Slovakia. Number of bird species at individual study sites (local richness) was predicted solely by the tree age and not by the forest type. Specifically, the number of species was highest in the oldest stands, while the stands of 55-65 and 85-95 years did not differ from each other. By contrast, forest type seems important for total bird species richness (number of species recorded in all study sites of a given type) with more species recorded in mixed forests than in beech forests. The local richness seems thus limited by the amount resources available at a given site, which is highest in the oldest stands irrespective to forest type, probably due to largest amount of food, dead wood or tree cavities, being particularly suitable for habitat specialists. However, larger species pool in mixed forest, enriched by birds adapted to coniferous trees, increases the total number of species observed in this type. We thus recommend to shift the harvest to the highest possible age and to include some other tree species into parts of beech monocultures.",WOS:000368886700015,58,0.919354421,1,the effect of tre ag and tre specy composit on bird specy rich in a cent europ mont forest larg area of mont forest ar commerc harvest whil som oth part remain unm thes condit provid an opportun to study the respons of bird commun to forest man her we focus on the effect of tre specy composit and tre ag on bird specy rich we count bird in two typ of mont forest beech and mix reply in three ag class man year man year unm ov year in the vtacnik mountain slovak numb of bird specy at individ study sit loc rich was predict sol by the tre ag and not by the forest typ spec the numb of specy was highest in the oldest stand whil the stand of and year did not diff from each oth by contrast forest typ seem import for tot bird specy rich numb of specy record in al study sit of a giv typ with mor specy record in mix forest than in beech forest the loc rich seem thu limit by the amount resourc avail at a giv sit which is highest in the oldest stand irrespect to forest typ prob due to largest amount of food dead wood or tre cav being particul suit for habit spec howev larg specy pool in mix forest enrich by bird adapt to con tre increas the tot numb of specy observ in thi typ we thu recommend to shift the harvest to the highest poss ag and to includ som oth tre specy into part of beech monocult,new,0.9425904594961209,0.9016316311289553,0.8633528792316045,0.8295794374762446,0.7995632813636813,0.7721656008092037,0.7463370482650863,0.7209873168221537,0.6947355623760708,0.6650905048212082,0.6258943339519779
710,tempconif,"Effects of previous land-use on plant species diversity in semi-natural and plantation forests in a warm-temperate region in southeastern Kyushu, Japan","We compared the species composition, occurrence and diversity of understorey of forestry plantations and semi-natural secondary forests in a warm-temperate region in southeastern Kyushu, Japan, in which the previous land-use history had been documented. Cluster analysis and a stand ordination, using detrended correspondence analysis, indicated that plant species composition in forest stands was primarily influenced by the previous land-use history (as meadows or coppices) compared with either the current status of the stand (semi-natural forest or plantation) or site micro-topography. Species occurrence was also dependent on the previous land-use, with a significantly greater proportion of native woodland species being present in former coppice stands. Species richness, however, was higher in plantations and stands developing on former meadow sites. This was true of perennial forbs and climbing plants, but not the evergreen species which were originally common in native woodland of the region. Species diversity indices (Shannon's H') showed a similar tendency to species richness. The light environment within forest stands, evaluated by gap light intensity (GLI) using hemispherical photography, had less effect on species richness. We conclude that previous land-use has a significant effect on the species composition and diversity of forest, persisting even after the establishment of conifer plantations, and that the restoration of the original 'woodland' species composition and diversity will require the retention of efficient seed sources near stands which have developed on land previously cleared of native forest cover.

810,tempconif,The effect of stand-level habitat characteristics on breeding bird assemblages in Hungarian temperate mixed forests,"The effects of stand structure, tree species composition, proportion of habitat types and land use history on breeding bird assemblages in temperate mixed forests in Western Hungary were studied. The species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole breeding bird assemblage and of some groups formed on the basis of nesting site and rarity were examined. Stand structural variables had the highest impact on the breeding bird assemblage, while tree species composition, the varying proportion of vegetation types and land use history had no significant effect. In the case of the species richness, the abundance and the composition of the whole assemblage, the most important variables were the mean diameter of trees, the vegetation cover of the forest floor and the dead wood volume. The explained variance in the linear models of different groups varied between 20% and 60%, and the relative importance of these three variables also differed considerably. These results indicate that forest management may considerably influence the diversity and the composition of birds, as all the structural elements affecting birds deeply depend on it. Within the shelterwood management system, the elongation of the rotation and regeneration periods, and the relatively high proportion of retention tree groups after harvest could contribute to the conservation of forest birds. Our results also showed that for the forest bird communities, both the prevalence of big trees and the presence of a dense understory layer are important.

After clear-cutting, differences in the restoration process of forest ecosystems, in terms of vegetation structure and woody debris, will affect the community structure of wood-inhabiting aphyllophoraceous fungi. In this study, we conducted field surveys in broad-leaved secondary forests and in planted conifer forests to examine the chronosequential pattern of fungal community development after clear-cutting and the relationships between environmental conditions and the fungal community structure in central Japan. In 2002, we collected 1476 records from 95 fungal species. Sixty-five species were recorded only in secondary forests, 17 were recorded only in planted conifer forests, and 13 were recorded in both forest types. Fungal species composition was different between the two forest types. Redundancy analysis showed that the amount of coarse woody debris in the broad-leaved secondary forests and basal area of coniferous trees in the planted forests correlated with the fungal species composition of the forests. In the broad-leaved secondary forests, species density showed significant positive correlations with stand age, and number of records and species composition changed with stand age. In the planted conifer forests, the number of records of brown rot fungi, which has a preference for conifers, was positively correlated with stand age. Our study suggested that differences in fungal community structure between the two forest types strongly reflect the preference of fungal species for different host substrates and vegetation structure, and that each forest type maintains specialists for the dominant trees. A mosaic of different forest types will promote the maintenance of high species diversity at the landscape level, as long as secondary or primary forests cover a large enough area to maintain high species diversity.

109,tempconif,Moth Diversity and Identification of Indicator Species in Temperate Forests of Southern South Korea,"The abundance and species richness of moths were evaluated at 16 sites in southern South Korea to assess moth diversity and to identify indicator species for different forest types in this area. In total, 975 moth species were identified in the seven 6-mo collection periods (May-October) between 2001 and 2007. A matrix of 536 species and 36 sampling units was adopted for clustering sampling sites, and indicator species were determined after removing species with fewer than five individuals (370 species), and species that were found at fewer than three sites (36 species). Five different forest groups were identified based on clustering analysis: 1) seashore secondary forest, 2) evergreen deciduous forest, 3) inland young secondary forest, 4) inland mixed deciduous forest, and 5) inland high elevation conifer and deciduous forest. Patterns of moth abundance and species richness within four of the five groups were similar, but the abundance and species richness in the high elevation sites were significantly lower than in the other four groups. Sixty-three species were recognized in the five different forests based on indicator species analysis and the adoption of 63 indicator species in nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination corroborated the grouping of sites into five groups. Many indicator species were woody plant feeders.

1112,tempconif,Forest management conditioning ground ant community structure and composition in temperate conifer forests in the Pyrenees Mountains,"The search for indicators to monitor management impact on biodiversity is a crucial question because management practices promote changes in community structure and composition of different animal groups. This study explores the effect of widely conducted management practices (forest logging and livestock) in Pinus uncinata forests in the Pyrenees range (NE Spain) on the structure and composition of ground ant communities compared to those of old-growth stands. Forest structure clearly differed in stands with different forest managements. These stands managed for different uses also showed marked differences in structure and composition of ground ant communities. There was a great dominance of a single species, Formica lugubris, which accounted for 99% of ants collected in pitfall traps. Rarefaction curves indicated that species richness was highest in old-growth stands and lowest in even-aged ones, with woodland pasture stands showing an intermediate value. Classification methods allowed us to identify two groups of species: six species related to old-growth plots and three species (including F. lugubris) associated to managed stands. Habitat structure played an important role in determining the structure of ant communities: forests with high tree density but low basal area were the most favourable forest type for F. lugubris, while the abundance of the remaining ant species was negatively affected by the abundance of F. lugubnis and by tree cover.

129,tempconif,Effect of forest management on temperate ant communities,"Human management of ecosystems can have direct or indirect effects on species communities. How species communities are affected by management is a key question in ecology and nature conservation. As keystone taxon, changes in ant communities can have sustained consequences for entire ecosystems. In forests, management has been shown to have an overall negative effect on ant communities in tropical and a positive effect in boreal forests. However, in temperate forests, it is unclear what components of forest management affect ant communities and how. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of forest management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in 150 temperate forest stands in three regions in Germany. Using a multi-model inference approach and structural equation models, we analyzed the effects of 18 variables, including variables of forest management, forest structure, arthropod diversity, and biomass, as well as abiotic factors, on ant species richness, abundance, and functional trait diversity (Rao's Q) based on morphological (FDM) and life-history traits (FDLH). In total, we found 28 ant species occurring on 120 plots. Main direct effects of forest management on ant abundance and species richness were caused by tree species selection, measured as dominant tree species. The main positive indirect effect was mediated by a reduced canopy cover with an increasing proportion of oak and pine, resulting in a higher temperature amplitude. Due to the low number of species in two regions, we analyzed functional diversity for the most ant species diverse region only. FDLH was affected positively by tree harvesting and negatively by structural complexity. FDM showed no response to forest management, potentially due to the low morphological diversity of temperate forest ants. Our results show that forest management practices in temperate forests strongly impact ant community structure. This can be beneficial for ants if management reduces the canopy cover, either by tree harvesting or by changing the tree species composition toward shade-intolerant tree species. To promote ant diversity as key taxon for maintaining ecosystem processes in forest ecosystems, we suggest to integrate forest stands with more open and warmer conditions in future management strategics.",WOS:000439997600019,41,0.902671294,1,effect of forest man on temp ant commun hum man of ecosystem can hav direct or indirect effect on specy commun how specy commun ar affect by man is a key quest in ecolog and nat conserv as keyston taxon chang in ant commun can hav sustain consequ for entir ecosystem in forest man has been shown to hav an overal neg effect on ant commun in trop and a posit effect in bor forest howev in temp forest it is unclear what compon of forest man affect ant commun and how thi study expl the direct and indirect effect of forest man on the taxonom and funct divers of ant commun in temp forest stand in three reg in germany us a mult model inf approach and structural equ model we analys the effect of vary includ vary of forest man forest structure arthropod divers and biomass as wel as abiot fact on ant specy rich abund and funct trait divers rao s q bas on morpholog fdm and lif hist trait fdlh in tot we found ant specy occur on plot main direct effect of forest man on ant abund and specy rich wer caus by tre specy select meas as domin tre specy the main posit indirect effect was medy by a reduc canop cov with an increas proport of oak and pin result in a high temp amplitud due to the low numb of specy in two reg we analys funct divers for the most ant specy divers reg on fdlh was affect posit by tre harvest and neg by structural complex fdm show no respons to forest man pot due to the low morpholog divers of temp forest ant our result show that forest man pract in temp forest strongly impact ant commun structure thi can be benef for ant if man reduc the canop cov eith by tre harvest or by chang the tre specy composit toward shad intol tre specy to promot ant divers as key taxon for maintain ecosystem process in forest ecosystem we suggest to integr forest stand with mor op and warm condit in fut man strategics,new,0.9319559732494608,0.8903739643087777,0.8532264745669098,0.821280729146419,0.7933566499560291,0.7681609491370421,0.7445999746929467,0.721604772207533,0.6978655941015159,0.6710681096323862,0.6354717608676711
138,tempconif,Edaphic Collembola assemblages of European temperate primeval forests gradually change along a forest-type gradient,"The Biatowieza Primeval Forest is the largest remnant of temperate virgin forest in central Europe. To investigate the relationship between forest type and edaphic Collembola assemblages, we established 36 study sites in the Strict Nature Reserve that represented the most valuable old growth forest stands and included most of the variability in forest type. The faunas of the humid and boggy deciduous forests were more abundant than those of the moderately humid forests. Three primary groups of assemblages were revealed by multivariate analysis to be typical of the following forest types: (i) coniferous bog forest, (ii) humid and moderately humid coniferous forest, and (iii) deciduous forest. Collembola assemblages were only moderately related to specific forest types but instead changed continuously along the environmental gradient that they formed. At the species level, the correlations to forest type were stronger, and approximately one-third of the collembolan species qualified as significant forest type indicators; both forest specialists and forest generalists were identified. Six species were revealed to be forest generalists because they indicated a wide spectrum of forest types. Nine species were significantly correlated with four to six forest types and were identified as broad specialists, and seventeen indicator species were associated with one, two or three forest types and were classified as narrow specialists. Because the correlation between the edaphic Collembola faunas and forest type revealed a gradual rather than categorical change in the community assemblages, we suggest that this relationship be considered in the development of future forest monitoring programmes.

148,tempconif,"Avifauna associated to native forest and forest plantations of exotic conifers in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, Costa Rica","Avifauna associated to native forest and forest plantations of exotic conifers in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, Costa Rica. - Forest plantations of exotic conifers have been used as a management strategy for restoring forests in many areas of the Neotropics. However, there is a remarkable lack of information of these plantations on the value for conservation biodiversity. To evaluate these plantations as habitat for wildlife, I studied bird communities in native secondary forest and in plantation of exotic tree species (Pinus oocarpa and Cupressus lusitanica) in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, Costa Rica. Bird assemblage composition, richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness were compared between habitats using the fixed-radius point count method. Fieldwork was conducted from September 2008 to May 2009. A total of 743 birds of 79 species corresponding to 10 orders and 25 families were recorded. The bird composition varied across habitats, sharing 51.9% of the same bird species. Although I found no significant differences in the patterns of bird diversity or evenness, the native forest had a greater bird richness and abundance than the plantation. This could be explained by the higher spatial heterogeneity and productivity in the native forest than in the plantation. On the basis of these results, secondary native forests seem to have a greater value for bird conservation than conifer plantations. Therefore, some management measures could favor bird communities in the Reserva Forestal Grecia, such as the implementation of strategies for ecological restoration in order to gradually replace the exotic vegetation by native species which offer more resources available for bird populations. The continuation of studies in plantations of exotic conifers may provide more knowledge that will allow a better understanding of the role played by exotic plantations in maintaining bird populations and biodiversity in general.",WOS:000282804500003,38,0.8987591229999999,1,avifaun assocy to nat forest and forest plant of exot con in the reserv forest grec cost ric avifaun assocy to nat forest and forest plant of exot con in the reserv forest grec cost ric forest plant of exot con hav been us as a man strategy for rest forest in many area of the neotrop howev ther is a remark lack of inform of thes plant on the valu for conserv biodivers to evalu thes plant as habit for wildl i study bird commun in nat second forest and in plant of exot tre specy pin oocarp and cupress lusitanic in the reserv forest grec cost ric bird assembl composit rich abund divers and ev wer comp between habit us the fix radi point count method fieldwork was conduc from septemb to may a tot of bird of specy correspond to ord and famy wer record the bird composit vary across habit shar of the sam bird specy although i found no sign diff in the pattern of bird divers or ev the nat forest had a gre bird rich and abund than the plant thi could be explain by the high spat heterog and produc in the nat forest than in the plant on the bas of thes result second nat forest seem to hav a gre valu for bird conserv than con plant theref som man meas could fav bird commun in the reserv forest grec such as the impl of strategies for ecolog rest in ord to grad replac the exot veget by nat specy which off mor resourc avail for bird pop the continu of study in plant of exot con may provid mor knowledg that wil allow a bet understand of the rol play by exot plant in maintain bird pop and biodivers in gen,new,0.9182088992709876,0.8802499044384358,0.8493856200189277,0.8248027858174282,0.8047663134116544,0.7879241705146232,0.7733664642629212,0.7604267497680793,0.748593232585552,0.7373132761057736,0.725753163952457
169,tempconif,"Long-term protection effects of national reserve to forest vegetation in 4 decades: biodiversity change analysis of major forest types in Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, China","The Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve (CNR) was established in 1960 to protect the virgin Korean pine mixed hardwood forest, a typical temperate forest of northeast China. We conducted systematic studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forests (800-1700 m a.s.l.) in 1963 and 2006 respectively. The aim of this comparison is to assess the long-term effects of the protection on plant biodiversity of CNR during the interval 43 years. The research was carried out in three types of forests: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found different in the same elevations and forest types during the 43-year interval. The floral composition and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layers, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF from 1963 to 2006. However, originally dominant species, P. koraiensis for example, tended to decline, while the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers trended to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the under canopy fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. Comparison of the alpha diversity in the three forests shows that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased with time. During the process of survey, we also found some rare and medicinal species disappeared. Analysis indicates that the changes of the diversity pattern in this region are caused by both nature and human factors. Meteorological records revealed that climate has changed significantly in the past 43 years. We also found the most severe human disturbance to the CNR forests in the process of another field survey that is the exploitation of herb medicines and Korean pine nuts.

177,tempconif,The effects of forest management on plant species diversity in a Sierran conifer forest,"We used a large data set collected as part of a wildlife habitat study at the Blodgett Forest Research Station in the Sierra Nevada of California to assess the influence of management practices on vascular plant diversity in the mixed conifer forest. In addition to the existing data, we conducted botanical inventories in 32 plots (0.28 ha in size) from five different silvicultural regimes in 1997. Based on these inventories, understory species richness normalized to a total area sampled of 1.13 ha was significantly greater in plots under plantation (80 species) and shelterwood (77 species) management compared to plots in reserve sites (i.e., approximately 80 year with no active management, 48 species). This pattern in species richness was consistent in the larger data set. Based on 372 plots sampled between 1977 and 1996, plantations and shelterwoods routinely had the highest species richness and the reserve units routinely were the least rich. Stands under single-tree selection had species richness values closer to those of the reserve stands. The relative diversity observed in group selection plots varied from year to year. Based on the 1997 data, canopy closure and seedbed were significantly correlated to understory plant diversity. Plots that were more open and had more bare ground tended to have higher species richness. This result supports the suggestion that in addition to the total amount of biomass removed, post-harvest practices also affect plant diversity. There were considerable differences in the composition of the understory communities among silvicultural treatments.

In this forest, more intensive management maximized species richness,but the lower intensity practices better conserved understory plants typical of late-seral stands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

187,tempconif,Succession Influences Wild Bees in a Temperate Forest Landscape: The Value of Early Successional Stages in Naturally Regenerated and Planted Forests,"In many temperate terrestrial forest ecosystems, both natural human disturbances drive the reestablishment of forests. Succession in plant communities, in addition to reforestation following the creation of open sites through harvesting or natural disturbances, can affect forest faunal assemblages. Wild bees perform an important ecosystem function in human-altered and natural or seminatural ecosystems, as they are essential pollinators for both crops and wild flowering plants. To maintain high abundance and species richness for pollination services, it is important to conserve and create seminatural and natural land cover with optimal successional stages for wild bees. We examined the effects of forest succession on wild bees. In particular, we evaluated the importance of early successional stages for bees, which has been suspected but not previously demonstrated. A range of successional stages, between 1 and 178 years old, were examined in naturally regenerated and planted forests. In total 4465 wild bee individuals, representing 113 species, were captured. Results for total bees, solitary bees, and cleptoparasitic bees in both naturally regenerated and planted conifer forests indicated a higher abundance and species richness in the early successional stages. However, higher abundance and species richness of social bees in naturally regenerated forest were observed as the successional stages progressed, whereas the abundance of social bees in conifer planted forest showed a concave-shaped relationship when plotted. The results suggest that early successional stages of both naturally regenerated and conifer planted forest maintain a high abundance and species richness of solitary bees and their cleptoparasitic bees, although social bees respond differently in the early successional stages. This may imply that, in some cases, active forest stand management policies, such as the clear-cutting of planted forests for timber production, would create early successional habitats, leading to significant positive effects for bees in general.",WOS:000315603700071,28,0.890656578,1,success influ wild bee in a temp forest landscap the valu of ear success stag in nat reg and plant forest in many temp terrest forest ecosystem both nat hum disturb driv the reest of forest success in plant commun in addit to reforest follow the cre of op sit through harvest or nat disturb can affect forest faun assembl wild bee perform an import ecosystem funct in hum alt and nat or semin ecosystem as they ar ess pollin for both crop and wild flow plant to maintain high abund and specy rich for pollin serv it is import to conserv and cre semin and nat land cov with optim success stag for wild bee we examin the effect of forest success on wild bee in particul we evalu the import of ear success stag for bee which has been suspect but not prevy demonst a rang of success stag between and year old wer examin in nat reg and plant forest in tot wild bee individ repres specy wer capt result for tot bee solit bee and cleptoparasit bee in both nat reg and plant con forest ind a high abund and specy rich in the ear success stag howev high abund and specy rich of soc bee in nat reg forest wer observ as the success stag progress wherea the abund of soc bee in con plant forest show a concav shap rel when plot the result suggest that ear success stag of both nat reg and con plant forest maintain a high abund and specy rich of solit bee and their cleptoparasit bee although soc bee respond diff in the ear success stag thi may imply that in som cas act forest stand man policy such as the clear cut of plant forest for timb produc would cre ear success habit lead to sign posit effect for bee in gen,new,0.9161145194721493,0.8970746880170867,0.8839832548732467,0.8746972626647211,0.8678270929172034,0.8625746108055536,0.8585189130006233,0.855455226966975,0.8533811610558041,0.8526146392681134,0.8544133023486423
199,tempconif,"Vascular diversity patterns of forest ecosystem before and after a 43-year interval under changing climate conditions in the Changbaishan Nature Reserve, northeastern China","The Changbaishan Nature Reserve (CNR) is the largest protected temperate forest in the world. It was established in 1960 to protect the virgin Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) mixed hardwood forest, a typical temperate forest of northeast China. Studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forest (800-1700 m a.s.l.) were conducted in 1963 and in 2006. The aim of this comparison was to assess the long-term effects of the protected status on plant biodiversity during the intervening 43 years. The research was carried out in three forest types: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found to differ for the same elevations and forest types after the 43-year interval, while the beta diversity indicated by the Cody index depicted the altitudinal patterns of plant species gain and loss. The floral compositional pattern and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layer, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF. However, originally dominant species, such as Pinus koraiensis, tended to decline, the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers showed a trend to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the understory fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. A comparison of the alpha diversity indices among the three forest types reveals that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased, and some rare and medicinal species disappeared. Meteorological records show that climate has changed significantly in this 43-year intervening period, and information collected from another field survey found that the most severe human disturbances to the CNR forests stemmed from the exploitation of Ginseng roots and Korean pine nuts.",WOS:000263175800010,125,0.887638879,0,vascul divers pattern of forest ecosystem bef and aft a year interv und chang clim condit in the changba nat reserv northeastern chin the changba nat reserv cnr is the largest protect temp forest in the world it was est in to protect the virgin kor pin pin koraiens mix hardwood forest a typ temp forest of northeast chin study of vascul divers pattern on the nor slop of the cnr mountainsid forest m a s l wer conduc in and in the aim of thi comparison was to assess the long term effect of the protect stat on plant biodivers dur the interv year the research was carry out in three forest typ mix con and broad leav forest mcbf mix con forest mcf and sub alpin con forest scf charact by diff domin specy the alph divers indict by specy rich and the shannon wien index wer found to diff for the sam elev and forest typ aft the year interv whil the bet divers ind by the cody index depict the altitudin pattern of plant specy gain and loss the flor composit pattern and the divers of vascul specy wer gen simil along altitudin grady bef and aft the year interv but som subst chang wer evid with the altitud grady in the tre lay the domin specy in wer simil to thos of though divers declin with altitud the ind in the three forest typ did not diff sign between and and thes valu ev increas in the mcbf and mcf howev origin domin specy such as pin koraiens tend to declin the proport of broad leav tre increas and the specy turnov in the success lay show a trend to shift to high altitud the divers pattern of the underst fluctu along the altitudin grady due to micro environ vary a comparison of the alph divers ind among the three forest typ rev that the divers of the shrub and herb lay decreas and som rar and medicin specy disappear meteorolog record show that clim has chang sign in thi year interv period and inform collect from anoth field survey found that the most sev hum disturb to the cnr forest stem from the exploit of ginseng root and kor pin nut,new,0.8990399101042255,0.8242329322764818,0.7575246158039755,0.7016953470557702,0.6545425487471148,0.6136298534918748,0.5770008138002465,0.5429654157380107,0.5097603019023742,0.4747225624878927,0.4319908446669076
205,tempconif,Succession in ant communities (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in deciduous forest clear-cuts - an Eastern European case study,"Clear-cutting, the main method of harvesting in many forests in the world, causes a series of dramatic environmental changes to the forest habitat and removes habitat resources for arboreal and epigeal species. It results in considerable changes in the composition of both plant and animal communities. Ants have many critical roles in the maintenance and functioning of forest ecosystems. Therefore, the response of ants to clear-cutting and the time it takes for an ant community to recover after clear-cutting are important indicators of the effect of this harvesting technique on the forest ecosystem. We investigated ground-dwelling ant communities during secondary succession of deciduous forests in Transylvania, Romania. Using space-for-time substitution, we explored a chronosequence from clear-cuts to mature forests (> 120 years). The object was to determine if cutting has measurable effects on ant community structure, and if ant species richness differs between successional stages. We recorded a total of 24 species of ants, 11 characteristic of forests and seven of open landscape. Ant species richness was higher in clear-cuts compared to closed-canopy and old stands. Number of ant individuals was highest in young age classes and lowest in closed-canopy age classes. There was no drastic change in species richness during the succession, however differences in community composition at different stages were recorded. Open landscape species are able to rapidly colonize following disturbance but disappear when the forest sites mature and many forest ant species are capable of surviving clear cutting.",WOS:000396466400012,1,0.8875492629999999,1,success in ant commun hymenopter formicida in decidu forest clear cut an eastern europ cas study clear cut the main method of harvest in many forest in the world caus a sery of dram environ chang to the forest habit and remov habit resourc for arb and epig specy it result in consid chang in the composit of both plant and anim commun ant hav many crit rol in the maint and funct of forest ecosystem theref the respons of ant to clear cut and the tim it tak for an ant commun to recov aft clear cut ar import ind of the effect of thi harvest techn on the forest ecosystem we investig ground dwel ant commun dur second success of decidu forest in transylvan roman us spac for tim substitut we expl a chronosequence from clear cut to mat forest year the object was to determin if cut has meas effect on ant commun structure and if ant specy rich diff between success stag we record a tot of specy of ant charact of forest and sev of op landscap ant specy rich was high in clear cut comp to clos canop and old stand numb of ant individ was highest in young ag class and lowest in clos canop ag class ther was no drast chang in specy rich dur the success howev diff in commun composit at diff stag wer record op landscap specy ar abl to rapid colon follow disturb but disappear when the forest sit mat and many forest ant specy ar cap of surv clear cut,new,0.9408697413459558,0.9071111071169988,0.8777284797104299,0.8521475799773777,0.8289966174466293,0.8071265098653513,0.7855554676940597,0.7632111600417474,0.7385344501787906,0.7084758249242583,0.6649341980082379
217,tempconif,Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems: Plant and mammal responses up to 8 years post-harvest,"Green-tree retention systems are an important management component of variable retention harvests in temperate zone coniferous forests. Residual live trees (""legacy trees"") provide mature forest habitat, increase structural diversity, and provide continuity in the regenerating stand. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that, at up to 8 years after harvest, abundance and species diversity of communities of (i) understory plants and (ii) forest-floor small mammals, and (iii) relative habitat use by mule deer (Odocoileits hemionus), will decline with decreasing levels of tree retention. Communities of plants and forest floor small mammals were sampled in replicated clearcut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch cut, and uncut forest sites in mixed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest in southern British Columbia, Canada from 2000 to 2003 (5-8 years post-harvest). Habitat use by mule deer was measured during summer and winter periods each year from 1999 to 2003 in these same sites. Mean total abundance (crown volume index) of herbs, shrubs, mosses, and lichens was similar among sites. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs, and total plants was similar among sites, but total species diversity and structural diversity were significantly lower in the patch cut and uncut forest sites than in the other harvesting treatments. Thus, hypothesis (i) was not supported. Mean total abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals were similar among sites, contrary to hypothesis (ii). However, the southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) declined in abundance as conditions became intolerable for this microtine to persist at numbers > 1/ha in the clearcut and seed-tree sites. The early successional and mycophagist northwestern chipmunk (Tamias amoenus) occurred at 2.3-4.4 times higher abundance on the seed-tree sites than the other sites. Relative habitat use by mule deer was highest in the seed-tree sites during summer periods and highest in the group seed-tree, patch cut and uncut sites in winter periods. The responses to our treatments were species specific, and hence a range of different harvesting systems should be used to maintain plant and mammal diversity across forest landscapes.

However, a comprehensive study analyzing lichen species richness in relation to several management types, extending over different regions and forest stages and including information on site conditions is missing for temperate European forests. In three German regions (Schwabische Alb, Hainich-Dun, Schorfheide-Chorin), the so-called Biodiversity Exploratories, we studied lichen species richness in 631 forest plots of 400 m(2) comprising different management types (unmanaged, selection cutting, deciduous and coniferous age-class forests resulting from clear cutting or shelterwood logging), various stand ages, and site conditions, typical for large parts of temperate Europe. We analyzed how lichen species richness responds to management and habitat variables (standing biomass, cover of deadwood, cover of rocks). We found strong regional differences with highest lichen species richness in the Schwabische Alb, probably driven by regional differences in former air pollution, and in precipitation and habitat variables. Overall, unmanaged forests harbored 22% more threatened lichen species than managed age-class forests. In general, total, corticolous, and threatened lichen species richness did not differ among management types of deciduous forests. However, in the Schwabische-Alb region, deciduous forests had 61% more lichen species than coniferous forests and they had 279% more threatened and 76% more corticolous lichen species. Old deciduous age classes were richer in corticolous lichen species than young ones, while old coniferous age-classes were poorer than young ones. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of stand continuity for conservation. To increase total and threatened lichen species richness we suggest (1) conserving unmanaged forests, (2) promoting silvicultural methods assuring stand continuity, (3) conserving old trees in managed forests, (4) promoting stands of native deciduous tree species instead of coniferous plantations, and (5) increasing the amount of deadwood in forests.",WOS:000315483200052,24,0.8734763940000001,1,rich of lich specy espec of threatened on is promot by man method furth stand continu lich ar a key compon of forest biodivers howev a comprehend study analys lich specy rich in rel to sev man typ extend ov diff reg and forest stag and includ inform on sit condit is miss for temp europ forest in three germ reg schwabische alb hainich dun schorfheide chorin the so cal biodivers expl we study lich specy rich in forest plot of m compr diff man typ unm select cut decidu and con ag class forest result from clear cut or shelterwood log vary stand ag and sit condit typ for larg part of temp europ we analys how lich specy rich respond to man and habit vary stand biomass cov of deadwood cov of rock we found strong reg diff with highest lich specy rich in the schwabische alb prob driv by reg diff in form air pollut and in precipit and habit vary overal unm forest harb mor threatened lich specy than man ag class forest in gen tot corticol and threatened lich specy rich did not diff among man typ of decidu forest howev in the schwabische alb reg decidu forest had mor lich specy than con forest and they had mor threatened and mor corticol lich specy old decidu ag class wer rich in corticol lich specy than young on whil old con ag class wer poor than young on overal our find highlight the import of stand continu for conserv to increas tot and threatened lich specy rich we suggest conserv unm forest promot silvicult method ass stand continu conserv old tre in man forest promot stand of nat decidu tre specy instead of con plant and increas the amount of deadwood in forest,new,0.8675512613247514,0.789004161705645,0.7250421141138018,0.6751795502228064,0.6357370528389317,0.6037743151979184,0.5773528439274057,0.5552226029335048,0.5366649508221952,0.5214623199226279,0.5103421565719247
242,tempconif,The influence of forest management on landscape structure in the cool-temperate forest region of central Japan,"Comprehension of historical changes in landscape and forest management will provide valuable insights into current ecosystems and biodiversity and will support future management decisions and conservation strategies. This study clarified changes in the forest landscape of the cool-temperate forest region of central Japan from 1947 to 1997. We used a geographic information system to reconstruct past forest landscapes at four times (1947,1962, 1975, and 1997) based on interpretation of aerial photographs and landscape metrics calculated using the FRAGSTATS software for spatial pattern analysis. Our results showed that secondary forests, the dominant land use in 1947, decreased greatly in area and became more fragmented, whereas coniferous plantations, which occupied approximately 20% of the total land area in 1947, became the dominant land use (almost 40% of the total land) by 1997. The young coniferous plantations have been established at increasing elevations over time and were mainly created by conversion of secondary forest until 1975. The number of young coniferous plantations and their patch spacing depended on the type of forest management. In the study area, landscape structure changed in response to changes in management of national forests, especially the expansion of afforestation in the 1950s and 1960s and changes in harvesting systems.

251,tempconif,Bat and bird diversity along independent gradients of latitude and tree composition in European forests,"Species assemblages are shaped by local and continental-scale processes that are seldom investigated together, due to the lack of surveys along independent gradients of latitude and habitat types. Our study investigated changes in the effects of forest composition and structure on bat and bird diversity across Europe. We compared the taxonomic and functional diversity of bat and bird assemblages in 209 mature forest plots spread along gradients of forest composition and vertical structure, replicated in 6 regions spanning from the Mediterranean to the boreal biomes. Species richness and functional evenness of both bat and bird communities were affected by the interactions between latitude and forest composition and structure. Bat and bird species richness increased with broadleaved tree cover in temperate and especially in boreal regions but not in the Mediterranean where they increased with conifer abundance. Bat species richness was lower in forests with smaller trees and denser understorey only in northern regions. Bird species richness was not affected by forest structure. Bird functional evenness increased in younger and denser forests.

Covariation between bat and bird abundances also shifted across Europe, from negative in southern forests to positive in northern forests.

261,tempconif,Evaluation of Early Stage Regeneration of Forest Communities Following Natural and Human-caused Disturbances in the Transitional Zone between Temperate and Hemiboreal Forests,"Increasing occurrence of natural and human-caused disturbances threatens sustainability of forest ecosystems, their ability to regenerate and maintain biological diversity. Simultaneously, forest tree species penetrate into abandoned agricultural lands, the areas of which have noticeably increased during the last decades. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the development of regenerating forest tree communities in terms of their growth, competition and species composition in ecosystems affected by various environmental stressors such as windthrows, insect pests, fungal diseases, traditional clearcuttings and agricultural land-use legacy. Lithuania, being located in the transition between the boreal and continental biogeographical regions of Europe, has been considered a favourable research area as both conifer and broadleaved tree stands as well as mixed ones are common here. Research methods used included inventory of vegetation and assessment of quantitative characteristics and sanitary condition of six regenerating forest tree species - Scots pine, Norway spruce, silver birch, pedunculate oak, common ash and black alder - in 7-8 circular research plots (50.24 m(2) each) per study site with total 17 study sites. Results of the study demonstrated that forest regeneration takes place in all disturbed ecosystems, although high variation in space and time was present. Species composition of the regenerating forest ecosystems depends on those prevailing before disturbance, although, pioneer species out-compete the others. The most intensive forest regeneration takes place in those forest ecosystems which were subjected to direct human impact, i.e., clear cuttings, and less intensive regeneration, particularly, that with the target species, takes place on sites cleared of windthrows and where sanitary fellings were applied. Although non-target species depending on habitat type usually prevail on cutting sites, numbers of saplings of target species are sufficient for the regeneration of high productivity forest ecosystems and development of the new ones given the competing species will be controlled by silvicultural measures. The pioneer herbaceous species established on areas affected by disturbances affect regeneration and species composition of the future forest communities.",WOS:000443205200016,10,0.86714657,0,evalu of ear stag reg of forest commun follow nat and hum caus disturb in the transit zon between temp and hemib forest increas occur of nat and hum caus disturb threatens sustain of forest ecosystem their abl to reg and maintain biolog divers simult forest tre specy penet into abandon agricult land the area of which hav not increas dur the last decad the aim of thi study was to evalu and comp the develop of reg forest tre commun in term of their grow competit and specy composit in ecosystem affect by vary environ stressors such as windthrow insect pest fung diseas tradit clearcut and agricult land us leg lithuan being loc in the transit between the bor and contin biogeograph reg of europ has been consid a favo research are as both con and broadleav tre stand as wel as mix on ar common her research method us includ inv of veget and assess of quantit charact and sanit condit of six reg forest tre specy scot pin norway spruce silv birch pedunc oak common ash and black ald in circul research plot m each per study sit with tot study sit result of the study demonst that forest reg tak plac in al disturb ecosystem although high vary in spac and tim was pres specy composit of the reg forest ecosystem depend on thos prevail bef disturb although pion specy out compet the oth the most intend forest reg tak plac in thos forest ecosystem which wer subject to direct hum impact i e clear cut and less intend reg particul that with the target specy tak plac on sit clear of windthrow and wher sanit fel wer apply although non target specy depend on habit typ us prevail on cut sit numb of sapl of target specy ar sufficy for the reg of high produc forest ecosystem and develop of the new on giv the compet specy wil be control by silvicult meas the pion herbac specy est on area affect by disturb affect reg and specy composit of the fut forest commun,new,0.88560990718269,0.8254650520882435,0.7764211020576908,0.7374302570173479,0.7056535386638487,0.6789259199460095,0.6557905452547301,0.6352086287672065,0.6163662781451293,0.5984123185312079,0.5799683147771072
272,tempconif,A continental comparison indicates long-term effects of forest management on understory diversity in coniferous forests,"Promotion of species diversity has become a major goal in forestry. This requires an understanding of the impacts of management disturbance on species diversity relative to natural drivers such as climatic or edaphic conditions on the relevant temporal scales, i.e., centuries. We examined the effects of long-term management disturbance on understory plant diversity in coniferous forests by comparing structure types (ages since disturbance) between regions with comparable abiotic settings but contrasting management history, i.e., management for centuries in central Europe versus the first logging in primary forests in western Canada. We systematically sampled three age classes after disturbance and compared their alpha diversity and species composition. The structure types (age classes) showed similar differences in alpha diversity in both landscapes, while the response of species compositions differed between the two. Fewer late-successional specialists occurred in the European landscape. Within the setting of our study, the structure types, which reflect the time since major forest management disturbance, affected understory species richness and composition at least as strongly as environmental conditions such as climate, soil, and tree layer diversity across the broad altitudinal gradients that we sampled. Our results suggest that forest management affects the diversity of coniferous forests, with management for centuries disadvantaging late-successional specialists.

351,tempconif,Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. I. Diversity of stand structure,"1. Variable retention harvests or 'green-tree retention systems' are important to the management of coniferous forests in the temperate zone. Green-tree retention leaves large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand and provide mature forest habitat that develops sooner than in typical even-aged management by clear-cutting. The seed-tree system is one method of harvesting that leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. Green-tree retention may increase biological diversity and help to enhance functional links among forest structures or ecological processes. 2. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the abundance (e.g. basal area and density of residual trees and amount of vegetation) and diversity (e.g. species diversity and structural diversity of the herb, shrub and tree layers) of various aspects of stand structure will decline with lower levels of tree retention. In particular, abundance and diversity should be greater in sites with green-tree retention than in clear-cut sites. 3. Stand structure attributes were measured from 1996 (immediately after harvesting) to 1999 in replicated clear-cut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. 4. In terms of abundance, clear-cut, single seed-tree and group seed-tree sites had similar mean basal areas of residual trees, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m(2) ha(-1), with significantly higher levels on patch-cut (23.4 m(2) ha(-1)) and uncut forest (39.0 m(2) ha(-1)) sites. Mean densities of residual trees also followed this pattern, ranging from 0.7 to 16.3 stems ha(-1) on the clear-cut to group seed-tree sites, to 769.4 and 2050.0 stems ha(-1) on the patch-cut and uncut forest sites, respectively. However, mean volume (m(3) ha(-1)) of fallen wood (i.e. dead wood or woody debris) was similar among sites, ranging from 116.7 in the single seed-tree to 210.2 in the patch-cut sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean index of total crown volume of herbs, shrubs, mosses and lichens was similar among sites. 5. Mean species richness of herbs, shrubs and total plants was similar among sites. Mean richness of trees in seed-tree sites was similar to that in uncut forest in three of four post-harvest years. The mean species diversity of herbs was similar among sites, but that of shrubs and trees was generally lowest in the patch-cut sites and similar among the other sites. 6. The mean structural richness and diversity of herbs was lowest in the uncut forest and similar at the other sites 3 and 4 years post-harvest. The mean structural richness of trees and total plants in the patch-cut and uncut forest sites had more vegetation layers than the other sites. 7. Our hypothesis was partly supported in terms of basal area and density of residual trees and structural richness of total vegetation layers across a gradient of tree retention from uncut forest to clear-cut sites. However, this pattern was not supported for abundance or diversity of understorey vegetation. Thus, the structural attributes of residual trees and layers of vegetation, but not the abundance, species richness or species diversity of understorey vegetation, lend support to the aims of variable retention harvesting, at least up to 4 years post-harvest.",WOS:000173050100006,4,0.84935233,1,influ of vary ret harvest on forest ecosystem i divers of stand structure vary ret harvest or green tre ret system ar import to the man of con forest in the temp zon green tre ret leav larg liv tre aft harvest i e resid tre to increas structural divers of the reg stand and provid mat forest habit that develop soon than in typ ev ag man by clear cut the see tre system is on method of harvest that leav a few wind firm see tre stand sing or in group to provid see to reg an are nat green tre ret may increas biolog divers and help to enh funct link among forest structures or ecolog process thi study was design to test the hypothes that the abund e g bas are and dens of resid tre and amount of veget and divers e g specy divers and structural divers of the herb shrub and tre lay of vary aspect of stand structure wil declin with low level of tre ret in particul abund and divers should be gre in sit with green tre ret than in clear cut sit stand structure attribut wer meas from immedy aft harvest to in reply clear cut singl see tre group see tre patch cut and uncut forest sit in mix forest of dougla fir pseudotsug menziesi lodgepol pin pin contort in southern brit columb canad in term of abund clear cut singl see tre and group see tre sit had simil mean bas area of resid tre rang from to m ha with sign high level on patch cut m ha and uncut forest m ha sit mean dens of resid tre also follow thi pattern rang from to stem ha on the clear cut to group see tre sit to and stem ha on the patch cut and uncut forest sit respect howev mean volum m ha of fal wood i e dead wood or woody debr was simil among sit rang from in the singl see tre to in the patch cut sit cont to our hypothes the mean index of tot crown volum of herb shrubs moss and lich was simil among sit mean specy rich of herb shrubs and tot plant was simil among sit mean rich of tre in see tre sit was simil to that in uncut forest in three of four post harvest year the mean specy divers of herb was simil among sit but that of shrubs and tre was gen lowest in the patch cut sit and simil among the oth sit the mean structural rich and divers of herb was lowest in the uncut forest and simil at the oth sit and year post harvest the mean structural rich of tre and tot plant in the patch cut and uncut forest sit had mor veget lay than the oth sit our hypothes was part support in term of bas are and dens of resid tre and structural rich of tot veget lay across a grady of tre ret from uncut forest to clear cut sit howev thi pattern was not support for abund or divers of understorey veget thu the structural attribut of resid tre and lay of veget but not the abund specy rich or specy divers of understorey veget lend support to the aim of vary ret harvest at least up to year post harvest,new,0.9033404463350382,0.8432699538099238,0.7917810744163537,0.7485602674112721,0.711203637241576,0.6777509328299307,0.64669800552544,0.6166834125764075,0.5860863178258442,0.5521885716889574,0.5085082593066279

Forests of the region are characterized by a mosaic of secondary deciduous stands of various ages scattered among plantations of conifers. The three different types of change in species richness observed in response to the stand age are as follows: Type I ( butterflies, tube-renting bees and wasps, hoverflies, fruit flies, and longicorn beetles), the species diversity was highest in open areas, just after clear-cutting, decreasing with the stand age; Type II (mushrooms and mites associated with them), older stands showed greater diversity than younger stands; and, Type III ( moths, oribatid mites, collembolas, carabid beetles, and ants), the number of species did not change greatly with the stand age, though ordination analysis revealed that there was variation in species compositions.

712,tempconif,Influence of variable retention harvests on forest ecosystems. II. Diversity and population dynamics of small mammals,"1. Variable retention harvests in temperate coniferous forests provide various intensities and sizes of disturbance across a gradient, from clear-cutting to single-tree harvesting. These 'green-tree retention systems' leave large live trees after harvest (i.e. residual trees) to increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand. It is unclear what effect these harvesting patterns will have on wildlife in general, and small mammals in particular. 2. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that: (i) the abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals will decline with lower levels of tree retention; (ii) the abundance, reproduction and survival of Microtus spp. and southern red-backed vole Clethrionomys gapperi populations will decline and increase, respectively, with the basal area and density of residual trees after harvest; and (iii) habitat heterogeneity generated by variable retention harvesting will limit population size of Microtus, thereby reducing feeding damage to tree seedlings planted on harvested areas. 3. Small mammals were intensively live-trapped from 1996 to 1999 in replicated clearcut, single seed-tree, group seed-tree, patch-cut and uncut forest sites in mixed natural forests of Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii-lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in southern British Columbia, Canada. The seed-tree harvesting system leaves a few wind-firm seed trees standing singly, or in groups, to provide seed to regenerate an area naturally. The patch-cut system harvests timber from small (< 1-ha) units dispersed over a given area of forest. 4. Contrary to hypothesis (i), the mean total abundance of small mammals was similar among sites, and mean species richness and diversity of small mammals was lowest in the uncut forest but similar across the other four treatments. 5. The overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of Microtus spp. was higher on clear-cut (11.3) sites than single seed-tree (6.0), group seed-tree (3.9), patch-cut (1.8) or uncut forest (0.1) sites. Overall mean abundance (ha(-1)) of C. gapperi was similar in uncut forest (16.2) and group seed-tree (10.0) sites, which were both higher than patch-cut (6.4), clear-cut (4.2) or single seed-tree (2.7) sites. 6. The recruitment of new Microtus spp. differed significantly among sites, declining from clear-cut to uncut forest. The recruitment of C. gapperi exhibited the opposite trend. The mean number of successful pregnancies was similar among treatments for Microtus spp. but for C. gapperi was highest in uncut forest, group seed-tree and patch-cut sites. The survival of each vole species was similar across treatment sites. 7. Hypothesis (ii) was supported. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was inversely, and that of C. gapperi positively, related to mean basal area and density of residual trees after harvest. The mean abundance of Microtus spp. was also inversely related to percentage cover and crown volume index of residual trees, and positively related to number of lodgepole pine cones (seeds) in logging debris. 8. In terms of hypothesis (iii), vole feeding damage to planted lodgepole pine seedlings appeared highest in the patch-cut sites during the 1997-98 and 1998-99 overwinter periods, and appeared to have been caused mainly by C. gapperi rather than Microtus spp. 9. The group seed-tree and patch-cut systems achieved both aims of C gapperi persistence and prevention of Microtus outbreaks. These harvesting methods are as good for overall small mammal abundance, species richness and diversity as any other.",WOS:000173050100007,6,0.791716423,1,influ of vary ret harvest on forest ecosystem ii divers and pop dynam of smal mam vary ret harvest in temp con forest provid vary intens and siz of disturb across a grady from clear cut to singl tre harvest thes green tre ret system leav larg liv tre aft harvest i e resid tre to increas structural divers of the reg stand it is unclear what effect thes harvest pattern wil hav on wildl in gen and smal mam in particul thi study was design to test the hypothes that i the abund and divers of forest flo smal mam wil declin with low level of tre ret ii the abund reproduc and surv of microt spp and southern red back vol clethrionom gapper pop wil declin and increas respect with the bas are and dens of resid tre aft harvest and ii habit heterog gen by vary ret harvest wil limit pop siz of microt thereby reduc fee dam to tre seedl plant on harvest area smal mam wer intend liv trap from to in reply clearcut singl see tre group see tre patch cut and uncut forest sit in mix nat forest of dougla fir pseudotsug menziesi lodgepol pin pin contort in southern brit columb canad the see tre harvest system leav a few wind firm see tre stand sing or in group to provid see to reg an are nat the patch cut system harvest timb from smal ha unit dispers ov a giv are of forest cont to hypothes i the mean tot abund of smal mam was simil among sit and mean specy rich and divers of smal mam was lowest in the uncut forest but simil across the oth four tre the overal mean abund ha of microt spp was high on clear cut sit than singl see tre group see tre patch cut or uncut forest sit overal mean abund ha of c gapper was simil in uncut forest and group see tre sit which wer both high than patch cut clear cut or singl see tre sit the recruit of new microt spp diff sign among sit declin from clear cut to uncut forest the recruit of c gapper exhibit the opposit trend the mean numb of success pregn was simil among tre for microt spp but for c gapper was highest in uncut forest group see tre and patch cut sit the surv of each vol specy was simil across tre sit hypothes ii was support the mean abund of microt spp was invers and that of c gapper posit rel to mean bas are and dens of resid tre aft harvest the mean abund of microt spp was also invers rel to perc cov and crown volum index of resid tre and posit rel to numb of lodgepol pin con see in log debr in term of hypothes ii vol fee dam to plant lodgepol pin seedl appear highest in the patch cut sit dur the and overwint period and appear to hav been caus main by c gapper rath than microt spp the group see tre and patch cut system achiev both aim of c gapper persist and prev of microt outbreak thes harvest method ar as good for overal smal mam abund specy rich and divers as any oth,new,0.8441926314205773,0.7732220589562879,0.7183280706443473,0.6760032204362383,0.6422413429891888,0.614416813980957,0.5908906451203445,0.5706038250385763,0.552854212190308,0.5371872077333597,0.5234039087345882
791,tempconif,Effects of logging residue removal on ground-active beetles in temperate forests,"Logging residue (""slash"") left on clear-cuttings may affect the microhabitat complexity, and thereby indirectly the beetle (Coleoptera) populations. In three regions (West, North and East) of south and central Sweden, we studied short-term effects of slash removal on species richness and abundance of beetles, collected by pitfall trapping in 16 clear-cuttings (<1 year old) in coniferous and mixed forests. The sites were managed in two alternative ways, either slash was removed (SR), or slash was left (SL). Overall, the number of morphospecies per trap was significantly higher on SL sites than on SR sites. Species richness differed significantly between the regions, the Western region being the poorest in number of species per trap. Rarefaction plots of species richness in four sites suggested that accumulation rate of species differed between two SR sites but rates were similar for two SL sites. Microhabitat structure was measured by aboveground height of slash heaps. Slash height was positively correlated with the number of sticks in slash heap and fractal dimension, respectively. There was a positive relationship between the number of individuals per trap and slash height in SR sites in the Western and Eastern regions, but not in the Northern one. We concluded that extensive slash removal leads to impoverish species richness of Coleoptera. at a local scale. Slash heaps left on site may provide important refuges for ground-active beetles. Moreover, our results supported the general theory that microhabitat structure affects arthropod abundance and diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

871,tempconif,Factors driving structure of natural and anthropogenic forest edges from temperate to boreal ecosystems,"QuestionsWhat factors control broad-scale variation in edge length and three-dimensional boundary structure for a large region extending across two biomes? What is the difference in structure between natural and anthropogenic edges? LocationTemperate and boreal forests across all of Sweden, spanning latitudes 55-69 degrees N. MethodsWe sampled more than 2000 forest edges using line intersect sampling in a monitoring programme (National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden). We compared edge length, ecosystem attributes (width of adjacent ecosystem, canopy cover, canopy height, patch contrast in canopy height, forest type) and boundary attributes (profile, abruptness, shape) of natural edges (lakeshore, wetland) with anthropogenic edges (clear-cut, agricultural, linear disturbance) in five regions. ResultsAnthropogenic edges were nearly twice as abundant as natural edges. Length of anthropogenic edges was largest in southern regions, while the abundance of natural edges increased towards the north. Edge types displayed unique spectrums of boundary structures, but abrupt edges dominated, constituting 72% of edge length. Anthropogenic edges were more abrupt than natural edges; wetland edges had the most gradual and sinuous boundaries. Canopy cover, canopy height, patch contrast and forest type depended on region, whereas overall boundary abruptness and shape showed no regional pattern. Patch contrast was related to temperature sum (degree days5 degrees C), suggesting that regional variability can be predicted from climate-controlled forest productivity.

90,tempconif,Lessons from native spruce forests in Alaska: managing Sitka spruce plantations worldwide to benefit biodiversity and ecosystem services,"There is increasing interest worldwide in managing forests to maintain or improve biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services and assure long-term sustainability of forest resources. An important goal of forest management is to increase stand diversity, provide wildlife habitat and improve forest species diversity. We synthesize results from natural spruce forests in southeast Alaska and suggest strategies for managing Sitka spruce plantations in other parts of the world to benefit biodiversity and enhance a variety of forest ecosystem services. We also discuss the roles of fungi in increasing both biological and structural diversity in Sitka spruce forests. New silvicultural systems that use partial cutting in older spruce forests could alleviate some of the problems associated with conventional even-aged management and increase both stand structural diversity and biodiversity. We found that mixed red alder-conifer stands in Alaska provided more heterogeneous structures than the pure conifer stands that typically develop after clear cutting. Well-planned silvicultural systems that include broad leaved species such as alder or birch could provide trees for timber production, improve wildlife habitat and a variety of other ecosystem services that are often compromised in young pure conifer forests.",WOS:000335912700002,15,0.765590123,0,lesson from nat spruce forest in alask man sitk spruce plant worldwid to benefit biodivers and ecosystem serv ther is increas interest worldwid in man forest to maintain or improv biodivers enh ecosystem serv and ass long term sustain of forest resourc an import goal of forest man is to increas stand divers provid wildl habit and improv forest specy divers we synthes result from nat spruce forest in southeast alask and suggest strategies for man sitk spruce plant in oth part of the world to benefit biodivers and enh a vary of forest ecosystem serv we also discuss the rol of fung in increas both biolog and structural divers in sitk spruce forest new silvicult system that us part cut in old spruce forest could allevy som of the problem assocy with conv ev ag man and increas both stand structural divers and biodivers we found that mix red ald con stand in alask provid mor heterog structures than the pur con stand that typ develop aft clear cut wel plan silvicult system that includ broad leav specy such as ald or birch could provid tre for timb produc improv wildl habit and a vary of oth ecosystem serv that ar oft comprom in young pur con forest,new,0.7862862909786916,0.7348003264774206,0.7004881151928051,0.6775762006860917,0.6622047546858204,0.6522702663554646,0.6467716970252556,0.6454960227566413,0.6490963267856846,0.6597975217091971,0.6841227204555296

Here we investigated differences in understory vegetation by comparing naturally regenerated deciduous forests (NR) and reforested spruce plantations (SP) aged 20-40 years on 12 similar clear-cuts of subalpine old-growth spruce-fir forests from the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We found that 283 of the 334 vascular plant species recorded were present in NR plots, while only 264 species occurred in SP plots. This was consistent with richer species, higher cover, and stem (or shoot) density of tree seedlings, shrubs, and ferns in the NR plots than in the SP plots. Moreover, understory plant diversity was limited under dense canopy cover, which occurred more frequently in the SP plots. Our findings implied that natural deciduous tree regeneration could better preserve understory vegetation and biodiversity than spruce reforestation after clear-cutting. This result further informed practices to reduce tree canopy cover for spruce plantations or to integrate natural regeneration and reforestation for clear-cuts in order to promote understory vegetation and species diversity conservation.",WOS:000336905000008,2,0.7527681540000001,1,underst structure and vascul plant divers in nat reg decidu forest and spruce plant on simil clear cut imply for forest reg strategy select the act effect of nat reg on underst veget and divers on clear cut forestland in contrast to con reforest is stil controvers her we investig diff in underst veget by comp nat reg decidu forest nr and reforest spruce plant sp ag year on simil clear cut of subalpin old grow spruce fir forest from the eastern tibet plateau we found that of the vascul plant specy record wer pres in nr plot whil on specy occur in sp plot thi was consist with rich specy high cov and stem or shoot dens of tre seedl shrubs and fern in the nr plot than in the sp plot moreov underst plant divers was limit und dens canop cov which occur mor frequ in the sp plot our find imply that nat decidu tre reg could bet preserv underst veget and biodivers than spruce reforest aft clear cut thi result furth inform pract to reduc tre canop cov for spruce plant or to integr nat reg and reforest for clear cut in ord to promot underst veget and specy divers conserv,new,0.8378207648875154,0.7690330970706093,0.7191891774169724,0.6819283162180304,0.6525935888545426,0.6285479724893918,0.6082595056494331,0.5907864778986852,0.5755287118949026,0.5621620952053784,0.550649877017343

The species richness of longicorns, which were collected with Malaise traps, was the highest in young stands, decreasing with the age of the stand for both broad-leaved and conifer stands. A canonical correspondence analysis divided the 18 plots into three groups based on longicorn assemblages and environmental variables. These three groups consisted of (1) very young (1-4 years old) stands after clear-cutting or plantation; (2) 12- to over 100 year-old broad-leaved stands; (3) 7- to 76-year-old conifer stands. The species richness of the longicorns was the highest in the young stands followed, in order of decreasing species richness, by broad-leaved stands and conifer stands. Possible causes of the high species richness in young stands include large amounts of coarse wood debris and flowers, which are resources for oviposition and nutrition for adults, respectively. The lower longicorn diversity in conifer stands than in broad-leaved stands may be due to the lower diversity of trees available as host plants in the former. Almost all species that occurred in conifer stands were also collected in young and/or broad-leaved stands, but the reverse was not true, suggesting that conifer plantations cannot replace broad-leaved stands in terms of longicorn biodiversity. We argue that an extensive conversion of broad-leaved forests into conifer plantations will lead to an impoverishment of the longicorn fauna, which may result in the degradation of ecosystem functions possibly carried out by them.",WOS:000246179100003,12,0.659510866,1,degrad of longicorn beetl coleopter cerambycida disteniida faun caus by convert from broad leav to man mad con stand of cryptomer japonic taxodiacea in cent jap we study the specy rich and assembl of longicorn beetl coleopter cerambycida disteniida in ten second broad leav stand and eight plant stand of japanes ced cryptomer japonic of vary ag aft clear cut or plant in ibarak cent jap the specy rich of longicorn which wer collect with mala trap was the highest in young stand decreas with the ag of the stand for both broad leav and con stand a canon correspond analys divid the plot into three group bas on longicorn assembl and environ vary thes three group consist of very young year old stand aft clear cut or plant to ov year old broad leav stand to year old con stand the specy rich of the longicorn was the highest in the young stand follow in ord of decreas specy rich by broad leav stand and con stand poss caus of the high specy rich in young stand includ larg amount of coars wood debr and flow which ar resourc for oviposit and nutrit for adult respect the low longicorn divers in con stand than in broad leav stand may be due to the low divers of tre avail as host plant in the form almost al specy that occur in con stand wer also collect in young and or broad leav stand but the revers was not tru suggest that con plant cannot replac broad leav stand in term of longicorn biodivers we argu that an extend convert of broad leav forest into con plant wil lead to an impov of the longicorn faun which may result in the degrad of ecosystem funct poss carry out by them,new,0.7460355339299446,0.6961595943997028,0.6650354912527546,0.6446914019621264,0.6310995078620143,0.6223809315698761,0.6177506588575145,0.6171819462749554,0.6214991009934693,0.6332086015934811,0.6594167445195436

The objective of this study was to examine relationships among ECM fungal community measures, local soil nutrients, and stand age along a chronosequence of mixed forest stands that were similar in vegetation composition and site quality. Six combinations of age class (5-, 26-, 65-, and 100-year-old) and stand initiation type (wildfire and clearcut) were replicated on four sites, each representing critical seral stages of stand development in Interior Cedar-Hemlock (ICH) forests of southern British Columbia. We found significant relationships between ECM fungal diversity and both available and organic P; available P was also positively correlated with the abundance of two ECM taxa (Rhizopogon vinicolor group and Cenoccocum geophilum). By contrast, ECM fungal diversity varied unpredictably with total and mineralizable N or C to N ratio. We also found that soil C, N, available P, and forest floor depth did not exhibit strong patterns across stand ages. Overall, ECM fungal community structure was more strongly influenced by stand age than specific soil nutrients, but better correlations with soil nutrients may occur at broader spatial scales covering a wider range of site qualities.",WOS:000266486000003,14,0.64468364,1,influ of soil nutry on ectomycorrh commun in a chronosequence of mix temp forest many fact assocy with forest ar collect respons for control ectomycorrh ecm fung commun structure includ plant specy composit forest structure stand ag and soil nutry the object of thi study was to examin rel among ecm fung commun meas loc soil nutry and stand ag along a chronosequence of mix forest stand that wer simil in veget composit and sit qual six combin of ag class and year old and stand in typ wildfir and clearcut wer reply on four sit each repres crit ser stag of stand develop in intery ced hemlock ich forest of southern brit columb we found sign rel between ecm fung divers and both avail and org p avail p was also posit correl with the abund of two ecm tax rhizopogon vinicol group and cenoccoc geophil by contrast ecm fung divers vary unpredict with tot and min n or c to n ratio we also found that soil c n avail p and forest flo dep did not exhibit strong pattern across stand ag overal ecm fung commun structure was mor strongly influ by stand ag than spec soil nutry but bet correl with soil nutry may occ at broad spat scal cov a wid rang of sit qual,new,0.6965281829423822,0.6441038237157105,0.6127227008764352,0.5933493363396072,0.5814204920849527,0.574822035514486,0.5726554819008788,0.5748518656676792,0.5822381437539208,0.5973255161863948,0.6273085346436281

The seed bank consisted of 36-plant species altogether, of which 14 were not represented in the vegetation. There were 42 phanerogam species in the forest understory, which were not represented in the seed bank.

Although a few stand-level studies have been conducted, a broad-scale study is needed to understand the general tendency of vegetation recovery and to obtain information for the management of such extensively distributed abandoned clearcut sites. This study is a province-level study that aims to interpret the patterns and factors in early-stage vegetation recovery at abandoned plantation clearcut sites. We also discuss the potential indicators that may determine whether a certain site recovers towards evergreen broad-leaved forest consisting of Castanopsis cuspidata and Quercus glauca or towards deciduous broad-leaved forest comprising Q. serrata and Q. acutissima. A cluster analysis revealed that five types of vegetation (evergreen trees, evergreen trees-deciduous pioneer shrubs, pioneer species, deciduous trees, and deciduous shrubs) were observed from an early stage of succession. The first two vegetation types were considered to recover successfully to the target vegetation of evergreen broad-leaved forest, but the remaining three vegetation types did not show any tendency to recover to the target vegetations. According to the results of the detrended correspondence analysis, a smaller size of the abandoned site with adjacent evergreen broad-leaved forest and a longer time after clearcutting were identified as factors that enhance the invasion of evergreen tree species; these factors are also useful to predict the future successional tendency. In conjunction with these factors, the existence of regeneration sources (i.e., stumps) that allow sprouting appeared to be an important indicator for predicting the early-stage vegetation recovery.",WOS:000266160200002,17,0.575681246,0,pattern and fact in ear stag veget recovery at abandon plant clearcut sit in oit jap poss ind for evalu veget stat the abandon of sit aft clearcut plant is increas rapid in jap although a few stand level study hav been conduc a broad scal study is nee to understand the gen tend of veget recovery and to obtain inform for the man of such extend distribut abandon clearcut sit thi study is a provint level study that aim to interpret the pattern and fact in ear stag veget recovery at abandon plant clearcut sit we also discuss the pot ind that may determin wheth a certain sit recov toward evergreen broad leav forest consist of castanops cuspidat and querc glauc or toward decidu broad leav forest compr q serrat and q acutissim a clust analys rev that fiv typ of veget evergreen tre evergreen tre decidu pion shrubs pion specy decidu tre and decidu shrubs wer observ from an ear stag of success the first two veget typ wer consid to recov success to the target veget of evergreen broad leav forest but the remain three veget typ did not show any tend to recov to the target veget accord to the result of the detrend correspond analys a smal siz of the abandon sit with adjac evergreen broad leav forest and a long tim aft clearcut wer ident as fact that enh the invas of evergreen tre specy thes fact ar also us to predict the fut success tend in conjunct with thes fact the ex of reg sourc i e stump that allow sprouting appear to be an import ind for predict the ear stag veget recovery,new,0.5915148785427491,0.5052838193947174,0.45531519067739357,0.42536386111376634,0.4072007080507702,0.39710116127354644,0.39354496037927267,0.39646571320231644,0.40739942491448955,0.431054837711855,0.48134807302713495
321,tempconif,Shift in fungal communities and associated enzyme activities along an age gradient of managed Pinus sylvestris stands,"Forestry reshapes ecosystems with respect to tree age structure, soil properties and vegetation composition. These changes are likely to be paralleled by shifts in microbial community composition with potential feedbacks on ecosystem functioning. Here, we assessed fungal communities across a chronosequence of managed Pinus sylvestris stands and investigated correlations between taxonomic composition and extracellular enzyme activities. Not surprisingly, clear-cutting had a negative effect on ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance and diversity. In contrast, clear-cutting favoured proliferation of saprotrophic fungi correlated with enzymes involved in holocellulose decomposition. During stand development, the re-establishing ectomycorrhizal fungal community shifted in composition from dominance by Atheliaceae in younger stands to Cortinarius and Russula species in older stands. Late successional ectomycorrhizal taxa correlated with enzymes involved in mobilisation of nutrients from organic matter, indicating intensified nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that maintenance of functional diversity in the ectomycorrhizal fungal community may sustain long-term forest production by retaining a capacity for symbiosis-driven recycling of organic nutrient pools.",WOS:000397281200005,3,0.5147034079999999,1,shift in fung commun and assocy enzym act along an ag grady of man pin sylvest stand forestry reshap ecosystem with respect to tre ag structure soil property and veget composit thes chang ar lik to be parallel by shift in microb commun composit with pot feedback on ecosystem funct her we assess fung commun across a chronosequence of man pin sylvest stand and investig correl between taxonom composit and extracellul enzym act not surpr clear cut had a neg effect on ectomycorrh fung abund and divers in contrast clear cut favo prol of saprotroph fung correl with enzym involv in holocellulos decomposit dur stand develop the re est ectomycorrh fung commun shift in composit from domin by atheliacea in young stand to cortinari and russul specy in old stand lat success ectomycorrh tax correl with enzym involv in mobl of nutry from org mat ind intens nutry limit our result suggest that maint of funct divers in the ectomycorrh fung commun may sustain long term forest produc by retain a capac for symbios driv recyc of org nutry pool,new,0.5855508941914437,0.5361316614735873,0.5090823012203975,0.49373062771596876,0.48562634461184323,0.48297007164032385,0.4852070728228528,0.49274735866352654,0.5072188876353303,0.5328629780764126,0.5812937124091881
139,tempgrass,Tree monocultures in a biodiversity hotspot: Impact of pine plantations on mammal and bird assemblages in the Atlantic Forest,"Forest plantations of fast-growing exotic species constitute an important economic activity in tropical and temperate regions of developing countries. Large areas of native forests and grasslands are being turned into tree plantations without assessing their impacts on natural communities. We evaluated the effects of replacing native forests by non-native pine (Pinus taeda) plantations on the diversity and composition of assemblages of terrestrial mammals and ground-dwelling and understory birds, in a forest productive landscape of the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina. Camera-trap stations were deployed in three different ""environments"": 53 in a continuous forest, 69 in forest fragments, and 62 in tree plantations. The evaluation focused on the effect of the environment, the structural complexity of the vegetation, the cost-distance (distance weighted by connectivity) to the continuous forest, the percentage of native forest within different radii, and the cost of human access (as a proxy for hunting pressure) on both mean species richness per station and species composition. Alpha diversity of the assemblages of each environment was estimated using Hill numbers (effective number of species): (q(0) = richness, q(1) = number of common species and q(2) = number of dominant species. Changes in community composition were evaluated by comparing the assemblages of the three environments using three similarity indices: Sorensen (q(0) = similarity in species identity), Horn (q(1) = similarity in common species), and Morisita-Horn (q(2) = similarity in dominant species). For mammals and birds, richness was significantly higher in forest stations (both continuous and fragmented) than in those located in plantations. For both taxa, it also decreased with the distance to the continuous forest (but with a negative quadratic term in birds). Tree plantation stands contained biased and impoverished subsets of the original assemblages. Mammal composition was affected by the environment, the distance to the continuous forest, the proportion of native forest in the landscape, and human access. The bird assemblages of plantations were seriously affected, and their composition was also influenced by changes in vegetation structure. Alternative management practices (e.g. pruning, thinning) and landscape features can partially mitigate the negative effect of tree plantations on mammal and bird assemblages. Large areas of forest that function as population sources and forest fragments immersed in the matrix of plantations are strictly necessary to preserve the original native mammal and bird assemblages in the productive landscape.

218,tempgrass,Bird assemblages in a mixed woodland-farmland landscape: The conservation value of silviculture-dependant open areas in plantation forest,"Although considered by some as a less ""ecologically suitable"" forestry model than ""near-natural"" stand management, even-aged plantation forest management, with regeneration procedure involving clearcutting, creates temporary habitat for many early-successional birds. The present study addresses the question of the conservation value for birds of clearcutting-related open areas in European temperate forest, in the context of a mixed woodland-farmland landscape. The point count technique was used to census the breeding birds on 300 sampling plots, distributed in the eight main habitat types of the Ardenne region (southern Belgium), including agricultural land, edge habitats, closed forest habitats and open areas in forest. Most of these open areas in forest derive from clearcutting practices, rapidly planted with young Norway Spruce (Picea abies). We quantified the conservation value of a given habitat type by using a ""conservation value index"", integrating the frequency of occurrence of each species in the considered habitat and their conservation status in Europe or in southern Belgium. Both conservation value index and species richness were higher for edge habitats and open areas in forest, compared to forest interior and agricultural land. Detrended Correspondence Analysis of the plot species lists showed that bird assemblages from open area in forest are not intermediate between forest and agricultural open land, as opposed to external edge habitats. Hence, open areas in forest do not contain bird assemblages composed of forest species mixed with colonizing agricultural species but rather shelter specific bird assemblages. An Indicator Species analysis further emphasized this specificity and identified seven species, which, in the Ardenne context, form a group of species specific to open areas in forest. Due to major changes of land use in the Ardenne during the 20th century, which leads to a tremendous decrease of moor, heath and fallow land areas, clearcut openings in the plantation forest progressively gained high conservation value at the regional scale. Further studies about habitat requirement of the conservation interest species inhabiting these open areas is needed, including a better understanding of how early-successional species react to forest planning. If plantation forestry evolves to an uneven-aged and more permanently closed forest, then other options, including semi-natural habitat restoration, are urgently required to save early-successional bird communities.

315,tempgrass,"Bird community diversity in three habitat types in an ecological corridor in the Atlantic Forest of Misiones province, Argentina","The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world due to habitat fragmentation. Restoration and connectivity of forest fragments are crucial to maintain viable populations of forest-dependent species. During winter and summer, we studied the bird diversity, its components and composition (including specialist and generalist species) in three different vegetation types: mature forest (MF), secondary forest (SF) and grassland (G) of an ecological corridor in Misiones, Argentina. We determined the influence of alpha diversity (of each habitat) and beta diversity (species turnover between habitats) on gamma diversity (regional diversity in the corridor), to provide conservation management recommendations. MF showed the highest values of bird diversity, richness, evenness and abundance, followed by SF and G, in both seasons. Only MF showed a possible seasonal variation in diversity and richness. The species composition of SF was similar to MF. However, G, where pasture specialist and edge species were the most common species recorded (70% of its avifauna), had very low similarity to MF, where the most forest specialist species were found (53%). As alpha diversities were higher than beta values, the bird diversity in the studied corridor mainly resulted from the diversity in each vegetation type, in both studied seasons. We therefore recommend preservation of both MF and recovering SF due to their high bird diversity and the presence of forest-dependent, threatened and endemic bird species.

46,tempgrass,Effects of creation of open vegetation in abandoned terraced paddy fields on carabid beetle assemblages in temperate Japan,"Many paddy fields in the mountainous rural areas of Japan have been abandoned since the 1960s, and forests have regenerated on these sites. In a mountainous area on Sado Island, a large number of abandoned paddies were converted into wetlands and open terrestrial vegetation. In this study, we used pitfall traps to examine the effects of the creation of open vegetation on carabid beetle assemblages by investigating 14 sites spanning five vegetation types: six sites in secondary forests (three coppice forests and three 40-year-old regenerating forests on abandoned paddies), three each in clear-cuts and paddy levees, and two in grasslands. The 14 study sites were clearly separated into two groups different in the species composition of carabid beetles: secondary forest and grassland-levee groups. The species composition of two clear-cut sites was similar to that of secondary forests, whereas that of the remaining one clear-cut site was similar to that of grasslands. Analyses of species responses showed various habitat preferences, e.g., for only coppice forests, for two types of secondary forests, for secondary forests and clear-cuts, for clear-cuts and grasslands, and for grasslands or levees, or no clear preference. There were no characteristic species in the regenerating forests. These results suggest that the 40-year-old regenerating forests may sustain only a limited subset of the carabid fauna found in coppice forests and that the creation of open vegetation in the abandoned paddies enhances carabid diversity at the landscape level by raising diversity among the different vegetation types.",WOS:000325352800002,2,0.908849798,1,effect of cre of op veget in abandon terrac paddy field on carabid beetl assembl in temp jap many paddy field in the mountain rur area of jap hav been abandon sint the s and forest hav reg on thes sit in a mountain are on sado island a larg numb of abandon paddy wer convert into wetland and op terrest veget in thi study we us pitfal trap to examin the effect of the cre of op veget on carabid beetl assembl by investig sit span fiv veget typ six sit in second forest three cop forest and three year old reg forest on abandon paddy three each in clear cut and paddy lev and two in grassland the study sit wer clear sep into two group diff in the specy composit of carabid beetl second forest and grassland lev group the specy composit of two clear cut sit was simil to that of second forest wherea that of the remain on clear cut sit was simil to that of grassland analys of specy respons show vary habit pref e g for on cop forest for two typ of second forest for second forest and clear cut for clear cut and grassland and for grassland or lev or no clear pref ther wer no charact specy in the reg forest thes result suggest that the year old reg forest may sustain on a limit subset of the carabid faun found in cop forest and that the cre of op veget in the abandon paddy enh carabid divers at the landscap level by rais divers among the diff veget typ,new,0.947977135958421,0.9120307530655902,0.8793566970014014,0.8507217785795219,0.8249556721579939,0.8008924220284138,0.7774627730000947,0.753537411799705,0.7275071320527924,0.6962959213614534,0.6518716890592016
513,tempgrass,"Butterfly assemblages in a traditional agricultural landscape: importance of secondary forests for conserving diversity, life history specialists and endemics","Satoyama, the traditional agricultural landscape in Japan, has drawn much attention from the viewpoint of biodiversity conservation. It is composed of diverse vegetation types, including secondary forests, paddy fields and cultivated fields in a narrow area (ca. 1 km(2)). To clarify the characteristics of butterfly assemblage and the relative contribution of each vegetation type to butterfly diversity and endemism in satoyama, we conducted a line-transect survey along a 1.1-km route with five sections (two forest interior, one interior-edge, one edge-openland and one openland). Life history features (voltinism, host plant range and host plant type) and endemism of butterflies were discussed in relation to their abundance and vegetation association. Fifty-one species and 856 individuals were recorded. Species richness was highest in the two sections with edges, 32 and 36 species, respectively. Analysis of vegetation association of each butterfly species showed that 16 species were forest interior species, 24 forest edge species and 11 openland species, indicating that vegetation diversity enhanced butterfly diversity. However, the point is that forest interior and edge species contained many specialists sensitive to human impact (univoltine and/or oligophagous species) and many species within temperate East Asia including all endemic species. In contrast, most openland species were generalists (multivoltine and/or polyphagous species) feeding on herbs/grasses with the widest geographic range. Since secondary forests kept more butterfly diversity and specialists than openlands, and had all endemic species, they must be maintained without over fragmentation in order to avoid loss of specialists and endemics in satoyama.",WOS:000246802700013,62,0.901577299,1,butterf assembl in a tradit agricult landscap import of second forest for conserv divers lif hist spec and endem satoyam the tradit agricult landscap in jap has drawn much at from the viewpoint of biodivers conserv it is compos of divers veget typ includ second forest paddy field and cult field in a narrow are ca km to clar the charact of butterf assembl and the rel contribut of each veget typ to butterf divers and endem in satoyam we conduc a lin transect survey along a km rout with fiv sect two forest intery on intery edg on edg openland and on openland lif hist feat voltin host plant rang and host plant typ and endem of butterf wer discuss in rel to their abund and veget assocy fifty on specy and individ wer record specy rich was highest in the two sect with edg and specy respect analys of veget assocy of each butterf specy show that specy wer forest intery specy forest edg specy and openland specy ind that veget divers enh butterf divers howev the point is that forest intery and edg specy contain many spec sensit to hum impact univoltin and or oligoph specy and many specy within temp east as includ al endem specy in contrast most openland specy wer gen multivoltin and or polyph specy fee on herb grass with the widest geograph rang sint second forest kept mor butterf divers and spec than openland and had al endem specy they must be maintain without ov frag in ord to avoid loss of spec and endem in satoyam,new,0.9114492548783508,0.8658947452538884,0.8286974169165628,0.7991360381494446,0.7749244996937024,0.7543685355119891,0.7362989611351737,0.7198741603319766,0.7043381203060678,0.6887512147301202,0.6713481867135377
611,tempgrass,Effects of land management on the abundance and richness of spiders (Araneae): A meta-analysis,"Human land use, through forest management and conversion of natural habitats into agroecosystems, has often resulted in loss of biodiversity. Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

713,tempgrass,Biophysical and human influences on plant species richness in grasslands: Comparing variegated landscapes in subtropical and temperate regions,"A survey of grassy woodlands in the Queensland subtropics was conducted, recording herbaceous species richness at 212 sites on three properties (2756 ha). A range of habitats typical of cattle grazing enterprises was sampled and site variables included lithology, slope position, tree density, soil disturbance, soil enrichment and grazing. Results were compared with a previously published survey of temperate grasslands. Lithology, slope position and tree density had relatively minor effects on plant species richness, although in both surveys there was some evidence of lower species richness on the more fertile substrates. Soil disturbance and soil enrichment significantly reduced the richness of native species in both surveys, while exotic species were insensitive (subtropics) or increased (temperate) with disturbance. Rare native species were highly sensitive to disturbances, including grazing, in the temperate study. Although some trends were similar for rare species in the subtropics, the results were not significant and there were complex interactions between grazing, lithology and slope position. Grazing did not have a negative effect on native species richness, except in the closely grazed patches within pastures, and then only on the most intensively developed property. At the scale recorded (30 m(2)), the native pastures, roadsides and stock routes sampled in the subtropics appear to be among the most species-rich grasslands ever reported, both nationally and globally. Native species richness was approximately 50% higher than the temperate survey figures across all the comparable habitats.

811,tempgrass,Responses of grassland species richness to local and landscape factors depend on spatial scale and habitat specialization,"Questions: To what extent is species richness in semi-natural grasslands related to local environmental factors and (present/ past) surrounding landscape structure? Do responses of species richness depend on degree of habitat specialization (specialists vs generalists) and/ or scale of the study? Location: O "" land, Sweden. Methods: Richness of herbaceous vascular plants (subdivided into richness of grassland specialists and generalists) was recorded within 50 9 50 cm plots and 0.1-4.8 ha grassland polygons. Generalized linearmodels and hierarchical partitioning were used to identify local factors (habitat area and heterogeneity, grazing intensity, habitat continuity) and landscape factors (proportion of surrounding grassland in 2004, 1938 and 1800, and landscape diversity in 2004) associated with the richness estimates. Results: At the polygon scale, both specialist and generalist richness was positively associated with local habitat area and heterogeneity and, independently of area and heterogeneity, with grazing intensity, habitat continuity and amount of surrounding grassland in 1800. At the plot scale, specialist species richness was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity, amount of surrounding grassland in 2004 and landscape diversity. Plot-scale generalist richness was negatively associated with surrounding grassland in 1938 and positively associated with local grazing intensity. Conclusions: Because both habitat specialization and study scale influence conclusions about relationships between species richness and local and landscape factors, the study highlights the need to consider species diversity at multiple spatial scales when making decisions about grassland management. Large-scale (polygon) species richness is influenced by immigration processes, with both specialists and generalists accumulating in old grasslands over centuries of grazing management. Habitat heterogeneity increased specialist species richness at both scales, suggesting that management policies should favour maintenance of a heterogeneous mosaic of open areas, trees and shrubs in temperate grazed grasslands. Although grassland specialists are sensitive to grassland isolation, in extensively managed landscapes with high landscape diversity input of grassland species from the landscape matrix may buffer negative effects of habitat fragmentation on grassland communities.",WOS:000298919100006,89,0.8945667140000001,1,respons of grassland specy rich to loc and landscap fact depend on spat scal and habit spec quest to what ext is specy rich in sem nat grassland rel to loc environ fact and pres past surround landscap structure do respons of specy rich depend on degr of habit spec spec vs gen and or scal of the study loc o land swed method rich of herbac vascul plant subdivid into rich of grassland spec and gen was record within cm plot and ha grassland polygon gen linearmodel and hierarch partit wer us to ident loc fact habit are and heterog graz intens habit continu and landscap fact proport of surround grassland in and and landscap divers in assocy with the rich estim result at the polygon scal both spec and gen rich was posit assocy with loc habit are and heterog and independ of are and heterog with graz intens habit continu and amount of surround grassland in at the plot scal spec specy rich was posit assocy with habit heterog amount of surround grassland in and landscap divers plot scal gen rich was neg assocy with surround grassland in and posit assocy with loc graz intens conclud becaus both habit spec and study scal influ conclud about rel between specy rich and loc and landscap fact the study highlight the nee to consid specy divers at multipl spat scal when mak decid about grassland man larg scal polygon specy rich is influ by immigr process with both spec and gen accum in old grassland ov century of graz man habit heterog increas spec specy rich at both scal suggest that man policy should favo maint of a heterog mosa of op area tre and shrubs in temp graz grassland although grassland spec ar sensit to grassland isol in extend man landscap with high landscap divers input of grassland specy from the landscap matrix may buff neg effect of habit frag on grassland commun,new,0.9228907794385278,0.8714224723358485,0.8247959865654331,0.7849628044764584,0.7505628853962878,0.7200746452444857,0.6921969629231723,0.6657751987736642,0.6395170822944883,0.611384730871794,0.5767909869812333
99,tempgrass,"Bats of the Chilean temperate rainforest: patterns of landscape use in a mosaic of native forests, eucalyptus plantations and grasslands within a South American biodiversity hotspot","Forestry plantations represent about 4 % of the global land cover and demand for wood is steadily increasing worldwide. Impacts of forest plantations on biodiversity are controversial; forest plantations could positively influence biodiversity by producing a buffer zone between native forests and agriculture, while replacement of native forests with plantations could reduce biodiversity. Chile is one of the main producers of wood worldwide, and production is largely based on intensively managed monocultures of exotic tree species. Only a few studies have looked at the effects of forestry plantations on biodiversity in Chile, mainly focusing on pine plantations. The aim of this study was to characterize habitat use and richness of bats between native forests, eucalyptus plantations and grasslands in a biodiversity hotspot in southern Chile to determine how land use affects an important mammalian taxa. We found no difference in use or richness of bats in eucalyptus plantations versus native forests.

1113,tempgrass,Native and non-native herbaceous species dependence on tree cover in grazing systems from northern Chilean Patagonia,"Grazing systems that combine grasslands and woodlands represent changes in tree cover that influences herbaceous vegetation and may threaten the native forest flora. We studied these influences in Chilean Patagonia where recent colonization resulted in the fragmentation of the lenga (Nothofagus pumilio) forests leading to a mosaic-type landscape. The herbaceous vegetation, transmitted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and other forest structure characteristics were sampled in 15 (20 m x 20 m) plots differing in tree cover for two years, while considering the relative position (below or beyond) of tree crowns. Herbaceous species were classified as forest, non-forest, and forest indifferent species according to their preference, rejection or indifference to the forest environment. Species richness decreased with increasing PAR but this was dependent on the response of non-natives. Species composition varied gradually from open grasslands to dense forests, according to transmitted PAR values. Native species were associated to either forests or open areas, but the number of native species did not vary along the tree cover gradient (beyond tree crowns) or even decreased (below tree crowns). Non-native species dominated in the open grasslands and beyond tree crowns and its richness increased with transmitted PAR. The occurrence of grasslands and dense forests within this grazing system is shown to promote higher species richness. Management will consider that dense forest patches are necessary for maintaining a high diversity of native species, since isolated trees or low wooded areas do not guarantee the persistence of all native species associated to the original forests.

1210,tempgrass,Ecology of pollination in a tropical Venezuelan savanna,"Pollination modes ecology of a total of 164 plant species was evaluated according to habitats and plant life forms in the Venezuelan Central Plain. Frequency distribution of nine pollination modes showed that, at the community level bee pollination (38.6%) was dominant. Butterfly (13.9%), fly (12.7%), and wasp (10.8%) pollination were the second most frequent. Moth (6.2%) and wind (10.4%) pollination occurred with similar frequency, and the least common were bird (3.1%), beetle (2.3%) and bat (1.9%) pollination. There was a significant interaction effect indicating that pollination mode was affected by the type of habitat. Bee pollination was the most common pollination mode in all habitats with butterfly, fly and wasp pollination being secondary for forest and forest-savanna transition; and butterfly, wasp, wind and fly pollination being secondary for savanna. Wind, butterfly and fly pollination were found in disturbed areas as secondary pollination modes. Pollination modes were significantly associated and affected by life forms. Bee pollination was dominant in all life forms with wasp, butterfly and fly pollination being the secondary for trees, shrubs, and lianas; and butterfly and wind pollination being the secondary for herbaceous species. The number of pollination modes (richness) among life forms ranged between four and nine for epiphytes and perennial herbs respectively. The highest values of diversity indexes among life forms were found in trees and shrubs. The richness and diversity indices of pollination modes were statistically higher for more structured habitats, forest and forest-savanna transition, than herbaceous habitats, savanna and disturbed areas, which is associated with the highest values of diversity indexes in trees and shrubs. Equitability was higher for forest and disturbed areas than forest-savanna transition and savanna. The results of comparative richness, equitability, diversity indices, and the frequency distribution of pollination modes of 19 samples from tropical and temperate communities indicated that richness of pollination modes may be different between tropical and temperate communities. The proportion of each pollination mode suggests four grouping: (1) rain forests and their strata, (2) grassland savanna, and associated disturbed areas, (3) temperate communities, and (4) the most heterogeneous group, contained mostly neotropical communities, including the four habitats of the Venezuelan Central Plain.

1310,tempgrass,How can we preserve and restore species richness of pollinating insects on agricultural land?,"During recent decades, concern about the loss of biodiversity on agricultural land has increased, and semi-natural grasslands have been highlighted as critical habitats. Temperate European agricultural landscapes require distinct and appropriate management to prevent further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent for pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our aim was to examine how species richness of three important groups of pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are related to different farm characteristics, and if there are any differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if red-listed species are related to any farm characteristics. Species richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all semi-natural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50 km(2) in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species richness of solitary bees increased with the area of semi-natural grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural grassland species richness was strongly positively related with the density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with the proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed solitary bees was positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after mid-July) and decreased with increased farm isolation. The number of burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation height, flower density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with traditional hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting traditional hay-meadows, late extensive grazing and the herb K. arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high species richness of pollinating insects and support red-listed species. Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects.",WOS:000262639100003,294,0.878280903,1,how can we preserv and rest specy rich of pollin insect on agricult land dur rec decad concern about the loss of biodivers on agricult land has increas and sem nat grassland hav been highlight as crit habit temp europ agricult landscap requir distinct and appropry man to prev furth impov of the flor and faun thi is espec urg for pollin insect that provid import ecosystem serv our aim was to examin how specy rich of three import group of pollin insect solit bee butterf and burnet moth ar rel to diff farm charact and if ther ar any diff between thes three group a furth aim was to test if red list specy ar rel to any farm charact specy rich of solit bee butterf and burnet was meas on al sem nat grassland at farm in a forest domin are of km in southern swed us system transect walk in april to septemb on butterf and burnet and specy rich of solit bee and butterf was intercorrel both bef and aft control for the are of sem nat grassland specy rich of solit bee increas with the are of sem nat grassland aft control for the effect of the are of sem nat grassland specy rich was strongly posit rel with the dens of the plant knaut arvens and neg rel with the proport of graz grassland the result wer simil for solit bee and butterf the numb of red list solit bee was posit rel to the proport of meadow with lat harvest aft mid july and decreas with increas farm isol the numb of burnet specy al red list was posit rel to veget height flow dens and the proport of meadow with lat harvest on a farm area with a high dens of k arvens and with tradit hay meadow with lat harvest pres harbo most specy promot tradit hay meadow lat extend graz and the herb k arvens peopl man agricult biodivers can encompass high specy rich of pollin insect and support red list specy furth we suggest that the dens of k arvens at a farm can be us as a biodivers ind at least for pollin insect,new,0.893688111468788,0.8629720680497778,0.8401342835509893,0.8227347021050169,0.8088677924665552,0.7974156187008739,0.7877077544885402,0.7793414349527783,0.7721027968074293,0.7660126057062531,0.7618229257709278

The studied habitat types were mature forest, second-growth forest, forest plantations, and agricultural grassland. We recorded eight species of sigmodontine rodents (Abrothrix longipilis, Abrothrix olivaceus, Chelemys macronyx, Geoxus valdivianus, Irenomys tarsalis, Loxodontomys micropus, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, and Reithrodon auritus). Most species experience an increment in abundance from summer to autumn, with a notable decrease in winter and spring. The grassland showed lower species abundance than the mature forest. However, we did not detect significant differences in diversity, evenness, or species richness among the forest habitats. Our results suggest that rodents basically distinguish between forested and open areas, but not the specific plant composition of each habitat. Thus, the change in land use in the central Chilean Patagonia has not significantly affected the community parameters of diversity, evenness, or species richness.",WOS:000318225300009,26,0.878064671,1,assess rod commun respons in disturb environ of the chil patagon the effect of a perturb grady on a patagon rod commun wer assess ov the cours of a year by comp the commun paramet in nat and diff disturb environ in the cent chil patagon the study habit typ wer mat forest second grow forest forest plant and agricult grassland we record eight specy of sigmodontin rod abrothrix longipil abrothrix olivace chelemy macronyx geox valdivian irenom tars loxodontom microp oligoryzom longicaudat and reithrodon aurit most specy expery an incr in abund from sum to autumn with a not decreas in wint and spring the grassland show low specy abund than the mat forest howev we did not detect sign diff in divers ev or specy rich among the forest habit our result suggest that rod bas distinct between forest and op area but not the spec plant composit of each habit thu the chang in land us in the cent chil patagon has not sign affect the commun paramet of divers ev or specy rich,new,0.8884675036418374,0.8391513017939133,0.8015658456563058,0.7730593692916086,0.7506222854747349,0.7323582769687049,0.7171073286836553,0.7041768630966581,0.6931781787663712,0.6840516231942928,0.6775130098602432
157,tempgrass,"Floristic diversity of meadow steppes in the Western Siberian Plain: effects of abiotic site conditions, management and landscape structure","Temperate grasslands have suffered from severe habitat loss and degradation worldwide. In Russia, vast areas of forest-steppe grasslands have been converted to cropland during Soviet times, whilst remaining grasslands were often intensively grazed. Contrastingly, the collapse of the Soviet Union have resulted in a massive reduction in livestock numbers and cessation of management. Albeit relatively large natural grassland areas remained in the Western Siberian Plain, their present condition is poorly studied. We analysed plant species composition, functional structure and richness of grassland communities and tested for the effect of local factors (management, abiotic site conditions) and landscape factors (patch size, proportion of land cover types) on diversity patterns. Abiotic site conditions, mainly soil moisture and salinity, differentiated distinct community types. Overall, species richness was highest in meadow steppe communities with lower soil moisture and salinity. Grazing intensity and litter accumulation due to cessation of management were significant negative related to species richness and shaped the functional structure. At the landscape scale, diversity in meadow steppe grasslands was higher in forest-grassland mosaics and in small remnants isolated in a matrix of cropland. Our findings highlight that meadow steppes suffered massively under the historical habitat loss and high grazing pressure. Small species-rich remnants are evidence of the former extent of meadow steppe habitats in agricultural landscape, but are likely threatened by an extinction debt. Low intense, irregular mowing maintained species-rich meadow steppe in forest- grassland mosaics, but currently such practices are declining.",WOS:000386500700009,32,0.8762921779999999,1,flor divers of meadow step in the western sib plain effect of abiot sit condit man and landscap structure temp grassland hav suff from sev habit loss and degrad worldwid in russ vast area of forest step grassland hav been convert to cropland dur soviet tim whilst remain grassland wer oft intend graz contrast the collaps of the soviet un hav result in a mass reduc in livestock numb and cess of man albeit rel larg nat grassland area remain in the western sib plain their pres condit is poor study we analys plant specy composit funct structure and rich of grassland commun and test for the effect of loc fact man abiot sit condit and landscap fact patch siz proport of land cov typ on divers pattern abiot sit condit main soil moist and salin differenty distinct commun typ overal specy rich was highest in meadow step commun with low soil moist and salin graz intens and lit accum due to cess of man wer sign neg rel to specy rich and shap the funct structure at the landscap scal divers in meadow step grassland was high in forest grassland mosa and in smal remn isol in a matrix of cropland our find highlight that meadow step suff mass und the hist habit loss and high graz press smal specy rich remn ar evid of the form ext of meadow step habit in agricult landscap but ar lik threatened by an extinct debt low intens irregul mow maintain specy rich meadow step in forest grassland mosa but cur such pract ar declin,new,0.8704440232548499,0.8069192911879663,0.7558339975511984,0.7157001775432503,0.6833755601061157,0.656610429789014,0.6339223874667265,0.6143488780561562,0.5972726977222524,0.5823702389518431,0.5698585045414242
1610,tempgrass,Native forest replacement by exotic plantations in southern Chile (1985-2011) and partial compensation by natural regeneration,"Although several studies have reported rates of deforestation and spatial patterns of native forest fragmentation, few have focused on the role of natural forest regeneration and exotic tree plantations on landscape dynamics. The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamics of land cover change in order to test the hypothesis that exotic tree plantations have caused a major transformation of temperate forest cover in southern Chile during the last three decades. We used three Landsat satellite images taken in 1985 (TM), 1999 (ETM+), and 2011 (TM) to quantify land cover change, together with a set of landscape indicators to describe the spatial configuration of land cover. Our results showed that the major changes were dynamic conversion among forest, exotic tree plantation and shrubland. During the study period, the area covered by exotic tree plantations increased by 168% (20,896-56,010 ha), at an annual rate of 3.8%, mostly at the expense of native forest and shrubland. There was a total gross loss of native forest of 30% (54,304 ha), but a net loss of initial cover of only 5.1% (9130 ha), at an annual net deforestation rate of 0.2%. The difference between gross and net loss of native forest was mostly the result of conversion of shrubland and agricultural and pasture land to secondary forest following natural regeneration. Over the course of the study period, exotic tree plantations showed a constant increase in patch density, total edge length, nearest-neighbor distance, and largest patch index; maximum mean patch size occurred in the middle of the study period. Native forest exhibited an increase and then a decrease in patch density and total edge length, whereas mean patch size and largest patch index were lowest in the middle of the period. Overall, the observed trends indicate expansion of exotic tree plantations and increase in native forest loss and fragmentation, particularly between 1985 and 1999. Forest loss included both old-growth and secondary forests, while native forest established after secondary succession differed in diversity, structure, and functionality from old-growth and old growth/secondary forests. Since different successional stages influence the provision of ecosystem services, the changes observed in our study are likely to have consequences for humans that extend beyond immediate changes in land use patterns.

179,tempgrass,"Overstorey tree density and understorey regrowth effects on plant composition, stand structure and floristic richness in grazed temperate woodlands in eastern Australia","As natural woodlands decline in both extent and quality worldwide, there is an increasing recognition of the biodiversity conservation value of production landscapes. In low-input, low-productivity grazing systems in Australia, the modification of natural woodlands through overstorey tree and woody regrowth removal are vegetation management options used by landholders to increase native grass production for livestock grazing; however, there is little empirical evidence to indicate at what tree densities biodiversity attributes are compromised. We examined the effects of overstorey tree density and understorey regowth on the floristic composition, stand structure and species richness of eucalypt woodlands in a grazing landscape in the Traprock region of southern Queensland, Australia. We sampled 47 sites stratified according to vegetation type (Eucalyptus crebra/Eucatyptus dealbata woodland; Eucalyptus melliodora/Eucalyptus microcarpa grassy woodland), density of mature trees (< 6 trees/ha; 6-20 trees/ha; > 20 trees/ha), and presence/absence of regrowth. Distinct patterns in composition were detected using indicator species analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling, with low density areas compositionally indistinguishable, although distinct from other land management units. Within vegetation type, medium tree density woodlands were compositionally similar to high density and reference woodlands. Species richness ranged from 18 to 67 species per 500 m(2) across all sites. No differences in total or native species richness were detected across management units: however, some differences in exotic species richness were detected. Differences in grass cover existed between low and high density management units, yet no difference in grass cover was evident between low and medium density management units. Our results suggest that medium tree densities may provide biodiversity benefits concordant with more natural areas, yet not adversely impact on pasture production. Retaining trees in grazing landscapes provides significant landscape heterogeneity and important refuges for species that may be largely excluded from open grassland habitats. Maintaining a medium density of overstorey trees in grazed paddocks can provide both production and biodiversity benefits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

188,tempgrass,Composition of grazed and cleared temperate grassy woodlands in eastern Australia: patterns in space and inferences in time,"A regional vegetation survey of the temperate grassy woodlands (temperate savanna) in Australia was designed to assess the effects of clearing and grazing on the composition of vegetation remnants and the adjacent pasture matrix. Vegetation was sampled across a range of habitats using 77 0.1024-ha quadrats; the relative abundance of species was recorded. Classification analysis clustered the sites into three main groups that corresponded to intensity of grazing/clearing followed by groups based on underlying lithology (basalt, metasediment, granites). Using Canonical Correspondence Analysis, exogenous disturbance and environmental variables were related to the relative abundance of species; grazing intensity had the highest eigenvalue (0.27) followed by tree canopy cover (0.25), lithology (0. 18), altitude (0.17) and slope (0.10). Based on two-dimensional ordination scores, six species response groups were defined relating to intensity of pastoralism and nutrient status of the landscape. Abundance and dominance of native shrubs, subshrubs, twiners and geophytes were strongly associated with areas of less-intense pastoralism on low-nutrient soils. The strongest effects on species richness were grazing followed by canopy cover. Continuously grazed sites had lower native species richness across all growth forms except native grasses. There was no indication that intermediate grazing intensities enhanced forb richness as a result of competitive release. Species richness for all native plants was lowest where trees were absent especially under grazed conditions. Canopy cover in ungrazed sites appeared to promote the co-existence of shrubs with the herbaceous layer. Predicted declines in forb richness in treeless, ungrazed, sites were not detected. The lack of a disturbance- mediated enhancement of the herbaceous layer was attributed to habitat heterogeneity at 0. 1 ha sampling scale.",WOS:000182915300001,18,0.862298771,1,composit of graz and clear temp grassy woodland in eastern austral pattern in spac and inf in tim a reg veget survey of the temp grassy woodland temp savann in austral was design to assess the effect of clear and graz on the composit of veget remn and the adjac past matrix veget was sampl across a rang of habit us ha quadr the rel abund of specy was record class analys clust the sit into three main group that correspond to intens of graz clear follow by group bas on und litholog basalt metasedy granit us canon correspond analys exog disturb and environ vary wer rel to the rel abund of specy graz intens had the highest eigenvalu follow by tre canop cov litholog altitud and slop bas on two dimend ordin scor six specy respons group wer defin rel to intens of past and nutry stat of the landscap abund and domin of nat shrubs subshrub twin and geophyt wer strongly assocy with area of less intens past on low nutry soil the strongest effect on specy rich wer graz follow by canop cov continu graz sit had low nat specy rich across al grow form exceiv nat grass ther was no ind that intermedy graz intens enh forb rich as a result of competit releas specy rich for al nat plant was lowest wher tre wer abs espec und graz condit canop cov in ungraz sit appear to promot the co ex of shrubs with the herbac lay predict declin in forb rich in treeless ungraz sit wer not detect the lack of a disturb medy enh of the herbac lay was attribut to habit heterog at ha sampl scal,new,0.910641408919873,0.8676113478245032,0.8332191365804845,0.8052019906749643,0.7812222795940579,0.7597703493978903,0.7397619084459924,0.7202347801940533,0.7000358978906634,0.6771848584714346,0.6468337293499146
1910,tempgrass,Habitat complexity of the Pannonian forest-steppe zone and its nature conservation implications,"Eurasian forest-steppes are among the most complex ecosystems in the northern temperate zone. Alternating forest and grassland patches form a mosaic-like landscape, stretching in a stripe from eastern Europe almost to the Pacific coast. Although the edges (contact zones between woody and herbaceous vegetation) may play an important ecological role, their study has been neglected in the forest-steppes. In this study, we aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis on the components of a sandy forest-steppe in the Pannonian ecoregion (Hungary), with special regard to the edges. 2 m x 1 m coenological releves were made in forest interiors, in edges and in grassland interiors. We carried out microclimate measurements in each habitat type. Compositional and structural characteristics of the forests, edges and grasslands were compared, including species number, Shannon diversity, summarized cover, life-form and geoelement spectra. Diagnostic species for each habitat type were identified, and the role of the habitats in harbouring protected and endemic species was also assessed. Based on the frequencies and cover values of tree seedlings and saplings in the three habitat types, we formulated tentative assumptions on vegetation dynamics. We found that edges possessed their own distinct species composition, having a considerably higher species number, Shannon diversity and vegetation cover than habitat interiors. Edges hosted relatively large numbers of edge-related species, and proved to be highly different from habitat interiors with regard to life-form and geoelement spectra. It seemed that the spatial interaction of two neighbouring communities resulted in the emergence of a third, unique community, the edge. The microclimate of the forests and the grasslands differed strikingly, whereas that of the edges fell between them. Except Populus alba, trees had very few seedlings and no saplings, which may have serious consequences if the current warming and drying trend continues. We conclude that in the study area, intermediate microclimate of the edges supports a community that is not intermediate compositionally and structurally: the edge should be recognized as a distinct community, although strongly connected to the neighbouring communities. As a consequence, forest-steppes have three integral components: forest, grassland and edge. Our results emphasize the conservation importance of all components. The conservation value of the sandy grasslands has long been recognized, but the contribution of edges and forest patches to species and habitat diversity should not be neglected either. Conservation activities should focus on maintaining the complexity of the forest-steppe ecosystem, with all of its integral components. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

281,tempgrass,Butterflies take advantage of contemporary forestry: Clear-cuts as temporary grasslands,"Contemporary forest landscapes in boreal and temperate environments, harvested by clear-cutting, contain various novel types of open spaces which are potentially suitable for species inhabiting natural or semi-natural open habitats. However, systematic analyses identifying the share of the regional species pool that can take advantage of this opportunity are missing. We assessed the importance of such forest openings for open-habitat butterflies in Estonia in Northern Europe by comparing butterfly species richness and composition in forest clear-cuts with their regional species pool. The species richness of butterflies in clear-cuts appeared to be remarkably high: we recorded altogether 81% of the total regional species pool across the study sites. Clear-cuts were inhabited by a very high share (79%) of regionally occurring grassland species, as well as nearly complete sets of open-habitat generalists and forest species. Redundancy analysis showed that clear-cuts in forests with different environmental characteristics harbour distinct butterfly assemblages, their contribution to the butterfly fauna in forest landscapes being thus complementary. This as well as several other lines of evidence indicate that most butterfly species can form resident populations in harvested forest landscapes. Our findings demonstrate that considering novel types of forest openings as 'temporary meadows' can substantially improve the conservation prospects for butterflies and other organisms that have traditionally been considered to inhabit grasslands and other open habitats in agricultural landscapes. Human-altered ecosystems may thus prove to be a viable alternative where restoring or maintaining natural and semi-natural habitats is impossible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

353,tempgrass,How do sheep affect plant communities and arthropod populations in temperate grasslands?,"Grasslands being used in sheep farming systems are managed under a variety of agricultural production, recreational and conservational objectives. Although sheep grazing is rarely considered the best method for delivering conservation objectives in seminatural temperate grasslands, the literature does not provide unequivocal evidence on the impact of sheep grazing on pasture biodiversity. Our aim was therefore to review evidence of the impacts of stocking rate, grazing period and soil fertility on plant communities and arthropod populations in both mesotrophic grasslands typical of agriculturally improved areas and in native plant communities. We therefore conducted a literature search of articles published up to the end of the year 2010 using 'sheep' and 'grazing' as keywords, together with variables describing grassland management, plant community structure or arthropod taxa. The filtering process led to the selection of 48 articles, with 42 included in the stocking rate dataset, 9 in the grazing period dataset and 10 in the soil fertility dataset The meta-analysis did not reveal any significant trends for plant species richness or plant community evenness along a wide stocking rate gradient. However, we found frequent shifts in functional groups or plant species abundance that could be explained by the functional properties of the plants in the community. The meta-analysis confirmed that increasing soil fertility decreased plant species richness. Despite the very limited dataset, plant species richness was significantly greater in autumn-grazed pastures than in ungrazed areas, which suggests that choosing an appropriate grazing period would be a promising option for preserving biodiversity in sheep farming systems. Qualitative review indicated that low grazing intensity had positive effects on Orthoptera, Hemiptera (especially phytophagous Auchenorrhyncha) and, despite a diverse range of feeding strategies, for the species richness of Coleoptera. Lepidoptera, which were favoured by more abundant flowering plants, also benefited from low grazing intensities. Spider abundance and species richness were higher in ungrazed than in grazed pastures. In contrast, there are insufficient published studies to draw any firm conclusions on the benefits of late grazing or stopping fertilization on insect diversity, and no grounds for including any of this information in decision support tools at this stage.",WOS:000304602900013,15,0.834950317,0,how do sheep affect plant commun and arthropod pop in temp grassland grassland being us in sheep farm system ar man und a vary of agricult produc recr and conserv object although sheep graz is rar consid the best method for del conserv object in semin temp grassland the lit doe not provid unequivoc evid on the impact of sheep graz on past biodivers our aim was theref to review evid of the impact of stock rat graz period and soil fertil on plant commun and arthropod pop in both mesotroph grassland typ of agricult improv area and in nat plant commun we theref conduc a lit search of artic publ up to the end of the year us sheep and graz as keyword togeth with vary describ grassland man plant commun structure or arthropod tax the filt process led to the select of artic with includ in the stock rat dataset in the graz period dataset and in the soil fertil dataset the met analys did not rev any sign trend for plant specy rich or plant commun ev along a wid stock rat grady howev we found frequ shift in funct group or plant specy abund that could be explain by the funct property of the plant in the commun the met analys confirm that increas soil fertil decreas plant specy rich despit the very limit dataset plant specy rich was sign gre in autumn graz past than in ungraz area which suggest that choos an appropry graz period would be a prom opt for preserv biodivers in sheep farm system qualit review ind that low graz intens had posit effect on orthopter hemipter espec phytoph auchenorrhynch and despit a divers rang of fee strategies for the specy rich of coleopter lepidopter which wer favo by mor abund flow plant also benefit from low graz intens spid abund and specy rich wer high in ungraz than in graz past in contrast ther ar insufficy publ study to draw any firm conclud on the benefit of lat graz or stop fertil on insect divers and no ground for includ any of thi inform in decid support tool at thi stag,new,0.8773471907167097,0.8380620655539257,0.8094817390510406,0.7875375945125456,0.7696909745619722,0.7545709299685527,0.741350785121301,0.7294632469543647,0.7184696232734364,0.7079402507241741,0.6973052323433194
441,tempgrass,Cattle decrease plant species diversity in protected humid temperate savanna,"Question: Is domestic cattle an appropriate surrogate for fire in a protected humid temperate savanna? Study area: El Palmar Grande de Colon (31 degrees 52'S, 58 degrees 17'W), Argentina. Methods: We surveyed dense Butia yatay palm savannas in two neighboring protected areas, El Palmar National Park (EPNP), under cattle exclusion since 1970 with sporadic burning; and La Aurora Wildlife Refuge (LAWR), under moderate cattle density, and not burnt since 1997. In each area, we randomly selected ten dense savanna stands, established 500 m(2) plots and undertook floristic survey in spring and summer to produce exhaustive plant-species lists. We statistically compared the two samples in terms of: local and global diversities; compositional heterogeneity among stands; mean similarity to a historical record from the area; overall species composition; and abundance and numbers of species with different growth habits and origins. Results: Differences between our samples are clear-cut. Savannas at EPNP have significantly increased local and global species richness and exhibit decreased similarities with the historical record. They have a novel understory, with significantly increased abundances and species numbers of fire-resistant grassland shrubs and fire-sensitive trees, and a groundcover with significantly increased richness of subshrub and perennial graminoid species. Savannas at LAWR have virtually no woody understory, and exhibit a groundcover dominated by an impoverished suite of perennial grasses, with significantly increased abundances and numbers of annual and of exotic species. Conclusions: Our results suggest that large-scale, long-term cattle exclusion and sporadic fires have resulted in changes in the structure and composition of the savanna vegetation leading to increased plant species diversity. Apparently, conservation of these humid savannas in protected areas requires periodic fire, while domestic cattle are a poor alternative for maintaining their plant species diversity.",WOS:000440825400002,10,0.823378525,1,cattl decreas plant specy divers in protect humid temp savann quest is domest cattl an appropry surrog for fir in a protect humid temp savann study are el palm grand de colon degr s degr w argentin method we survey dens but yatay palm savanna in two neighb protect area el palm nat park epnp und cattl exclud sint with sporad burn and la auror wildl refug lawr und mod cattl dens and not burnt sint in each are we random select ten dens savann stand est m plot and undertook flor survey in spring and sum to produc exhaust plant specy list we stat comp the two sampl in term of loc and glob divers composit heterog among stand mean simil to a hist record from the are overal specy composit and abund and numb of specy with diff grow habit and origin result diff between our sampl ar clear cut savanna at epnp hav sign increas loc and glob specy rich and exhibit decreas simil with the hist record they hav a novel underst with sign increas abund and specy numb of fir resist grassland shrubs and fir sensit tre and a groundcov with sign increas rich of subshrub and peren graminoid specy savanna at lawr hav virt no woody underst and exhibit a groundcov domin by an impov suit of peren grass with sign increas abund and numb of an and of exot specy conclud our result suggest that larg scal long term cattl exclud and sporad fir hav result in chang in the structure and composit of the savann veget lead to increas plant specy divers app conserv of thes humid savanna in protect area requir period fir whil domest cattl ar a poor altern for maintain their plant specy divers,new,0.8585156730965552,0.8106111402851899,0.7758684441358634,0.7492205997655709,0.7275377059321698,0.7091353806222211,0.6930031471986199,0.6784530436482583,0.664925855405536,0.6518201758343716,0.6381563830003417
651,tempgrass,Alternative silvicultural practices with variable retention to improve understory plant diversity conservation in southern Patagonian forests,"Understory plants could can act as indicators of temperate forest sustainability, health and conservation status due to their importance in ecosystem function. Harvesting impacts on understory plant diversity depends on their intensity. Variable retention has been proposed to mitigate the harmful effects of timber harvesting, but its effectiveness remains unknown in southern Patagonian Nothofagus pumilio forests. The objectives of this study were to: (i) define a baseline of understory plant diversity in old-growth forests along a site quality gradient and under canopy gaps; (ii) evaluate stands with three different variable retention treatments compared to old-growth forests; and (iii) assess temporal changes during 4 years after harvesting (YAH). A 61 ha N. pumilio forest was selected. Understory plant (Dicotyledonae, Monocotyledonae and Pteridophyta) richness, cover (including woody debris and bare forest floor) and above-ground dry biomass were characterized in summer for 5 years. Before harvesting, baseline samples were conducted along a site quality gradient and outside/inside canopy gaps. Analyzed treatments include a control of old-growth forest (OGF) and three different harvesting treatments with variable retention: (i) dispersed retention (DR) of 30 m(2) ha(-1) (20-30% retention); (ii) aggregated retention (AR) with one aggregate per hectare and clear-cuts (28% retention); and (iii) combined dispersed and aggregated retention (DAR) with one aggregate per hectare and dispersed retention of 10-15 m(2) ha(-1) (40-50% retention). Data analyses included parametric and permutational ANOVAs, multivariate classification and ordinations. Before harvesting, 31 plant species were found, where richness, cover and biomass were directly related to site quality. The presence of canopy gaps did not have a significant impact on the measured variables. After harvesting, 20 new species appeared from adjacent associated environments (two from N. antarctica forests and 18 from grasslands and peatlands). At the stand level, understory values were higher in AR > DR > DAR > OGF. Most (81-95%) plant richness at baseline conditions was conserved in all treatments, where inside the aggregates understory remained similar to OGF. Combination of aggregated and dispersed retention (DAR) better limited exotic species introduction and protected sensitive species, improving conservation in harvested stands. Changes in understory variables were observed after the first YAH in all treatments; greater changes were observed in the harvested areas than in aggregates. Changes stabilized at the fourth YAH. As a conclusion, the location of retention aggregates should be selected to preserve species understory diversity of more speciose and diverse habitats or particularly uncommon stands. Implementation of different kinds (patterns and levels) of retention for improvement of biodiversity conservation in harvested forests should be included in timber and forest management planning.

80,tempgrass,Evaluating forest clear-cuts as alternative grassland habitats for plants and butterflies,"Temperate semi-natural grasslands in Europe and East Asia have been rapidly declining and their conservation is urgently required. Although recent studies have indicated the importance of clear-cuts as alternative habitats for grassland butterflies, there is paucity of studies that directly compare biodiversity and habitat quality between grasslands and clear-cuts using multiple taxa. In this study, we compared the plant and butterfly richness between grasslands and clear-cuts, with a focus on the distribution of butterfly resources (nectaring flowers and host plants) and endangered plant and butterfly species, in a cool temperate area of central Japan. We established three or six transects in five grassland and five clear-cut sites, and measured the richness of plants and butterflies and environmental variables such as vegetation height and coverage at both transect and site levels. At the site level, there were no differences in the richness of all plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants, but there were significant or marginal differences in the richness of endangered plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants. Almost all endangered plants and butterflies were found in the overall grasslands, but only half of the endangered butterfly species were observed in the overall clear-cuts. At the transect level, species richness of endangered plants and butterflies peaked at an intermediate vegetation height. Our results indicate the primary importance of existing semi-natural grasslands and the necessity of management when the vegetation becomes too high. We recommend active creation of clear-cuts near or between the existing grasslands, so that clear-cuts can provide source or backup populations and act as stepping stones to connect the isolated grassland populations.",WOS:000449137300033,1,0.78581954,1,evalu forest clear cut as altern grassland habit for plant and butterf temp sem nat grassland in europ and east as hav been rapid declin and their conserv is urg requir although rec study hav ind the import of clear cut as altern habit for grassland butterf ther is pauc of study that direct comp biodivers and habit qual between grassland and clear cut us multipl tax in thi study we comp the plant and butterf rich between grassland and clear cut with a foc on the distribut of butterf resourc nect flow and host plant and endang plant and butterf specy in a cool temp are of cent jap we est three or six transect in fiv grassland and fiv clear cut sit and meas the rich of plant and butterf and environ vary such as veget height and cov at both transect and sit level at the sit level ther wer no diff in the rich of al plant butterf and butterf host plant but ther wer sign or margin diff in the rich of endang plant butterf and butterf host plant almost al endang plant and butterf wer found in the overal grassland but on half of the endang butterf specy wer observ in the overal clear cut at the transect level specy rich of endang plant and butterf peak at an intermedy veget height our result ind the prim import of ex sem nat grassland and the necess of man when the veget becom too high we recommend act cre of clear cut near or between the ex grassland so that clear cut can provid sourc or backup pop and act as step ston to connect the isol grassland pop,new,0.8517221365143146,0.8012355668143474,0.763614579561161,0.7350908845360155,0.7126804383367071,0.6945978832005365,0.6797936390816011,0.6677031850190304,0.6581671428505674,0.6516004697833162,0.649803889441431
971,tempgrass,Annual mowing maintains plant diversity in threatened temperate grasslands,"Questions: Disturbance regimes shaped the evolution of grasslands but grazing exclusion and fire suppression have caused unprecedented increases in grassland biomass and biodiversity declines. Mowing reduces biomass but is not widely practiced in conservation reserves because of concerns about facilitating exotic plant invasion and altering ecosystem function. We asked whether regular mowing affected (1) the diversity of native and exotic functional groups, (2) spatial turnover in vegetation composition (beta-diversity), (3) vegetation attributes relating to biomass and structural heterogeneity, (4) community composition and (5) the distribution and abundance of individual native and exotic species. Location: Five temperate grassland reserves, south-eastern Australia, encompassing C-3 and C-4 dominated communities. Methods: Vegetation within reserves had been cut to 10 cm, once per year, for 10 years in late spring/early summer to maintain access tracks. We surveyed plant communities in mowed areas and nearby (<5 m) unmowed control areas (40 subplots per reserve, 200 total) and used linear mixed-effects models to examine the effects of mowing. Results: Of 24 functional groups, the richness of 16 native and exotic groups significantly increased with mowing. In 14 of these cases, effects were consistent across C-3- and C-4-dominated grassland. Mowing reduced spatial turnover, but this did not reduce species richness at any spatial scale. When accounting for species abundance and evenness (Shannon diversity), effects of mowing were generally positive for native species and neutral for exotic species. Mowing increased native perennial grass cover and bare earth, decreased exotic perennial grass cover and litter, and changed community composition. Mowing reduced vegetation height but not structural heterogeneity. Mowing positively affected six individual native species and no exotic species.

1041,tempgrass,Effect of the shape of forest fragments on tree population dynamics,"A lattice model is used to study the influence of the shape of forest fragments on the augmentation process of a tree population following clear-cutting. Two fragments of different shapes, squarish and linear, were studied without seed immigration from the outside. Both fragments consisted initially of two patches, a 4-ha clear-cut area and a 1-ha remnant forest, mimicking a common forest management regime in Japan. Stochastic simulations using the model reveal several differences in the dynamics and equilibrium structure of the tree population between the fragments. In the squarish fragment, the forest structure reached an equilibrium state in 500-600 years, but the linear fragment took 2100-2400 years. At equilibrium, the proportion of treeless area was significantly larger in the linear fragment than in the squarish fragment. The mean area of gaps was also larger in the linear fragment. The population expansion rate from the remnant forest into the cleared area differed significantly between the two fragments: 0.63 m year(-1) in the squarish fragment, and 0.43 m year(-1) in the linear fragment. These differences are explained as arising from the spatial configuration of seed dispersal: in the linear fragment, the density of seedlings was lower by half than in the squarish fragment, because a greater proportion of seeds produced within the linear fragment were deposited outside the fragment and were lost. However, the density effect (i.e., one-sided competition among trees) mitigates the negative impact of dispersal loss on the adult population density at equilibrium. Forest fragments with linear shapes should be preferred by fugitive light-demanding species in forested landscapes.",WOS:000221178600011,6,0.761587859,0,effect of the shap of forest frag on tre pop dynam a lat model is us to study the influ of the shap of forest frag on the aug process of a tre pop follow clear cut two frag of diff shap squ and linear wer study without see immigr from the outsid both frag consist init of two patch a ha clear cut are and a ha remn forest mimick a common forest man regim in jap stochast sim us the model rev sev diff in the dynam and equilibr structure of the tre pop between the frag in the squ frag the forest structure reach an equilibr stat in year but the linear frag took year at equilibr the proport of treeless are was sign larg in the linear frag than in the squ frag the mean are of gap was also larg in the linear frag the pop expand rat from the remn forest into the clear are diff sign between the two frag m year in the squ frag and m year in the linear frag thes diff ar explain as ar from the spat config of see dispers in the linear frag the dens of seedl was low by half than in the squ frag becaus a gre proport of see produc within the linear frag wer deposit outsid the frag and wer lost howev the dens effect i e on sid competit among tre mitig the neg impact of dispers loss on the adult pop dens at equilibr forest frag with linear shap should be prefer by fugit light demand specy in forest landscap,new,0.7749109980441568,0.7202212595215995,0.6855057767560416,0.6632233325812064,0.6487092739571703,0.6396324138541007,0.6349391765414933,0.6344482716312623,0.6388550693403019,0.6504844275514632,0.6761512912917809
1114,tempgrass,Evaluating partial cutting in broadleaved temperate forest under strong experimental control: Short-term effects on herbaceous plants,"Partial harvesting of forest for biofuel and other products may be less harmful to biodiversity than clear-cutting, and may even be beneficial for some species or groups of organisms such as herbs. There are, however, few well-controlled experiments evaluating positive and negative effects, such as species losses directly after harvest. In closed canopy mixed oak forest in Sweden, about 25% of the tree basal area and 50-90% of the understory was removed (mainly spruce, birch, aspen, lime, rowan and hazel). In each of six forests, we studied herbs in an experimental (cutting) plot and a control plot (undisturbed) before, and in the first summer, after the harvest (conducted in winter). Losses of species were similar in experimental and control plots (15-16%). The harvest increased species richness by 4-31% (mean 18%); also species diversity (H) increased. Several ruderals increased in experimental plots, but most changes occurred in grassland and forest species; partial cutting led to complex, partly unpredictable early changes in the herb community. A review of early effects of partial cutting (eight experiments) indicated that it increases herb species richness in stands of broadleaves, but apparently not in conifer stands; there was no evidence that partial cutting increases species losses. Thus, with respect to early changes after harvest, we found no negative effects of partial cutting on herbs. We suggest, however, that some proportion of closed-canopy mixed oak forest should not be harvested, to protect rare, potentially sensitive herbs, and to create stand diversity.

1121,tempgrass,Species diversity of woody recruits within Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations established on grasslands: the effects of site conditions and landscape,"Plantations established on grasslands have low recruitment of broadleaved trees and therefore may require particular attention when developing biodiversity-oriented management practices. In this study, we tested four hypotheses concerning woody recruits in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations established on grasslands with respect to their distance from the nearest Konara oak (Quercus serrata) forest. Our four hypotheses were as follows: (1) both species richness and occurrence frequency (the number of subplots in which recruits were present) decline with increasing distance; (2) the strength of the effect of distance differs depending on the growth form, seed dispersal type, or life history trait; (3) the species richness of recruits does not increase in response to a disturbance or other site conditions; (4) and species composition of recruits also changes with distance. Our results showed that species richness and occurrence frequency generally declined with increasing distance. This result supports the first hypothesis. The effect of distance was stronger in wind-dispersed species than in bird-dispersed species, as predicted by the second hypothesis. Disturbances such as thinning or wind throw did not increase but rather did decrease species richness, as predicted by the third hypothesis. Furthermore, distance had the strongest impact on species composition, as predicted by the fourth hypothesis. These findings show that, in biodiversity-oriented management, it may be more challenging to increase biodiversity using stand-level management in plantations established on grasslands than in plantations established after clear-cutting of broadleaved forests. Thus, landscape-level management may be required for these cases.",WOS:000433141300003,9,0.7538930690000001,0,specy divers of woody recruit within japanes ced cryptomer japonic plant est on grassland the effect of sit condit and landscap plant est on grassland hav low recruit of broadleav tre and theref may requir particul at when develop biodivers ory man pract in thi study we test four hypothes concern woody recruit in japanes ced cryptomer japonic plant est on grassland with respect to their dist from the nearest konar oak querc serrat forest our four hypothes wer as follow both specy rich and occur frequ the numb of subplot in which recruit wer pres declin with increas dist the strength of the effect of dist diff depend on the grow form see dispers typ or lif hist trait the specy rich of recruit doe not increas in respons to a disturb or oth sit condit and specy composit of recruit also chang with dist our result show that specy rich and occur frequ gen declin with increas dist thi result support the first hypothes the effect of dist was stronger in wind dispers specy than in bird dispers specy as predict by the second hypothes disturb such as thin or wind throw did not increas but rath did decreas specy rich as predict by the third hypothes furtherm dist had the strongest impact on specy composit as predict by the four hypothes thes find show that in biodivers ory man it may be mor challeng to increas biodivers us stand level man in plant est on grassland than in plant est aft clear cut of broadleav forest thu landscap level man may be requir for thes cas,new,0.7844908838563625,0.7285326292347742,0.6916706845711689,0.6670280919529982,0.6502329293628988,0.6390185475733591,0.6322987464199796,0.6297930130580517,0.6320469289181063,0.6410828729856596,0.6629153433621606
1281,tempgrass,Landscape and local influences on patterns of reptile occurrence in grazed temperate woodlands of southern Australia,"The woodlands of temperate south-eastern Australia are characterised by extensive historical clearing and ongoing modification of the understorey habitat through livestock grazing, fertilization and cropping. The reptile assemblage of these temperate woodlands, while relatively speciose, is believed to be in decline. We report on the abundance and diversity of terrestrial reptiles in native pastures in south-eastern Australia in relation to landscape and local factors; in particular, latitude and grazing management and tree retention. Reptiles were sampled on 24 paired farms spread widely over the south-western slopes of south-eastern Australia. Each pair comprised one farm under rotational grazing and a neighbouring farm with continuous grazing. Twenty-one species were detected, dominated numerically by several skinks and a pygopodid, with clear disparities in the biogeographic distribution of reptiles and also variation owing to survey technique, location, grazing regime, and the presence of trees. Multivariate models showed that the distribution of reptiles is influenced by factors operating at several levels and, to a lesser extent, by farm management. Reptile occurrence was regularly explained by correlations with site-level structural heterogeneity (e.g. native plant richness, number of large trees and log cover) as well as showing strong underlying latitudinal variation. The presence of woodland is critical to reptile occurrence in grazed (and fragmented) landscapes. If the reptile assemblage of this agroecosystem is to benefit from altered farm management, then different management and policy responses may be required, depending on the levels of habitat structural complexity and agricultural intensification that already exist.

228,tempgrass,SEED BANKS AND FOREST RECRUITMENT AFTER DISTURBANCE: THE COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE OF SEED AFTER THE CLEAR-CUT OF STONE PINE (PINUS PINEA L.) PLANTATIONS,"Seed banks play a key role in the recruitment of forest vegetation after severe disturbance, but can originate an undesired plant community. Thus, investigations on seed bank structure, and early changes occurring after clear-cut, are of primary interest for sustainable forest management. Researches were carried out in two mature stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) plantations located in Tuscany (Italy), along the Mediterranean coast. Soil samples were collected in March, July and October of the 2nd and 3rd year after clear-cut, in cut strips and adjacent intact stands. Seed bank size and composition were evaluated through the number of seedlings and species emerged from soil samples. Intact plantations differed in seed bank richness and composition, but not in abundance that was approximately 1,200 seeds m(-2). Clear-cut doubled seed density in soil, did not change seed bank richness, and affected markedly composition. Seed banks of cut strips were richer in annual and open space species, and poorer in perennial, forest and disturbed sites species. Seeds of Erica scoparia dominated the seed bank, with a relative abundance of 60% in intact stands and 43% in cut strips. Proportion of annual seeds was slightly less than 20% in intact stands, but increased up to 50% after clear-cut. Between the 2nd and 3rd year from clear-cut, the proportion of seeds from species typical of stone pine forests decreased, while that of non-forest species and aliens increased. The scarcity of seeds from most forest species and the lack of tree seeds make the recruitment of understorey vegetation from seed banks critical. In addition, the increased seed density of alien and disturbed site species in intact seed banks with time from clear-cut, suggests that disturbance caused by cutting in narrow strips threatens the integrity of intact plantations.",WOS:000324790100004,3,0.6731716209999999,1,see bank and forest recruit aft disturb the composit and abund of see aft the clear cut of ston pin pin pine l plant see bank play a key rol in the recruit of forest veget aft sev disturb but can origin an undesir plant commun thu investig on see bank structure and ear chang occur aft clear cut ar of prim interest for sustain forest man research wer carry out in two mat ston pin pin pine l plant loc in tuscany ita along the mediter coast soil sampl wer collect in march july and octob of the nd and rd year aft clear cut in cut strips and adjac intact stand see bank siz and composit wer evalu through the numb of seedl and specy emerg from soil sampl intact plant diff in see bank rich and composit but not in abund that was approxim see m clear cut doubl see dens in soil did not chang see bank rich and affect mark composit see bank of cut strips wer rich in an and op spac specy and poor in peren forest and disturb sit specy see of eric scopar domin the see bank with a rel abund of in intact stand and in cut strips proport of an see was slight less than in intact stand but increas up to aft clear cut between the nd and rd year from clear cut the proport of see from specy typ of ston pin forest decreas whil that of non forest specy and aly increas the scarc of see from most forest specy and the lack of tre see mak the recruit of understorey veget from see bank crit in addit the increas see dens of aly and disturb sit specy in intact see bank with tim from clear cut suggest that disturb caus by cut in narrow strips threatens the integr of intact plant,new,0.8058736568441032,0.7222060858204974,0.6601264133011616,0.6134950153971608,0.577068727089615,0.5476581170265951,0.5232991894221775,0.5027315063856485,0.4851073945863658,0.46982125071634656,0.4562780276561753
259,tempgrass,Impacts of elevated atmospheric CO2 and temperature on plant community structure of a temperate grassland are modulated by cutting frequency,"To determine the impacts of climate change and defoliation on the community structure and plant diversity of a semi-natural temperate grassland, monoliths of a permanent grassland were exposed to ambient or elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient + 235 ppmv) and temperature (ambient + VC) from October 1998 to December 2000. The monoliths were subjected to two different cutting frequencies, either two or six cuts per year. The grassland community structure changed during the course of the experiment and was more responsive to changes in management than to changes in climate. Increased cutting frequency stimulated plant diversity by enhancing the number of forb species, but plant diversity was not significantly affected by climate change. The contribution of individual plant species to the vegetation cover revealed species-specific responses to climate change and cutting frequency, but for most species significant interactions between climate change and cutting frequency were present. There were no clear-cut effects of treatments on the total annual yield and the proportion of forbs present, as significant interactions between climate change and cutting frequency occurred. It is concluded that differential grassland management will modify plant species-specific responses to climate change and resulting changes in the botanical composition of mixed-species, temperate grasslands.",WOS:000222181500005,8,0.64754087,0,impact of elev atmosph co and temp on plant commun structure of a temp grassland ar mod by cut frequ to determin the impact of clim chang and defo on the commun structure and plant divers of a sem nat temp grassland monolith of a perm grassland wer expos to amby or elev atmosph co cont amby ppmv and temp amby vc from octob to decemb the monolith wer subject to two diff cut frequ eith two or six cut per year the grassland commun structure chang dur the cours of the expery and was mor respond to chang in man than to chang in clim increas cut frequ stim plant divers by enh the numb of forb specy but plant divers was not sign affect by clim chang the contribut of individ plant specy to the veget cov rev specy spec respons to clim chang and cut frequ but for most specy sign interact between clim chang and cut frequ wer pres ther wer no clear cut effect of tre on the tot an yield and the proport of forb pres as sign interact between clim chang and cut frequ occur it is conclud that diff grassland man wil mod plant specy spec respons to clim chang and result chang in the bot composit of mix specy temp grassland,new,0.7250518133732512,0.6104668345935039,0.5325207857350147,0.47831844750067665,0.43860354531803614,0.4083384029021792,0.38472667520240833,0.36619963076661466,0.35200362767252774,0.3422382756993689,0.33871944582764885
266,tempgrass,How should we view temperate semi-natural grasslands? Insights from butterflies in Japan,"In humid temperate regions, it has been commonly thought that closed forests represent original states and grasslands are unstable human artifacts that persist only as ""semi-natural"" states. This perspective underrates grasslands, because it makes the recent decline in grassland excusable. A contrasting perspective was recently proposed for temperate Europe and North America, stating that grasslands are intrinsically natural and stable, and hence could have survived without human presence during the postglacial age. However, few quantitative analyses have been performed to test the validity of these two perspectives. Considering that the evolutionary history of species is reflected in species traits, analyzing traits of grassland species in relation to habitat stability is expected to identify the intrinsic nature of grasslands (stable or unstable) and test the validity of these two perspectives. Here, using temperate Japanese butterflies, I compared ecological traits, geographic range, endemism and habitat types in the Eurasian continent between grassland species and forest (stable habitat) and ruderal (unstable habitat) species. I found that grassland butterflies shared similar ecological traits with forest butterflies, but not with ruderal butterflies. Moreover, grassland butterflies were primarily associated with natural and stable steppes and meadows in the Eurasian continent. Furthermore, Japanese grassland species are evolutionarily unique, nurturing many endemic subspecies with narrow geographic ranges. These results indicate that grasslands should not be regarded as unstable, transient, and artificial, but as intrinsically natural and stable in humid temperate regions. These grasslands may have persisted in a stable state without human intervention during the Holocene due to natural disturbances and severe environmental conditions, which are currently immensely suppressed or altered by human. Such perspective also holds true for humid temperate regions in Europe and North America. Thus, temperate semi-natural grasslands should be conserved with high priority in these regions considering that few natural grasslands are left resulting from the present intensive land use pressures and disturbance suppression.

352,tempgrass,Seed banks of temperate deciduous forests during secondary succession,"Question (i) How does former land use and land use intensity affect seed bank development during post-agricultural succession? (ii) How does time since the last clear-cut change seed bank composition during post-clear-cut succession? Methods One data set was compiled per succession type using the following selection criteria: (i) the data set included a successional series, (ii) plots were located in mesotrophic forest plant communities and (iii) vegetation data were available. The post-agricultural succession data set comprised 76 recent forest plots (eight studies); the post-clear-cut succession data set comprised 218 ancient forest plots (three studies). Each data set was analysed separately using either linear mixed models or generalized linear models, controlling for both environmental heterogeneity and variation between study locations. Results In the post-agricultural succession data set, land use and time significantly affected nearly all the studied seed bank characteristics. Seed banks on former arable land recovered poorly even after 150 year of restored forest cover, whereas moderate land use intensities (grasslands, heathlands) yielded more rapid seed bank recovery. Time was a significant determinant of all but two soil seed bank characteristics during post-clear-cut succession.

In this study, we assessed the patterns in communities of birds among forests of varying age consisting of clear-cuts of former coniferous plantations, selectively logged compartments and primary forests in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Birds were surveyed by 10-minute point counts at 174 randomly located points in nine forest areas during September-October 2011. A total of 2 688 birds representing 115 species were recorded. The species density, diversity and dominance of all birds, and dominance of forest specialists showed no differences between forest areas, whereas the species density and diversity of forest specialists differed significantly between forest areas. The composition of communities of all birds and of forest specialists varied significantly among the forest areas.

219,tropconif,Variability after 15 Years of Vegetation Recovery in Natural Secondary Forest with Timber Harvesting at Different Intensities in Southeastern China: Community Diversity and Stability,"The mixed Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook., Pinus massoniana Lamb., and hardwood forest in southeastern China is a major assemblage in natural secondary forests, and of national and international importance in terms of both timber and ecosystem services. However, over-harvesting has threatened its long-term sustainability, and there is a knowledge gap relating to the effect of harvesting on the ecosystem. After conifer species were selected for harvesting, the mixed Chinese fir, pine, and hardwood forest was changed into mixed evergreen broadleaf forest. In this context, we observed the restoration dynamics of plant communities over a period of 15 years (1996 to 2011) with different levels of harvesting intensity, including selective harvesting at low (13.0% removal of growing stock volume), medium (29.1%), high (45.8%), and extra-high (67.1%) intensities, as well as clear-cut harvesting (100.0%), with non-harvesting as the control, based on permanent sample plots established in a randomized block design in these forests in southeastern China. The impact on the richness, diversity, and evenness of plant species derived from descriptive statistical analyses was shown to initially increase, and then decrease, with an increase in harvesting intensity. The most critical impacts were on the richness, diversity, and evenness of shrub and herb species. Richness, diversity, and evenness of plant species recovered and increased under selective harvesting at low and medium intensities, while these parameters had not recovered and significantly decreased under selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities, as well as with clear-cut harvesting. The impact on the plant community stability was derived from the stability test method of the improved Godron M. The plant community stability was closest to the point of stability (20/80) under selective harvesting at medium intensity, followed by selective harvesting at low intensity. The plant community stability was far from the point of stability (20/80) under selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities, as well as with clear-cut harvesting. Of these treatments, clear-cut harvesting had the greatest effect with regard to reducing stability. Therefore, these results indicate that the selective harvesting at low and medium intensities is conducive to preserve or increase the species diversity and community stability. In order to prioritize promoting plant species diversity, clear-cut harvesting and selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities should be avoided with regard to this type of forest in this region.

515,tropconif,"Spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of species richness and abundance of woody plant functional groups in a tropical forest landscape of Hainan Island, south China","Tropical forests are among the most species-diverse ecosystems on Earth. Their structures and ecological functions are complex to understand. Functional group is defined as a group of species that play similar roles in an ecosystem. The functional group approach has been regarded as an effective way of linking the compositions of complex ecosystems with their ecological functions. To understand the variation of functional groups in species-rich ecosystems after disturbance, the present study investigated the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of woody plants in a typically fragmented natural forest landscape of Hainan Island in South China. The study area was classified into eight landscape types based on vegetation type, disturbance manner and the time of recovery. The woody plant species were aggregated into seven functional groups based on the growth form, successional status and plant size. The results gained from the present study showed that all functional groups, except for the emergent and canopy tree species, were present in all eight landscape types. Each landscape type had different numbers of dominant functional groups. There are similar species richness and stem abundance structure among functional groups between mid-successional clear cut lowland rainforest and old growth tropical coniferous forest. This similarity exists in selective logged lowland rainforest and old-growth lowland rainforest, as well as among landscape types of montane rainforest. The functional groups with the same successional status had similar patterns of species richness and stem abundance ratios among different landscape types. The variation patterns of functional groups along the successional stages in terms of species richness and stem abundance among the tropical lowland rainforest landscape types were more similar to each other than those in the tropical montane rainforest landscape types.

612,tropconif,Litter Decomposition as an Indicator of Stream Ecosystem Functioning at Local-to-ontinental Scales: Insights from the European RivFunction Project,"RivFunction is a pan-European initiative that started in 2002 and was aimed at establishing a novel functional-based approach to assessing the ecological status of rivers. Litter decomposition was chosen as the focal process because it plays a central role in stream ecosystems and is easy to study in the field. Impacts of two stressors that occur across the continent, nutrient pollution and modified riparian vegetation, were examined at >200 paired sites in nine European ecoregions. In response to the former, decomposition was dramatically slowed at both extremes of a 1000-fold nutrient gradient, indicating nutrient limitation in unpolluted sites, highly variable responses across Europe in moderately impacted streams, and inhibition via associated toxic and additional stressors in highly polluted streams. Riparian forest modification by clear cutting or replacement of natural vegetation by plantations (e.g. conifers, eucalyptus) or pasture produced similarly complex responses. Clear effects caused by specific riparian disturbances were observed in regionally focused studies, but general trends across different types of riparian modifications were not apparent, in part possibly because of important indirect effects. Complementary field and laboratory experiments were undertaken to tease apart the mechanistic drivers of the continental scale field bioassays by addressing the influence of litter, fungal and detritivore diversity. These revealed generally weak and context-dependent effects on decomposition, suggesting high levels of redundancy (and hence potential insurance mechanisms that can mitigate a degree of species loss) within the food web. Reduced species richness consistently increased decomposition variability, if not the absolute rate. Further field studies were aimed at identifying important sources of this variability (e.g. litter quality, temporal variability) to help constrain ranges of predicted decomposition rates in different field situations. Thus, although many details still need to be resolved, litter decomposition holds considerable potential in some circumstances to capture impairment of stream ecosystem functioning. For instance, species traits associated with the body size and metabolic capacity of the consumers were often the main driver at local scales, and these were often translated into important determinants of otherwise apparently contingent effects at larger scales. Key insights gained from conducting continental scale studies included resolving the apparent paradox of inconsistent relationships between nutrients and decomposition rates, as the full complex multidimensional picture emerged from the large-scale dataset, of which only seemingly contradictory fragments had been seen previously.",WOS:000399647700004,6,0.423499499,1,lit decomposit as an ind of stream ecosystem funct at loc to ontin scal insight from the europ rivfunct project rivfunct is a pan europ in that start in and was aim at est a novel funct bas approach to assess the ecolog stat of riv lit decomposit was chos as the foc process becaus it play a cent rol in stream ecosystem and is easy to study in the field impact of two stressors that occ across the contin nutry pollut and mod rip veget wer examin at pair sit in nin europ ecoreg in respons to the form decomposit was dram slow at both extrem of a fold nutry grady ind nutry limit in unpollut sit high vary respons across europ in mod impact streams and inhibit via assocy tox and addit stressors in high pollut streams rip forest mod by clear cut or replac of nat veget by plant e g con eucalypt or past produc simil complex respons clear effect caus by spec rip disturb wer observ in reg focus study but gen trend across diff typ of rip mod wer not app in part poss becaus of import indirect effect compl field and lab expery wer undertak to teas apart the mech driv of the contin scal field bioassay by address the influ of lit fung and detrit divers thes rev gen weak and context depend effect on decomposit suggest high level of redund and hent pot ins mech that can mitig a degr of specy loss within the food web reduc specy rich consist increas decomposit vary if not the absolv rat furth field study wer aim at ident import sourc of thi vary e g lit qual temp vary to help constrain rang of predict decomposit rat in diff field situ thu although many detail stil nee to be resolv lit decomposit hold consid pot in som circumst to capt impair of stream ecosystem funct for inst specy trait assocy with the body siz and metabol capac of the consum wer oft the main driv at loc scal and thes wer oft transl into import determin of otherw app cont effect at larg scal key insight gain from conduc contin scal study includ resolv the app paradox of inconsist rel between nutry and decomposit rat as the ful complex multidimend pict emerg from the larg scal dataset of which on seem contradict frag had been seen prevy,new,0.4229791755641905,0.3765123046075855,0.3534088441130992,0.3426288905702342,0.3395980094490155,0.3426226696346402,0.3514994251863994,0.3672930802025484,0.3929542094880026,0.4356968205439321,0.5152328707840838
714,tropconif,Conifer seedling response to northern temperate forest gaps,"Studies of gap dynamics have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of small-scale disturbance in forest ecosystems, but have been little used by foresters for predicting tree responses to partial cutting. Fifth year growth and survival of five commonly planted tree species were contrasted in canopy gaps (single-tree to 5000 m(2)), in the forest understory and in the open conditions of a clear-cut. There were strong and consistent trends in growth response among the tree species as gap size increased. Growth of all the species increased rapidly from small single-tree gaps to about 1000 m(2) gaps, but thereafter, showed little change up to 5000 m(2). Tree size and current growth rates for all species were highest in full open conditions. Performance of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the most light-demanding species, exceeded that of all other species in large gaps (1001-5000 m(2)) and clearcuts. In large and medium gaps (301-1000 m(2)), the largest trees of all species were found in the middle gap position and there was little difference between the sunny north and shady south positions, except for lodgepole pine which clearly grew poorly in the south position. Total size and growth rates of all species were nearly identical in small gaps (20-300 m(2)) and again in the forest understory. The light advantage expected off the north end of high latitude gaps was not a benefit for tree growth, suggesting that below-ground effects of canopy edge trees have an important influence on seedling growth in these forests. Differences in mortality among the tree species were evident, with the most light demanding species having the greatest early mortality in shaded areas of medium gaps, in small gaps and in the forest understory. Careful matching of tree species to gap size and gap position can minimize early mortality and maximize growth rates. Opening sizes need not be very large (0.1-0.2 ha or larger) in order for most tree species to achieve growth rates similar to those found in the open conditions of clearcuts.

812,tropconif,Site and neighborhood effects on growth of tree saplings in subtropical plantations (China),"Reforestation and afforestation often takes place in the form of monocultures. These have increasingly come under criticism due to their greater susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions and pathogens and because of the negative long-term impacts they have on soil fertility. Moreover, reservations have frequently been expressed as to whether monoculture is the only way to maximize biomass productivity. Subtropical forests in China are not only rich in tree species but are also diverse in terms of topography. However, historical clear-cutting and the high demand for wood have meant that considerable areas of these forests have been degraded or lost entirely. In recent years, great efforts have been made in subtropical China to restore and afforest vast areas. Nonetheless, conifer monoculture plantations are still prevalent owing to the lack of data on the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and the limited knowledge of the growth performance of native broad-leaved tree species in plantations in this region. In this study, we investigated the growth response of individual tree saplings in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment established in a highly heterogeneous environment in subtropical China (BEF-China). The experiment was established during the period November 2008 to April 2009 and incorporates a species pool of 24 tree species across 261 plots (0.067 ha each) and a broad richness gradient with 1-24 species per plot. Annual growth rates of tree height, stem diameter and crown width for 6723 saplings of 24 species in the third year after establishment were used as response variables. We analyzed the effects of initial size, local abiotic site conditions and local neighborhood on growth performance using mixed effects models. Initial size, local topographic (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation) and edaphic variables (total nitrogen, C/N ratio) as well as local neighborhood variables (competition index, Shannon index) were included as fixed effects. Random effects were plot and species identity. The results showed that growth performance of tree saplings was markedly species-specific and strongly affected by initial size and local site conditions. In this early stage of the experiment, local Shannon diversity did not yet explain a significant amount of variation in sapling growth. However, the significant effect of the increasing size of neighboring trees indicated that tree-tree interactions had already occurred. A greater investment in height growth at the expense of diameter growth suggested that light intercept is the priority for tree sapling growth. This study stresses the importance of better understanding the effects of local site conditions on initial growth in mixed-species plantations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

910,tropconif,Butterfly Community Composition Across a Successional Gradient in a Human-disturbed Afro-tropical Rain Forest,"Knowledge of the recovery of insect communities after forest disturbance in tropical Africa is very limited. Here, fruit-feeding butterflies in a tropical rain forest at Kibale National Park, Uganda, were used as a model system to uncover how, and how fast, insect communities recover after forest disturbance. We trapped butterflies monthly along a successional gradient for one year. Traps were placed in intact primary forest compartments, heavily logged forest compartments with and without arboricide treatment approximately 43years ago, and in conifer-clearcut compartments, ranging from 9 to 19years of age. The species richness, total abundance, diversity, dominance, and similarity of the community composition of butterflies in the eight compartments were compared with uni- and multivariate statistics. A total of 16,728 individuals representing 88 species were trapped during the study. Butterfly species richness, abundance, and diversity did not show an increasing trend along the successional gradient but species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate stages. There was monthly variation in species richness, abundance, diversity and composition. Butterfly community structure differed significantly among the eight successional stages and only a marginal directional change along the successional gradient emerged. The greatest number of indicator species and intact forest interior specialists were found in one of the primary forests. Our results show that forest disturbance has a long-term impact on the recovery of butterfly species composition, emphasizing the value of intact primary forests for butterfly conservation.",WOS:000332089400011,9,0.936484408,1,butterf commun composit across a success grady in a hum disturb afro trop rain forest knowledg of the recovery of insect commun aft forest disturb in trop afric is very limit her fruit fee butterf in a trop rain forest at kib nat park ugand wer us as a model system to uncov how and how fast insect commun recov aft forest disturb we trap butterf month along a success grady for on year trap wer plac in intact prim forest compart heavy log forest compart with and without arboricid tre approxim year ago and in con clearcut compart rang from to year of ag the specy rich tot abund divers domin and simil of the commun composit of butterf in the eight compart wer comp with un and mult stat a tot of individ repres specy wer trap dur the study butterf specy rich abund and divers did not show an increas trend along the success grady but specy rich and abund peak at intermedy stag ther was month vary in specy rich abund divers and composit butterf commun structure diff sign among the eight success stag and on a margin direct chang along the success grady emerg the greatest numb of ind specy and intact forest intery spec wer found in on of the prim forest our result show that forest disturb has a long term impact on the recovery of butterf specy composit emphas the valu of intact prim forest for butterf conserv,new,0.9350266558510382,0.9072892220561002,0.885522257571828,0.8682863744939671,0.8539915406889178,0.8415421555408077,0.8301995547582746,0.8193668849787995,0.8084081117651105,0.7963433086813422,0.7809584045497306
1010,tropconif,Native forest management in subtropical South America: long-term effects of logging and multiple-use on forest structure and diversity,"If logging and forest multiple-use are to be compatible with biodiversity conservation, then forest structure, composition and diversity must be expected to recover from the disturbance and eventually return to their former levels. Here we evaluate the long-term effects of selective logging and forest multiple-use on Southern Brazilian subtropical Araucaria mixed conifer-hardwood forest resilience at the landscape-scale. Long-term effects of different management regimes were compared between control undisturbed forests and forest stands subjected to early (55 years before this study) and recent (13 years) selective logging followed by undisturbed postharvest periods, and forest fragments subjected to selective logging followed by unregulated multiple-use by private landowners. Forest structure (tree density, basal area and height, and regeneration density) in early-logged areas was indistinguishable from control areas. Fragmentation and chronic disturbance, however, degraded forest fragments and kept them at early successional stages, with higher tree density, reduced basal area and scarce or absent regeneration. Mixed forests showed compositional resilience in the angiosperm component but not in the conifer component. Chronic disturbance kept forest fragments floristically away from mature and undisturbed secondary forests. Species richness in control and recently-logged plots did not differ significantly and was higher than richness in early-logged plots. Species richness was much reduced in degraded forest fragments. Density of the conifer Araucaria angustifolia, characteristic of the mature forest, was reduced in the fragments and in logged stands. We discuss how native forest management practices can be implemented to contribute positively to the conservation of the Araucaria mixed forest biodiversity.",WOS:000305228400004,10,0.932809366,1,nat forest man in subtrop sou americ long term effect of log and multipl us on forest structure and divers if log and forest multipl us ar to be compat with biodivers conserv then forest structure composit and divers must be expect to recov from the disturb and ev return to their form level her we evalu the long term effect of select log and forest multipl us on southern brazil subtrop araucar mix con hardwood forest resy at the landscap scal long term effect of diff man regim wer comp between control undisturb forest and forest stand subject to ear year bef thi study and rec year select log follow by undisturb postharvest period and forest frag subject to select log follow by unreg multipl us by priv landown forest structure tre dens bas are and height and reg dens in ear log area was indistinct from control area frag and chronic disturb howev degrad forest frag and kept them at ear success stag with high tre dens reduc bas are and scarc or abs reg mix forest show composit resy in the angiosperm compon but not in the con compon chronic disturb kept forest frag flor away from mat and undisturb second forest specy rich in control and rec log plot did not diff sign and was high than rich in ear log plot specy rich was much reduc in degrad forest frag dens of the con araucar angustifol charact of the mat forest was reduc in the frag and in log stand we discuss how nat forest man pract can be impl to contribut posit to the conserv of the araucar mix forest biodivers,new,0.946774377154107,0.9185780433652132,0.894836600944897,0.8753014585227994,0.8586594103547879,0.8438322068229227,0.8300049016176893,0.8164544158854717,0.8023333883141393,0.7862109376272325,0.7646872489611377
1116,tropconif,"Effects of forestry practices on vegetation structure and bird community of Kibale National Park, Uganda","I examined the lingering effects of past timber management practices on the vegetation structure and bird community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. I compared four forest treatments: unlogged native forest (UL), two that were selectively logged Lit low (LL) and high (HL) intensities in the 1960s, and a conifer plantation (PL). Forest-dependent birds were best represented at UL. LL was similar to UL in both vegetation structure and bird community cornposition, although some forest-dependent bird species were missing from the former. HL had significantly less canopy closure and lower tree density than other plots as a result of the combination of extensive secondary damage and natural disturbance patterns that prevented the reclosure of the forest canopy. Thirty-one percent of the forest-dependent bird species observed during the study were not detected Lit HL. At PL, bird species richness and bird abundance were about a third of those observed in other plots. There were significant correlations between heterogeneity of tree distribution (horizontal heterogeneity) and abundance and species richness of birds across plots. Abundance and species richness of all, forest-dependent, and forest generalist birds were highest in plots with intermediate measures of horizontal heterogeneity, which were mostly unlogged or lightly logged. If reduced-impact logging practices are not implemented during selective logging operations in tropical forests, consequent long-term changes in vegetation structure may result ill significant declines in the populations of some forest-dependent species, as was observed in Kibale National Park.

1211,tropconif,Changes in spider diversity through the growth cycle of pine plantations in the semi-deciduous Atlantic forest: The role of prey availability and abiotic conditions,"The replacement of native forests by tree plantations affects the diversity of biological communities, particularly in highly diverse tropical and subtropical ecosystems such as the semi-deciduous Atlantic forest. Previous studies in this ecosystem have focused on vertebrates, while only a few studies have been performed on the relationship between spiders and pine plantations. We aimed to estimate changes in spider richness and species composition over the course of a pine plantation forestry cycle of 15 years. We expected that the increase in environmental similarity (vegetation, prey availability) between native forest and tree plantations through the plantation growth cycle would promote its use by native spider species. We used six collection methods to characterize the spider assemblages and their potential prey in five replicates of native forest and pine plantations of three different ages representing the forest cycle (1-2, 5-6, 10-11 years old). Additionally, we described vegetation structure and recorded ground temperature and humidity during the sampling period. Analyses were carried out combining spiders from all sampling methods and independently on each vertical stratum. As expected, spider richness increased and the dissimilarity in relation to the native forest spider community decreased through the growth cycle of the pine plantation, associated with an increase in potential prey abundance and richness (but not vegetation structure). The response of spiders on each stratum showed interesting trends; opposite to the general pattern, in young plantations the ground strata exhibited a rich and distinctive spider assemblage while herbaceous strata showed similar diversity (richness and species composition) in all three plantation ages. Our results showed a rapid increase in spider richness in the first 6-7 years after plantation and a subsequent stabilization. Also, the proportion of native species in plantations increased from 6% in the first years to 34% and then remained constant until cutting age (11-12 years). Differences in species composition were mainly due to both differences in richness and species composition in young plantations, while in middle-aged and mature plantations it was mainly due to species replacement. The increase in prey abundance (and probably the increase in vegetation complexity and the decrease of extreme microclimatic conditions) through the plantation cycle increase the suitability for native forest species. However, a deeper understanding of the ecological and physiological requirements of spiders is necessary to improve the ability of tree plantations for native diversity.",WOS:000437967900050,12,0.8251348959999999,1,chang in spid divers through the grow cyc of pin plant in the sem decidu atl forest the rol of prey avail and abiot condit the replac of nat forest by tre plant affect the divers of biolog commun particul in high divers trop and subtrop ecosystem such as the sem decidu atl forest prevy study in thi ecosystem hav focus on vertebr whil on a few study hav been perform on the rel between spid and pin plant we aim to estim chang in spid rich and specy composit ov the cours of a pin plant forestry cyc of year we expect that the increas in environ simil veget prey avail between nat forest and tre plant through the plant grow cyc would promot it us by nat spid specy we us six collect method to charact the spid assembl and their pot prey in fiv reply of nat forest and pin plant of three diff ag repres the forest cyc year old addit we describ veget structure and record ground temp and humid dur the sampl period analys wer carry out combin spid from al sampl method and independ on each vert stratum as expect spid rich increas and the dissimil in rel to the nat forest spid commun decreas through the grow cyc of the pin plant assocy with an increas in pot prey abund and rich but not veget structure the respons of spid on each stratum show interest trend opposit to the gen pattern in young plant the ground strata exhibit a rich and distinct spid assembl whil herbac strata show simil divers rich and specy composit in al three plant ag our result show a rapid increas in spid rich in the first year aft plant and a subsequ stabl also the proport of nat specy in plant increas from in the first year to and then remain const until cut ag year diff in specy composit wer main due to both diff in rich and specy composit in young plant whil in middl ag and mat plant it was main due to specy replac the increas in prey abund and prob the increas in veget complex and the decreas of extrem microclim condit through the plant cyc increas the suit for nat forest specy howev a deep understand of the ecolog and physiolog requir of spid is necess to improv the abl of tre plant for nat divers,new,0.8628169475111183,0.7975038849861364,0.7479585935415318,0.7106459798522035,0.6816371132888123,0.6583923231724362,0.6394060140157405,0.6237921636264605,0.6111220061023237,0.6014855392935168,0.5961075841551854
1311,tropconif,Changes of dominant ground beetles in black pine forests with fire severity and successional age,"This study analyzes the effect of fire on the composition and abundance of ground beetles in Pinus nigra forests. We used pitfall traps to sample beetles in burned P.nigra forests in Catalonia (Spain). Since fire dramatically alters forest structure and composition and beetles follow vegetation changes, we expected drastic changes in beetle composition and abundance immediately after fire. Because P.nigra forests do not recover after fire, we also expected beetles in burned and unburned areas to differ along a chronosequence. Beetle abundance per plot increased in canopy-fire-burned areas, but per plot species richness, diversity, and dominance were not affected by fire. Species composition varied depending on fire intensity. Some species were associated with canopy fire and low vegetation cover. Other species were associated with shrub cover and time since fire. Finally, some species were not dependent on fire or vegetation cover. Beetle abundance in burned areas was independent of time since fire. This lack of medium-term convergence between burned and unburned P.nigra forest agrees with our second hypothesis. Given the increase in fire frequency and size in submediterranean areas and the observed slow recovery of beetle species, a decline ill beetle diversity at a regional scale is expected.",WOS:000261940600004,13,0.839891097,0,chang of domin ground beetl in black pin forest with fir sev and success ag thi study analys the effect of fir on the composit and abund of ground beetl in pin nigr forest we us pitfal trap to sampl beetl in burn p nigr forest in catalon spain sint fir dram alt forest structure and composit and beetl follow veget chang we expect drast chang in beetl composit and abund immedy aft fir becaus p nigr forest do not recov aft fir we also expect beetl in burn and unburn area to diff along a chronosequence beetl abund per plot increas in canop fir burn area but per plot specy rich divers and domin wer not affect by fir specy composit vary depend on fir intens som specy wer assocy with canop fir and low veget cov oth specy wer assocy with shrub cov and tim sint fir fin som specy wer not depend on fir or veget cov beetl abund in burn area was independ of tim sint fir thi lack of med term converg between burn and unburn p nigr forest agr with our second hypothes giv the increas in fir frequ and siz in submediter area and the observ slow recovery of beetl specy a declin il beetl divers at a reg scal is expect,new,0.8727680609918014,0.8051085080714183,0.7501451402253653,0.706574914623675,0.6712132477471227,0.6416254246658397,0.6161839508334092,0.5937489366368262,0.5734452590653534,0.5544521275822109,0.5356843103169708
1410,tropconif,Effect of forest management on temperate ant communities,"Human management of ecosystems can have direct or indirect effects on species communities. How species communities are affected by management is a key question in ecology and nature conservation. As keystone taxon, changes in ant communities can have sustained consequences for entire ecosystems. In forests, management has been shown to have an overall negative effect on ant communities in tropical and a positive effect in boreal forests. However, in temperate forests, it is unclear what components of forest management affect ant communities and how. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of forest management on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities in 150 temperate forest stands in three regions in Germany. Using a multi-model inference approach and structural equation models, we analyzed the effects of 18 variables, including variables of forest management, forest structure, arthropod diversity, and biomass, as well as abiotic factors, on ant species richness, abundance, and functional trait diversity (Rao's Q) based on morphological (FDM) and life-history traits (FDLH). In total, we found 28 ant species occurring on 120 plots. Main direct effects of forest management on ant abundance and species richness were caused by tree species selection, measured as dominant tree species. The main positive indirect effect was mediated by a reduced canopy cover with an increasing proportion of oak and pine, resulting in a higher temperature amplitude. Due to the low number of species in two regions, we analyzed functional diversity for the most ant species diverse region only. FDLH was affected positively by tree harvesting and negatively by structural complexity. FDM showed no response to forest management, potentially due to the low morphological diversity of temperate forest ants. Our results show that forest management practices in temperate forests strongly impact ant community structure. This can be beneficial for ants if management reduces the canopy cover, either by tree harvesting or by changing the tree species composition toward shade-intolerant tree species. To promote ant diversity as key taxon for maintaining ecosystem processes in forest ecosystems, we suggest to integrate forest stands with more open and warmer conditions in future management strategics.",WOS:000439997600019,14,0.902671294,1,effect of forest man on temp ant commun hum man of ecosystem can hav direct or indirect effect on specy commun how specy commun ar affect by man is a key quest in ecolog and nat conserv as keyston taxon chang in ant commun can hav sustain consequ for entir ecosystem in forest man has been shown to hav an overal neg effect on ant commun in trop and a posit effect in bor forest howev in temp forest it is unclear what compon of forest man affect ant commun and how thi study expl the direct and indirect effect of forest man on the taxonom and funct divers of ant commun in temp forest stand in three reg in germany us a mult model inf approach and structural equ model we analys the effect of vary includ vary of forest man forest structure arthropod divers and biomass as wel as abiot fact on ant specy rich abund and funct trait divers rao s q bas on morpholog fdm and lif hist trait fdlh in tot we found ant specy occur on plot main direct effect of forest man on ant abund and specy rich wer caus by tre specy select meas as domin tre specy the main posit indirect effect was medy by a reduc canop cov with an increas proport of oak and pin result in a high temp amplitud due to the low numb of specy in two reg we analys funct divers for the most ant specy divers reg on fdlh was affect posit by tre harvest and neg by structural complex fdm show no respons to forest man pot due to the low morpholog divers of temp forest ant our result show that forest man pract in temp forest strongly impact ant commun structure thi can be benef for ant if man reduc the canop cov eith by tre harvest or by chang the tre specy composit toward shad intol tre specy to promot ant divers as key taxon for maintain ecosystem process in forest ecosystem we suggest to integr forest stand with mor op and warm condit in fut man strategics,new,0.9349965429364603,0.8923113956247126,0.8536806111152518,0.8204620113459273,0.7915361224365474,0.7655710172502772,0.7414399982787525,0.7180709864685105,0.6941644138478217,0.66746706599133,0.632377138106749
158,tropconif,Characterization of Unexplored Deadwood Mycobiome in Highly Diverse Subtropical Forests Using Culture-independent Molecular Technique,"The deadwood mycobiome, also known as wood-inhabiting fungi (WIF), are among the key players in wood decomposition, having a large impact on nutrient cycling in forest soils. However, our knowledge of WIF richness and distribution patterns in different forest biomes is limited. Here, we used pyrotag sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region to characterize the deadwood mycobiome of two tree species with greatly different wood characteristics (Schima superba and Pinus massoniana) in a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. Specifically, we tested (i) the effects of tree species and wood quality properties on WIF OTU richness and community composition; (ii) the role of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the WIF communities; and (iii) the relationship between WIF OTU richness, community composition and decomposition rates. Due to different wood chemical properties, we hypothesized that the WIF communities derived from the two tree species would be correlated differently with biotic and abiotic factors. Our results show that deadwood in subtropical forests harbors diverse fungal communities comprising six ecological functional groups. We found interesting colonization patterns for this subtropical biome, where Resinicium spp. were highly detected in both broadleaved and coniferous deadwood. In addition, the members of Xylariales were frequently found in Schima. The two deadwood species differed significantly in WIF OTU richness (Pinus > Schima) and community composition (P < 0.001). Variations in WIF community composition of both tree species were significantly explained by wood pH and ecological factors (biotic: deadwood species, basal area and abiotic: soil pH), but the WIF communities derived from each tree species correlated differently with abiotic factors. Interestingly, we found that deadwood decomposition rate significantly correlated with WIF communities and negatively correlated with WIF OTU richness. We conclude that the pattern of WIF OTU richness and community composition are controlled by multiple interacting biotic and abiotic factors. Overall, our study provides an in-depth picture of the deadwood mycobiome in this subtropical forest. Furthermore, by comparing our results to results from temperate and boreal forests we contribute to a better understanding of patterns of WIF communities across different biomes and geographic locations.",WOS:000399525200001,15,0.6294556179999999,0,charact of unexpl deadwood mycobiom in high divers subtrop forest us cult independ molecul techn the deadwood mycobiom also known as wood inhabit fung wif ar among the key play in wood decomposit hav a larg impact on nutry cyc in forest soil howev our knowledg of wif rich and distribut pattern in diff forest biom is limit her we us pyrot sequ of the fung intern transcrib spac it reg to charact the deadwood mycobiom of two tre specy with gre diff wood charact schima superb and pin massonian in a chines subtrop forest ecosystem spec we test i the effect of tre specy and wood qual property on wif otu rich and commun composit ii the rol of biot and abiot fact in shap the wif commun and ii the rel between wif otu rich commun composit and decomposit rat due to diff wood chem property we hypothes that the wif commun der from the two tre specy would be correl diff with biot and abiot fact our result show that deadwood in subtrop forest harb divers fung commun compr six ecolog funct group we found interest colon pattern for thi subtrop biom wher resinic spp wer high detect in both broadleav and con deadwood in addit the memb of xyl wer frequ found in schima the two deadwood specy diff sign in wif otu rich pin schima and commun composit p vary in wif commun composit of both tre specy wer sign explain by wood ph and ecolog fact biot deadwood specy bas are and abiot soil ph but the wif commun der from each tre specy correl diff with abiot fact interest we found that deadwood decomposit rat sign correl with wif commun and neg correl with wif otu rich we conclud that the pattern of wif otu rich and commun composit ar control by multipl interact biot and abiot fact overal our study provid an in dep pict of the deadwood mycobiom in thi subtrop forest furtherm by comp our result to result from temp and bor forest we contribut to a bet understand of pattern of wif commun across diff biom and geograph loc,new,0.653765235679982,0.5653181006367354,0.5108326704440891,0.47613628537870034,0.453374895617144,0.4387057847942273,0.4303626817876763,0.4278799153294809,0.43209049095657526,0.4461738119568947,0.4800274071682974

We examined endophytes associated with healthy photosynthetic tissues of three closely related tree species in the Cupressaceae (Coniferales): two native species within their natural ranges [Juniperus virginiana in a mesic semideciduous forest, North Carolina (NC); Cupressus arizonica, under xeric conditions, Arizona (AZ)], and a non-native species planted in each site (Platycladus orientalis). Endophytes were recovered from 229 of 960 tissue segments and represented at least 35 species of Ascomycota. Isolation frequency was more than threefold greater for plants in NC than in AZ, and was 2.5 (AZ) to four (NC) times greater for non-native Platycladus than for Cupressus or Juniperus. Analyses of ITS rDNA for 109 representative isolates showed that endophyte diversity was more than twofold greater in NC than in AZ, and that endophytes recovered in AZ were more likely to be host-generalists relative to those in NC. Different endophyte genera dominated the assemblages of each host species/locality combination, but in both localities, Platycladus harboured less diverse and more cosmopolitan endophytes than did either native host. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses for four classes of Ascomycota (Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Eurotiomycetes) based on LSU rDNA data (ca 1.2 kb) showed that well-supported clades of endophytes frequently contained representatives of a single locality or host species, underscoring the importance of both geography and host identity in shaping a given plant's endophyte community. Together, our data show that not only do the abundance, diversity, and taxonomic composition of endophyte communities differ as a function of host identity and locality, but that host affinities of those communities are variable as well.

1710,tropconif,The saproxylic beetle assemblage-associated with different host trees in Southwest China,"Dead wood is a habitat for many insects and other small animals, some of which may be rare or endangered and in need of effective protection. In this paper, saproxylic beetle assemblages associated with different host trees in the subtropical forests in southwestern China were investigated. A total of 277 species (1439 specimens) in 36 beetle families were collected from 117 dead wood samples, of which 101 samples were identified and respectively belonged to 12 tree genera. The number of saproxylic beetle species varied greatly among logs of different tree genera, with the highest diversity on logs of Juglans. Generally, broad-leaved trees had a higher richness and abundance of saproxylic species than coniferous trees. Cluster analysis revealed that assemblages from broad-leaved tree genera were generally similar (except for Betula) and assemblages from coniferous trees formed another distinct cluster. The subsequent indicator analysis proposed that there are different characteristic species for different cluster groups of host tree genera. In our study, log diameter has no positive influence on beetle species density. Conversely, comparisons of individual-based rarefaction curves suggested that beetle species richness was highest in the small diameter class both in coniferous and broad-leaved tree genera. With increased wood decay, proportion of habitat specialists (saproxylic beetles living on one tree genus) decreased, whereas proportion of habitat generalists (living on more than three tree genera) increased. The beetle species density was found to be higher in early stages, and decreased in later stages as well. A negative influence of altitude on saproxylic beetle species richness and abundance was detected. It was indicated that different tree genera and altitudes possibly display cross effects in modulating the altitudinal distribution and host preference of the beetles.",WOS:000256312700008,17,0.7406050540000001,0,the saproxyl beetl assembl assocy with diff host tre in southwest chin dead wood is a habit for many insect and oth smal anim som of which may be rar or endang and in nee of effect protect in thi pap saproxyl beetl assembl assocy with diff host tre in the subtrop forest in southwestern chin wer investig a tot of specy specim in beetl famy wer collect from dead wood sampl of which sampl wer ident and respect belong to tre gener the numb of saproxyl beetl specy vary gre among log of diff tre gener with the highest divers on log of jugl gen broad leav tre had a high rich and abund of saproxyl specy than con tre clust analys rev that assembl from broad leav tre gener wer gen simil exceiv for betul and assembl from con tre form anoth distinct clust the subsequ ind analys propos that ther ar diff charact specy for diff clust group of host tre gener in our study log diamet has no posit influ on beetl specy dens convers comparison of individ bas rarefact curv suggest that beetl specy rich was highest in the smal diamet class both in con and broad leav tre gener with increas wood decay proport of habit spec saproxyl beetl liv on on tre gen decreas wherea proport of habit gen liv on mor than three tre gener increas the beetl specy dens was found to be high in ear stag and decreas in lat stag as wel a neg influ of altitud on saproxyl beetl specy rich and abund was detect it was ind that diff tre gener and altitud poss display cross effect in mod the altitudin distribut and host pref of the beetl,new,0.7706057815123363,0.7128833547761213,0.6735523375564515,0.6473591190175482,0.630117000105195,0.6193652566314733,0.613928518229367,0.6135787021946021,0.6191355397435184,0.6333624002535385,0.6643164442410808
1810,tropconif,"Pervasive, long-lasting impact of historical logging on composition, diversity and above ground carbon stocks in Afrotemperate forest","Understanding the rate and extent of forest recovery from major disturbance events enable forest managers to establish conservation priorities and allocate limited resources for their management. We examined the extent to which Afrotemperate forest has recovered from widespread, stand-levelling logging that followed the European settlement of south eastern South Africa approximately 150 years ago. We used plot-based tree census data to compare ecological characteristics (diversity, composition, structure) of primary, secondary and degraded Afrotemperate forests. Forests impacted by colonial logging events show no evidence of converging on the composition and above ground standing stock of old-growth forests. Primary forest canopies were dominated by two conifer species (Podocarpaceae) and a suite of long-lived pioneer angiosperms dominated the canopies of secondary forests. Old-growth canopy trees (>= 20 cm dbh) were taller (similar to 26 m vs similar to 16 m) and had broader girths (similar to 94 cm vs similar to 54 cm) compared with those in secondary forest. Canopy tree size differences translated to considerable (2 to 3-fold) differences in above ground carbon: we estimated that primary forest stores >240 Mg C ha(-1) compared with the range of 80.7-114.3 Mg C ha(-1) estimated for the two secondary forests and 84.3 Mg C ha(-1) for the degraded forest. Measures of rarefied species richness and diversity (Shannon exponential) were markedly lower for primary forest canopy trees, consistent with the proposition that the composition of Afrotemperate forests converges on podocarp dominance at the old-growth stage. In contrast, diversity measures for small (2.5-10.0 cm dbh) and medium (10.1-19.9 cm dbh) trees were noticeably higher in secondary and degraded forests indicating the considerable conservation value of these formerly disturbed forests.

1911,tropconif,The community structures of the coniferous and deciduous dead wood-dwelling arthropods in Korea,"We examined the structure of the arthropod community among deciduous and coniferous dead woods along the process of wood decay. We collected dead wood-dwelling arthropods from April 2010 to October 2011 by using a vacuum aspirator and an electric chain saw in three areas (Mt. Woonak, Mt. Wolchul, Mt. Jingang) in Korea. We identified them to species levels and classified them into functional groups. We collected 8792 arthropods (5 classes, 20 orders, 58 families, and 93 species). The species richness and abundance of arthropods increased with the progress of decay in dead woods. The evenness index seemed to be shown at a lower value at late decay stage than at early- and mid-decay stages. The diversity index (H) in conifers was lower than that in deciduous dead woods at the early decay stage but this situation was reversed at the late decay stage. Arthropod communities of functional groups, except the xylophagous insects, did not differ in the variables, but the proportion of xylophagous insects increased as the decay stages progressed. The abundance of arthropods and xylophagous was statistically significantly different. The patterns generated by non-metric multidimensional scaling in the overall arthropod community composition revealed that the species composition between study areas were significantly different. We confirmed that dead woods play very important roles as arthropods' habitats.

2110,tropconif,Effects of management on understory diversity in the forest ecosystems of Northern Spain,"Pine plantations are an alternative to marginal agriculture in many countries, and are often presented as an option that improves biodiversity. However, these plantations can have adverse environmental effects if improperly managed. To evaluate the effect of forest management practices on biodiversity, the diversity, species richness, dominance and frequency of understory woody plant species in different forests of the Basque Country (northern Spain) were compared. Plantations of exotic conifers (Pinus radiata [D.] Don) of different ages were compared with deciduous forests of Quercus robur L. and Fagus sylvatica L. The effects of different types and intensities of management were taken into account. The differences observed were mainly conditioned by the intensity of forestry management, although the response varied according to forest type and age. In unmanaged pine plantations, the diversity and species richness of the understory increased rapidly after planting (while dominance decreased), remained stable in the intermediate age range, and reached a maximum in plantations more than 25 years of age. Management practices resulted in decreased understory diversity and species richness, as well as greater dominance. This was more pronounced in younger than in older stands. Moderate management, however, favored a greater diversity of the understory in deciduous forests. The species composition of the plantations and deciduous forests were different, the latter having a wider range of characteristic species. Knowledge of how forestry practices influence biodiversity (in terms of diversity, richness, dominance, and species composition) may allow predictions to be made about the diversity achievable with different management systems.",WOS:000227236800005,21,0.882087892,1,effect of man on underst divers in the forest ecosystem of northern spain pin plant ar an altern to margin agricult in many country and ar oft pres as an opt that improv biodivers howev thes plant can hav advers environ effect if improp man to evalu the effect of forest man pract on biodivers the divers specy rich domin and frequ of underst woody plant specy in diff forest of the basqu country northern spain wer comp plant of exot con pin radiat d don of diff ag wer comp with decidu forest of querc rob l and fag sylvatic l the effect of diff typ and intens of man wer tak into account the diff observ wer main condit by the intens of forestry man although the respons vary accord to forest typ and ag in unm pin plant the divers and specy rich of the underst increas rapid aft plant whil domin decreas remain stabl in the intermedy ag rang and reach a maxim in plant mor than year of ag man pract result in decreas underst divers and specy rich as wel as gre domin thi was mor pronount in young than in old stand mod man howev fav a gre divers of the underst in decidu forest the specy composit of the plant and decidu forest wer diff the lat hav a wid rang of charact specy knowledg of how forestry pract influ biodivers in term of divers rich domin and specy composit may allow predict to be mad about the divers achiev with diff man system,new,0.915971151255309,0.8807580913804653,0.8540690563605425,0.8336164591345154,0.8172307447512143,0.8035053241046178,0.7915624378970151,0.7807795165037809,0.7706241352491487,0.7604478566523631,0.7489717277092651
30,tropconif,Diversity of the Bialowieza Forest avifauna in space and time,"The Bialowieza Forest (BF) is an extensive and relatively little changed forest complex on the Polish-Belarussian border. Data on the structure and diversity of its breeding avifauna have mostly been collected in primeval old-growth stands, preserved within the Bialowieza National Park (BNP). Mapping censuses repeated in space (plots, replicated in riverine, oak-lime-hornbeam and coniferous stands) and time (permanent plots, 28 years) reveal that the breeding bird assemblages are rich in species (29-52/season in a 25 to 33-ha plot), but of moderate overall density (40-120 pairs/10 ha). The latter is due to low, lower than in man-transformed areas, densities of the majority of particular species. Despite marked changes in vegetation structure, the composition of the breeding bird assemblage does not vary much across different primeval forest types, with a single breeding bird community inhabiting all of them, including treefall gaps. High richness of the BF avifauna stems from the Forest's geographical locality, as well as from a high level of the primeval avifauna retention. Over 95% of the 135-140 pristine species still breed there. Especially species-rich groups are birds of prey, owls, woodpeckers and Sylvinae warblers. Bird communities in the BNP and primeval tropical rain forests share many features, suggesting that natural differences between temperate and tropical forests were less pronounced in the past. The combination of high species richness with low densities of individual species is probably a feature of all pristine forests, independent of climatic zone. The BF avifauna must once have been typical of the ancient European forests and it has become so exceptional chiefly because it has preserved most of its pristine features. The BF thus constitutes an indispensable reference site for future studies of woodland bird biology. To ensure its survival should become a priority. Commercial logging, taking place over 80% of the Polish BF part, severely changes the Forest's structure and strongly affects the birds, especially species which depend on dead wood (Dendrocopos leucotos, Picoides tridactylus) and on old-growth stands. The small area protected as the BNP becomes an increasingly isolated ""island"", in which preservation of the primeval forest features seems to be impossible.

541,tropconif,"Forest vegetation responses to climate and environmental change: A case study from Changbai Mountain, NE China","The distribution of plant species has always been altered by changing climatic conditions. Nonetheless, the potential for species' range shift responses has recently become severely limited, as exceptionally fast temperature changes coincide with a high degree of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. This study provides rare insights into the effects current temperature increases have on pristine temperate forest ecosystems, using the forests of Changbai Mountain, NE China, as a case study. On the northern slopes of the mountain at elevations between 750 and 2100 m, the composition of trees, shrubs and herbaceous species was recorded on 60 plots in 1963 and 2006/07. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to establish the response of plant diversity and plant distribution patterns to environmental conditions. Climatic factors proved important in explaining the spatio-temporal trends within the vegetation. The composition of dominant trees remained mostly unchanged over the last 43 years, reflecting a very slow response of the forest canopy to environmental change. The composition of young trees, shrubs and herb species showed varied changes in the different forest types. A homogeneous species composition in the cohort of regenerating trees indicates an increased future uniformity in the mixed broadleaved and coniferous forest. The understory vegetation of high elevation birch forests was invaded by floristic elements of the lower-elevation coniferous forests. Both these trends pose potential threats to forests plant diversity. Future research investigating climate change responses in forest canopy composition needs to be based on even longer timescales, while investigations in the near future need to pay particular attention to the changes in the distribution of rare and threatened herbaceous species.

60,tropconif,"Vascular diversity patterns of forest ecosystem before and after a 43-year interval under changing climate conditions in the Changbaishan Nature Reserve, northeastern China","The Changbaishan Nature Reserve (CNR) is the largest protected temperate forest in the world. It was established in 1960 to protect the virgin Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) mixed hardwood forest, a typical temperate forest of northeast China. Studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forest (800-1700 m a.s.l.) were conducted in 1963 and in 2006. The aim of this comparison was to assess the long-term effects of the protected status on plant biodiversity during the intervening 43 years. The research was carried out in three forest types: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found to differ for the same elevations and forest types after the 43-year interval, while the beta diversity indicated by the Cody index depicted the altitudinal patterns of plant species gain and loss. The floral compositional pattern and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layer, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF. However, originally dominant species, such as Pinus koraiensis, tended to decline, the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers showed a trend to shift to higher altitudes.

701,tropconif,Plantation forests and biodiversity: oxymoron or opportunity?,"Losses of natural and semi-natural forests, mostly to agriculture, are a significant concern for biodiversity. Against this trend, the area of intensively managed plantation forests increases, and there is much debate about the implications for biodiversity. We provide a comprehensive review of the function of plantation forests as habitat compared with other land cover, examine the effects on biodiversity at the landscape scale, and synthesise context-specific effects of plantation forestry on biodiversity. Natural forests are usually more suitable as habitat for a wider range of native forest species than plantation forests but there is abundant evidence that plantation forests can provide valuable habitat, even for some threatened and endangered species, and may contribute to the conservation of biodiversity by various mechanisms. In landscapes where forest is the natural land cover, plantation forests may represent a low-contrast matrix, and afforestation of agricultural land can assist conservation by providing complementary forest habitat, buffering edge effects, and increasing connectivity. In contrast, conversion of natural forests and afforestation of natural non-forest land is detrimental. However, regional deforestation pressure for agricultural development may render plantation forestry a 'lesser evil' if forest managers protect indigenous vegetation remnants. We provide numerous context-specific examples and case studies to assist impact assessments of plantation forestry, and we offer a range of management recommendations.

872,tropconif,Edge influence on vegetation at natural and anthropogenic edges of boreal forests in Canada and Fennoscandia,"Although anthropogenic edges are an important consequence of timber harvesting, edges due to natural disturbances or landscape heterogeneity are also common. Forest edges have been well studied in temperate and tropical forests, but less so in less productive, disturbance-adapted boreal forests. We synthesized data on forest vegetation at edges of boreal forests and compared edge influence among edge types (fire, cut, lake/wetland; old vs. young), forest types (broadleaf vs. coniferous) and geographic regions. Our objectives were to quantify vegetation responses at edges of all types and to compare the strength and extent of edge influence among different types of edges and forests. Research was conducted using the same general sampling design in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in Sweden and Finland. We conducted a meta-analysis for a variety of response variables including forest structure, deadwood abundance, regeneration, understorey abundance and diversity, and non-vascular plant cover. We also determined the magnitude and distance of edge influence (DEI) using randomization tests. Some edge responses (lower tree basal area, tree canopy and bryophyte cover; more logs; higher regeneration) were significant overall across studies. Edge influence on ground vegetation in boreal forests was generally weak, not very extensive (DEI usually <20m) and decreased with time. We found more extensive edge influence at natural edges, at younger edges and in broadleaf forests. The comparison among regions revealed weaker edge influence in Fennoscandian forests.Synthesis. Edges created by forest harvesting do not appear to have as strong, extensive or persistent influence on vegetation in boreal as in tropical or temperate forested ecosystems. We attribute this apparent resistance to shorter canopy heights, inherent heterogeneity in boreal forests and their adaptation to frequent natural disturbance. Nevertheless, notable differences between forest structure responses to natural (fire) and anthropogenic (cut) edges raise concerns about biodiversity implications of extensive creation of anthropogenic edges. By highlighting universal responses to edge influence in boreal forests that are significant irrespective of edge or forest type, and those which vary by edge type, we provide a context for the conservation of boreal forests.",WOS:000353640500003,87,0.822623503,1,edg influ on veget at nat and anthropog edg of bor forest in canad and fennoscand although anthropog edg ar an import consequ of timb harvest edg due to nat disturb or landscap heterog ar also common forest edg hav been wel study in temp and trop forest but less so in less produc disturb adapt bor forest we synthes dat on forest veget at edg of bor forest and comp edg influ among edg typ fir cut lak wetland old vs young forest typ broadleaf vs con and geograph reg our object wer to quant veget respons at edg of al typ and to comp the strength and ext of edg influ among diff typ of edg and forest research was conduc us the sam gen sampl design in albert ontario and quebec in canad and in swed and finland we conduc a met analys for a vary of respons vary includ forest structure deadwood abund reg understorey abund and divers and non vascul plant cov we also determin the magnitud and dist of edg influ dei us random test som edg respons low tre bas are tre canop and bryophyt cov mor log high reg wer sign overal across study edg influ on ground veget in bor forest was gen weak not very extend dei us m and decreas with tim we found mor extend edg influ at nat edg at young edg and in broadleaf forest the comparison among reg rev weak edg influ in fennoscand forest synthes edg cre by forest harvest do not appear to hav as strong extend or persist influ on veget in bor as in trop or temp forest ecosystem we attribut thi app resist to short canop height inh heterog in bor forest and their adapt to frequ nat disturb nevertheless not diff between forest structure respons to nat fir and anthropog cut edg rais concern about biodivers imply of extend cre of anthropog edg by highlight univers respons to edg influ in bor forest that ar sign irrespect of edg or forest typ and thos which vary by edg typ we provid a context for the conserv of bor forest,new,0.8628502562331817,0.7711883222117258,0.6968232612894721,0.6407984153743853,0.5980380614762543,0.5645176497166345,0.53770638833909,0.5161156804805901,0.49903219622272105,0.48663891209593446,0.4811735182497055
1551,tropconif,"Forest landscape pattern in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa: 50 years of change or stasis?","Understanding patterns and processes of habitat change is essential for managing and conserving forest fragments in anthropogenically altered landscapes. Digitized aerial photographs from 1944 and 1996 were examined for changes to the indigenous forest landscape in the Karkloof-Balgowan archipelago in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Attributes relating to proximate land-use, patch shape, isolation and position in the landscape were used to determine putative causes of forest change. The total change in forest area was -5.7% (forest covered 6739 ha in 1996). This is contrasted with previous reports for the period 1880-1940 that estimated change in total forest area of up to -80%. Attrition was the predominant process of forest transformation between 1944 and 1996. Despite little overall change in forest area, 786 mostly small (<0.5 ha) forest patches were lost from the landscape, leaving 1277 forest patches in 1996. An increase in patch isolation, but no change in patch cohesion accompanied the changes in forest area. Ignoring patches that were eliminated, 514 patches decreased in area. This was partly a function of patch size, but the conversion of natural grassland to commercial plantation forestry in the matrix also influenced forest decline. Their small size and irregular shape caused forest patches in the region to be vulnerable to edge effects. Core area declined in a negative exponential way with increasing edge width and the total area of edge habitat exceeded that of core habitat at an edge width of only 50 m. Nevertheless, total core area decreased by only 2%, (65 ha) between 1944 and 1996 because most of the eliminated patches were small and contained no core area. The large Karkloof forest (1649 ha) is a conservation priority for forest interior species, but the ecological role and biodiversity value of small forest patches should not be overlooked.",WOS:000226516800002,155,0.898351059,0,forest landscap pattern in the kwazulu nat midland sou afric year of chang or stas understand pattern and process of habit chang is ess for man and conserv forest frag in anthropog alt landscap digit aer photograph from and wer examin for chang to the indig forest landscap in the karkloof balgow archipelago in kwazulu nat sou afric attribut rel to proxim land us patch shap isol and posit in the landscap wer us to determin put caus of forest chang the tot chang in forest are was forest cov ha in thi is contrast with prevy report for the period that estim chang in tot forest are of up to attrit was the predomin process of forest transform between and despit littl overal chang in forest are most smal ha forest patch wer lost from the landscap leav forest patch in an increas in patch isol but no chang in patch coher accompany the chang in forest are ign patch that wer elimin patch decreas in are thi was part a funct of patch siz but the convert of nat grassland to commerc plant forestry in the matrix also influ forest declin their smal siz and irregul shap caus forest patch in the reg to be vuln to edg effect cor are declin in a neg expon way with increas edg wid and the tot are of edg habit excess that of cor habit at an edg wid of on m nevertheless tot cor are decreas by on ha between and becaus most of the elimin patch wer smal and contain no cor are the larg karkloof forest ha is a conserv pri for forest intery specy but the ecolog rol and biodivers valu of smal forest patch should not be overlook,new,0.8999032329942113,0.8152316136360848,0.7379960722121578,0.675381740180339,0.6251960879047188,0.5842116762592806,0.5499765634393763,0.5207391808863134,0.4952091478320173,0.47230339689308193,0.45094346100093957
220,tropgrass,Tree monocultures in a biodiversity hotspot: Impact of pine plantations on mammal and bird assemblages in the Atlantic Forest,"Forest plantations of fast-growing exotic species constitute an important economic activity in tropical and temperate regions of developing countries. Large areas of native forests and grasslands are being turned into tree plantations without assessing their impacts on natural communities. We evaluated the effects of replacing native forests by non-native pine (Pinus taeda) plantations on the diversity and composition of assemblages of terrestrial mammals and ground-dwelling and understory birds, in a forest productive landscape of the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina. Camera-trap stations were deployed in three different ""environments"": 53 in a continuous forest, 69 in forest fragments, and 62 in tree plantations. The evaluation focused on the effect of the environment, the structural complexity of the vegetation, the cost-distance (distance weighted by connectivity) to the continuous forest, the percentage of native forest within different radii, and the cost of human access (as a proxy for hunting pressure) on both mean species richness per station and species composition. Alpha diversity of the assemblages of each environment was estimated using Hill numbers (effective number of species): (q(0) = richness, q(1) = number of common species and q(2) = number of dominant species. Changes in community composition were evaluated by comparing the assemblages of the three environments using three similarity indices: Sorensen (q(0) = similarity in species identity), Horn (q(1) = similarity in common species), and Morisita-Horn (q(2) = similarity in dominant species). For mammals and birds, richness was significantly higher in forest stations (both continuous and fragmented) than in those located in plantations. For both taxa, it also decreased with the distance to the continuous forest (but with a negative quadratic term in birds). Tree plantation stands contained biased and impoverished subsets of the original assemblages. Mammal composition was affected by the environment, the distance to the continuous forest, the proportion of native forest in the landscape, and human access. The bird assemblages of plantations were seriously affected, and their composition was also influenced by changes in vegetation structure. Alternative management practices (e.g. pruning, thinning) and landscape features can partially mitigate the negative effect of tree plantations on mammal and bird assemblages. Large areas of forest that function as population sources and forest fragments immersed in the matrix of plantations are strictly necessary to preserve the original native mammal and bird assemblages in the productive landscape. Promoting connectivity and improving hunting controls will also support their conservation.",WOS:000437967900021,206,0.953668893,1,tre monocult in a biodivers hotspot impact of pin plant on mam and bird assembl in the atl forest forest plant of fast grow exot specy constitut an import econom act in trop and temp reg of develop country larg area of nat forest and grassland ar being turn into tre plant without assess their impact on nat commun we evalu the effect of replac nat forest by non nat pin pin taed plant on the divers and composit of assembl of terrest mam and ground dwel and underst bird in a forest produc landscap of the up paran atl forest of mis argentin camer trap stat wer deploy in three diff environ in a continu forest in forest frag and in tre plant the evalu focus on the effect of the environ the structural complex of the veget the cost dist dist weight by connect to the continu forest the perc of nat forest within diff radi and the cost of hum access as a proxy for hunt press on both mean specy rich per stat and specy composit alph divers of the assembl of each environ was estim us hil numb effect numb of specy q rich q numb of common specy and q numb of domin specy chang in commun composit wer evalu by comp the assembl of the three environ us three simil ind sorens q simil in specy id horn q simil in common specy and morisit horn q simil in domin specy for mam and bird rich was sign high in forest stat both continu and frag than in thos loc in plant for both tax it also decreas with the dist to the continu forest but with a neg quadr term in bird tre plant stand contain bias and impov subset of the origin assembl mam composit was affect by the environ the dist to the continu forest the proport of nat forest in the landscap and hum access the bird assembl of plant wer sery affect and their composit was also influ by chang in veget structure altern man pract e g prun thin and landscap feat can part mitig the neg effect of tre plant on mam and bird assembl larg area of forest that funct as pop sourc and forest frag immers in the matrix of plant ar strictly necess to preserv the origin nat mam and bird assembl in the produc landscap promot connect and improv hunt control wil also support their conserv,new,0.9658038958448055,0.9417010746650638,0.9194723554714543,0.899818426030332,0.8819434598903313,0.8649757539262144,0.8480681466580385,0.8302464322713915,0.8100297659543606,0.7844046775944347,0.7451484192920419
319,tropgrass,Land rehabilitation and the conservation of birds in a degraded Afromontane landscape in northern Ethiopia,"The few remaining Afromontane forest fragments in northern Ethiopia and the surrounding degraded, semiarid matrix form a habitat mosaic of varying suitability for forest birds. To evaluate the effect of recent land rehabilitation efforts on bird community composition and diversity, we studied bird species distributions in ten small forest fragments (0.40-20.95 ha), five grazing exclosures (10-year-old forest restoration areas without wood extraction and grazing livestock) and three grazed matrix sites during the rainy season (July-October 2004) using 277 one-hour species counts. Based on the distribution pattern of 146 bird species, sites were assigned to one of three bird communities (birds of moist forest, dry forest or degraded savanna), each occupying a well-defined position along an environmental gradient reflecting decreasing vegetation structure and density. All three communities were representative of the avifauna of Afrotropical Highland open forest and woodland with a high proportion of invasive and competitive generalist species (31%). Apart from these, exclosures shared more species with forest fragments (20%) than did the grazed matrix (5%), indicating local ecosystem recovery. By increasing habitat heterogeneity, exclosures have the potential to enhance landscape connectivity for forest birds and are, therefore, an effective instrument for conserving species in a fragmented landscape. However, 52 bird species (36%) occurred exclusively within forest patches and many forest birds that use exclosures are unlikely to maintain viable populations when forest fragments disappear, particularly as forest fragments may be a critical resource during the hot dry season. This highlights the high conservation value of small isolated forest fragments for less tolerant, forest-limited and/or biome-restricted species.",WOS:000252302300005,12,0.953613425,1,land rehabilit and the conserv of bird in a degrad afromont landscap in northern ethiop the few remain afromont forest frag in northern ethiop and the surround degrad semiarid matrix form a habit mosa of vary suit for forest bird to evalu the effect of rec land rehabilit effort on bird commun composit and divers we study bird specy distribut in ten smal forest frag ha fiv graz exclos year old forest rest area without wood extract and graz livestock and three graz matrix sit dur the rainy season july octob us on hour specy count bas on the distribut pattern of bird specy sit wer assign to on of three bird commun bird of moist forest dry forest or degrad savann each occupy a wel defin posit along an environ grady reflect decreas veget structure and dens al three commun wer repres of the avifaun of afrotrop highland op forest and woodland with a high proport of invas and competit gen specy apart from thes exclos shar mor specy with forest frag than did the graz matrix ind loc ecosystem recovery by increas habit heterog exclos hav the pot to enh landscap connect for forest bird and ar theref an effect instru for conserv specy in a frag landscap howev bird specy occur exclud within forest patch and many forest bird that us exclos ar unlik to maintain viabl pop when forest frag disappear particul as forest frag may be a crit resourc dur the hot dry season thi highlight the high conserv valu of smal isol forest frag for less tol forest limit and or biom restrict specy,new,0.9650775748885838,0.9396883159836928,0.9154409475044729,0.8933992422320753,0.872984670799319,0.8533885144402604,0.8337404860154317,0.8129822774631597,0.7894527415990216,0.7597286755360129,0.7145160867661005
411,tropgrass,Species composition and diversity of small Afromontane forest fragments in northern Ethiopia,"In the highlands of northern Ethiopia, remnants of the original Afromontane forest vegetation are largely restricted to church yards and other sacred groves in a matrix of cropland and semiarid degraded savanna. To assess the potential for natural forest regeneration, species composition and diversity of all forest fragments (10) in a study area of 13,000 ha were analyzed in relation to environmental and soil variables. Using a random design and a density of approximately one plot per 2 ha in all fragments, 31 20x20 m plots were sampled. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests yielded five communities representing two forest types and one degraded savanna habitat. The forest fragments had a species-poor tree and shrub community in which plots were rather homogeneous and most species abundant. NMDS and analysis of variance indicated that a topographical gradient correlated to soil phosphorus, soil depth, stoniness and the proximity to the river system explained the major differences in species composition and separated moist and dry Afromontane forest communities. The grazing intensity further partitioned the habitats. Present communities and their environmental correlates indicate that the secondary climax forest in the area probably consisted of dry Afromontane forest interlaced by broad strips of moist Afromontane forest along rivers and streams and not a continuous, mono-dominant Juniperus forest as is often presumed. Negative effects of the degraded matrix on forest fragments increased with decreasing patch area and increasing shape irregularity. Nevertheless, all remaining fragments are important for their role in the landscape ecology of the region as refuges and species pools and should be protected and managed accordingly. If seed dispersal from forest fragments into exclosures and subsequent tree recruitment are both successful, the vegetation type most likely to establish is Afromontane savanna woodland, and if managed properly, eventually dry Afromontane forest may arise. Increasing the size of small patches and placing forest plantations and exclosures in the vicinity of small forest fragments is expected to yield the most immediate results. This approach may increase the likelihood of patch colonisation by frugivorous forest birds and thus foster the regeneration of native woody species.",WOS:000241164000010,62,0.940394996,1,specy composit and divers of smal afromont forest frag in northern ethiop in the highland of northern ethiop remn of the origin afromont forest veget ar larg restrict to church yard and oth sacr grov in a matrix of cropland and semiarid degrad savann to assess the pot for nat forest reg specy composit and divers of al forest frag in a study are of ha wer analys in rel to environ and soil vary us a random design and a dens of approxim on plot per ha in al frag x m plot wer sampl ind specy analys and mrpp test yield fiv commun repres two forest typ and on degrad savann habit the forest frag had a specy poor tre and shrub commun in which plot wer rath homog and most specy abund nmds and analys of vary ind that a topograph grady correl to soil phosphor soil dep stony and the proxim to the riv system explain the maj diff in specy composit and sep moist and dry afromont forest commun the graz intens furth partit the habit pres commun and their environ correl ind that the second climax forest in the are prob consist of dry afromont forest interlac by broad strips of moist afromont forest along riv and streams and not a continu mono domin juniper forest as is oft presum neg effect of the degrad matrix on forest frag increas with decreas patch are and increas shap irregul nevertheless al remain frag ar import for their rol in the landscap ecolog of the reg as refug and specy pool and should be protect and man accord if see dispers from forest frag into exclos and subsequ tre recruit ar both success the veget typ most lik to est is afromont savann woodland and if man prop ev dry afromont forest may ar increas the siz of smal patch and plac forest plant and exclos in the vicin of smal forest frag is expect to yield the most immedy result thi approach may increas the lik of patch colon by frug forest bird and thu fost the reg of nat woody specy,new,0.9514096657808251,0.9081536984571614,0.8653556331884965,0.8264011140844196,0.7908653800595526,0.7576377576853235,0.725499474220364,0.6930555352345475,0.658290729890667,0.617315095180154,0.5602086126337205
516,tropgrass,Matrix effects on bird assemblages in fragmented Afromontane forests in South Africa,"We examine the effects of matrix type on forest bird species richness in historically fragmented forests of the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa. Bird species-area relationships for forest fragments within natural grassland were compared with those surrounded by plantation forestry (Pinus spp.). While fragments in grasslands displayed a species-area effect, no such effect (slope similar to0) was detected for fragments in plantations. The critical fragment size to avoid an island effect on species richness was 302 ha for fragments in grasslands, and contained 51 of the 61 forest bird species encountered. Small forest fragments (<50 ha) within grasslands were less species-rich than those surrounded by plantation, while the reverse was true for forests larger than 50 ha. Bird density was significantly lower in larger forest patches within plantation when compared to those in grassland. However, a slight decline in species density with increasing species richness in a patch (i.e. weak density compensation) characterised only those bird assemblages surrounded by a grassland matrix, suggesting these are approaching species saturation. Commercial plantations may increase the likelihood of colonisation of, and immigration from, small forest fragments by birds, reducing the incidence of area-dependent extinction in small fragments, but may also result in lower species richness in larger fragments. The latter is likely a consequence of the promotion by plantations of a wider distribution of generalist species in, and the loss of some specialised or rare species from, large patches. Management options are to avoid planting plantations near large forest patches and to increase the size of small patches where possible.

613,tropgrass,"Contrasting responses of hoverflies and wild bees to habitat structure and land use change in a tropical landscape (southern Yunnan, SW China)","The response of insects to monoculture plantations has mainly proceeded at the expense of natural forest areas, and is an outstanding and important issue in ecology and conservation biology, with pollination services declined around the world. In this study, species richness and distribution of hoverfly and wild bee communities were investigated in a changing tropical landscape in southern Yunnan, south-west China by Malaise traps periodically from 2008 to 2009. Species were recorded from the traditional land use types (natural forest, grassland, shrubland and rice field fallows), and from recently established rubber plantations of different ages. Hoverflies (total 53 species) were most common in young successional stages of vegetation, including rice field fallow and shrubland. Species richness was highest in rice field fallows and lowest in forests and showed a highly significant relationship with the number of forb species and ground vegetation cover. In contrast, the highest richness of wild bees (total 44 species) was recorded from the natural forest sites, which showed a discrete bee community composition compared to the remaining habitat types. There was no significant relationship between the bee species richness and the environmental variables, including the numbers of different plant life forms, coverage of canopy and ground vegetation, successional age of vegetation and land use type. At the landscape scale, open land use systems, including young rubber plantations, are assumed to increase the species richness of hoverflies; however, this might decrease wild bee diversity. The present land use change by rubber cultivation can be expected to have negative impacts on the native wild bee communities.",WOS:000311434100006,94,0.922278997,1,contrast respons of hoverf and wild bee to habit structure and land us chang in a trop landscap southern yun sw chin the respons of insect to monocult plant has main process at the expens of nat forest area and is an outstand and import issu in ecolog and conserv biolog with pollin serv declin around the world in thi study specy rich and distribut of hoverf and wild bee commun wer investig in a chang trop landscap in southern yun sou west chin by mala trap period from to specy wer record from the tradit land us typ nat forest grassland shrubland and ric field fallow and from rec est rub plant of diff ag hoverf tot specy wer most common in young success stag of veget includ ric field fallow and shrubland specy rich was highest in ric field fallow and lowest in forest and show a high sign rel with the numb of forb specy and ground veget cov in contrast the highest rich of wild bee tot specy was record from the nat forest sit which show a discret bee commun composit comp to the remain habit typ ther was no sign rel between the bee specy rich and the environ vary includ the numb of diff plant lif form cov of canop and ground veget success ag of veget and land us typ at the landscap scal op land us system includ young rub plant ar assum to increas the specy rich of hoverf howev thi might decreas wild bee divers the pres land us chang by rub cult can be expect to hav neg impact on the nat wild bee commun,new,0.9355283793275273,0.9137309845362744,0.8976353957578171,0.8852613857899563,0.875117106029561,0.8663217090501599,0.8582947767572524,0.8505777050936518,0.8426807790293643,0.8338593004683414,0.8225249803820573
715,tropgrass,"Tree population inventory, diversity and degradation analysis of a tropical dry deciduous forest in Afram Plains, Ghana","Forest inventory and diversity assessments are essential to understand the tree population structure and diversity status of forests and to provide information for biodiversity recovery planning. But, unfortunately, the vast majority of forests in developing countries lack inventory data, particularly the dry forests and savanna woodlands where timber potential is considered to be low. Consequently the tree population structure and diversity status of these forests are often insufficient for sound management. In this study, the structure and composition of tree species were studied in a dry semi-deciduous forest in Afram plain, Ghana. The site's status in terms of level of degradation/disturbance was also determined. Two-long rectangular plots (each 20 m x 2000 m) were established, 200 m apart, in five locations within a 40-hectare (ha) area. Each of the plots was sub-divided into 20 quadrats (20 m x 100 m). All tree species >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were identified and their diameters over bark measured at 1.3 m. The forest condition was scored and habitat types classified. In total 44 tree species with 831 individuals belonging to 25 families were recorded at the study site. This corresponds to an average of 21 trees ha(-1) of which 17 had dbh <= 30 cm. Trees with dbh >= 70 cm were less than one tree ha(-1) (mean 0.8 ha(-1)). The Simpson (0.06) and Shannon (4.52) indices reveal a poorly stocked and less diverse forest. Five species (Lophira sp., Daniellia oliveri, Pterocatpus erinaceus, Terminalia glaucescens and Ficus sur) accounted for 50% of the total individuals recorded with the Fabaceae being the most species-rich family recording 22% of all the species in the studied area. Tree basal area (1 m(2) ha(-1)) and volumes (13 m(3) ha(-1)) were at least 49% lower than national means for dry semi-deciduous forest to which the study sites belong. Based on basal area cover, D. oliveri was the single dominant species. The mean forest condition score was 5.7 and vegetation cover type was largely open forests with less than 2% forest cover. These results suggest the area is highly degraded and the loss of biodiversity may be more significant than previously thought. This would indicate a need for rehabilitation interventions and doubling of conservation management efforts in the area. Three pathways of intervention have been recommended: (a) protecting intact native forest and ecological corridors, and undertaking enrichment riparian plantings to protect waterways, (b) developing agroforestry practices for biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems, and (c) establishing plantations in the severely degraded areas.

813,tropgrass,Unprecedented plant species loss after a decade in fragmented subtropical Chaco Serrano forests,"Current biodiversity loss is mostly caused by anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and resource exploitation. Measuring the balance of species loss and gain in remaining fragmented landscapes throughout time entails a central research challenge. We resurveyed in 2013 plant species richness in the same plots of a previous sampling conducted in 2003 across 18 forest fragments of different sizes of the Chaco Serrano forest in Argentina. While the area of these forest remnants was kept constant, their surrounding forest cover changed over this time period. We compared plant species richness of both sampling years and calculated the proportion of species loss and gain at forest edges and interiors. As in 2003, we found a positive relationship between fragment area and plant richness in 2013 and both years showed a similar slope. However, we detected a net decrease of 24% of species' richness across all forest fragments, implying an unprecedentedly high rate and magnitude of species loss driven mainly by non-woody, short-lived species. There was a higher proportion of lost and gained species at forest edges than in forest interiors. Importantly, fragment area interacted with percent change in surrounding forest cover to explain the proportion of species lost. Small forest fragments showed a relatively constant proportion of species loss regardless of any changes in surrounding forest cover, whereas in larger fragments the proportion of species lost increased when surrounding forest cover decreased. We show that despite preserving fragment area, habitat quality and availability in the surroundings is of fundamental importance in shaping extinction and immigration dynamics of plant species at any given forest remnant. Because the Chaco Serrano forest has already lost 94% of its original cover, we argue that plant extinctions will continue through the coming decades unless active management actions are taken to increase native forest areas.",WOS:000451755800029,258,0.9146318659999999,1,unprec plant specy loss aft a decad in frag subtrop chaco serrano forest cur biodivers loss is most caus by anthropog habit loss and frag clim chang and resourc exploit meas the bal of specy loss and gain in remain frag landscap throughout tim entail a cent research challeng we resurvey in plant specy rich in the sam plot of a prevy sampl conduc in across forest frag of diff siz of the chaco serrano forest in argentin whil the are of thes forest remn was kept const their surround forest cov chang ov thi tim period we comp plant specy rich of both sampl year and calc the proport of specy loss and gain at forest edg and intery as in we found a posit rel between frag are and plant rich in and both year show a simil slop howev we detect a net decreas of of specy rich across al forest frag imply an unprec high rat and magnitud of specy loss driv main by non woody short liv specy ther was a high proport of lost and gain specy at forest edg than in forest intery import frag are interact with perc chang in surround forest cov to explain the proport of specy lost smal forest frag show a rel const proport of specy loss regardless of any chang in surround forest cov wherea in larg frag the proport of specy lost increas when surround forest cov decreas we show that despit preserv frag are habit qual and avail in the surround is of funda import in shap extinct and immigr dynam of plant specy at any giv forest remn becaus the chaco serrano forest has already lost of it origin cov we argu that plant extinct wil continu through the com decad unless act man act ar tak to increas nat forest area,new,0.9292975855221138,0.8720147055839167,0.8183001585872264,0.7719330007255262,0.7318689515258473,0.6964709246886766,0.6642627349221477,0.6339158447358926,0.6039519891462658,0.5720773168452592,0.5331845446546846
911,tropgrass,The impact of fire and forest conversion into savanna on the bird communities of West Madagascan dry forests,"We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores, with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forest-savanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44).

How are epiphytic assemblages affected by different degrees of human disturbance, and what are the driving forces? An inter-Andean dry forest landscape at 2300 m elevation in northern Ecuador. We sampled epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants on 100 trees of Acacia macracantha in five habitats: closed-canopy mixed and pure acacia forest (old secondary), forest edge, young semi-closed secondary woodland, and isolated trees in grassland. Total species richness in forest edge habitats and on isolated trees was significantly lower than in closed forest types. Species density of vascular epiphytes (species per tree) did not differ significantly between habitat types. Species density of bryophytes, in contrast, was significantly lower in edge habitat and on isolated trees than in closed forest. Forest edge showed greater impoverishment than semi-closed woodland and similar floristic affinity to isolated trees and to closed forest types. Assemblages were significantly nested; habitat types with major disturbance held only subsets of the closed forest assemblages, indicating a gradual reduction in niche availability. Distance to forest had no effect on species density of epiphytes on isolated trees, but species density was closely correlated with crown closure, a measure of canopy integrity. Microclimatic changes but not dispersal constraints were key determinants of epiphyte assemblages following disturbance. Epiphytic cryptogams are sensitive indicators of microclimate and human disturbance in montane dry forests.

Orchid I. is 92 km off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, and its forests are the northernmost tropical forests in East Asia. In this study, the spider diversity was compared in 4 types of habitats with different degrees of human disturbances on this island. Habitat types examined in this study included primary forest, cultivated woodlands with a small degree of disturbance, firewood plantations with an intermediate level of disturbance, and grasslands generated from the clear-cutting of forests. We used 2 replicates for all habitat types, each containing four 5 x 5 m sample plots. Spiders from the ground, understory shrubs, and canopy were collected to obtain a comprehensive representation of diversity from all microhabitats in the sample plots. From the 1718 adult specimens obtained, 123 species from 19 families were identified. The abundance was the highest in the primary forest and lowest in the grassland plots. Plots in the 4 habitat types did riot differ in Margalef species richness, Shannon-Weaver function, or Simpson index. However, plots in the primary forest had significantly lower evenness due to the high relative abundance of dominant orb weaver species. Results of a UPGMA analysis using pair-wise Euclidean distances showed that the sample plots could be clustered into 4 distinct groups, indicating that the composition of spiders among habitat types considerably differed. Plots in the primary forest, cultivated woodland, and firewood plantation habitats were dominated by space web builders and orb weavers, while those in the grasslands contained a much-higher proportion of wandering sheet weavers and ground runners.

Deer have debarked many trees, causing die-back, gradually changing the primary forest first to light forest with a floor that is densely covered with sasa grass (Sasa nipponica) and then to S. nipponica grassland. To examine the effects of vegetative transformation on the dung-beetle community, we compared the diversity and abundance of dung-beetle assemblages in the primary forest, transition forest, and S. nipponica grassland using dung-baited pitfall traps. The species richness and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) were significantly highest in the primary forest and lowest in the S. nipponica grassland. The evenness (Smith-Wilson index) was highest in the primary forest and nearly equal in the transition forest and S. nipponica grassland. The abundance was apparently greater in the transition forest than in the primary forest and S. nipponica grassland. These results suggest that loss of primary forest resulting from an increasing deer population decreases the diversity of the dung-beetle community while increasing the abundance of dung beetles in the transition forest. Sika deer use transition forests and grasslands more frequently than primary forests as habitat, but an increase in dung supply there does not necessarily increase the diversity or abundance of dung-beetle assemblages.",WOS:000228011500004,373,0.912427347,0,divers of dung beetl commun in declin japanes subalpin forest caus by an increas sik deer pop the ohdaigahar subalpin plateau in jap has rec suff a reduc in prim forest land caus by an increas pop of sik deer cerv nippon deer hav debark many tre caus die back grad chang the prim forest first to light forest with a flo that is dens cov with sas grass sas nipponic and then to s nipponic grassland to examin the effect of veget transform on the dung beetl commun we comp the divers and abund of dung beetl assembl in the prim forest transit forest and s nipponic grassland us dung bait pitfal trap the specy rich and specy divers shannon wien index wer sign highest in the prim forest and lowest in the s nipponic grassland the ev smi wilson index was highest in the prim forest and near eq in the transit forest and s nipponic grassland the abund was app gre in the transit forest than in the prim forest and s nipponic grassland thes result suggest that loss of prim forest result from an increas deer pop decreas the divers of the dung beetl commun whil increas the abund of dung beetl in the transit forest sik deer us transit forest and grassland mor frequ than prim forest as habit but an increas in dung supply ther doe not necess increas the divers or abund of dung beetl assembl,new,0.9122812280915421,0.874753097665623,0.8458801275745381,0.824068471207823,0.8070902603439997,0.7934690587109429,0.782300661500903,0.773070233024294,0.7655521453223652,0.7599001786210665,0.7572183735316035

The intact forest reserve and a secondary forest regrowth, disturbed as a result of slash-and-burn agriculture, were compared to savanna habitats. Of the 290 specimens collected, 195 butterfly species were included, of which significant proportion were Nymphalidae. Of the 147 forest species, 111 (75.5%) showed preferences for the forest habitats, while 70 (47.6%) and 34 (23.1%) preferred disturbed and savannah habitats, respectively. Numerically, a comparable proportion of savannah species were recorded in the 18 disturbed (73.9%) and 16 savannah habitats (63.2%).

1411,tropgrass,Vegetation structure and composition along an interior-edge-exterior gradient in a Costa Rican montane cloud forest,"A study was carried out in the Costa Rican Cordillera de Talamanca in order to assess changes in vegetation structure and floristic composition along a gradient from the interior of tropical upper montane cloud forest into adjacent pastureland. At four sites a 150 x 10 m belt transect was established perpendicular to the forest/pasture edge. Vegetation transect censusing included recording of seed plane species presence and abundance (aerial crown/shoot cover), as well as assessment of seedling sapling and tree stem diameter and height. A total of 290 seed plant species were found in 159 genera and 85 families. Asteraceae is with 47 species the most speciose family. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index showed no significant difference between forest and pastureland, with the exception of a pastureland site which had experienced intensive land use. Sorensen's similarity index showed significant differences in species composition between forest and pastureland. Vegetation at the forest edge consisted mainly of secondary shrub and tree species. From the forest interior towards the edge, numbers of seedlings, saplings and secondary trees increased, while numbers of mature forest trees declined. Edge effects are expressed in a reduction of canopy height and an increase in subcanopy stature from the forest interior towards the edge, causing thr merging of forest canopy and subcanopy layers at the edge. Intensively used pasturelands only harboured a low herbaceous vegetation, while their abandoned equivalents showed the presence of patches of secondary shrub vegetation and recovering forest in a grassland matrix. Expected spatio-temporal changes at the forest edge include the encroachment of secondary vegetation and the levelling of the forest/pasture border as time advances and land use becomes less intense. Transitional second,growth edge vegetation may buffer the remaining mature forest core and simultaneously induce forest recovery processes in adjacent abandoned pasturelands. It is recommended to include forest edge tree species in programs focused at the ecological restoration of tropical montane cloud forests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

159,tropgrass,Area- but no edge-effect on woody seedling abundance and species richness in old Afromontane forest fragments,"Question: What is the relative importance of area- and edge-effects on woody seedling diversity in old Afromontane forest fra-ments? Location: Mistbelt Afromontane forests, KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa. Methods: Woody seedling abundance and species richness in 590 1-m(2) plots were sampled at the forest edge (< 10 m from the edge) and interior in 31 old (> 60 a) Afromontane forest fragments (0.05 - 328.5 ha) with closed edges in an ancient grassland matrix. Results: Unlike young (< 20 a) Amazonian fragments, there was no edge- or area-effect on sample plot seedling density and species richness, although these increased significantly with increasing herb cover (less disturbance). Seedling density, but not species richness, declined significantly with herbivory of seedlings, regardless of forest size or plot location. Seedling community composition and richness did not differ significantly between the edge and interior of forests across the range of forest sizes (i.e. no edge-effect). Community composition was nested with small forests retaining a subset of the seedling flora of larger forests. Overall, cumulative seedling species richness increased with forest area (i.e. area-effect). Conclusions: Holocene climatic extinction filtering events and area-dependent species relaxation have potentially selected for tree species with convergent life histories adapted to local fragmentation-effects. Stable environmental conditions at old edges in these naturally fragmented forests cause similar regeneration conditions and seedling species composition between edge and interior. Consequently, seedling density and species richness are controlled more by response to gradients of local disturbance (habitat area, herb cover, herbivory) than by proximity to the edge. Large patches (> 50 ha) with intact edges had the highest tree seedling diversity and are a conservation priority. Although small patches contain no unique species they preserve landscape processes, have conservation value, and require protection. Conservation principles derived from recently created Amazonian fragments and that emphasize edge-effects, require critical evaluation for application to old Afromontane patches.",WOS:000232457000001,28,0.905967948,1,are but no edg effect on woody seedl abund and specy rich in old afromont forest frag quest what is the rel import of are and edg effect on woody seedl divers in old afromont forest fra ment loc mistbelt afromont forest kwazulu nat midland sou afric method woody seedl abund and specy rich in m plot wer sampl at the forest edg m from the edg and intery in old a afromont forest frag ha with clos edg in an ant grassland matrix result unlik young a amazon frag ther was no edg or are effect on sampl plot seedl dens and specy rich although thes increas sign with increas herb cov less disturb seedl dens but not specy rich declin sign with herb of seedl regardless of forest siz or plot loc seedl commun composit and rich did not diff sign between the edg and intery of forest across the rang of forest siz i e no edg effect commun composit was nest with smal forest retain a subset of the seedl flor of larg forest overal cum seedl specy rich increas with forest are i e are effect conclud holoc clim extinct filt ev and are depend specy relax hav pot select for tre specy with converg lif hist adapt to loc frag effect stabl environ condit at old edg in thes nat frag forest caus simil reg condit and seedl specy composit between edg and intery consequ seedl dens and specy rich ar control mor by respons to grady of loc disturb habit are herb cov herb than by proxim to the edg larg patch ha with intact edg had the highest tre seedl divers and ar a conserv pri although smal patch contain no un specy they preserv landscap process hav conserv valu and requir protect conserv principl der from rec cre amazon frag and that emphas edg effect requir crit evalu for apply to old afromont patch,new,0.9312529681046465,0.877667236805956,0.828454829902266,0.7866337242763193,0.7508470040391187,0.7194079704539392,0.6908877873071344,0.664045690070002,0.6375122515273256,0.6091508253445677,0.5741219721990853

To evaluate the biodiversity restoration function of the plantation, we compared the species richness and species composition of butterfly assemblages in three plantations of Acacia mangium, two ex-forest grasslands and a native forest in East Kalimantan based on repeated 45-min sampling sessions in December 2004, May 2005 and December 2005. Higher species richness was recorded in plantation than in grassland, indicating that the plantation could support more butterfly species. Even. higher species richness was found in the native forest. The species accumulation trend indicated by a, rarefaction curve suggested that there were many more undiscovered species in the native forest. The. butterflies found in the native forest included many range-restricted species, which were not found in the plantation and grassland. These range-restricted species were thought to be specific to the interior of the native forest and unlikely to colonise the plantations. Artificial plantations established on degraded grasslands can enrich butterfly assemblage, but this enrichment is mainly due to the increase in species with moderate or wide distribution ranges, rather than the recovery of range-restricted native forest species.",WOS:000349431200007,241,0.898824753,1,rest of butterf in acac mang plant est on degrad grassland in east kalim the biodivers stat of insect in plant in the trop is littl known to evalu the biodivers rest funct of the plant we comp the specy rich and specy composit of butterf assembl in three plant of acac mang two ex forest grassland and a nat forest in east kalim bas on rep min sampl sess in decemb may and decemb high specy rich was record in plant than in grassland ind that the plant could support mor butterf specy ev high specy rich was found in the nat forest the specy accum trend ind by a rarefact curv suggest that ther wer many mor undiscov specy in the nat forest the butterf found in the nat forest includ many rang restrict specy which wer not found in the plant and grassland thes rang restrict specy wer thought to be spec to the intery of the nat forest and unlik to colon the plant art plant est on degrad grassland can enrich butterf assembl but thi enrich is main due to the increas in specy with mod or wid distribut rang rath than the recovery of rang restrict nat forest specy,new,0.9162106789124649,0.8684402128973744,0.8280921569411469,0.7950687300177557,0.7673861237517474,0.7434269999375241,0.7219817115680195,0.7020809061721629,0.6827334218252937,0.6624781171461147,0.6380087021567408
1711,tropgrass,Butterfly populations in two forest fragments at the Kenya coast,"Species richness, diversity and composition of butterflies in two Kenya coastal forest remnants, Muhaka and Mrima hill, were investigated. Sixty-three species were recorded from each forest remnant from a total of 1329 individuals. Species accumulation curves for both forests did not reach an asymptote. High species similarity was recorded between the forest interior and the surrounding matrix, primarily due to invasion of the forest interior clearings by the savanna species. Despite their small sizes, these forest remnants were found to maintain viable populations of true forest butterflies. However, the number of species was less than half that recorded from the larger forest reserve of Arabuko-Sokoke, located in the same geographical area. Records from Muhaka forest show species unique to it, not found in the larger forest reserves, underscoring the importance of small remnants in the preservation of forest biodiversity. The high species similarity between the forest remnants implied that if habitat corridors were created, gene flow between these remnants and other larger forest reserves would be possible.

1811,tropgrass,Effects of land management on the abundance and richness of spiders (Araneae): A meta-analysis,"Human land use, through forest management and conversion of natural habitats into agroecosystems, has often resulted in loss of biodiversity. Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

1912,tropgrass,"Forest landscape pattern in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa: 50 years of change or stasis?","Understanding patterns and processes of habitat change is essential for managing and conserving forest fragments in anthropogenically altered landscapes. Digitized aerial photographs from 1944 and 1996 were examined for changes to the indigenous forest landscape in the Karkloof-Balgowan archipelago in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Attributes relating to proximate land-use, patch shape, isolation and position in the landscape were used to determine putative causes of forest change. The total change in forest area was -5.7% (forest covered 6739 ha in 1996). This is contrasted with previous reports for the period 1880-1940 that estimated change in total forest area of up to -80%. Attrition was the predominant process of forest transformation between 1944 and 1996. Despite little overall change in forest area, 786 mostly small (<0.5 ha) forest patches were lost from the landscape, leaving 1277 forest patches in 1996. An increase in patch isolation, but no change in patch cohesion accompanied the changes in forest area. Ignoring patches that were eliminated, 514 patches decreased in area. This was partly a function of patch size, but the conversion of natural grassland to commercial plantation forestry in the matrix also influenced forest decline. Their small size and irregular shape caused forest patches in the region to be vulnerable to edge effects. Core area declined in a negative exponential way with increasing edge width and the total area of edge habitat exceeded that of core habitat at an edge width of only 50 m. Nevertheless, total core area decreased by only 2%, (65 ha) between 1944 and 1996 because most of the eliminated patches were small and contained no core area. The large Karkloof forest (1649 ha) is a conservation priority for forest interior species, but the ecological role and biodiversity value of small forest patches should not be overlooked.",WOS:000226516800002,1007,0.898351059,0,forest landscap pattern in the kwazulu nat midland sou afric year of chang or stas understand pattern and process of habit chang is ess for man and conserv forest frag in anthropog alt landscap digit aer photograph from and wer examin for chang to the indig forest landscap in the karkloof balgow archipelago in kwazulu nat sou afric attribut rel to proxim land us patch shap isol and posit in the landscap wer us to determin put caus of forest chang the tot chang in forest are was forest cov ha in thi is contrast with prevy report for the period that estim chang in tot forest are of up to attrit was the predomin process of forest transform between and despit littl overal chang in forest are most smal ha forest patch wer lost from the landscap leav forest patch in an increas in patch isol but no chang in patch coher accompany the chang in forest are ign patch that wer elimin patch decreas in are thi was part a funct of patch siz but the convert of nat grassland to commerc plant forestry in the matrix also influ forest declin their smal siz and irregul shap caus forest patch in the reg to be vuln to edg effect cor are declin in a neg expon way with increas edg wid and the tot are of edg habit excess that of cor habit at an edg wid of on m nevertheless tot cor are decreas by on ha between and becaus most of the elimin patch wer smal and contain no cor are the larg karkloof forest ha is a conserv pri for forest intery specy but the ecolog rol and biodivers valu of smal forest patch should not be overlook,new,0.8985532850325011,0.8144403487362585,0.7378845580795729,0.6759221187299621,0.626373356508931,0.5861271508981046,0.5527584152748022,0.5245753207656899,0.5003969059051145,0.47939803845617107,0.46121682105770695
206,tropgrass,Biophysical and human influences on plant species richness in grasslands: Comparing variegated landscapes in subtropical and temperate regions,"A survey of grassy woodlands in the Queensland subtropics was conducted, recording herbaceous species richness at 212 sites on three properties (2756 ha). A range of habitats typical of cattle grazing enterprises was sampled and site variables included lithology, slope position, tree density, soil disturbance, soil enrichment and grazing. Results were compared with a previously published survey of temperate grasslands. Lithology, slope position and tree density had relatively minor effects on plant species richness, although in both surveys there was some evidence of lower species richness on the more fertile substrates. Soil disturbance and soil enrichment significantly reduced the richness of native species in both surveys, while exotic species were insensitive (subtropics) or increased (temperate) with disturbance. Rare native species were highly sensitive to disturbances, including grazing, in the temperate study. Although some trends were similar for rare species in the subtropics, the results were not significant and there were complex interactions between grazing, lithology and slope position. Grazing did not have a negative effect on native species richness, except in the closely grazed patches within pastures, and then only on the most intensively developed property. At the scale recorded (30 m(2)), the native pastures, roadsides and stock routes sampled in the subtropics appear to be among the most species-rich grasslands ever reported, both nationally and globally. Native species richness was approximately 50% higher than the temperate survey figures across all the comparable habitats.

The species richness of herbs and mosses in the coniferous forest was highest in the forest edge and declined towards interior. The highest decrease in the number of species occurred within 0 to 5 m to the edge. The highest cover of herbs and mosses was in the forest edge and decreased towards the forest interior. CCA biplot showed a good correlation of overall species composition and the distance to the forest edge. Distribution of species along edge to interior gradient depended on the species response to different ecological factors. Ellenberg value of light was higher in the edge.

521,tropgrass,Changes in ant species composition and community organisation along grazing gradients in semi-arid rangelands of the Northern Territory,"The impact of cattle grazing on ant diversity, species composition and community organisation was investigated in the Victoria River District of the Northern Territory, using distance from water as a surrogate of grazing intensity. Two gradients were sampled, one on red earth at Kidman Springs (5 plots), the other on black cracking clay at Mount Sanford (6 plots). Sites were sampled in April (both sites) and October (Kidman Springs only)1998. The two sites supported distinctly different ant communities, with 70 species at Kidman Springs and 36 at Mount Sanford. Species richness and total abundance did not change significantly with distance from water, although species richness was always greatest at the most distant plot. However, multivariate analysis showed that ant species composition changed markedly. Despite large changes in species composition, the abundance of only six of the 24 most common species (two at Kidman Springs and four at Mount Sanford) were significantly correlated with grazing intensity. The abundance of Bassian taxa was promoted by grazing, whereas the species richness of Torresian taxa and the abundance and species richness of Widespread taxa were suppressed. Ant functional group analysis showed community organisation was resilient, with slight changes being primarily driven by Hot Climate Specialists and dependent on the season. However, the relative richness of five functional groups correlated significantly with grazing intensity, all negatively. Ant variables suppressed by grazing were positively associated with patch cover variables and litter, and negatively correlated with annual grass and bare ground, and may serve as indicators of rangeland condition.",WOS:000165918400001,17,0.865724314,1,chang in ant specy composit and commun org along graz grady in sem arid rangeland of the northern territ the impact of cattl graz on ant divers specy composit and commun org was investig in the victor riv district of the northern territ us dist from wat as a surrog of graz intens two grady wer sampl on on red ear at kidm springs plot the oth on black crack clay at mount sanford plot sit wer sampl in april both sit and octob kidm springs on the two sit support distinct diff ant commun with specy at kidm springs and at mount sanford specy rich and tot abund did not chang sign with dist from wat although specy rich was alway greatest at the most dist plot howev mult analys show that ant specy composit chang mark despit larg chang in specy composit the abund of on six of the most common specy two at kidm springs and four at mount sanford wer sign correl with graz intens the abund of bass tax was promot by graz wherea the specy rich of torres tax and the abund and specy rich of widespread tax wer suppress ant funct group analys show commun org was resy with slight chang being prim driv by hot clim spec and depend on the season howev the rel rich of fiv funct group correl sign with graz intens al neg ant vary suppress by graz wer posit assocy with patch cov vary and lit and neg correl with an grass and bar ground and may serv as ind of rangeland condit,new,0.8987258115187113,0.8541394380386504,0.819710541417827,0.7923017601976836,0.76927323150214,0.7490294343118207,0.7304833748408925,0.7127353479006049,0.69477372723638,0.6749352041893588,0.6492335202154315
542,tropgrass,Is livestock grazing compatible with biodiversity conservation? Impacts on savanna ant communities in the Australian seasonal tropics,"Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread forms of anthropogenic disturbance globally, and can have a major impact on biodiversity and therefore conservation values. Here we use ants to assess the extent to which livestock grazing is compatible with biodiversity conservation in a tropical savanna of northern Australia, where there is growing pressure to intensify pastoral production. We focus on the extent to which ant responses conform with four general patterns identified in a recent global review: (1) soil and vegetation type have a far bigger impact on ant community composition than does grazing; (2) grazing modifies ant species composition but often not species richness or total abundance; (3) a species' response often varies among habitats; and (4) between 25-50% of the species that can be statistically analysed are responsive to grazing. We sampled ants using pitfall traps at 38 sites in two land systems, based on cross-fence comparisons of areas of different grazing intensities. A total of 130 ant species from 24 genera were recorded, with the fauna dominated by species of Iridomyrmex and Monomorium. Land system was the primary driver of variation in ant species richness and composition, and grazing intensity was related to neither species richness nor total abundance. Only 10% of common species appeared to be impacted by grazing. Overall, ant responses to grazing in our study region were generally consistent with the four global patterns, except that the local fauna seems to be particularly resilient. Such resilience indicates that current grazing management practices are compatible with the conservation of ant biodiversity.",WOS:000398111000007,16,0.864962173,1,is livestock graz compat with biodivers conserv impact on savann ant commun in the aust season trop graz by domest livestock is on of the most widespread form of anthropog disturb glob and can hav a maj impact on biodivers and theref conserv valu her we us ant to assess the ext to which livestock graz is compat with biodivers conserv in a trop savann of northern austral wher ther is grow press to intens past produc we foc on the ext to which ant respons conform with four gen pattern ident in a rec glob review soil and veget typ hav a far big impact on ant commun composit than doe graz graz mod ant specy composit but oft not specy rich or tot abund a specy respons oft vary among habit and between of the specy that can be stat analys ar respond to graz we sampl ant us pitfal trap at sit in two land system bas on cross fent comparison of area of diff graz intens a tot of ant specy from gener wer record with the faun domin by specy of iridomyrmex and monomor land system was the prim driv of vary in ant specy rich and composit and graz intens was rel to neith specy rich nor tot abund on of common specy appear to be impact by graz overal ant respons to graz in our study reg wer gen consist with the four glob pattern exceiv that the loc faun seem to be particul resy such resy ind that cur graz man pract ar compat with the conserv of ant biodivers,new,0.9016906778975324,0.8756297028924399,0.8570634430156471,0.8427658083124295,0.8309880990880281,0.8208250702225771,0.8117150264117047,0.8032437434154743,0.7950224323598573,0.7865383472821156,0.7768198547804835

1042,tropgrass,Effects of past and present land use on vegetation cover and regeneration in a tropical dryland forest,"Brazilian Caatinga is one of the most diverse dryland ecosystem of the world and is threatened by strong land use pressure and poor protection. In this study, we investigate the effects of past and present land use on plant community richness and structure. We used satellite information to identify 55 Caatinga forest plots with and without past vegetation clearing. We also quantified current land use, i.e. grazing by domestic animals, and selective logging. Caatinga vegetation structure, measured as vegetation cover, vegetation height, basal area and woody plant density, as well as recruitment, measured as woody plant seedling density and species richness, were negatively affected by both past and current land use. Past clear-cut not only had strong effects on most vegetation measures, but also increased current grazing which further negatively affected vegetation structure. Selective logging had little measurable effects but increased recruitment in plots previously clear-cut. Increasing time since the last clear-cut increased negative effects on vegetation, presumably because of a prolonged negative effect of grazing. Our results suggest that grazing needs to be prevented in areas degraded by clear-cut to allow vegetation restoration through natural succession and avoid further degradation and desertification.

1221,tropgrass,Eaten Out of House and Home: Impacts of Grazing on Ground-Dwelling Reptiles in Australian Grasslands and Grassy Woodlands,"Large mammalian grazers can alter the biotic and abiotic features of their environment through their impacts on vegetation. Grazing at moderate intensity has been recommended for biodiversity conservation. Few studies, however, have empirically tested the benefits of moderate grazing intensity in systems dominated by native grazers. Here we investigated the relationship between (1) density of native eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, and grass structure, and (2) grass structure and reptiles (i.e. abundance, richness, diversity and occurrence) across 18 grassland and grassy Eucalyptus woodland properties in south-eastern Australia. There was a strong negative relationship between kangaroo density and grass structure after controlling for tree canopy cover. We therefore used grass structure as a surrogate for grazing intensity. Changes in grazing intensity (i.e. grass structure) significantly affected reptile abundance, reptile species richness, reptile species diversity, and the occurrence of several ground-dwelling reptiles. Reptile abundance, species richness and diversity were highest where grazing intensity was low. Importantly, no species of reptile was more likely to occur at high grazing intensities. Legless lizards (Delma impar, D. inornata) were more likely to be detected in areas subject to moderate grazing intensity, whereas one species (Hemiergis talbingoensis) was less likely to be detected in areas subject to intense grazing and three species (Menetia greyii, Morethia boulengeri, and Lampropholis delicata) did not appear to be affected by grazing intensity. Our data indicate that to maximize reptile abundance, species richness, species diversity, and occurrence of several individual species of reptile, managers will need to subject different areas of the landscape to moderate and low grazing intensities and limit the occurrence and extent of high grazing.",WOS:000347146700001,22,0.816188942,1,eat out of hous and hom impact of graz on ground dwel reptil in aust grassland and grassy woodland larg mam graz can alt the biot and abiot feat of their environ through their impact on veget graz at mod intens has been recommend for biodivers conserv few study howev hav empir test the benefit of mod graz intens in system domin by nat graz her we investig the rel between dens of nat eastern grey kangaroo macrop gigante and grass structure and grass structure and reptil i e abund rich divers and occur across grassland and grassy eucalypt woodland property in sou eastern austral ther was a strong neg rel between kangaroo dens and grass structure aft control for tre canop cov we theref us grass structure as a surrog for graz intens chang in graz intens i e grass structure sign affect reptil abund reptil specy rich reptil specy divers and the occur of sev ground dwel reptil reptil abund specy rich and divers wer highest wher graz intens was low import no specy of reptil was mor lik to occ at high graz intens legless lizard delm imp d inornat wer mor lik to be detect in area subject to mod graz intens wherea on specy hemierg talbingoens was less lik to be detect in area subject to intens graz and three specy menet greyi moreth boulenger and lamprophol delicat did not appear to be affect by graz intens our dat ind that to maxim reptil abund specy rich specy divers and occur of sev individ specy of reptil man wil nee to subject diff area of the landscap to mod and low graz intens and limit the occur and ext of high graz,new,0.8646927485468486,0.8144038003943521,0.7768935902197314,0.7480132354919972,0.7247263891906737,0.7052941525310676,0.6886602920904504,0.6741698187590233,0.6614333340927765,0.6503493555590865,0.6414715119580171

In particular, the biodiversity consequences of replacing native grasslands with exotic pastures have not been studied. Here we examine how the conversion of the native savanna grasslands affects dung beetle communities. Our study was conducted in 14 native (grassland: campo limpo), and 21 exotic (Urochloa spp. monoculture) pastures in Carrancas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We collected 4996 dung beetle individuals from 66 species: 3139 individuals from 50 species in native pastures and 1857 individuals from 55 species in the exotic pastures. Exotic pastures had lower dung beetle richness, abundance and biomass than native pastures. Species composition between the two pasture types was significantly different and exotic pastures were dominated by few abundant species. Indicator species analysis detected 16 species indicators of native pastures and three of exotic pastures, according to relative abundance and frequency in each pasture system. Our results show that the conversion of native pastures to exotic pastures leads to a predictable loss of local species richness, increasing dominance and changes in species composition.

1271,tropgrass,Impacts of oil palm expansion on avian biodiversity in a Neotropical natural savanna,"The consequences of converting tropical rainforest to oil palm are well-documented, but the impacts of oil palm conversion on natural savanna landscapes remain little-known. Natural savannas in South America have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the Colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the Llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared.",WOS:000410014100026,15,0.814329722,1,impact of oil palm expand on av biodivers in a neotrop nat savann the consequ of convert trop rainforest to oil palm ar wel docu but the impact of oil palm convert on nat savann landscap remain littl known nat savanna in sou americ hav been ident as fertil ground for fut oil palm expand part due to perceiv low biodivers impact rel to forest system we quant the impact of oil palm convert for bird commun inhabit nat savanna in the colomb flaw bird specy rich and abund wer sign reduc at sampl point in oil palm rel to adjac nat savanna with mark concomit shift in commun composit aqu forest and grassland spec al show sign low abund in oil palm habit rel to savann as did migr specy and carn insect diet guild in both habit point level specy rich and tot bird abund increas with proxim to remn forest patch within savann tot bird abund also decreas with proxim to adjac oil palm though specy rich was not sign affect within oil palm point level abund increas with proxim to savann suggest that commun in both habit may be impact by reciproc edg or spil ov effect point level abund in oil palm also increas sign with the pres of an invas vin kudzu a specy introduc in som plant as a soil protect meas although specy rich was not affect our work underlin the nee for car monit of furth larg scal agro indust convert in the llano in particul we suggest gre effort to direct oil palm expand toward already degrad land e g improv grassland area cur us for intend cattl graz to ens remain nat savanna ar spar,new,0.8127217194258849,0.7817465520476264,0.7616560018816306,0.7480897454834846,0.7387580642664422,0.7325371024120056,0.7289339592852063,0.7279103090394173,0.7299440327551437,0.7365235990813991,0.7519590587398768
1421,tropgrass,Relationships between biomass and plant species richness in arid-zone grazing lands,"1. The relationship between biomass and species richness in temperate vegetation has been described as a hump-back response model. The hump-back model predicts that herbaceous species richness is highest at an intermediate level of biomass. However, this has not been investigated in arid-zone grazing lands. 2. We tested the hump-back prediction in an and tropical grazing region in northern Kenya where a seasonal grazing exclosure system is practised. We compared vegetation structure, species richness and composition on an open range and exclosures at five sites to elucidate the potential mechanisms behind variation in species richness. 3. More biomass was accumulated within seasonal exclosures than in continuously grazed areas. Species richness in exclosure plots varied from 5.3 to 8.3 species In 2, while that in open plots varied from 5.1 to 7.5 species m(-2). A pair-wise test showed no difference in two of the five sites with respect to both total and herbaceous species richness. 4. The primary floristic gradient illuminated through ordination was related to biomass, while the secondary gradient was related to species richness. The exclosure plots had more abundant species, especially compared with open plots, which had more rare and occasional species. A total of 37 herbaceous species was recorded; 22% were indifferent to grazing, 30% grazing intolerant and 48% promoted by grazing. 5. The relationship between biomass and herbaceous species richness showed (i) no trend within the exclosures (maximum biomass 800 g m(-2)); (ii) a positive trend in the open grazing land (maximum of 500 g m(-2)); and a hump-back pattern when (i) and (ii)were analysed together. Optimum richness corresponded to a biomass level of 400-500 g m(-2). Species richness declined with increase in age of exclosures. 6. We confirmed that species richness will decline when biomass exceeds 500 g m(-2), as predicted by the hump-back model, even in and grazing lands. Seasonal grazing exclosures may increase species richness to a certain level, but the decline in species richness with age of exclosures indicates that long-term exclusion of grazing may not necessarily increase species richness in arid-zone grazing lands.",WOS:000170568000013,23,0.8022055020000001,1,rel between biomass and plant specy rich in arid zon graz land the rel between biomass and specy rich in temp veget has been describ as a hump back respons model the hump back model predict that herbac specy rich is highest at an intermedy level of biomass howev thi has not been investig in arid zon graz land we test the hump back predict in an and trop graz reg in northern keny wher a season graz exclos system is pract we comp veget structure specy rich and composit on an op rang and exclos at fiv sit to elucid the pot mech behind vary in specy rich mor biomass was accum within season exclos than in continu graz area specy rich in exclos plot vary from to specy in whil that in op plot vary from to specy m a pair wis test show no diff in two of the fiv sit with respect to both tot and herbac specy rich the prim flor grady illumin through ordin was rel to biomass whil the second grady was rel to specy rich the exclos plot had mor abund specy espec comp with op plot which had mor rar and occas specy a tot of herbac specy was record wer indiff to graz graz intol and promot by graz the rel between biomass and herbac specy rich show i no trend within the exclos maxim biomass g m ii a posit trend in the op graz land maxim of g m and a hump back pattern when i and ii wer analys togeth optim rich correspond to a biomass level of g m specy rich declin with increas in ag of exclos we confirm that specy rich wil declin when biomass excess g m as predict by the hump back model ev in and graz land season graz exclos may increas specy rich to a certain level but the declin in specy rich with ag of exclos ind that long term exclud of graz may not necess increas specy rich in arid zon graz land,new,0.8678911639581812,0.8077426183070585,0.7628814210776275,0.7283616841929897,0.7003977916385118,0.6768305291747528,0.6563129281510985,0.637910484179408,0.6208489838913481,0.6042465676037984,0.5864706084520672
1481,tropgrass,"INFLUENCE OF GRAZING INTENSITY ON SWAMP PLANT COMMUNITIES IN THE TROPICAL MONTANE WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS, NILGIRIS, SOUTHERN INDIA","Livestock grazing is a major anthropogenic impact influencing both grasslands and wetlands of the world which often results in the alteration of the structure, diversity and functioning of the plant communities. Here, we seek to understand how grazing intensity influences swamp vegetation, with an emphasis on their diversity, structure and function. Six swamps were selected, two each in high, moderate and low intensity grazing sites, from the tropical montane swamps of the Upper Nilgiri Mountains, southern India. We recorded a total of 78 species belonging to 63 genera and 31 families. Our results showed that species richness, abundance and species composition differed significantly across grazing treatments. Moreover, mean vegetation cover and mean height differed significantly across grazing treatments, indicating that grazing significantly affected the vegetation structure and growth of swamp plant communities. Species compositional patterns showed that moderately grazed plant communities were significantly different from low and high grazing sites. In summary, grazing intensity influenced swamp species richness, abundance, and swamp plant communities.

1821,tropgrass,Use by small mammals of a chronosequence of tropical rainforest revegetation,"Context. The conversion of tropical rainforest to grazing pasture results in a drastic change in small-mammal community composition. Restoring the landscape through ecological revegetation is thus an increasingly important management technique to conserve rainforest mammals. Aims. This study aimed to determine the habitat ages at which species of small mammals recolonised revegetated habitats on the southern Atherton Tablelands, north-eastern Queensland, Australia. We focussed on changes in rainforest mammal abundance and diversity with increasing habitat age. Methods. Small-mammal trapping and mark-recapture techniques investigated mammal diversity, abundance and community composition within remnant rainforest, three age classes of ecological revegetation and abandoned grazing pasture. Key results. Small-mammal community composition differed between remnant rainforest and abandoned grazing pasture. The pasture and 3-year old revegetated sites were similar in composition, both lacking rainforest small mammals. Six-and 7-year old revegetation plantings provided suboptimal habitat for both rainforest and grassland mammals, whereas 16-and 22-year old revegetated habitats were dominated by rainforest species, with some individuals being frequently recaptured. Conclusions. As revegetated habitats aged, the small-mammal community composition transitioned from a grassland-like composition to a community dominated by rainforest species. Implications. Although rainforest small mammals were very occasionally captured within the 6- and 7-year old habitats, revegetated plantings were not dominated by rainforest species until the habitat was 16 years old. This highlights the importance of commencing revegetation as early as possible to minimise future population declines and maximise the conservation of rainforest mammals.",WOS:000346373200006,18,0.7829338220000001,1,us by smal mam of a chronosequence of trop rainforest reveget context the convert of trop rainforest to graz past result in a drast chang in smal mam commun composit rest the landscap through ecolog reveget is thu an increas import man techn to conserv rainforest mam aim thi study aim to determin the habit ag at which specy of smal mam recolon reveget habit on the southern atherton tableland nor eastern queensland austral we focuss on chang in rainforest mam abund and divers with increas habit ag method smal mam trap and mark recapt techn investig mam divers abund and commun composit within remn rainforest three ag class of ecolog reveget and abandon graz past key result smal mam commun composit diff between remn rainforest and abandon graz past the past and year old reveget sit wer simil in composit both lack rainforest smal mam six and year old reveget plant provid suboptim habit for both rainforest and grassland mam wherea and year old reveget habit wer domin by rainforest specy with som individ being frequ recapt conclud as reveget habit ag the smal mam commun composit transit from a grassland lik composit to a commun domin by rainforest specy imply although rainforest smal mam wer very occas capt within the and year old habit reveget plant wer not domin by rainforest specy until the habit was year old thi highlight the import of com reveget as ear as poss to minim fut pop declin and maxim the conserv of rainforest mam,new,0.8188026618040743,0.7964639116605245,0.7847197895599511,0.7781729358320056,0.7746265901267778,0.7732176947625833,0.7736598726594437,0.7760496928356874,0.780937624036447,0.7898323472722761,0.8069695888168569
2041,tropgrass,Forest degradation and recovery in a miombo woodland landscape in Zambia: 22 years of observations on permanent sample plots,"Because dry tropical forests cover 40% of tropical forest area and contain considerable biomass and carbon stocks, deforestation and forest degradation of these forests have global significance. However, in most developing countries with dry forests there is no quantitative information on past trends of forest degradation so that the development of historical reference levels is virtually impossible. This study assessed impacts of forest practices on forest degradation from 1990 to 2012 using data from destructive tree sampling and permanent sample plots in a miombo woodland landscape in central Zambia. Aboveground live wood biomass was estimated using allometric equations developed from 113 felled trees. Resprouting was a major source of regeneration on clear-cut subplots and the rate of aboveground wood biomass accumulation was much higher on re-growth sites than on old-growth sites. Changes in aboveground live wood biomass on uncut subplots were linked to biomass loss due to fire, harvesting and conversion to crop cultivation on the one hand and biomass increment due to growth of remaining trees on the other hand. Forest degradation was estimated to cause aboveground wood biomass loss of 0.3 t ha(-1) year(-1) on the least impacted site to 4.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) on the most impacted site. Control of fire and harvesting for charcoal production is recommended if miombo woodland is to be managed for biomass and carbon storage and sequestration. The study also found that negative trends in woody biomass accumulation rate and standing stocks are good indicators of forest degradation while positive trends in species diversity indices and standing wood biomass are useful indicators of forest recovery. However, the application of these indicators requires repeated inventories at permanent sample plots to establish reference levels against which changes in these indicator variables can be compared.

2151,tropgrass,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore communities of a tropical dry forest ecosystem show resilience to land-use change,"We explored the resilience of arbtiscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities of a tropical dry forest ecosystem to land use as pastures. We compared spore community species richness, composition, abundance, and similarity between old-growth forests and active pastures, as a measure of resistance and examined the trajectory of change in successional fields when pasture use stopped to evaluate recovery. Despite a few changes in species richness, community composition and structure were strikingly similar in all sites, including the active pastures. The spore communities were considered resistant to land use as pastures and showed minor changes along succession when management stopped. We found a significant negative relation between the frequency of Diversisporales and Glomerales indicating a selective species turnover driven: mainly by the families Gigasporaceae and Glomeraceae. This was, however, unrelated to land use or successional time. These results suggest the AMF communities of this ecosystem seem resilient to management as pastures.

246,tropgrass,Effect of the shape of forest fragments on tree population dynamics,"A lattice model is used to study the influence of the shape of forest fragments on the augmentation process of a tree population following clear-cutting. Two fragments of different shapes, squarish and linear, were studied without seed immigration from the outside. Both fragments consisted initially of two patches, a 4-ha clear-cut area and a 1-ha remnant forest, mimicking a common forest management regime in Japan. Stochastic simulations using the model reveal several differences in the dynamics and equilibrium structure of the tree population between the fragments. In the squarish fragment, the forest structure reached an equilibrium state in 500-600 years, but the linear fragment took 2100-2400 years. At equilibrium, the proportion of treeless area was significantly larger in the linear fragment than in the squarish fragment. The mean area of gaps was also larger in the linear fragment. The population expansion rate from the remnant forest into the cleared area differed significantly between the two fragments: 0.63 m year(-1) in the squarish fragment, and 0.43 m year(-1) in the linear fragment. These differences are explained as arising from the spatial configuration of seed dispersal: in the linear fragment, the density of seedlings was lower by half than in the squarish fragment, because a greater proportion of seeds produced within the linear fragment were deposited outside the fragment and were lost. However, the density effect (i.e., one-sided competition among trees) mitigates the negative impact of dispersal loss on the adult population density at equilibrium. Forest fragments with linear shapes should be preferred by fugitive light-demanding species in forested landscapes.",WOS:000221178600011,2,0.761587859,0,effect of the shap of forest frag on tre pop dynam a lat model is us to study the influ of the shap of forest frag on the aug process of a tre pop follow clear cut two frag of diff shap squ and linear wer study without see immigr from the outsid both frag consist init of two patch a ha clear cut are and a ha remn forest mimick a common forest man regim in jap stochast sim us the model rev sev diff in the dynam and equilibr structure of the tre pop between the frag in the squ frag the forest structure reach an equilibr stat in year but the linear frag took year at equilibr the proport of treeless are was sign larg in the linear frag than in the squ frag the mean are of gap was also larg in the linear frag the pop expand rat from the remn forest into the clear are diff sign between the two frag m year in the squ frag and m year in the linear frag thes diff ar explain as ar from the spat config of see dispers in the linear frag the dens of seedl was low by half than in the squ frag becaus a gre proport of see produc within the linear frag wer deposit outsid the frag and wer lost howev the dens effect i e on sid competit among tre mitig the neg impact of dispers loss on the adult pop dens at equilibr forest frag with linear shap should be prefer by fugit light demand specy in forest landscap,new,0.7757327764427155,0.7240052529732873,0.690724528865877,0.6691399358491191,0.6549924771622211,0.6461066186608437,0.6415012659394974,0.6410135298694146,0.6453468615584119,0.6568178319969679,0.6821998719235235
278,tropgrass,Stability of plant communities along a tropical inselberg ecotone in French Guiana (South America),"We questioned whether and how plant communities vary in space and time along an inselberg-rainforest ecotone in relation to present-day warming and whether biotic and non-biotic factors could explain the observed patterns. The study took place on a granitic inselberg in the French Guianan (South America) rainforest (Nouragues Natural Reserve: 4 degrees 5'N, 52 degrees 41'W). In a diachronic study (1995-2005) embracing a severe El-Nino event in 1997. we analysed vegetation structure and composition along three transects subsuming whole environmental and topographical variations in the transition zone from shrub vegetation at the fringe of open-rock vegetation to tall-tree rainforest. Data were analysed by PCA. Major variations in species and trait distribution were described in the low forest, with two floristic types evidenced by first PCA component and verified by cluster analysis: one with floristic composition reminiscent of open-rock vegetation but with higher and continuous canopy, the other typical of the low forest. There is no clear-cut boundary between typical open-rock and low forest vegetation. Variation in species composition of typical low forest was evidenced by second PCA component, which displayed differences according to slope and altitude. Small (similar to 1.5 m), although significant, shifts in the spatial distribution of plant species pointed to possible slow encroachment of typical low forest vegetation in the absence of disturbance. However, the stability of species and trait distribution was remarkable within the 10-yr interval considered, despite an otherwise recorded decrease in species richness and recruitment. The boundary between typical low forest and open-rock-like vegetation coincided with the spatial limit of the mineral soil above granite. Despite demographic accidents due to severe El Nino events, plant communities at the fringe of a tropical inselberg are stable at short-time both in composition and spatial distribution. In the absence of strong disturbances such as wildfire and further erosion, soil availability for roots could be interpreted as an environmental constraint to the successional development of forest vegetation. Soil development might thus act as an ecological barrier to forest encroachment, which could only be alleviated by erosion recovery, as otherwise demonstrated. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

348,tropgrass,What happens to the soil seed bank 17 years after clear cutting of vegetations?,"Seed banks play an important role in the resilience of potential anthropogenic areas and are influenced by seasonal variation. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the forests influences the richness and density of the soil seed bank, but there is a hypothesis that such influence can be changed in anthropogenic areas, where we expect to find lower richness and seed density in relation to the seed bank of mature forests. The richness and seasonal density of seeds in the soil depth of a young caatinga forest, 17 years after an agricultural activity was abandoned, were evaluated and compared with those of a mature forest. The study was conducted at the Instituo Agronomic de Pernambuco - IPA (Estacao Experimental Jose Nilson de Melo), located in Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil, in an area of tropical dry forest, known locally as ""caatinga"". The local climate is seasonal, the dry season occurring from September to February and the rainy season concentrated in the remaining months. The average annual rainfall over time (time series of 30 years) is 692mm. In each climatic season (rainy and dry), the seed bank was sampled in 210 20x20cm plots (105 in the leaf litter and 105 at 5cm soil depth). The richness and seed density of the soil samples were evaluated by the method of seedling emergence. The seed bank had 47 species, with a predominance of herbaceous plants. Seasonal variation in richness and seed density in the soil (leaf litter + soil) was not significant, but 42 species of the mature forest were absent from the seed bank of the young forest, despite 17 years of natural regeneration and its proximity to the mature forest. On its own, the soil has greater richness and density of seeds than the leaf litter. The depth of seed deposition in the soil bank of the young forest significantly explained 36% of the species richness and 16% of the seed density, with a significant interaction effect with the climatic season only on species richness, explaining 4% of the variation recorded. The seed density of the young forest (1 277seeds/m(2)) was greater than that the mature forest indicating that the time abandoned had not yet been sufficient for complete recovery of plant diversity and there is no longer any seed limitation of pioneer species for regeneration of the young forest.",WOS:000359961900001,8,0.724200854,1,what hap to the soil see bank year aft clear cut of veget see bank play an import rol in the resy of pot anthropog area and ar influ by season vary the spat and temp heterog of the forest influ the rich and dens of the soil see bank but ther is a hypothes that such influ can be chang in anthropog area wher we expect to find low rich and see dens in rel to the see bank of mat forest the rich and season dens of see in the soil dep of a young caating forest year aft an agricult act was abandon wer evalu and comp with thos of a mat forest the study was conduc at the instituo agronom de pernambuco ip estacao expery jos nilson de melo loc in caruaru pernambuco brazil in an are of trop dry forest known loc as caating the loc clim is season the dry season occur from septemb to febru and the rainy season cont in the remain month the av an rainfal ov tim tim sery of year is mm in each clim season rainy and dry the see bank was sampl in xcm plot in the leaf lit and at cm soil dep the rich and see dens of the soil sampl wer evalu by the method of seedl emerg the see bank had specy with a predomin of herbac plant season vary in rich and see dens in the soil leaf lit soil was not sign but specy of the mat forest wer abs from the see bank of the young forest despit year of nat reg and it proxim to the mat forest on it own the soil has gre rich and dens of see than the leaf lit the dep of see deposit in the soil bank of the young forest sign explain of the specy rich and of the see dens with a sign interact effect with the clim season on on specy rich explain of the vary record the see dens of the young forest see m was gre than that the mat forest ind that the tim abandon had not yet been sufficy for complet recovery of plant divers and ther is no long any see limit of pion specy for reg of the young forest,new,0.7881980220558796,0.7187193453447378,0.6703669528172513,0.635952450909595,0.6104731981604832,0.5911535688978202,0.5764617976188351,0.5656127621291681,0.5584136456028955,0.5554532066913661,0.5593142861247662
438,tropgrass,Mycorrhiza of Brazil pine (Araucaria angustifolia [Bert. O. Ktze.]),"Tropical and subtropical forests once covered large areas of Central and South America. An important member of forests of the southern hemisphere is the genus Araucaria. Because of clear cutting only small remnants of Araucaria angustifolio forests still exist in Southern Brazil. Attempts at reforestation have had only limited success because of lack of knowledge about the environmental requirements of this species. This is especially true with respect to the root/fungus symbiosis (mycorrhiza) which is necessary for enhanced water and nutrient uptake and present in more than 90% of land plants. Analysis of the root systems of Araucaria trees from forest and grassland (campo) sites revealed mycorrhizal structures (appressoria, penetration and coiled hyphae, vesicles, arbuscules, spores) which are characteristic for the arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) type. The spores of AM fungi at both sites - forest and campo - were identified. The biodiversity at the forest site was much higher, with 13 species, whereas only 6 different species could be identified at the campo site. Glomus and Acaulospora were the only genera present at the campo. The forest, however, also contained spores of Entrophospora and Scutellospora. In addition to the greater biodiversity, the spore number in soil as well as the percent mycorrhizal colonization in roots were significantly higher at the forest site than at the campo site. Because of the low frequency of hyphal coils and the dominating intercellular growth of hyphae, these mycorrhizas can be classified as an Arum-type, which is the first report of this kind in gymnosperms.",WOS:000085349600002,5,0.68614948,1,mycorrhiz of brazil pin araucar angustifol bert o ktze trop and subtrop forest ont cov larg area of cent and sou americ an import memb of forest of the southern hemisph is the gen araucar becaus of clear cut on smal remn of araucar angustifolio forest stil ex in southern brazil attempt at reforest hav had on limit success becaus of lack of knowledg about the environ requir of thi specy thi is espec tru with respect to the root fung symbios mycorrhiz which is necess for enh wat and nutry uptak and pres in mor than of land plant analys of the root system of araucar tre from forest and grassland campo sit rev mycorrh structures appressor penet and coil hypha vesic arbusc spor which ar charact for the arbuscul mycorrhiz am typ the spor of am fung at both sit forest and campo wer ident the biodivers at the forest sit was much high with specy wherea on diff specy could be ident at the campo sit glom and acaulospor wer the on gener pres at the campo the forest howev also contain spor of entrophospor and scutellospor in addit to the gre biodivers the spor numb in soil as wel as the perc mycorrh colon in root wer sign high at the forest sit than at the campo sit becaus of the low frequ of hyph coil and the domin intercellul grow of hypha thes mycorrhiza can be class as an ar typ which is the first report of thi kind in gymnosperm,new,0.6868159048299244,0.6178906602452826,0.5752096763089065,0.5483860877381715,0.531446667597806,0.5214639097388034,0.5171809552125783,0.5184674722156528,0.5264254968084651,0.5444794883676543,0.5824951323318204

Four native mammal species were commonly recorded in the original sampling: sandstone antechinus (Pseudantechinus bilarni), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), Arnhem rock-rat (Zyzomys maini) and common rock-rat (Z. argurus). Trap success rates declined significantly for the northern quoll, Arnhem rock-rat and all species combined, but increased for the common rock-rat. Despite being recorded commonly in the initial (1977-79) study, no Arnhem rock-rats were recorded in the most recent (2002) sampling. Trap success rates for northern quoll declined by 90% from 1977-79 to 2002. The reasons for change are not clear-cut. Notably, all sampling occurred before the arrival of cane toads (Rhinella marina), a factor that has caused severe decline in northern quoll numbers elsewhere. Fire was more frequent in the sampling area in the period preceding the 2002 sampling than it was in the period preceding the initial (1977-79) sampling, and this may have contributed to change in mammal abundance.",WOS:000439693400007,3,0.537457974,0,declin in the mam assembl of a rug sandston environ in kakadu nat park northern territ austral ther has been mark rec declin in the terrest mam faun across much of northern austral with most docu of such declin for lowland area her we report chang in the assembl of smal mam in a rug sandston environ nawurlandj in kakadu nat park ov intermit sampl between and four nat mam specy wer common record in the origin sampl sandston antechin pseudantechin bilarn northern quol dasyur hallucat arnhem rock rat zyzom main and common rock rat z argur trap success rat declin sign for the northern quol arnhem rock rat and al specy combin but increas for the common rock rat despit being record common in the init study no arnhem rock rat wer record in the most rec sampl trap success rat for northern quol declin by from to the reason for chang ar not clear cut not al sampl occur bef the ar of can toad rhinell marin a fact that has caus sev declin in northern quol numb elsewh fir was mor frequ in the sampl are in the period prec the sampl than it was in the period prec the init sampl and thi may hav contribut to chang in mam abund,new,0.5233269264999418,0.49991919796491197,0.49203287246096816,0.49215254329844715,0.497589462907034,0.507590906639675,0.522420778317036,0.5432684070770778,0.5727761252259094,0.6167891702966483,0.6893812862476385
856,tropgrass,"Climate change impacts on the sustainability of the firewood harvest and vegetation and soil carbon stocks in a tropical dry forest in Santa Teresinha Municipality, Northeast Brazil","The Brazilian semi-arid region is characterized by low and erratic rainfall, high temperatures and high potential evapotranspiration. The removal of firewood from the native tropical dry forest, called ""Caatinga"", can negatively impact important ecosystem services, such as soil conservation, water resources, biodiversity and atmospheric carbon capture, if performed in an unsustainable manner. Most global climate models indicate that Caatinga will experience temperature increases and rainfall decreases in the next few decades. We used the Century model to simulate the impact of climate changes on woody vegetation growth and on vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks in a Caatinga area managed with a single clear cut or cuts every 10 years, 15 years, and 20 years, followed or not followed by the burning of plant residues (leaves and small branches) left after firewood removal. The effects of future climate projections, (LOW, MIDI and HIGH members of the climate scenario SRES A1B, which corresponded to different CO2 emission predictions, downscaled by the Eta/CPTEC model), were compared to those of the projection of the historical climate. With the current climate, it would take 50 years to regenerate the Caatinga biomass stock to a level close to that before cutting after a single cut, followed or not followed by fire. Therefore, the recommended cutting cycles (10-20 years) were not long enough to allow for the regeneration of a fully mature Caatinga. However, all of these cycles reached sustainable biomass production levels, with similar total productions until the end of the century. Under these conditions, the lower proportions of biomass recovery of shorter cycles would be compensated by more frequent cutting. The model also indicated that burning or not burning the residues would have little effect. On the contrary, if the climate changes as predicted, the biomass of the native Caatinga vegetation and soil organic carbon stock would decrease throughout this century, even without cutting the vegetation. All of the cutting cycles would not provide sustainable firewood production, with reduced production after each consecutive cut. Therefore, if the climate changes as expected, forest management legislation should require longer periods of forest recovery between cutting cycles for sites with environmental conditions (e.g., climate, soil and vegetation) similar to those of the present study.

160,tundra,"Seismic lines in the boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America: environmental impacts, challenges, and opportunities","The oil and gas industry has grown significantly throughout the boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America. A major feature of the ecological footprint of oil and gas exploration is seismic lines-narrow corridors used to transport and deploy geophysical survey equipment. These lines, which traverse forests, tundra, uplands, and peatlands, were historically up to 10 m wide. Over the past decade, seismic lines have decreased in width (in some cases down to 1.75-3m); however, their density has increased drastically and their construction is expected to continue in regions of Canada and the United States that are rich in oil and gas resources. We examine the literature related to the environmental impacts of, and restoration and reclamation efforts associated with, seismic lines in the boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America. With respect to conventional seismic lines, numerous studies report significant and persistent environmental changes along these lines and slow recovery of vegetation that translates into a lasting fragmentation of the landscape. This fragmentation has many ramifications for biodiversity and ecosystem processes, including significant implications for threatened woodland caribou herds. While modern, low-impact seismic lines have comparatively lower ecological effects at the site-level, their high density and associated potential edge effects suggest that their actual environmental impact may be underestimated. Seismic line restoration is a critical aspect of future integrated landscape management in hydrocarbon-rich regions of the boreal-arctic, and if widely applied, has the potential to benefit a wide range of species and maintain or re-establish key ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity.",WOS:000433097600008,1,0.473730979,0,seism lin in the bor and arct ecosystem of nor americ environ impact challeng and opportun the oil and gas industry has grown sign throughout the bor and arct ecosystem of nor americ a maj feat of the ecolog footprint of oil and gas expl is seism lin narrow corrid us to transport and deploy geophys survey equip thes lin which travers forest tundr upland and peatland wer hist up to m wid ov the past decad seism lin hav decreas in wid in som cas down to m howev their dens has increas drast and their construct is expect to continu in reg of canad and the unit stat that ar rich in oil and gas resourc we examin the lit rel to the environ impact of and rest and reclam effort assocy with seism lin in the bor and arct ecosystem of nor americ with respect to conv seism lin num study report sign and persist environ chang along thes lin and slow recovery of veget that transl into a last frag of the landscap thi frag has many ram for biodivers and ecosystem process includ sign imply for threatened woodland caribou herd whil modern low impact seism lin hav comp low ecolog effect at the sit level their high dens and assocy pot edg effect suggest that their act environ impact may be underestim seism lin rest is a crit aspect of fut integr landscap man in hydrocarbon rich reg of the bor arct and if wid apply has the pot to benefit a wid rang of specy and maintain or re est key ecosystem serv such as carbon sequest and biodivers,new,0.44801786528081844,0.41015296557702585,0.39291071078269935,0.38673493107131574,0.3877234889654739,0.394585261903575,0.407438852809548,0.4276924682129841,0.4587943309173264,0.5088915565895901,0.5992866737825119
226,tundra,"Environmental perturbation, grazing pressure and soil wetness jointly drive mountain tundra toward divergent alternative states","Plant communities are structured by complex interactions between multiple factors, which veil our understanding of the effects of environmental changes on communities and ecosystems. Besides the relative role of biotic and abiotic factors as community-structuring processes, addressing how they jointly affect the ecological resilience and resistance of plant communities is crucial to understand better the long-term response of communities facing global changes. Here, we used the results from a long-term (23years) perturbation experiment set up in Fennoscandian mountain tundra to test these mechanisms. The experiment consisted of a transplantation of twenty blocks of Vaccinium myrtillus heath vegetation including upper soil layer from a lower elevation tundra heath habitat to a snowbed habitat 150m higher in elevation where V.myrtillus lies at its upper limit. In the snowbed with contrasting levels of soil wetness, half of the transplanted blocks were protected from mammalian herbivores. Our results revealed that in addition to the important role of environmental conditions as a structuring force, the joint effects of multiple drivers resulted in divergent patterns in both plant functional composition and species diversity among transplanted communities. Under environmental perturbation (i.e. transplantation to snowbed), the heath vegetation was altered by grazing pressure that reduced the cover of shrubs (especially V.myrtillus). In grazed dry snowbed, a species-rich community with high functional type evenness and diversity developed. Reversely, in dry exclosures, V.myrtillus gained high dominance associated with only few graminoids and forbs. In wet snowbed conditions, shrubs tended to decline both in grazed plots and exclosures whereas bryophytes attained high abundance. Grazing promoted species richness while soil waterlogging tended to promote among-plot heterogeneity (-diversity) which was highest in wet exclosures.Synthesis. Our long-term experiment reveals that environmental perturbation, grazing and soil wetness exhibit joint effects that induce divergent trajectories of tundra plant communities. We suggest that a strong environmental perturbation triggers mountain tundra heath community to move away from its equilibrium state. The outcome of this shift depends on the interplay between grazing pressure and soil wetness that drive tundra plant communities toward divergent alternative states.",WOS:000344333800030,2,0.561638058,0,environ perturb graz press and soil wet joint driv mountain tundr toward diverg altern stat plant commun ar structured by complex interact between multipl fact which veil our understand of the effect of environ chang on commun and ecosystem besid the rel rol of biot and abiot fact as commun structuring process address how they joint affect the ecolog resy and resist of plant commun is cruc to understand bet the long term respons of commun fac glob chang her we us the result from a long term year perturb expery set up in fennoscand mountain tundr to test thes mech the expery consist of a transpl of twenty block of vaccin myrtill hea veget includ up soil lay from a low elev tundr hea habit to a snowb habit m high in elev wher v myrtill lie at it up limit in the snowb with contrast level of soil wet half of the transpl block wer protect from mam herb our result rev that in addit to the import rol of environ condit as a structuring forc the joint effect of multipl driv result in diverg pattern in both plant funct composit and specy divers among transpl commun und environ perturb i e transpl to snowb the hea veget was alt by graz press that reduc the cov of shrubs espec v myrtill in graz dry snowb a specy rich commun with high funct typ ev and divers develop revers in dry exclos v myrtill gain high domin assocy with on few graminoid and forb in wet snowb condit shrubs tend to declin both in graz plot and exclos wherea bryophyt attain high abund graz promot specy rich whil soil waterlog tend to promot among plot heterog divers which was highest in wet exclos synthes our long term expery rev that environ perturb graz and soil wet exhibit joint effect that induc diverg traject of tundr plant commun we suggest that a strong environ perturb trig mountain tundr hea commun to mov away from it equilibr stat the outcom of thi shift depend on the interplay between graz press and soil wet that driv tundr plant commun toward diverg altern stat,new,0.5998231217606562,0.5547142778755803,0.529535233507703,0.5154189024943626,0.5085002023523615,0.5071691721984903,0.5110182685506569,0.5205999596758025,0.5378103907086538,0.5674803859579377,0.6228024255497729
322,tundra,"Changes in the abundance, composition and species richness of mountain vegetation in relation to summer grazing by reindeer","Question: How do reduced levels of summer grazing by reindeer affect the abundance, composition and species richness of mountain plant communities? Location: Arctic-alpine mountain vegetation 700-850 m a.s.l., Saana Conservation Area, northwestern Finnish Lapland. Methods: Permanent plots were established in 1990 and resampled in 1999 or 2001. The number of reindeer had considerably declined from the 1980s to the 1990s and we followed the recovery of vegetation. The comparisons between 1990 and 1999/2001 were made at seven sites differing in their original grazing pressure. Results: At the initially heavily grazed sites, lichen abundances increased, but at the lightly grazed sites the abundances of lichens decreased. Graminoids declined at all sites, but the change seemed to be greatest at the most heavily grazed sites. Forbs increased slightly across all sites. At the species level, lichens and graminoids responded most notably to the reduction of grazing pressure. Individual species responses in shrubs were variable and among forbs, typical species of species-rich Dryas heaths increased. Total species richness increased at all sites and the change was greater at heavily grazed sites. This increase resulted mainly from increased bryophyte and lichen species richness but also from a slight increase in vascular plant species richness. Conclusions: These results suggest that lichens are the group most responsive to the reduction of heavy summer grazing by reindeer and that lichens and forbs typical in arctic-alpine Dryas heaths are favoured over graminoids under reduced grazing. Heavy grazing decreases overall species richness with the most pronounced effects on bryophyte and lichen species richness.

We tested the role of geese for structuring bryophyte communities at fine spatial scales in the arctic tundra by excluding them from 4 x 4 m areas. We surveyed the presence and absence of bryophyte species in quadrats (10 x 10 cm) divided into 25 cells outside and inside these exclosures, after 5 and 11 years of treatment. Species richness per cell (4 cm(2)) was higher in the presence of geese, especially after 11 years of treatment, while geese had little effect on richness at larger scales (i.e. quadrat and whole exclosure). The slope of the species-area relationship within quadrats was consequently shallower outside exclosures. Our results further suggest that the community outside the exclosures was more variable in space and time than that inside the exclosures.

Location Northern Fennoscandia, Europe. Methods We resampled tree line ecotone vegetation sites sampled 26 years earlier. To quantify compositional changes, we used generalized linear models to test relationships between compositional changes and environmental gradients. Results Compositional changes in species abundances are positively related to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based estimate of productivity gradient and to geomorphological disturbance. Competitive species in fertile sites show the greatest changes in abundance, opposed to negligible changes in infertile sites. Change in species richness is negatively related to initial richness, whereas geomorphological disturbance has positive effects on change in richness. Few lowland species have moved towards higher elevations. Main conclusions The sensitivity of vegetation to climate change depends on a complex interplay between productivity, physical and biotic disturbances, plant functional composition and richness. Our results suggest that vegetation on productive sites, such as herb-rich deciduous forests at low altitudes, is more sensitive to climate warming than alpine tundra vegetation where grazing may have strong buffering effects.

In addition, species-specific associations between understorey species and shrub volume were analysed. Results: Shrub abundance was shown to be associated with the composition of understorey vegetation, and the association patterns were consistent across the study sites. Increased forb cover was positively associated with shrub volume, whereas bryophyte, lichen, dwarf shrub and graminoid cover decreased in association with increasing volume of deciduous shrubs.

However, little is known of the effect of herbivores on plant colonisation following disturbance, and on its variability depending on the identity of herbivores and the characteristics of the habitats. To quantify the role of large and small vertebrate herbivores, we established exclosures of two different mesh sizes around disturbed subplots in forest and nearby tundra habitats in four contrasting locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and Norway. The study revealed that herbivores influenced the abundance but not the species composition of regenerating vegetation. Gaps were colonised by the dominant species in the surrounding vegetation. The only exception to this expectation was Empetrum nigrum, which failed to colonise gaps even though it dominated undisturbed vegetation. Significant effects of herbivory were only detected when both small and large herbivores were excluded. Herbivores decreased the abundance of three of the most common species Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis idaea, and Deschampsia flexuosa. The effect of herbivory on the abundance of these three species did not differ between habitats and locations. However, the composition of the regenerating vegetation differed between habitats and locations. The disturbance treatment increased the species richness on the scale of plots, habitats, and sites. However, on the scale of whole locations, all species found in disturbed areas were also found in undisturbed areas, suggesting that the natural disturbance regime in arctic landscapes is high enough to sustain colonising species.",WOS:000231824400010,8,0.8374108809999999,0,effect of mam herb on reveget of disturb area in the forest tundr ecoton in northern fennoscand herb influ the structure of plant commun in arct alpin ecosystem howev littl is known of the effect of herb on plant colon follow disturb and on it vary depend on the id of herb and the charact of the habit to quant the rol of larg and smal vertebr herb we est exclos of two diff mesh siz around disturb subplot in forest and nearby tundr habit in four contrast loc in the forest tundr ecoton in northernmost swed and norway the study rev that herb influ the abund but not the specy composit of reg veget gap wer colon by the domin specy in the surround veget the on exceiv to thi expect was empetr nigr which fail to colon gap ev though it domin undisturb veget sign effect of herb wer on detect when both smal and larg herb wer exclud herb decreas the abund of three of the most common specy vaccin myrtill vaccin vit idae and deschamps flexuos the effect of herb on the abund of thes three specy did not diff between habit and loc howev the composit of the reg veget diff between habit and loc the disturb tre increas the specy rich on the scal of plot habit and sit howev on the scal of whol loc al specy found in disturb area wer also found in undisturb area suggest that the nat disturb regim in arct landscap is high enough to sustain colon specy,new,0.8529918066174497,0.7828625267149464,0.7303706711634586,0.6911854670845674,0.6607422186879117,0.6362616914461872,0.6161160986976081,0.5993415682849956,0.5854318645987004,0.5743684696937793,0.5672813189336157
912,tundra,Browsing-mediated shrub canopy changes drive composition and species richness in forest-tundra ecosystems,"Changes in climate and in browsing pressure are expected to alter the abundance of tundra shrubs thereby influencing the composition and species richness of plant communities. We investigated the associations between browsing, tundra shrub canopies and their understory vegetation by utilizing a long-term (1013 seasons) experiment controlling reindeer and ptarmigan herbivory in the subarctic forest tundra ecotone in northwestern Fennoscandia. In this area, there has also been a consistent increase in the yearly thermal sum and precipitation during the study period. The cover of shrubs increased 2.87.8 fold in exclosures and these contrasted with browsed control areas creating a sharp gradient of canopy cover of tundra shrubs across a variety of vegetation types. Browsing exclusions caused significant shifts in more productive vegetation types, whereas little or no shift occurred in low-productive tundra communities. The increased deciduous shrub cover was associated with significant losses of understory plant species and shifts in functional composition, the latter being clearest in the most productive plant community types. The total cover of understory vegetation decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of litter showed the opposite response. The cover of cryptogams decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of forbs was favoured by a shrub cover. Increasing shrub cover decreased species richness of understory vegetation, which was mainly due to the decrease in the cryptogam species. The effects were consistent across different types of forest tundra vegetation indicating that shrub increase may have broad impacts on arctic vegetation diversity. Deciduous shrub cover is strongly regulated by reindeer browsing pressure and altered browsing pressure may result in a profound shrub expansion over the next one or two decades. Results suggest that the impact of an increase in shrubs on tundra plant richness is strong and browsing pressure effectively counteracts the effects of climate warming-driven shrub expansion and hence maintains species richness.",WOS:000308634600005,9,0.678068338,0,brows medy shrub canop chang driv composit and specy rich in forest tundr ecosystem chang in clim and in brows press ar expect to alt the abund of tundr shrubs thereby influ the composit and specy rich of plant commun we investig the assocy between brows tundr shrub canop and their underst veget by util a long term season expery control reind and ptarmig herb in the subarct forest tundr ecoton in northwestern fennoscand in thi are ther has also been a consist increas in the year therm sum and precipit dur the study period the cov of shrubs increas fold in exclos and thes contrast with brows control area cre a sharp grady of canop cov of tundr shrubs across a vary of veget typ brows exclud caus sign shift in mor produc veget typ wherea littl or no shift occur in low produc tundr commun the increas decidu shrub cov was assocy with sign loss of underst plant specy and shift in funct composit the lat being clearest in the most produc plant commun typ the tot cov of underst veget decreas along with increas shrub cov whil the cov of lit show the opposit respons the cov of cryptogam decreas along with increas shrub cov whil the cov of forb was favo by a shrub cov increas shrub cov decreas specy rich of underst veget which was main due to the decreas in the cryptogam specy the effect wer consist across diff typ of forest tundr veget ind that shrub increas may hav broad impact on arct veget divers decidu shrub cov is strongly reg by reind brows press and alt brows press may result in a profound shrub expand ov the next on or two decad result suggest that the impact of an increas in shrubs on tundr plant rich is strong and brows press effect counteract the effect of clim warm driv shrub expand and hent maintain specy rich,new,0.7254553492208864,0.6356256543295298,0.5773466392086696,0.538933663038533,0.5127089732084861,0.4947252173609822,0.48307230959033814,0.4770806034024594,0.4772698125716318,0.48619823447413413,0.5121956763803294
1012,tundra,Long-term mammalian herbivory and nutrient addition alter lichen community structure in Alaskan dry heath tundra,"Mammalian herbivores in arctic tundra often alter plant species composition and lichen abundance, with effects dependent on grazing season and herbivore preference. We investigated how long-term mammal exclosures designed to exclude large mammals (caribou) alone, large and medium-sized mammals (e.g., ground squirrels), or all mammals (including voles and lemmings) affected lichen abundance and species composition as well as the vascular plant community. The exclosures were partly established in combination with long-term soil nutrient additions to investigate the interaction between mammal activity and nutrient availability. Our study was conducted in dry heath tundra in northern Alaska, dominated by dwarf evergreen shrubs and lichens. Excluding mammals for 17 years allowed the lichen community to increase in biomass, particularly within the genus Cladonia, which also had more intrageneric diversity in the exclosures; after 10 years, results were subtler. Fertilization, however, almost eliminated the lichens, regardless of herbivore treatment. This coincided with a dramatic shift in vascular vegetation toward a more palatable grass-dominated community, similar to studies of other arctic heaths. Our results suggest that with greater soil nutrient availability that occurs with climate warming, lichens will decrease in abundance, and this effect may be exacerbated by increased mammalian herbivory.",WOS:000252869000007,10,0.5731098379999999,0,long term mam herb and nutry addit alt lich commun structure in alask dry hea tundr mam herb in arct tundr oft alt plant specy composit and lich abund with effect depend on graz season and herb pref we investig how long term mam exclos design to exclud larg mam caribou alon larg and med siz mam e g ground squirrel or al mam includ vol and lem affect lich abund and specy composit as wel as the vascul plant commun the exclos wer part est in combin with long term soil nutry addit to investig the interact between mam act and nutry avail our study was conduc in dry hea tundr in northern alask domin by dwarf evergreen shrubs and lich exclud mam for year allow the lich commun to increas in biomass particul within the gen cladon which also had mor int divers in the exclos aft year result wer subtl fertil howev almost elimin the lich regardless of herb tre thi coincid with a dram shift in vascul veget toward a mor pal grass domin commun simil to study of oth arct heath our result suggest that with gre soil nutry avail that occ with clim warm lich wil decreas in abund and thi effect may be exacerb by increas mam herb,new,0.6175159295453633,0.5714739806171678,0.5451277163456828,0.5297391368724668,0.5213895013711703,0.5184293437107714,0.5203836222215916,0.527699882135344,0.5420640941888757,0.5678690945198593,0.6173478431098015

1213,tundra,Plant species diversity and grazing in the Scandinavian mountains - patterns and processes at different spatial scales,"There is a long tradition of grazing by semi-domestic reindeer and sheep in alpine and sub-alpine Scandinavian habitats, but present management regimes are questioned from a conservation point of view. In this review we discuss plant diversity patterns in the Scandinavian mountains in a global regional and local perspective. The main objective was to identify processes that influence diversity at different spatial scales with a particular focus on grazing. In a global perspective the species pool of the Scandinavian mountains is limited, partly reflecting the general latitudinal decline of species but also historical and ecological factors operating after the latest glaciation. At the local scale, both productivity and disturbance are primary factors structuring diversity, but abiotic factors such as soil pH, snow distribution and temperature are also important. Although evidence is scarce, grazing favours local species richness in productive habitats, whereas species richness decreases with grazing when productivity is low. Regional patterns of plant diversity is set by, 1) the species pool, 2) the heterogeneity and fragmentation of communities, and 3) local diversity of each plant community. We suggest that local shifts in community composition depend both on the local grazing frequency and the return-time of the plant community after a grazing session. In addition, an increasing number of grazing-modified local patches homogenises the vegetation and is likely to reduce the regional plant diversity. The time scale of local shifts in community composition depends on plant colonisation and persistence, From a mechanistic point of view, diversity patterns at a regional scale also depend on the regional dynamics of single species. Colonisation is usually a slow and irregular process in alpine environments, whereas the capacity for extended local persistence is generally high. Although the poor knowledge of plant regional dynamics restricts our understanding of how grazing influences plant diversity, we conclude that grazing is a key process for maintaining biodiversity in the Scandinavian mountains.",WOS:000173491900007,12,0.721115579,0,plant specy divers and graz in the scandinav mountain pattern and process at diff spat scal ther is a long tradit of graz by sem domest reind and sheep in alpin and sub alpin scandinav habit but pres man regim ar quest from a conserv point of view in thi review we discuss plant divers pattern in the scandinav mountain in a glob reg and loc perspect the main object was to ident process that influ divers at diff spat scal with a particul foc on graz in a glob perspect the specy pool of the scandinav mountain is limit part reflect the gen latitudin declin of specy but also hist and ecolog fact op aft the latest glacy at the loc scal both produc and disturb ar prim fact structuring divers but abiot fact such as soil ph snow distribut and temp ar also import although evid is scarc graz favo loc specy rich in produc habit wherea specy rich decreas with graz when produc is low reg pattern of plant divers is set by the specy pool the heterog and frag of commun and loc divers of each plant commun we suggest that loc shift in commun composit depend both on the loc graz frequ and the return tim of the plant commun aft a graz sess in addit an increas numb of graz mod loc patch homog the veget and is lik to reduc the reg plant divers the tim scal of loc shift in commun composit depend on plant colon and persist from a mech point of view divers pattern at a reg scal also depend on the reg dynam of singl specy colon is us a slow and irregul process in alpin environ wherea the capac for extend loc persist is gen high although the poor knowledg of plant reg dynam restrict our understand of how graz influ plant divers we conclud that graz is a key process for maintain biodivers in the scandinav mountain,new,0.7877761163907003,0.7410724616129248,0.7107249554759005,0.6898094883573582,0.6748937496714502,0.6643068106868497,0.6572763106982632,0.6536153943591477,0.6537749160980612,0.6594244237639659,0.6757071250405936

The experimental sites included tundra heath, frost heath and riparian habitats, and the two latter habitats were characterized by hummock-hollow ground forms. The total cover of vegetation, cover of willow (Salix spp.), dwarf birch (Betula nana), dwarf shrubs, forbs and grasses (Poaceae spp.) increased in exclosures in all habitats. The increase in the total cover of vegetation and in the covers of willow and dwarf birch tended to be greatest in the least productive tundra heath. Opposing to the increase in the dominant vascular plant groups, the cover and species number of bryophytes decreased in exclosures.

We imported seeds of lowland species to tundra under factorial treatments of warming, fertilization, herbivore exclusion and biomass removal. We show that warming alone had little impact on lowland species, while exclusion of native herbivores and relaxation of nutrient limitation greatly benefitted them. In contrast, warming alone benefitted resident tundra species and increased species richness; however, these were canceled by negative effects of herbivore exclusion and fertilization. Dominance of lowland species was associated with low cover of tundra species and resulted in decreased species richness. Our results highlight the critical role of biotic and abiotic filters unrelated to temperature in protecting tundra under warmer climate. While scarcity of soil nutrients and native herbivores act as important agents of resistance to invasions by lowland species, they concurrently promote overall species coexistence. However, when these biotic and abiotic resistances are relaxed, invasion of lowland species can lead to decreased abundance of resident tundra species and diminished diversity.",WOS:000390218300021,14,0.472032181,0,herb and nutry limit protect warm tundr from lowland specy invas and divers loss herb and nutry limit can increas the resist of temp limit system to invas und clim warm we import see of lowland specy to tundr und fact tre of warm fertil herb exclud and biomass remov we show that warm alon had littl impact on lowland specy whil exclud of nat herb and relax of nutry limit gre benefit them in contrast warm alon benefit resid tundr specy and increas specy rich howev thes wer cancel by neg effect of herb exclud and fertil domin of lowland specy was assocy with low cov of tundr specy and result in decreas specy rich our result highlight the crit rol of biot and abiot filt unrel to temp in protect tundr und warm clim whil scarc of soil nutry and nat herb act as import ag of resist to invas by lowland specy they concur promot overal specy coex howev when thes biot and abiot resist ar relax invas of lowland specy can lead to decreas abund of resid tundr specy and dimin divers,new,0.4829870627725466,0.44412496568322696,0.4255314303796076,0.41779002853846897,0.41708527533985273,0.42206979368220465,0.43271625383000745,0.4501598189608426,0.4773054754968406,0.5210713330666727,0.5996151788504425

Higher species losses occurred at the drier sites where N was less available. Moreover, we observed an indirect effect of climate change on species richness as mediated by plant-plant interactions.

3110,tundra,Grazing and spring snow counteract the effects of warming on an alpine plant community in Tibet through effects on the dominant species,"Although studies have investigated the independent effects of warming, snow, and grazing on alpine plant community properties - including plant species richness, evenness, and diversity - the interactive effects of these climate and grazing factors have not been addressed experimentally in cold systems. We investigate the effects of these climate change and grazing factors using 5 years of data collected from a relatively long-term (2009-2015), fully-factorial field experiment in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, we investigate: 1) how experimental warming, spring snow addition, and yak grazing independently and interactively affect plant community properties, including diversity metrics and relative contributions of different plant life forms to the total plant cover, and 2) how the changes in plant community properties are associated with the proportional cover of the dominant plant species, Kobresia pygmaea within the total vegetation cover. We found that warming reduced species richness and increased species evenness and the proportional cover of shrubs within the total vegetation cover. Snow addition also increased species evenness. Grazing increased the proportional cover of K. pygmaea within the total vegetation cover, while decreasing that of grasses. Grazing also counteracted warming-induced increases in shrubs. Treatment-induced changes in K. pygmaea cover were strongly correlated with the indices of plant community properties and were generally in the opposite direction of changes in species evenness and diversity.

381,tundra,Plant diversity changes and succession along resource availability and disturbance gradients in Kamchatka,"Changes in plant species richness across environmental and temporal gradients have often been explained by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and a unimodal diversity-productivity relationship. We tested these predictions using two sets of mountain plant communities assembled along postglacial successional and snow depth (disturbance and stress) gradients in maritime Kamchatka. In each community, we counted the number of species in plots of increasing sizes (0.0025-100 m(2)) and analyzed them using species-area curves fitted by the Arrhenius power function and the Gleason logarithmic function. A comparison of successional communities along a 270-year-old moraine chronosequence behind the receding Koryto Glacier-representing gradients of increasing productivity and resource competition-confirmed the unimodal species richness pattern. The plant diversity peaked in a 60-80-year-old Salix-Alnus stand where light availability was sufficient to sustain a rich understory combining pioneer and late successional herbs. The closed Alnus canopy on older moraines caused a pronounced decrease in species richness for all plot sizes (interactive stage 80-120 years since deglaciation). A slight increase in species richness in the oldest assortative stages (120-270 years), when Alnus stands are mature, was found only at the smaller spatial scales. This reflects (i) the consolidation of clonal understory dominants and (ii) the absence of other woody species such as Betula ermanii whose invasion would eliminate Alnus and increase diversity at larger spatial scales. A comparative study of major mountain plant communities distributed above the Koryto Glacier foreland did not confirm the highest species richness at intermediate levels of disturbance and stress. Contrary to our expectation, the species richness was highest in alpine tundra and snowbed communities, which are subjected to severe winter frost and a short summer season, while less disturbed communities of subalpine meadows, heaths, and Betula ermanii woods were less species-rich. We attribute this pattern to differences in habitat area and species pool size.",WOS:000315491300012,38,0.801523137,0,plant divers chang and success along resourc avail and disturb grady in kamchatk chang in plant specy rich across environ and temp grady hav oft been explain by the intermedy disturb hypothes and a unimod divers produc rel we test thes predict us two set of mountain plant commun assembl along postglac success and snow dep disturb and stress grady in maritim kamchatk in each commun we count the numb of specy in plot of increas siz m and analys them us specy are curv fit by the arrheni pow funct and the gleason logarithm funct a comparison of success commun along a year old morain chronosequence behind the rec koryto glacy repres grady of increas produc and resourc competit confirm the unimod specy rich pattern the plant divers peak in a year old salix aln stand wher light avail was sufficy to sustain a rich underst combin pion and lat success herb the clos aln canop on old morain caus a pronount decreas in specy rich for al plot siz interact stag year sint degl a slight increas in specy rich in the oldest assort stag year when aln stand ar mat was found on at the smal spat scal thi reflect i the consolid of clon underst domin and ii the abs of oth woody specy such as betul ermani whos invas would elimin aln and increas divers at larg spat scal a comp study of maj mountain plant commun distribut abov the koryto glacy foreland did not confirm the highest specy rich at intermedy level of disturb and stress cont to our expect the specy rich was highest in alpin tundr and snowb commun which ar subject to sev wint frost and a short sum season whil less disturb commun of subalpin meadow heath and betul ermani wood wer less specy rich we attribut thi pattern to diff in habit are and specy pool siz,new,0.8308838257732098,0.7862136096669584,0.756376516701675,0.7350625518391828,0.7190392955137297,0.7066782812523865,0.6971302685265136,0.6899971283040282,0.6852612816834848,0.6834935241109539,0.6868872260152658
471,tundra,Variations in mountain vegetation use by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) affects dry heath but not grass heath,"Question: Are differences in landscape use of semi-domesticated reindeer reflected in the vegetation of summer grazing grounds? Location: Alpine heaths, central east Sweden. Methods: Dry heath and grass heath vegetation plots with inferred grazing intensities (high, intermediate and low) were selected a priori from an interpolated pellet count map compiled in 2002. In each plot, faecal pellets were counted, environmental variables measured and vegetation sampled by listing presence and absence. Species composition was compared with a detrended correspondence analysis, and a canonical correspondence analysis was used to infer relations between species composition and environmental variables. Plots were also clustered to provide groupings for an indicator species analysis. Results: Significant differences in faecal pellet count were present between the highest and lowest grazing intensities for both vegetation types, showing that the pattern in the interpolated pellet maps was robust. Differences in species composition between grazing intensities were found for the dry heath only. Here, there was an apparent grazing gradient, with lichens and mosses in the low-use plots and grasses and herbs in the high-use plots. No such gradient was found for the grass heath. Conclusions: Within the dry heath vegetation type, grazing levels had a subtle effect on the vegetation, while no effects were seen in the grass heath, probably as a result of the dominance of more grazing-tolerant graminoids. Even in the dry heath, species richness did not differ between grazing levels, but the relative abundances of species differed.",WOS:000270031300003,47,0.70425066,0,vary in mountain veget us by reind rang tarand affect dry hea but not grass hea quest ar diff in landscap us of sem domest reind reflect in the veget of sum graz ground loc alpin heath cent east swed method dry hea and grass hea veget plot with infer graz intens high intermedy and low wer select a prior from an interpol pellet count map compil in in each plot faec pellet wer count environ vary meas and veget sampl by list pres and abs specy composit was comp with a detrend correspond analys and a canon correspond analys was us to inf rel between specy composit and environ vary plot wer also clust to provid group for an ind specy analys result sign diff in faec pellet count wer pres between the highest and lowest graz intens for both veget typ show that the pattern in the interpol pellet map was robust diff in specy composit between graz intens wer found for the dry hea on her ther was an app graz grady with lich and moss in the low us plot and grass and herb in the high us plot no such grady was found for the grass hea conclud within the dry hea veget typ graz level had a subtl effect on the veget whil no effect wer seen in the grass hea prob as a result of the domin of mor graz tol graminoid ev in the dry hea specy rich did not diff between graz level but the rel abund of specy diff,new,0.7530385334447984,0.7081072789662836,0.6808062319769803,0.6635519327297118,0.6526058851137831,0.6462514773890198,0.6438207859256703,0.6453658948954281,0.6517922474568573,0.6657395866677733,0.6947650637065313
591,tundra,Tundra fire alters vegetation patterns more than the resultant thermokarst,"Tundra fires are increasing in their frequencies and intensities due to global warming, which alter revegetation patterns through various pathways. To understand the effects of tundra fire and the resultant thermokarst on revegetation, vegetation and related environmental factors were compared between burned and unburned areas of Seward Peninsula, Alaska, using a total of 140 plots, 50 cm x 50 cm each. The area was burned in 2002 and surveyed in 2013. Seven vegetation types were classified by a cluster analysis and were categorized along a fire-severity gradient from none to severe fire intensity. The species richness and diversity were higher in intermediately disturbed plots. Severe fire allowed the immigration of fire-favored species (e.g., Epilobium angustifolium, Ceratodon purpureus) and decreased or did not change the species diversity, indicating that species replacement occurred within the severely burned site. Although thermokarsts (ground subsidence) broadly occurred on burned sites, due to thawing, the subsidence weakly influenced vegetation patterns. These results suggest that the fire directly altered the species composition at a landscape scale between the burned and unburned sites and it indirectly altered the plant cover and diversity through the differential modification, such as thermokarst, at a small scale within the burned site.",WOS:000428603800014,59,0.7332427840000001,0,tundr fir alt veget pattern mor than the result thermokarst tundr fir ar increas in their frequ and intens due to glob warm which alt reveget pattern through vary pathway to understand the effect of tundr fir and the result thermokarst on reveget veget and rel environ fact wer comp between burn and unburn area of seward peninsul alask us a tot of plot cm x cm each the are was burn in and survey in sev veget typ wer class by a clust analys and wer categ along a fir sev grady from non to sev fir intens the specy rich and divers wer high in intermedy disturb plot sev fir allow the immigr of fir fav specy e g epilob angustifol ceratodon purpure and decreas or did not chang the specy divers ind that specy replac occur within the sev burn sit although thermokarst ground subsid broad occur on burn sit due to thaw the subsid weak influ veget pattern thes result suggest that the fir direct alt the specy composit at a landscap scal between the burn and unburn sit and it indirect alt the plant cov and divers through the diff mod such as thermokarst at a smal scal within the burn sit,new,0.7569367986629746,0.6945770425418485,0.6528835287921001,0.6241286502457223,0.6036132514578588,0.5888952194792947,0.5787684408774031,0.5728312080292793,0.5714771003560533,0.576520633941129,0.5937883689100262
641,tundra,Determinants of plant species richness in an alpine meadow,"1. Nutrient availability, defoliation and soil disturbance are important factors that influence the richness of plant communities. However, few studies have examined the interactions between these factors, especially in harsh environments. We therefore examined the effects of fertilization, defoliation and soil disturbance on plant species richness in an alpine meadow in northern Sweden. 2. From 2002 to 2005, plots were fertilized, mowed and disturbed annually in a factorially designed experiment. Plant species richness, colonization and extinction were recorded in permanent subplots. Seedling densities and recruitment from seed of Potentilla crantzii were also estimated in order to examine the mechanisms whereby these treatments influence colonization by new species. 3. Species richness peaked in the absence of disturbance in unfertilized plots and with light disturbance in fertilized plots. Colonization by new vascular plant species, seed recruitment and seedling density were all increased by soil disturbance, suggesting that colonization was increased because conditions were more favourable for seed recruitment following the disturbance treatment. Extinction of species was highest in the mowed, intensively disturbed and unfertilized plots and lowest in the fertilized, lightly disturbed and unmowed plots. 4. Local extinction was negatively correlated with both moss and vascular plant biomass. Local colonization, seedling density and recruitment of P. crantzii were all strongly negatively correlated with the biomass of mosses. In contrast, the biomass of vascular plants was only weakly correlated with local colonization, seedling density and recruitment of P. crantzii. 5. This study suggest that the level of disturbance at which species richness peaks should move towards higher disturbance levels when productivity increases. However, lower extinction rates rather then higher colonization rates seem to be causing the increase in species richness following disturbance.",WOS:000249166700003,64,0.746390401,1,determin of plant specy rich in an alpin meadow nutry avail defo and soil disturb ar import fact that influ the rich of plant commun howev few study hav examin the interact between thes fact espec in harsh environ we theref examin the effect of fertil defo and soil disturb on plant specy rich in an alpin meadow in northern swed from to plot wer fertil mow and disturb an in a fact design expery plant specy rich colon and extinct wer record in perm subplot seedl dens and recruit from see of potentill crantzi wer also estim in ord to examin the mech whereby thes tre influ colon by new specy specy rich peak in the abs of disturb in unfertil plot and with light disturb in fertil plot colon by new vascul plant specy see recruit and seedl dens wer al increas by soil disturb suggest that colon was increas becaus condit wer mor favo for see recruit follow the disturb tre extinct of specy was highest in the mow intend disturb and unfertil plot and lowest in the fertil light disturb and unmow plot loc extinct was neg correl with both moss and vascul plant biomass loc colon seedl dens and recruit of p crantzi wer al strongly neg correl with the biomass of moss in contrast the biomass of vascul plant was on weak correl with loc colon seedl dens and recruit of p crantzi thi study suggest that the level of disturb at which specy rich peak should mov toward high disturb level when produc increas howev low extinct rat rath then high colon rat seem to be caus the increas in specy rich follow disturb,new,0.7915704991997133,0.7316272237719904,0.6891831710912494,0.6582420420081139,0.6350675809968896,0.6175414198848859,0.6045215435707478,0.5955354883093612,0.5907982910268477,0.591718398716036,0.603087042122275
702,tundra,"Grazing and fire impacts on macrolichen communities of the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, USA","We sought to assess impacts of fire and grazing by reindeer and caribou on lichen communities in northwestern Alaska. Macrolichen abundance was estimated from 45, 0.38-ha plots. Eighteen of those plots, scattered throughout the southern Seward Peninsula, represented two levels of grazing, heavy and light. We found lightly grazed areas had taller lichens and greater total lichen cover than heavily grazed sites. Minor yet statistically significant changes in community structure were also observed between heavily and lightly grazed sites. However, lichen species richness did not differ by grazing status. Overall, average lichen height appears to be the best indication of grazing intensity on the Seward Peninsula. Apart from the 18 grazing plots, 8 additional plots were established in previously burned sites to represent reference conditions with a known time since disturbance date. These plots provided a framework of vegetation recovery from severe, recent disturbance towards pre-disturbance conditions. Patterns in lichen, bryophyte and vascular plant characteristics from these fire plots in combination with our findings from the grazing plots were then used to interpret the disturbance history of new plots. These new plots comprise the remaining 19 plots (of the total 45) that were sampled within the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve (BELA). We believe the location of BELA, regardless of disturbance history, is more favorable to vascular plants and Sphagnum, and lichens grow taller in response, compared to areas on the Seward Peninsula further south. In addition, lower cover in the Preserve may be attributed to site or climatic differences rather than grazing.",WOS:000253903400004,70,0.7428810690000001,0,graz and fir impact on macrolich commun of the seward peninsul alask us we sought to assess impact of fir and graz by reind and caribou on lich commun in northwestern alask macrolich abund was estim from ha plot eighteen of thos plot scat throughout the southern seward peninsul repres two level of graz heavy and light we found light graz area had tal lich and gre tot lich cov than heavy graz sit min yet stat sign chang in commun structure wer also observ between heavy and light graz sit howev lich specy rich did not diff by graz stat overal av lich height appear to be the best ind of graz intens on the seward peninsul apart from the graz plot addit plot wer est in prevy burn sit to repres ref condit with a known tim sint disturb dat thes plot provid a framework of veget recovery from sev rec disturb toward pre disturb condit pattern in lich bryophyt and vascul plant charact from thes fir plot in combin with our find from the graz plot wer then us to interpret the disturb hist of new plot thes new plot compr the remain plot of the tot that wer sampl within the ber land bridg nat preserv bel we believ the loc of bel regardless of disturb hist is mor fav to vascul plant and sphagnum and lich grow tal in respons comp to area on the seward peninsul furth sou in addit low cov in the preserv may be attribut to sit or clim diff rath than graz,new,0.8096631481196499,0.7860975475988279,0.7712089399258332,0.7613407507853551,0.7548456672075046,0.7509320688359348,0.7492942700889993,0.7500106698532767,0.7536561012107725,0.7618768460824858,0.7794787088347841
721,tundra,Importance of large and small mammalian herbivores for the plant community structure in the forest tundra ecotone,"Both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggests that herbivory in general and mammalian winter herbivory in particular is important in arctic-alpine ecosystems. Although knowledge of the effect of herbivores on specific plants and communities is quite extensive, little is known about the relative impact of large and small vertebrate herbivores and how it might vary among different habitats. To address this key issue, we established exclosures with two different mesh sizes in forest and nearby tundra at three different sites in four contrasting locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and Norway. Plant community composition was recorded annually in three permanent plots within each exclosure and an unfenced control. Local densities of vertebrate herbivores were estimated in spring and autumn from 1998 to 2002. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) were the most abundant large vertebrate while Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) and grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus) were the most common small vertebrates. The study reveals that voles and lemmings have larger effects on the vegetation than reindeer in both habitats in all four locations, even though densities of reindeer differ between locations and only two locations experienced lemming peaks during the period of the experiment. The relative abundance of five of the fifteen most common species was significantly influenced by voles and lemmings whereas only a single species was significantly influenced by reindeer. Different analyses give contrasting results on the importance of herbivory in forest versus open heathlands. A principal component analyses revealed that herbivory influenced the vegetation more in open heathlands than in forests. However, an importance index of herbivores did not differ between forest and open heathlands. Moreover, none of the plant species responded differently in the two habitats, when herbivores were removed. Our results suggest that intense and localised selective foraging by small mammals may have a more marked effect on vegetation than transient feeding by reindeer.",WOS:000222424600012,72,0.7470769890000001,0,import of larg and smal mam herb for the plant commun structure in the forest tundr ecoton both theoret argu and empir evid suggest that herb in gen and mam wint herb in particul is import in arct alpin ecosystem although knowledg of the effect of herb on spec plant and commun is quit extend littl is known about the rel impact of larg and smal vertebr herb and how it might vary among diff habit to address thi key issu we est exclos with two diff mesh siz in forest and nearby tundr at three diff sit in four contrast loc in the forest tundr ecoton in northernmost swed and norway plant commun composit was record an in three perm plot within each exclos and an unf control loc dens of vertebr herb wer estim in spring and autumn from to reind rang tarand wer the most abund larg vertebr whil norweg lem lemm lemm and grey sid vol clethrionom rufocan wer the most common smal vertebr the study rev that vol and lem hav larg effect on the veget than reind in both habit in al four loc ev though dens of reind diff between loc and on two loc expery lem peak dur the period of the expery the rel abund of fiv of the fifteen most common specy was sign influ by vol and lem wherea on a singl specy was sign influ by reind diff analys giv contrast result on the import of herb in forest vers op heathland a princip compon analys rev that herb influ the veget mor in op heathland than in forest howev an import index of herb did not diff between forest and op heathland moreov non of the plant specy respond diff in the two habit when herb wer remov our result suggest that intens and loc select for by smal mam may hav a mor mark effect on veget than transy fee by reind,new,0.766609689203384,0.7011060850767449,0.6596144036881783,0.6324443956236485,0.614037014114739,0.6017064166632384,0.5942419213537945,0.591363051593513,0.59374725051519,0.6038489246156821,0.629140872203428
1091,tundra,Biodiversity of Sayano-Shushensky nature reserve,"The Sayano-Shushensky Nature Reserve is a standard primeval locus of high conservation value which remained undisturbed landscapes within the Altai-Sayan Mountain Land. In the plant cover the altitudinal belts are clearly expressed. The northern part of the Sayan-Shushensky reserve is included in moist areas of the Altai-Sayan forest vegetation zone and the Southern part of it is included in insufficiently moist areas of Central Asian forest zone. The ground vegetation of the reserve is presented by high-mountain tundra, meadows and shrub thicket sites, high-mountain open Pinus sibirica D u. T o u r. and Larix sibirica L e d e b. woodland, dark and light coniferous taiga, coniferous subtaiga, forest-steppe and steppe. As a whole forests occupy somewhat about 60% of the territory. Ecocenotic groups of species found in individual phytocoenoses in river basins of the northern part of the nature reserve are qualitatively different in composition and share from those ones found in the southern river basins. In the north, the high mountain ecocenotic species group enjoys the greatest abundance, and forest-meadow, taiga, and bog species are also represented substantially. Steppe and forest-steppe species are absent. Alpine, steppe, and forest-steppe species are found in equal shares in the southern part of the forest reserve. Invasive species are quite many. Taiga species contribution is three times less than in the north of the reserve. Conditions climatically optimal for the greatest species diversity are the result of a perfect balance of heat and moisture characteristics of subtaiga/forest-steppe altitudinal belt complexes (ABC). However, changes in phytochorological- and alpha-diversity of individual phyl.ocoenoses are influenced by ecological and phytocoenotic factors combined. The biggest number of species in the reserve occurs along the forest distribution boundaries - in subtaiga and high mountain open woodland whereas species are the fewest in mountain taiga.

1192,tundra,Dictyostelid cellular slime molds associated with grasslands of the central and western United States,"Dictyostelid cellular slime molds (dictyostelids) associated with grassland ecosystems of the central and western United States were investigated at nine sites that included examples of the three major ecological types of grasslands (tall grass, mixed grass and short grass) generally recognized for the region. Samples of soil/humus collected from each site were examined with the Cavender method of isolating dictyostelids. For each of those six sites with well developed gallery forests present, an additional set of forest soil/humus samples was collected. A more intensive sampling effort was carried out at one site (Konza LTER) to assess the possible effects of burning and grazing on dictyostelid diversity and density. Twelve species of dictyostelids were recovered from grassland sites, whereas gallery forest sites yielded only nine species. Four cosmopolitan species (Dictyostelium giganteum, D. mucoroides, D. sphaerocephalum and Polysphondylium pallidum) were represented by the greatest densities of clones, with D. sphaerocephalum particularly common.

1321,tundra,Evaluating human-disturbed habitats for recovery planning of endangered plants,"The recovery potential of endangered species is limited by the high prevalence of human-modified habitats, while effective in situ conservation strategies to identify and restore disturbed habitat within species ranges are lacking. Our goal was to determine the impact of human disturbance on the endangered endemic Barrens willow (Salix jejuna) to provide science-based protocols for future restoration of disturbed habitats; a key component of conservation and recovery plans for many rare plant species. Our study examined differences in substrate (e.g., % total plant cover, % species cover, substrate type) and vegetation in naturally- (via frost activity) vs human-disturbed limestone barrens (Newfoundland, Canada), across the entire species range of the endangered Barrens willow. There were distinct differences in substrate conditions and vegetation community structure between naturally- and human-disturbed limestone barrens habitat throughout the narrow range of this endemic willow. Human-disturbed sites are more homogeneous and differ significantly from the naturally-disturbed sites having a much coarser substrate (30% more gravel) with less fine grained sands, less exposed bedrock, decreased soil moisture, increased nitrogen content, and reduced phosphorus content. Substrate differences can inhibit return to the natural freeze-thaw disturbance regime of the limestone barrens, negatively affecting long-term persistence of this, and other rare plants. The structure of associated vegetation (specifically woody species presence) negatively affected willow abundance but was not linked to disturbance type. Human-disturbed sites are potential candidates for endangered plant recovery habitat if natural ecosystem processes, vegetation community structure, and habitat heterogeneity are restored, thereby supporting the establishment of long term viable populations.

170,tundra,"Ski trail effects on a beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Elateridae) community in Vermont","Beetle diversity and species composition were studied using pitfall traps placed along three parallel transects that extended from the center of a downhill ski trail, 100 m into a large, unfragmented spruce-fir forest on Mount Mansfield State Park, VT, USA. Groups of beetles showed associations with three distinct habitats: ski trail openings (Agonum cupripenne, Amara spp., Poecilus lucublandus, Hypnoidus bicolor, and H. abbreviatus), edge (Pterostichus coracinus, Agonum retractum, Sphaeroderus canadensis, and Calathus ingratus), and forest (Pterostichus adstrictus, P. punctatissimus, P. brevicornis, Platynus decentis, Trechas apicalis, T. crassiscapus, and Eanus maculipennis). Consequently, carabid and elaterid species composition in the ski trail, edge, and 5 m into the unfragmented forest showed nearly complete turnover. Most beetles within the ski trail were colonizers from lower elevations; however, one species, H. bicolor, was a tundra species that appeared to have colonized lower elevations along the ski trail opening. Of ""forest"" beetles, only 2 of 540 individuals (< 0.5%) were collected in the ski trail opening. Thus, ski trails are strong barriers to dispersal for forest beetles, several of which are flightless or dimorphic and primarily short-winged. Consequently, fragmentation of mountain slopes by ski trails, especially those that run perpendicular to the climatic gradient, may put isolated populations at a greater risk of local extirpation.",WOS:000208370600002,170,0.7292867690000001,1,ski trail effect on a beetl coleopter carabida elaterida commun in vermont beetl divers and specy composit wer study us pitfal trap plac along three parallel transect that extend from the cent of a downhil ski trail m into a larg unfr spruce fir forest on mount mansfield stat park vt us group of beetl show assocy with three distinct habit ski trail op agon cupripen amar spp poecil lucubland hypnoid bicol and h abbreviat edg pterostich coracin agon retract sphaeroderus canadens and calath ingrat and forest pterostich adstrict p punctatissim p brevicorn platyn dec trecha ap t crassiscap and ean maculipen consequ carabid and elaterid specy composit in the ski trail edg and m into the unfr forest show near complet turnov most beetl within the ski trail wer colon from low elev howev on specy h bicol was a tundr specy that appear to hav colon low elev along the ski trail op of forest beetl on of individ wer collect in the ski trail op thu ski trail ar strong barry to dispers for forest beetl sev of which ar flightless or dimorph and prim short wing consequ frag of mountain slop by ski trail espec thos that run perpendicul to the clim grady may put isol pop at a gre risk of loc extirp,new,0.704316705991694,0.6295570097768302,0.5850948343490074,0.5582152802349054,0.5418083100439837,0.5325950724968246,0.5292432770922729,0.5316653231649607,0.5411324368377661,0.5615439122864412,0.6042815425994902
2061,tundra,Large scale experimental effects of three levels of sheep densities on an alpine ecosystem,"Plant herbivore dynamics is a major topic in ecological research, but empirical knowledge on the ecological effects of different densities of large grazers from fully replicated experiments is rare. Previous studies have focused on grazing vs no grazing, and our understanding of the extent to which different levels of grazing alter vegetation composition, and how quickly such effects can be measured, is therefore limited. We performed a fully replicated, short-term (four-year) experiment using large enclosures (each similar to 0.3 km(2)) with three different sheep densities (no grazing, low grazing and high grazing, respectively) in an alpine environment with summer grazing in southern Norway to address these issues. Sheep grazing mainly affected plant species at high densities of sheep as compared to no sheep after a four-year treatment; few effects of low sheep densities were detectable. Highly selected herbs, herbs suggested vulnerable to trampling, and woody species decreased, while most graminoids, one ruderal, one prostrate species and two bryophyte taxa increased at high sheep densities. We found contrasting responses within main functional groups highlighting that fine details of plant life histories need to be known for responses to grazing to be successfully predicted. Vascular plant cover and bare soil responded to sheep density after two years of treatment, but only for one of the species was frequency change observed at this stage. Overall, plants in low grazing plots were found to be almost unaffected. Changes in abundance were mainly found at the no grazing and high grazing treatments. Plant species that decreased at high grazing generally increased at no grazing and vice versa, suggesting a response to both cessation of grazing and enhanced grazing respectively. Our study demonstrates, beyond a simple comparison of heavily grazed and non-grazed sites, that herbivore effects on plants are typically non-linearly related to herbivore density, and that the speed of plant responses will depend both on the plant property examined and the grazing pressure.",WOS:000256839300004,206,0.723223999,1,larg scal expery effect of three level of sheep dens on an alpin ecosystem plant herb dynam is a maj top in ecolog research but empir knowledg on the ecolog effect of diff dens of larg graz from ful reply expery is rar prevy study hav focus on graz vs no graz and our understand of the ext to which diff level of graz alt veget composit and how quick such effect can be meas is theref limit we perform a ful reply short term four year expery us larg enclos each simil to km with three diff sheep dens no graz low graz and high graz respect in an alpin environ with sum graz in southern norway to address thes issu sheep graz main affect plant specy at high dens of sheep as comp to no sheep aft a four year tre few effect of low sheep dens wer detect high select herb herb suggest vuln to trampl and woody specy decreas whil most graminoid on rud on prost specy and two bryophyt tax increas at high sheep dens we found contrast respons within main funct group highlight that fin detail of plant lif hist nee to be known for respons to graz to be success predict vascul plant cov and bar soil respond to sheep dens aft two year of tre but on for on of the specy was frequ chang observ at thi stag overal plant in low graz plot wer found to be almost unaffect chang in abund wer main found at the no graz and high graz tre plant specy that decreas at high graz gen increas at no graz and vic vers suggest a respons to both cess of graz and enh graz respect our study demonst beyond a simpl comparison of heavy graz and non graz sit that herb effect on plant ar typ non linear rel to herb dens and that the spee of plant respons wil depend both on the plant property examin and the graz press,new,0.8175741850666088,0.7942659614712013,0.7793383130332021,0.7694081001828282,0.7629570563597827,0.7592431334075356,0.7579867934644308,0.7592829547535765,0.7637378237380278,0.7730489166237079,0.7920141657575221
263,tundra,"The influence of non-sorted circles on species diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens in Sub-Arctic Tundra","Non-sorted circles (NSCs), also known as frost boils, are common soil frost features that create a small-scale mosaic of vegetation zones in periglacial landscapes. The causes of variation in plant diversity within NSCs are poorly understood. This lack of understanding hampers our ability to predict how arctic plant communities respond to changing soil frost conditions. We hypothesised that plant communities of different ages develop at a micro-site scale within NSCs as soil frost periodically exposes uncolonised soil or fatally offsets plant succession. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the species diversity of plant communities (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens) from the sparsely vegetated centre of the circles to the densely vegetated outer domain in conjunction with estimates of the age of the plant communities (inferred using lichenometry). Our results suggest that the variation in species diversity and density can largely be explained by the occurrence of progressively older plant communities from the centre towards the vegetated rim. Here, the high species diversity was observed to occur in communities having the ages approximately around 150 years. Our findings suggest that soil frost disturbances are important for maintaining successional gradients several centuries long within the arctic landscape at a small spatial scale (< 3 m). The termination of soil frost activity as a result of a warmer future winter climate is therefore most likely to result in a loss of micro-sites having young vegetation communities with high plant diversities and a subsequent establishment of mature shrub-dominated plant communities.",WOS:000310207900005,263,0.7177959079999999,0,the influ of non sort circ on specy divers of vascul plant bryophyt and lich in sub arct tundr non sort circ nscs also known as frost boil ar common soil frost feat that cre a smal scal mosa of veget zon in periglac landscap the caus of vary in plant divers within nscs ar poor understood thi lack of understand hamp our abl to predict how arct plant commun respond to chang soil frost condit we hypothes that plant commun of diff ag develop at a micro sit scal within nscs as soil frost period expos uncolon soil or fat offset plant success to test thi hypothes we investig the specy divers of plant commun vascul plant bryophyt and lich from the spars veget cent of the circ to the dens veget out domain in conjunct with estim of the ag of the plant commun infer us lichenometry our result suggest that the vary in specy divers and dens can larg be explain by the occur of progress old plant commun from the cent toward the veget rim her the high specy divers was observ to occ in commun hav the ag approxim around year our find suggest that soil frost disturb ar import for maintain success grady sev century long within the arct landscap at a smal spat scal m the termin of soil frost act as a result of a warm fut wint clim is theref most lik to result in a loss of micro sit hav young veget commun with high plant divers and a subsequ est of mat shrub domin plant commun,new,0.7615691492736368,0.7121291628138914,0.6802490632747284,0.6585936941942193,0.6434931387556161,0.6331324942937923,0.6266638125982689,0.6238834093487583,0.6252811036735139,0.6326597292168102,0.6516298332882147
302,tundra,Plant community properties predict vegetation resilience to herbivore disturbance in the Arctic,"P>1. Understanding the impact of disturbance on vegetation and the resilience of plant communities to disturbance is imperative to ecological theory and environmental management. In this study predictors of community resilience to a simulated natural disturbance are investigated. Responses to disturbance are examined at the community, plant functional type and species level. 2. Field experiments were set up in seven tundra plant communities, simulating disturbance based on the impact of grubbing by an increasing herbivore population of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus). The short-term resilience of communities was assessed by comparing community dissimilarity between control plots and plots subject to three disturbance intensities based on the foraging impact of these geese. Potential for long-term recovery was evaluated across different disturbance patch sizes. 3. Resilience to disturbance varied between communities; those with higher moss cover and higher soil moisture, such as wetlands and mires, were most resilient to disturbance. 4. The wetter communities demonstrated greater long-term recovery potential following disturbance. In wetland communities, vegetative recovery of vascular plants and moss was greater in smaller disturbed patches and at the edges of patches. 5. The response of vegetation to disturbance varied with intensity of disturbance, plant community and plant species. The use of functional type classifications only partially explained the variation in species responses to disturbance across communities, thus their use in predicting community changes was limited. 6. Synthesis. The impact of disturbance is shown to be plant-community specific and related to the initial abiotic and biotic properties of the community. By showing that resilience is partly predictable, the identification of disturbance-susceptible communities is possible, which is of relevance for ecosystem management.",WOS:000280667200003,302,0.744078032,0,plant commun property predict veget resy to herb disturb in the arct p understand the impact of disturb on veget and the resy of plant commun to disturb is imp to ecolog the and environ man in thi study predict of commun resy to a sim nat disturb ar investig respons to disturb ar examin at the commun plant funct typ and specy level field expery wer set up in sev tundr plant commun sim disturb bas on the impact of grub by an increas herb pop of pink foot gees ans brachyrhynch the short term resy of commun was assess by comp commun dissimil between control plot and plot subject to three disturb intens bas on the for impact of thes gees pot for long term recovery was evalu across diff disturb patch siz resy to disturb vary between commun thos with high moss cov and high soil moist such as wetland and mir wer most resy to disturb the wet commun demonst gre long term recovery pot follow disturb in wetland commun veget recovery of vascul plant and moss was gre in smal disturb patch and at the edg of patch the respons of veget to disturb vary with intens of disturb plant commun and plant specy the us of funct typ class on part explain the vary in specy respons to disturb across commun thu their us in predict commun chang was limit synthes the impact of disturb is shown to be plant commun spec and rel to the init abiot and biot property of the commun by show that resy is part predict the id of disturb suscept commun is poss which is of relev for ecosystem man,new,0.7878352672956718,0.7225594828044474,0.6767903987703149,0.6434763055387752,0.61827097970427,0.5988207465556673,0.583869884853802,0.572864137408876,0.5659296236863445,0.5643802355606444,0.5730275443231371
413,tundra,Unintentional habitats: Value of a city for the wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe),"Humans are rapidly reducing and isolating the habitats of native species such as the wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) through urbanisation and agricultural intensification. The wheatear, a small songbird, has declined dramatically throughout Europe. It is known to live in alpine meadows, in tundra, and rural landscapes as well as in urban areas, but it is unknown if these urban populations reproduce sufficiently. This study aimed to investigate reproductive success and habitat requirements of the wheatear in the city of Berlin, Germany. We analysed occurrence and breeding success in relation to vegetation and surface structure of the settled sites, intensity of direct disturbance by humans and dogs, as well as degree of sealing and residential population density in the surrounding urban matrix. Finally, we compared early-settled to late-settled territories to appraise habitat preferences of wheatears. The proportion of successful nests was high (73%) compared to other regions and habitats. Area size of a site greatly affected the probability of wheatear occurrence; it was much higher on sites larger than five hectare. Factors affecting breeding success differed completely from those explaining variation in occurrence, indicating that breeding success seems not to be related to habitat preferences. There was no influence of the urban matrix at a landscape level (200 m and 2000 m zone) on occurrence or breeding success. To maintain and create habitat for endangered open-land species as the wheatear, we recommend minimum area size of five hectare, sparse vegetation, open soils, short grass, and very few trees and shrubs.
