1,amphib_neotropic,The demography of Atelopus decline: Harlequin frog survival and abundance in central Panama prior to and during a disease outbreak,"Harlequin frogs (Bufonidae: Atelopus) are a species-rich genus of Neotropical toads that have experienced disproportionately severe population declines and extinctions caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (. Bd). The genus Atelopus is of high conservation concern, but relatively little is known about the population dynamics and life history of the majority of species. We examined the demography of one population of Atelopus zeteki and two populations of A. varius in central Panama using three to six years of mark-recapture data collected prior to and during an outbreak of Bd. We estimated male survival probabilities prior to the arrival of Bd and sex-specific population sizes for these three populations using state-space Bayesian population models. Prior to the arrival of Bd, monthly apparent survival probabilities were higher for A. varius males than for A. zeteki males, and recaptures among years were low in both species. Abundance of both species varied over time and declined rapidly after the arrival of Bd. Male densities were generally greater than female densities, though female densities were higher or equivalent to males after the arrival of Bd. Estimates of survival and abundance over time may be explained by differences in the use of stream habitat by the two sexes and three populations, both during and between breeding seasons. These estimates provide key baseline population information that can be used to inform reintroductions from captive assurance colonies and studies of extant Atelopus populations as part of conservation and management programs. ¬© 2015 The Authors.",10.1016/j.gecco.2015.07.003,2-s2.0-84937555508,4,0.8468576440000001,1,the demograph of atelop declin harlequin frog surv and abund in cent panam pri to and dur a diseas outbreak harlequin frog bufonida atelop ar a specy rich gen of neotrop toad that hav expery disproport sev pop declin and extinct caus by the amphib chytrid fung batrachochytr dendrobatid bd the gen atelop is of high conserv concern but rel littl is known about the pop dynam and lif hist of the maj of specy we examin the demograph of on pop of atelop zetek and two pop of a vari in cent panam us three to six year of mark recapt dat collect pri to and dur an outbreak of bd we estim mal surv prob pri to the ar of bd and sex spec pop siz for thes three pop us stat spac bayes pop model pri to the ar of bd month app surv prob wer high for a vari mal than for a zetek mal and recapt among year wer low in both specy abund of both specy vary ov tim and declin rapid aft the ar of bd mal dens wer gen gre than fem dens though fem dens wer high or equ to mal aft the ar of bd estim of surv and abund ov tim may be explain by diff in the us of stream habit by the two sex and three pop both dur and between bree season thes estim provid key baselin pop inform that can be us to inform reintroduc from capt ass colony and study of ext atelop pop as part of conserv and man program,new,0.8834402009478441,0.8595343586804167,0.8405497076689761,0.8250845935417929,0.8121117412847116,0.8009491884527735,0.7911337475443612,0.7823403947364063,0.7743334104708081,0.7669328553755318,0.7600741295243678
2,amphib_neotropic,Spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics of Andean frogs: Effects of forest disturbance and evidence for declines,"Biodiversity loss is a global phenomenon that can result in the collapse of food webs and critical ecosystem services. Amphibian population decline over the last century is a notable case of species loss because amphibians survived the last four major extinction events in global history, their current rate of extinction is unprecedented, and their rate of extinction is greater than that for most other taxonomic groups. Despite the severity of this conservation problem and its relevance to the study of global biodiversity loss, major knowledge gaps remain for many of the most threatened species and regions in the world. Rigorous estimates of population parameters are lacking for many amphibian species in the Neotropics. The goal of our study was to determine how the demography of seven species of the genus Pristimantis varied over time and space in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes. We completed a long term capture-mark-recapture study to estimate abundance, survival, and population growth rates in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes; from 2002 to 2009 at Yanayacu in the Eastern Cordillera and from 2002 to 2003 at Cashca Totoras in the Western Cordillera. Our results showed seasonal and annual variation in population parameters by species and sex. P. bicantus experienced significant reductions in abundance over the course of our study. Abundance, apparent survival, and population growth rates were lower in disturbed than in primary or mature secondary forest. The results of our study raise concerns for the population status of understudied amphibian groups and provide insights into the population dynamics of Neotropical amphibians. ¬© 2014 The Authors.",10.1016/j.gecco.2014.06.002,2-s2.0-84919332430,26,0.833651963,1,spat and temp vary in pop dynam of and frog effect of forest disturb and evid for declin biodivers loss is a glob phenomenon that can result in the collaps of food web and crit ecosystem serv amphib pop declin ov the last century is a not cas of specy loss becaus amphib surv the last four maj extinct ev in glob hist their cur rat of extinct is unprec and their rat of extinct is gre than that for most oth taxonom group despit the sev of thi conserv problem and it relev to the study of glob biodivers loss maj knowledg gap remain for many of the most threatened specy and reg in the world rig estim of pop paramet ar lack for many amphib specy in the neotrop the goal of our study was to determin how the demograph of sev specy of the gen pristim vary ov tim and spac in two cloud forest in the ecuad and we complet a long term capt mark recapt study to estim abund surv and pop grow rat in two cloud forest in the ecuad and from to at yanayacu in the eastern cordiller and from to at cashc totora in the western cordiller our result show season and an vary in pop paramet by specy and sex p bicant expery sign reduc in abund ov the cours of our study abund app surv and pop grow rat wer low in disturb than in prim or mat second forest the result of our study rais concern for the pop stat of understudy amphib group and provid insight into the pop dynam of neotrop amphib,new,0.8759301957893977,0.8594066422033974,0.8473677032720527,0.8381905957076045,0.830925910665291,0.8250209456396239,0.8201363526551312,0.8160534690475417,0.8126308577741925,0.8097713691155739,0.8074829264421628
3,amphib_neotropic,"Site fidelity, home range behaviour and habitat utilization of male harlequin toads (Amphibia: Atelopus hoogmoedi) from Suriname: Relevant aspects for conservation breeding","Recently, neotropical harlequin toads (Atelopus spp.) have undergone drastic population declines. Captive breeding has been suggested as a way to conserve harlequin frogs threatened by the amphibian chytrid fungus and global warming. A major problem is that little is known with regard to the natural history of Atelopus species. We studied male A. hoogmoedi site fidelity, home range and habitat utilization during the long rainy season (April to August) at Brownsberg Nature Park, Suriname. During this period, males and females occupy different habitats (i.e. streams versus forest). We studied male toads along a stream site. In total, 19 males were observed; relative abundance was 0.475 individuals per meter. Fourteen males were recaptured at the same site or its vicinity at least once and 12 maintained home ranges (38.1 ¬± 17.7 m 2 in size) for up to four months. However, male-male interaction was not observed. In the vicinity of streams, male A. hoogmoedi were perched 51.95 ¬± 36.7 cm above ground in dense understory. In conservation breeding efforts, we recommend to keep sexes separately prior to mating and to simulate the rainy season. Because males occupy home ranges at the breeding site, reproductive success in captivity may be higher when females are moved to male containers (which should have some running water imitating a stream habitat). Low male density and home range size should be considered when populating tanks with males. Tanks for males and breeding should address that wild specimens were mostly found on low vegetation. ¬© 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Herpetologie und Terrarienkundee. V.

4,amphib_neotropic,A long-term study on the dynamics of guild structure among predatory vertebrates at a semi-arid Neotropical site,"Diets and populations of 10 species of predatory vertebrates (two foxes, four falconiforms, four owls) were monitored in semi-desert scrub at Auco, Chile. Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors",10.2307/3545099,2-s2.0-0027386301,36,0.779302536,1,a long term study on the dynam of guild structure among pred vertebr at a sem arid neotrop sit diet and pop of specy of pred vertebr two fox four falconiform four owl wer monit in sem desert scrub at auco chil pellet bird and fec fox collect month contain ident remain of smal mam bird reptil amphib larg insect oth arthropod and in som fox fec fruit for non mam prey season vary in avail appear to be mor pronount than long term vary avail of the eight specy of smal mam vary rel littl between pred bree and non bree season but declin by an ord of magnitud through the first yr of the study rath than respond to thes shift in food avail by diverg in diet dur lean tim and converg opportun dur fat tim pred respond in idiosyncr way pred of al specy tend to maintain specy spec mean in siz of prey tak regardless of shift in the rel avail of prey siz class two owl specy maintain strict mam diet throughout the declin in mam abund wherea two oth owl plu the two fox specy maintain a tight fee guild bas on arthropod as wel as mam and oth food group the four falconiform fail to maintain consist diet from season to season and consequ end up temp in un posit in diet hyperspac or els join temp on of the two consist guild the degr to which falconiform diet wer un in a giv season show no clear rel to food abund chang in us of habit did howev rel to chang in food abund non of the falconiform resid continu in the study are throughout the period from auth,new,0.8532801078035174,0.8043170886145027,0.7640373109153424,0.7307910611149226,0.7026256123642617,0.6780747391696597,0.6560589557061243,0.6356959407188827,0.6161068909965481,0.5960929876755733,0.5734272381119638
5,amphib_neotropic,"Reproductive dynamics of the neotropical treefrog Hypsiboas albopunctatus (Anura, Hylidae)","To understand the seasonal reproductive dynamics of Hypsiboas albopunctatus, a Neotropical treefrog, we studied the following components: 1) the influence of abiotic factors on seasonality, 2) how this seasonality relates to population dynamics, and 3) male breeding recruitment. We conducted fieldwork every month from August 2007 to July 2008 within an ecotone connecting semideciduous Atlantic Forest and Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) in S√£o Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. Over the course of the prolonged breeding season, we recorded the maximum number of calling males and measured their snout-vent lengths; we then compared our data from the beginning and the end of the breeding season. We found that the breeding pattern of H. albopunctatus is correlated with climatic, physical, and biological factors. Male competition and aggression varied according to the population density, most likely as a function of resource availability. There appears to be a social hierarchy among males of H. albopunctatus according to body size. Large calling males dominated the chorus in the beginning of the breeding season, but smaller males contributed more to the assemblage as the breeding season progressed. The average size of calling males at the end of the breeding season was significantly smaller. Smaller males occurred most in January and February, marking the H. albopunctatus breeding recruitment, when an abundance of adequate breeding microhabitats exist. Our full-season study serves as a cautionary tale: hypotheses based on body size, particularly for prolonged anuran breeder species, may be affected by seasonality.

7,amphib_neotropic,"Ineffectiveness of Call Surveys for Estimating Population Size in a Widespread Neotropical Frog, Oophaga pumilio","Call surveys offer a valuable method to monitor anuran populations attributable to their temporal breeding habits and close association with water. Many temperate locations have adopted citizen science programs to monitor local anuran populations using call surveys and road transects. These surveys, however, are not commonly conducted in the tropics. I tested use of call surveys for estimating population density of a small terrestrial poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in six different populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama. By conducting three-minute call surveys, and searching for all individual frogs in a 10 m radius of the survey point, I directly compared the number of calling males to the observed number of frogs in a given area. I found call density to be a poor predictor of population density. Despite there being differences in population densities, the lack of a relationship between the number of calls and population density highlights the limited use for call surveys for terrestrial, territorial species. Although call surveys may be useful in some taxa for general abundance estimates, this study clearly demonstrates a startling deficiency of call surveys for anuran monitoring and highlights the need for species-specific analysis to further explore the utility of this method. ¬© Copyright 2017 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.",10.1670/14-148,2-s2.0-85009349865,28,0.739937118,0,ineffect of cal survey for estim pop siz in a widespread neotrop frog oophag pumilio cal survey off a valu method to monit an pop attribut to their temp bree habit and clos assocy with wat many temp loc hav adopt cit sci program to monit loc an pop us cal survey and road transect thes survey howev ar not common conduc in the trop i test us of cal survey for estim pop dens of a smal terrest poison frog oophag pumilio in six diff pop in boca del toro panam by conduc three minut cal survey and search for al individ frog in a m radi of the survey point i direct comp the numb of cal mal to the observ numb of frog in a giv are i found cal dens to be a poor predict of pop dens despit ther being diff in pop dens the lack of a rel between the numb of cal and pop dens highlight the limit us for cal survey for terrest territ specy although cal survey may be us in som tax for gen abund estim thi study clear demonst a startl deficy of cal survey for an monit and highlight the nee for specy spec analys to furth expl the util of thi method,new,0.7521297231292721,0.6989658981644855,0.6605755895607625,0.6324196854682922,0.6113502519477286,0.5955357233856445,0.5839996289723879,0.5763894121316594,0.5729913501442881,0.5751265080483622,0.5865245267912149

Some toad species of the Bufonidae family are common, thus allowing the study of their populations. We studied a population in r√≠o Ca√±aza, Golfito, Costa Rica, in a sector 360 m upstream of Barrio Ure√±a, divided in 36 sectors of 10 m. The study was carried out for five years, but taking samples of adults in January 1995, 1997, 1998 (except March), and 1999. We also studied tadpoles during four days in 1997. In total, 443 males and 7 females were marked, with 315 males recaptured and no females. Females are bigger (91.1 mm) than males (61.3 mm). Most recaptured individuals occurred in the same or adjacent sectors, with a maximum movement of 28 sectors. One individual was recaptured repeatedly in all the samples. This indicates that they survived at least five reproductive cycles. The reproductive cycle takes place during the dry season, between December and April. We found more individuals during the reproductive cycle of 1997 and less during 1995. Sector 6 had the most number of males and sector number 4 had the least. Sectors with semi-open vegetation had more males compared to sectors with more forest cover. February is the month with the highest abundance of males. There are intermediate values in December and January, and fewer individuals in March and April. In every month, except February, the abundance of individuals was greater where there were beaches. Tadpoles were found both during the day and night in the 31 river sectors, but it was less likely to find tadpoles in the river section during the night. During the day all tadpoles were found scattered around the river, at night they congregated near river margins. The reproductive cycle of this toad occurs during the dry season and females are present only in the reproductive season, resulting in an almost only male sex ratio (only seven females were found).

We surveyed frogs in the Peruvian Andes in montane forests along a steep elevational gradient (1200-3700 m). We used visual encounter surveys to sample stream-dwelling and arboreal species and leaf-litter plots to sample terrestrial-breeding species. We compared species richness and abundance among the wet seasons of 1999, 2008, and 2009. Despite similar sampling effort among years, the number of species (46 in 1999) declined by 47% between 1999 and 2008 and by 38% between 1999 and 2009. When we combined the number of species we found in 2008 and 2009, the decline from 1999 was 36%. Declines of stream-dwelling and arboreal species (a reduction in species richness of 55%) were much greater than declines of terrestrial-breeding species (reduction of 20% in 2008 and 24% in 2009). Similarly, abundances of stream-dwelling and arboreal frogs were lower in the combined 2008-2009 period than in 1999, whereas densities of frogs in leaf-litter plots did not differ among survey years. These declines may be associated with the infection of frogs with Bd.

10,amphib_neotropic,Endemic Ecuadorian glassfrog Cochranella mache is Critically Endangered because of habitat loss,"Amphibians are one of the most threatened animal groups. In the Family Centrolenidae c. 50% of the species are declining and threatened with extinction. One of these is the glassfrog Cochranella mache, endemic to seasonal evergreen forests of the West Ecuadorian region and restricted to highly fragmented forest of &lt; 100 km2 in the Cordillera Mache-Chindul, north-western coastal Ecuador, at 100-640 m. We surveyed this region to elucidate the distribution and conservation status of C. mache. We located it in three new localities and also found a museum specimen from a further new locality. We recommend that the species should be categorized as Critically Endangered because of the continuous and progressive destruction of its increasingly fragmented habitat. Recent surveys of glassfrog species sympatric with C. mache showed low relative abundances compared to surveys in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the relationship between forest and local climate we suggest that gradual declines of lowland glassfrog populations may be caused by local climate changes produced by forest destruction. In situ conservation is required to halt and mitigate these impacts. Further research on the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, and associated climate changes on Neotropical amphibians is required. ¬© 2009 Fauna &amp; Flora International.",10.1017/S0030605309990640,2-s2.0-77952520908,7,0.716245778,1,endem ecuad glassfrog cochranell mach is crit endang becaus of habit loss amphib ar on of the most threatened anim group in the famy centrolenida c of the specy ar declin and threatened with extinct on of thes is the glassfrog cochranell mach endem to season evergreen forest of the west ecuad reg and restrict to high frag forest of lt km in the cordiller mach chind nor western coast ecuad at m we survey thi reg to elucid the distribut and conserv stat of c mach we loc it in three new loc and also found a muse specim from a furth new loc we recommend that the specy should be categ as crit endang becaus of the continu and progress destruct of it increas frag habit rec survey of glassfrog specy symp with c mach show low rel abund comp to survey in the s and s becaus of the rel between forest and loc clim we suggest that grad declin of lowland glassfrog pop may be caus by loc clim chang produc by forest destruct in situ conserv is requir to halt and mitig thes impact furth research on the effect of habit loss frag and assocy clim chang on neotrop amphib is requir,new,0.7697155703974374,0.7153304748411722,0.6749231869429367,0.6445102956540285,0.6210816045707369,0.6027821837669816,0.5885194839079521,0.5777104640436385,0.5702159992836288,0.5664750232388861,0.5681934499916532
11,amphib_neotropic,Taking the lead on climate change: Modelling and monitoring the fate of an Amazonian frog,"Climate change is expected to have important impacts on biodiversity. However, cases showing explicit links between species decline and climate are scarce, mostly because of a lack of baseline data. Tropical ectotherms with narrow altitudinal ranges are particularly sensitive to climate change; for example the frog Pristimantis espedeus may be at risk, with only nine populations known to date in French Guiana, all on isolated massifs. Ecological niche modelling indicated that these populations could disappear by 2070. To facilitate testing of this prediction we conducted a study to design an efficient, cost-effective monitoring protocol, combining occupancy rate estimations using passive acoustic recorders, and abundance estimations using acoustic repeated counts and capture-mark-recapture. We found the passive recorders to be effective, with a detection probability of 0.8. Two recording sessions were sufficient to estimate occupancy rates reliably. A minimum of 57 surveyed sites were required to detect a decline of 15% in occupancy between two consecutive monitoring events. Acoustic repeated counts and capture-mark-recapture yielded similar density estimates (1.6 and 1.8 calling males per 100 m2, respectively). Based on these results we present a protocol based on passive acoustic recording and abundance monitoring to monitor P. espedeus populations.

12,amphib_neotropic,The effects of amphibian population declines on the structure and function of neotropical stream ecosystems,"Amphibians can be important consumers in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and may represent an important energetic link between the two, particularly in the tropics, where amphibian species richness and abundance are high. In the past 20 years, amphibian populations have declined dramatically around the world; numbers have decreased catastrophically in protected upland sites throughout the neotropics, usually resulting in the disappearance of over 75% of amphibians at a given site, particularly those species that breed in streams. Most studies of amphibian declines have focused on identifying causes and documenting changes in adult abundance, rather than on their ecological consequences. Here, we review evidence for the potential ecological effects of catastrophic amphibian declines, focusing on neotropical highland streams, where impacts will likely be greatest. Evidence to date suggests that amphibian declines will have large-scale and lasting ecosystem-level effects, including changes in algal community structure and primary production, altered organic matter dynamics, changes in other consumers such as aquatic insects and riparian predators, and reduced energy transfers between streams and riparian habitats. Furthermore, because of habitat and functional differences between larvae and adults in most amphibians, the loss of a single species is akin to losing two species. ¬© The Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/1540-9295(2006)004[0027:TEOAPD]2.0.CO;2,2-s2.0-32444435569,22,0.675905069,0,the effect of amphib pop declin on the structure and funct of neotrop stream ecosystem amphib can be import consum in both aqu and terrest habit and may repres an import energet link between the two particul in the trop wher amphib specy rich and abund ar high in the past year amphib pop hav declin dram around the world numb hav decreas catastroph in protect upland sit throughout the neotrop us result in the disappear of ov of amphib at a giv sit particul thos specy that bree in streams most study of amphib declin hav focus on ident caus and docu chang in adult abund rath than on their ecolog consequ her we review evid for the pot ecolog effect of catastroph amphib declin focus on neotrop highland streams wher impact wil lik be greatest evid to dat suggest that amphib declin wil hav larg scal and last ecosystem level effect includ chang in alg commun structure and prim produc alt org mat dynam chang in oth consum such as aqu insect and rip pred and reduc energy transf between streams and rip habit furtherm becaus of habit and funct diff between larva and adult in most amphib the loss of a singl specy is akin to los two specy,new,0.7269472558081703,0.689490750636127,0.6637967040005538,0.6457068169444388,0.6328151799234023,0.6238535304488347,0.6182326033488041,0.6158633566756803,0.6172319688566594,0.6238359246861463,0.6396654495321618

Leiuperidae represented 41.7 and 56.3% of the total number of species and individuals captured, respectively. The amphibian richness and abundance were higher in the Spring-Summer than in the Autumn-Winter period, and these attributes did not change after the flood events.

14,amphib_neotropic,In search of critically endangered species: The current situation of two tiny salamander species in the neotropical mountains of mexico,"Worldwide, one in every three species of amphibian is endangered, 39 species have gone extinct in the last 500 years and another 130 species are suspected to have gone extinct in recent decades. Of the amphibians, salamanders have the highest portion of their species in one of the risk categories, even higher than the frogs. To date there have been few studies that have used recent field data to examine the status of populations of endangered salamanders. In this study we evaluate the current situation of two tiny salamanders, Parvimolge townsendi and Thorius pennatulus, both of which are distributed at intermediate elevations in the mountains of the northern Neotropics and are considered to be critically endangered; the first has been proposed as possibly extinct. By carrying out exhaustive surveys in both historical and potentially suitable sites for these two species, we evaluated their abundance and the characteristics of their habitats, and we estimated their potential geographic distribution. We visited 22 sites, investing 672 person-hours of sampling effort in the surveys, and found 201 P. townsendi salamanders in 11 sites and only 13 T. pennatulus salamanders in 5 sites. Both species were preferentially found in cloud forest fragments that were well conserved or only moderately transformed, and some of the salamanders were found in shade coffee plantations. The potential distribution area of both species is markedly fragmented and we estimate that it has decreased by more than 48%. The results of this study highlight the importance of carrying out exhaustive, systematic field surveys to obtain accurate information about the current situation of critically endangered species, and help us better understand the crisis that amphibians are facing worldwide. ¬© 2012 Sandoval-Comte et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0034023,2-s2.0-84859242633,15,0.665617123,0,in search of crit endang specy the cur situ of two tiny salamand specy in the neotrop mountain of mexico worldwid on in every three specy of amphib is endang specy hav gon extinct in the last year and anoth specy ar suspect to hav gon extinct in rec decad of the amphib salamand hav the highest port of their specy in on of the risk categ ev high than the frog to dat ther hav been few study that hav us rec field dat to examin the stat of pop of endang salamand in thi study we evalu the cur situ of two tiny salamand parvimolg townsend and thori pennatul both of which ar distribut at intermedy elev in the mountain of the northern neotrop and ar consid to be crit endang the first has been propos as poss extinct by carry out exhaust survey in both hist and pot suit sit for thes two specy we evalu their abund and the charact of their habit and we estim their pot geograph distribut we visit sit invest person hour of sampl effort in the survey and found p townsend salamand in sit and on t pennatul salamand in sit both specy wer pref found in cloud forest frag that wer wel conserv or on mod transform and som of the salamand wer found in shad coff plant the pot distribut are of both specy is mark frag and we estim that it has decreas by mor than the result of thi study highlight the import of carry out exhaust system field survey to obtain acc inform about the cur situ of crit endang specy and help us bet understand the cris that amphib ar fac worldwid,new,0.7095911697252217,0.6626438396276265,0.630612507745975,0.6084755535904283,0.5931093018140001,0.5828213542284871,0.5768052987825267,0.5749047808253889,0.577676641318524,0.586893258935304,0.6072317170384209
15,amphib_neotropic,Integrating life-history traits and amphibian upland habitat use in a Neotropical hotspot,"Effective management of semi-aquatic animals requires detailed information on upland habitat use around aquatic habitats. Quantifying the amount of habitats needed to sustain local animals' populations is a crucial criterion when setting protective buffers to water bodies, especially for amphibians, which depend on these upland habitats for breeding and development. Differences in upland habitat use can emerge among amphibian species with distinct life-history traits, including reproductive-strategy (pond-breeding vs. non-pond breeding anurans), life-stage (adults vs. juveniles), and sex (males vs. females). To date there has been no quantitative study of upland habitat use in the Neotropics, which can provide a baseline for quantifying the amount of upland forested habitats needed to sustain local amphibian populations. We monitored three ponds for over two sampling year using drift fences with pitfall traps to investigate how reproductive-strategy, life-stage, and sex affect anuran upland habitat use in a forest remnant in the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We found no differences in upland habitat use between adult and juvenile anurans. However, we found that although the species richness of pond-breeding and non-pond breeding anurans was similar near wetlands, there was greater abundance of pond-breeding compared to non-pond breeding anurans. We also found a strong difference between the sexes in pond-breeding anurans, with males remaining closer to wetlands than females. Thus, the sex ratio of amphibian populations can be strongly skewed toward males if only small protective terrestrial buffers (50-m) are enforced during land development. Our findings also point to the inadequacy of current Brazilian policies to protect small wetlands and the fauna that depend on them. We recommend that policymakers adjust regulatory criteria to set hierarchical protective buffers around wetlands allowing different levels of land-use intervention. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",10.1016/j.actao.2015.09.009,2-s2.0-84942862520,23,0.6521088970000001,1,integr lif hist trait and amphib upland habit us in a neotrop hotspot effect man of sem aqu anim requir detail inform on upland habit us around aqu habit quant the amount of habit nee to sustain loc anim pop is a cruc crit when set protect buff to wat body espec for amphib which depend on thes upland habit for bree and develop diff in upland habit us can emerg among amphib specy with distinct lif hist trait includ reproduc strategy pond bree vs non pond bree an lif stag adult vs juvenil and sex mal vs fem to dat ther has been no quantit study of upland habit us in the neotrop which can provid a baselin for quant the amount of upland forest habit nee to sustain loc amphib pop we monit three pond for ov two sampl year us drift fent with pitfal trap to investig how reproduc strategy lif stag and sex affect an upland habit us in a forest remn in the atl forest hotspot we found no diff in upland habit us between adult and juvenil an howev we found that although the specy rich of pond bree and non pond bree an was simil near wetland ther was gre abund of pond bree comp to non pond bree an we also found a strong diff between the sex in pond bree an with mal remain clos to wetland than fem thu the sex ratio of amphib pop can be strongly skew toward mal if on smal protect terrest buff m ar enforc dur land develop our find also point to the inadequ of cur brazil policy to protect smal wetland and the faun that depend on them we recommend that policymak adjust reg criter to set hierarch protect buff around wetland allow diff level of land us interv,new,0.6760180634040269,0.6278169238034197,0.5948920236965191,0.5723157635330596,0.5569598983007897,0.547119161465448,0.5420125860603687,0.5415808897512558,0.5466047511312102,0.5593449569229014,0.5855851530134718
16,amphib_neotropic,Amphibian diversity and threatened species in a severely transformed neotropical Region in Mexico,"Many regions around the world concentrate a large number of highly endangered species that have very restricted distributions. The mountainous region of central Veracruz, Mexico, is considered a priority area for amphibian conservation because of its high level of endemism and the number of threatened species. The original tropical montane cloud forest in the region has been dramatically reduced and fragmented and is now mainly confined to ravines and hillsides. We evaluated the current situation of amphibian diversity in the cloud forest fragments of this region by analyzing species richness and abundance, comparing assemblage structure and species composition, examining the distribution and abundance of threatened species, and identifying the local and landscape variables associated with the observed amphibian diversity. From June to October 2012 we sampled ten forest fragments, investing 944 person-hours of sampling effort. A total of 895 amphibians belonging to 16 species were recorded. Notable differences in species richness, abundance, and assemblage structure between forest fragments were observed. Species composition between pairs of fragments differed by an average of 53%, with the majority (58%) resulting from species replacement and the rest (42%) explained by differences in species richness. Half of the species detected are under threat of extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and although their distribution and abundance varied markedly, there were also ubiquitous and abundant species, along with rare species of restricted distribution. The evident heterogeneity of the ten study sites indicates that to conserve amphibians in a mountainous region such as this one it is necessary to protect groups of fragments which represent the variability of the system. Both individually and together cloud forest fragments are very important to conservation because each remnant is inhabited by several threatened species, some of them at imminent risk of extinction. ¬© 2015 Meza-Parral, Pineda.",10.1371/journal.pone.0121652,2-s2.0-84925797523,6,0.649278088,0,amphib divers and threatened specy in a sev transform neotrop reg in mexico many reg around the world cont a larg numb of high endang specy that hav very restrict distribut the mountain reg of cent veracruz mexico is consid a pri are for amphib conserv becaus of it high level of endem and the numb of threatened specy the origin trop mont cloud forest in the reg has been dram reduc and frag and is now main confin to ravin and hillsid we evalu the cur situ of amphib divers in the cloud forest frag of thi reg by analys specy rich and abund comp assembl structure and specy composit examin the distribut and abund of threatened specy and ident the loc and landscap vary assocy with the observ amphib divers from jun to octob we sampl ten forest frag invest person hour of sampl effort a tot of amphib belong to specy wer record not diff in specy rich abund and assembl structure between forest frag wer observ specy composit between pair of frag diff by an av of with the maj result from specy replac and the rest explain by diff in specy rich half of the specy detect ar und threat of extinct accord to the intern un for conserv of nat and although their distribut and abund vary mark ther wer also ubiquit and abund specy along with rar specy of restrict distribut the evid heterog of the ten study sit ind that to conserv amphib in a mountain reg such as thi on it is necess to protect group of frag which repres the vary of the system both individ and togeth cloud forest frag ar very import to conserv becaus each remn is inhabit by sev threatened specy som of them at immin risk of extinct,new,0.756134233671001,0.6778643467238906,0.618444595748498,0.57308978916458,0.5374516187917535,0.5086594189291984,0.48488367257056586,0.46493264833923437,0.44803377759661694,0.4337144109042865,0.4218758449852817
17,amphib_neotropic,Stream invertebrate responses to a catastrophic decline in consumer diversity,"Tadpoles are often abundant and diverse consumers in headwater streams in the Neotropics. However, their populations are declining catastrophically in many regions, in part because of a chytrid fungal pathogen. These declines are occurring along a moving disease front in Central America and offer the rare opportunity to quantify the consequences of a sudden, dramatic decline in consumer diversity in a natural system. As part of the Tropical Amphibian Declines in Streams (TADS) project, we examined stream macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and production for 2 y in 4 stream reaches at 2 sites in Panama. One site initially had healthy amphibians but declined during our study (El Cop), and 1 site already had experienced a decline in 1996 (Fortuna). During the 1st y, total macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and production were generally similar among sites and showed no consistent patterns between pre- and post-decline streams. However, during the 2nd y, tadpole densities declined precipitously at El Cop, and total macroinvertebrate production was significantly lower in the El Cop streams than in Fortuna streams. Functional structure differed between sites. Abundance, biomass, and production of filterers generally were higher at Fortuna, and shredders generally were higher at El Cop. However, shredder production declined significantly in both El Cop reaches in the 2nd y as tadpoles declined. Nonmetric dimensional scaling (NMDS) based on abundance and production indicated that assemblages differed between sites, and patterns were linked to variations in relative availability of basal resources.

18,amphib_neotropic,Non-invasive invaders from the Caribbean: The status of Johnstone's Whistling frog (Eleutherodactylus johnstonei) ten years after its introduction to Western French Guiana,"The neotropical frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei (Anura: Eleutherodactylidae) has been referred to as a highly invasive species on grounds of its wide distribution and is expected to extend its range significantly based on recent climate model assumptions. The frog was introduced to a number of South American mainland localities, including French Guiana. Other species of the genus have become invasive on oceanic islands such as Hawaii where they pose serious biological and economical problems. No data are available on the invasion status of E. johnstonei populations from coastal South America. Here we present the first assessment of the status of a mainland population from French Guiana 10 years after the introduction of the species. We found that the species has not spread significantly within the last ten years and so far does not exhibit a high invasion potential. Frogs were restricted to urban garden habitats showing significantly higher abundance in gardens containing ornamental potted plants. Distribution patterns were best explained by two dispersal-related factors operating at different scales: (1) distance of occupied sites to nearest population indicating short-distance active dispersal using stepping stone habitats, and (2) distance of occupied sites to shore with a distinct bimodal pattern indicating long-distance passive or jump-dispersal, most likely due to the exchange or transfer of ornamental plants. Even though past and current invasion potential can be considered low, we advocate the implementation of a regional monitoring scheme and detailed studies on biotic interactions with native fauna. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10530-010-9930-5,2-s2.0-79960061662,37,0.627957048,0,non invas invad from the carib the stat of johnston s whistl frog eleutherodactyl johnstone ten year aft it introduc to western french guian the neotrop frog eleutherodactyl johnstone anur eleutherodactylida has been refer to as a high invas specy on ground of it wid distribut and is expect to extend it rang sign bas on rec clim model assum the frog was introduc to a numb of sou am mainland loc includ french guian oth specy of the gen hav becom invas on oc island such as hawai wher they pos sery biolog and econom problem no dat ar avail on the invas stat of e johnstone pop from coast sou americ her we pres the first assess of the stat of a mainland pop from french guian year aft the introduc of the specy we found that the specy has not spread sign within the last ten year and so far doe not exhibit a high invas pot frog wer restrict to urb gard habit show sign high abund in gard contain orna pot plant distribut pattern wer best explain by two dispers rel fact op at diff scal dist of occupy sit to nearest pop ind short dist act dispers us step ston habit and dist of occupy sit to shor with a distinct bimod pattern ind long dist pass or jump dispers most lik due to the exchang or transf of orna plant ev though past and cur invas pot can be consid low we advoc the impl of a reg monit scheme and detail study on biot interact with nat faun,new,0.657225410881114,0.6103813186932628,0.5789985968125035,0.5576155606696949,0.5430575484009228,0.5336592331826747,0.5286658166168199,0.5280011701706933,0.5323619879834884,0.5438042056035814,0.56767961017848
19,amphib_neotropic,Seasonal and geographic variation in the diet of barn owls (Tyto Alba) in temperate agroecosystems of Argentina,"We studied the dietary niche of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) in temperate agroecosystems of central Argentina by describing seasonal and geographic variation in the food habits of this owl in four districts of the Pampean region (Flooding, Inland, Rolling, and Southern Pampas). We identified 21,925 prey items from samples of fresh pellets collected in summer (n = 23) and winter (n = 26). Mammals,' mostly sigmodontine rodents, were the main prey items (91.9%), followed by amphibians (6.5%) and birds (1.6%). Arthropods were also a common prey item (found in 45% of the samples). The consumption of arthropods and amphibians was higher in summer than in winter, indicating that seasonal changes in prey abundances are reflected in the Barn Owl diet. We found no differences in food-niche breadth among the four study districts, but food-niche breadth varied between seasons, being higher during summer. Six rodent species were common to all districts: Calomys spp., Akodon azarae, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Mus musculus, Rattus spp., and Holochilus brasiliensis. Calomys spp. was numerically dominant in 46 of the 49 samples, and together with A. azarae and O. flavescens comprised the bulk of the diet (> 80%).

20,amphib_neotropic,Abundance signals of amphibians and reptiles indicate strong edge effects in Neotropical fragmented forest landscapes,"Fragmentation and habitat loss contribute considerably to global declines of amphibians and reptiles. However, few studies focus on forest edges, created during the fragmentation process, as proximate drivers of the local demographic structure of populations. Here, we use abundance data of amphibians and reptiles to study their responses to forest edges in nine fragmented forested landscapes of the Neotropics. Species-specific abundance data were collected in plots established at varying distances from their respective nearest forest edge. We tested for edge effects on the abundance of species, and used curve clustering techniques to group species with similar edge responses, i.e. species with either increasing or decreasing abundance from the matrix towards the forest interior. We also grouped species that showed no change in abundance with respect to the nearest forest edge and those whose abundance response was unimodal, peaking in either forest habitat or the surrounding matrix habitat. We found that 96% of all amphibians and 90% of all reptiles showed an edge response, with the abundance of 74.5% of amphibians and 57.3% of reptiles decreasing with increasing proximity to forest edges. However, species-specific edge effects were not always consistent, with some species having opposite edge responses when measured in different landscapes. The depth of edge effects exhibited by forest species, i.e. species that increased in abundance in the forest interior, extended up to one kilometre away from forest edges. We show that the median edge effect on forest species extends to 250¬†m within the forest interior, indicating that tropical forest patches with a mean diameter¬†<¬†500¬†m (minimum area¬†‚âà¬†78¬†ha) are unsuitable for half of forest-dependent species considered in this study. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.biocon.2016.06.011,2-s2.0-84976330785,3,0.614293309,0,abund sign of amphib and reptil ind strong edg effect in neotrop frag forest landscap frag and habit loss contribut consid to glob declin of amphib and reptil howev few study foc on forest edg cre dur the frag process as proxim driv of the loc demograph structure of pop her we us abund dat of amphib and reptil to study their respons to forest edg in nin frag forest landscap of the neotrop specy spec abund dat wer collect in plot est at vary dist from their respect nearest forest edg we test for edg effect on the abund of specy and us curv clust techn to group specy with simil edg respons i e specy with eith increas or decreas abund from the matrix toward the forest intery we also group specy that show no chang in abund with respect to the nearest forest edg and thos whos abund respons was unimod peak in eith forest habit or the surround matrix habit we found that of al amphib and of al reptil show an edg respons with the abund of of amphib and of reptil decreas with increas proxim to forest edg howev specy spec edg effect wer not alway consist with som specy hav opposit edg respons when meas in diff landscap the dep of edg effect exhibit by forest specy i e specy that increas in abund in the forest intery extend up to on kilomet away from forest edg we show that the med edg effect on forest specy extend to ¬†m within the forest intery ind that trop forest patch with a mean diameter¬† ¬†¬†m minim area¬†‚âà¬†¬†h ar unsuit for half of forest depend specy consid in thi study,new,0.67169663909477,0.6016886893375873,0.5542958242860018,0.5211695912803405,0.4972674295606831,0.4798466345269329,0.46746119964271315,0.45947914661183226,0.45599877192357813,0.4581558728321721,0.4693904060171431

22,amphib_neotropic,Neotropical tadpoles influence stream benthos: Evidence for the ecological consequences of decline in amphibian populations,"1. Few studies have assessed the role of tadpoles in tropical streams, although they are often abundant and conspicuous components of these systems. Moreover, amphibian populations are declining around the globe, particularly stream-dwelling species in tropical uplands, and the ecological consequences of these losses are not understood. 2. We chose a stream in the central Panamanian highlands, which has an intact fauna of stream-breeding anurans, to examine the ecological consequences of amphibian losses. This site differs dramatically from sites in nearby western Panama and Costa Rica where anuran diversity and abundance have declined greatly in the last two decades. 3. We used an underwater electric field to create tadpole exclosures in runs, so that we could evaluate their influence on sediment dynamics and the abundance and community structure of algae and aquatic insects. Tadpoles reduced total sediments and both organic and inorganic fractions on substrata. Tadpoles also reduced algal abundance on substrata by approximately 50% and decreased algal biovolume. Gut content analyses showed that tadpoles consumed algae and sediments and we could see that algae and sediments were also displaced through bioturbation. 4. Atelopus zeteki, Rana warszewitschii, and Hyla spp. were the dominant larval anurans responsible for the effects observed. Visual surveys indicated that the densities of these taxa ranged from 23 (R. warszewitschii and Hyla spp. combined) to 43 m-2 (A. zeteki) in runs. 5. The abundance of baetid mayflies was lower in tadpole exclosures compared with controls, and this was attributed to tadpoles facilitating mayfly feeding by removing sediments and exposing underlying periphyton. 6. Tadpoles affect the abundance and diversity of basal resources and other primary consumers, and thus influence food web dynamics and energy flow in these tropical streams.

23,amphib_neotropic,Variation in Abundance and Efficacy of Tadpole Predators in a Neotropical Pond Community,"Variation in predation risk plays an important role in shaping prey behavior, morphology, life history, population dynamics, and community structure in freshwater systems. Anuran larvae are important prey in freshwater communities and spatiotemporal variation in risk can arise from changes in the number and identity of predators; however, our understanding of variation in abundance, identity, and foraging rates for natural predator assemblages in tropical pond communities is limited. We surveyed ponds near Gamboa, Panama in 2004 and 2010 to estimate variation in predator communities of tadpoles over space and time.We also conducted short-term predation trials with the 10 most common predators using hatchling tadpoles of two widespread Neotropical frog species, Red-Eyed Treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and Pantless Treefrogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Predator abundance varied nearly threefold across ponds within a single year and as much as 19-fold within a pond across years. Dominant taxa also varied, with backswimmers (Notonectidae), poeciliid fish, or libellulid dragonfly naiads being the most common depending upon pond and year. Predation trials revealed that prey-specific predation rates differed among predator taxa. Some presumed predators did not consume hatchlings, whereas others consumed >90% of prey. The smaller D. ebraccatus hatchlings generally experienced higher predation rates; however, large invertebrate predators like aeshnid dragonfly naiads, giant water bugs, and fishing spiders consumed more A. callidryas. These results suggest that strong but variable larval-stage risk may be an important selective factor shaping tadpole communities and phenotypes in Neotropical ponds. ¬© 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.",10.1670/14-111,2-s2.0-84959866101,13,0.540339602,1,vary in abund and eff of tadpol pred in a neotrop pond commun vary in pred risk play an import rol in shap prey behavy morpholog lif hist pop dynam and commun structure in freshw system an larva ar import prey in freshw commun and spatiotemp vary in risk can ar from chang in the numb and id of pred howev our understand of vary in abund id and for rat for nat pred assembl in trop pond commun is limit we survey pond near gambo panam in and to estim vary in pred commun of tadpol ov spac and tim we also conduc short term pred tri with the most common pred us hatchl tadpol of two widespread neotrop frog specy red ey treefrog agalychn callidrya and pantless treefrog dendropsoph ebraccat pred abund vary near threefold across pond within a singl year and as much as fold within a pond across year domin tax also vary with backswim notonectida poeciliid fish or libellulid dragonf naiad being the most common depend upon pond and year pred tri rev that prey spec pred rat diff among pred tax som presum pred did not consum hatchl wherea oth consum of prey the smal d ebraccat hatchl gen expery high pred rat howev larg invertebr pred lik aeshnid dragonf naiad giant wat bug and fish spid consum mor a callidrya thes result suggest that strong but vary larv stag risk may be an import select fact shap tadpol commun and phenotyp in neotrop pond,new,0.5852223196982481,0.5171462066730482,0.47164137761411623,0.4404268449420672,0.41859248126422977,0.40349543760321593,0.39379935127108295,0.38905605593448905,0.38970899633180855,0.39765776126122965,0.4183677025074458

We investigated the road-edge effect of a low-use dirt road on amphibian and reptile abundance, diversity, and composition within adjacent lowland Amazonian rainforest at San Jos√© de Payamino, Ecuador. The road has been closed to vehicle traffic since its construction in 2010. Thus, effects from vehicle mortality, vehicle-related pollution, and road noise were not confounding factors. Herpetofauna were surveyed using both visual encounter surveys and drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps at varying distances from the road. Structural and microclimate features of the forest were measured at each sampling distance. Several habitat variables were found to differ at intermediate and interior sampling distances from the road compared to forest edge conditions, suggesting the road-edge effect began to attenuate by the intermediate sampling distance. However, the edge effect on amphibians and reptiles appeared to extend 100 m from the road edge, as abundance and diversity were significantly greater at the interior forest compared to the forest edge. Additionally, assemblage composition as well as the hierarchical position of species shifted between sampling distances. Habitat predictor models indicate that amphibian abundance was best predicted by vine abundance, while both vine and mature tree abundance were the best predictors for species richness and diversity. Overall, and contrary to what might otherwise be expected, our results demonstrate that small, little-used road disturbances can nonetheless have profound impacts on wildlife. ¬© Ross J.

25,amphib_neotropic,Rarity as an indicator of endangerment in neotropical frogs,"Anurans are endangered worldwide and declining populations are in need of urgent conservation management. Optimal conservation actions ideally rely on basic ecological and natural history data, such as population size, habitat requirements and availability, or biotic interactions. Unfortunately, we lack basic natural history information for most frogs, making it difficult to determine species vulnerability in nature. Our goal in this study was to apply a 'rarity' index to assess whether rarity and other endangerment assessment criteria can serve complementary roles in conservation prioritization. We applied Rabinowitz' ""eight forms of rarity"" classification, which is based on geographic range, habitat specificity, and local population size, to evaluate its value as an indicator of species vulnerability in the anuran assemblage endemic to the Atlantic Coastal Forest of Brazil. We compared patterns of rarity in anurans to IUCN endangerment status, and investigated possible relationships between spatial traits (topographic complexity, elevation, and latitudinal variation) and groups of species with different forms of rarity. We found similar patterns of rarity across taxonomic groups and among local anuran communities, indicating that these patterns are consistent across taxa and geographic scales.

26,amphib_neotropic,Road ecology and Neotropical amphibians: Contributions for future studies,"Many species of amphibians have suffered serious population declines. Several factors contribute separately or jointly to these declines. However, the reduction of an available habitat due to human expansion is still the main cause, and roads are a major mean for this expansion. Both the construction phase and the subsequent use of roads have negative consequences for amphibians. We reviewed the literature on the subject within the Neotropical context. To this end, the paper begins with a summary of recent reviews and proceeds through an analysis of sampling methods used in roadkill studies, mitigation measures and the Neotropical scenario and concludes with several suggestions to guide future studies. More attention will be given to roadkills, which is one of the primary impacts on wildlife that is caused by roads. Even in the Neotropical zone most studies are foot-based, the richness and abundance of amphibians affected are higher in regions outside the Neotropics. One possible explanation is that in the other regions, the proportion of studies exclusively on amphibians is bigger. Regarding mitigation measures, most studies only indicates what should be used, but do not implement or evaluate their effectiveness. ¬© Firenze University Press.",10.13128/Acta_Herpetol-12331,2-s2.0-84901367722,34,0.513020895,0,road ecolog and neotrop amphib contribut for fut study many specy of amphib hav suff sery pop declin sev fact contribut sep or joint to thes declin howev the reduc of an avail habit due to hum expand is stil the main caus and road ar a maj mean for thi expand both the construct phas and the subsequ us of road hav neg consequ for amphib we review the lit on the subject within the neotrop context to thi end the pap begin with a sum of rec review and process through an analys of sampl method us in roadkil study mitig meas and the neotrop scenario and conclud with sev suggest to guid fut study mor at wil be giv to roadkil which is on of the prim impact on wildl that is caus by road ev in the neotrop zon most study ar foot bas the rich and abund of amphib affect ar high in reg outsid the neotrop on poss expl is that in the oth reg the proport of study exclud on amphib is big regard mitig meas most study on ind what should be us but do not impl or evalu their effect,new,0.5586405113295329,0.5097288825642393,0.4787788343368554,0.45900246821032475,0.4467973217299105,0.4404214667842999,0.43923970117951877,0.44349663186018046,0.4545552326361546,0.4758938050624137,0.5161692045378514
27,amphib_neotropic,"Effects of collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) exclusion on leaf litter amphibians and reptiles in a Neotropical wet forest, Costa Rica","Peccaries are known to shape vegetation structure and create important breeding habitat for some pond-breeding amphibians in Neotropical forests. Because peccaries are also important agents of disturbance and microhabitat variation in the litter, peccary loss could have important consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles that depend entirely upon the litter for shelter, foraging and reproduction sites, and thermoregulation. However, very little is known about the effects of peccaries or their loss on litter amphibians and reptiles. We experimentally reduced peccary density in 20. √ó. 50. m fenced exclusion plots (. n=. 5). We compared standing litter structure and amphibian and reptile abundance where peccaries were excluded to paired, open-forest control plots that had natural peccary densities. We encountered 16% more amphibian and reptile individuals in open control plots, and we encountered more juveniles of the most common anuran species in control plots than on peccary exclusions. Control plots had more compacted litter than peccary exclusion plots, indicating that peccaries alter the physical structure of the standing leaf litter in a way that promotes greater recruitment of juvenile anurans. Our results demonstrate that peccaries should be viewed not just as seed predators or ecosystem engineers for palms and pond-breeding amphibians, but also as important agents that affect leaf litter structure and abundance of terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. Peccary extirpation from overhunting or habitat degradation could have unexpected negative consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles, a diverse group already severely threatened by habitat loss, climate change, disease, and other anthropogenic effects worldwide. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.biocon.2012.12.015,2-s2.0-84879177789,30,0.508829758,0,effect of coll pecc pecar tajacu exclud on leaf lit amphib and reptil in a neotrop wet forest cost ric pecc ar known to shap veget structure and cre import bree habit for som pond bree amphib in neotrop forest becaus pecc ar also import ag of disturb and microhabit vary in the lit pecc loss could hav import consequ for lit amphib and reptil that depend entir upon the lit for shelt for and reproduc sit and thermoreg howev very littl is known about the effect of pecc or their loss on lit amphib and reptil we expery reduc pecc dens in √ó m fent exclud plot n we comp stand lit structure and amphib and reptil abund wher pecc wer exclud to pair op forest control plot that had nat pecc dens we encount mor amphib and reptil individ in op control plot and we encount mor juvenil of the most common an specy in control plot than on pecc exclud control plot had mor compact lit than pecc exclud plot ind that pecc alt the phys structure of the stand leaf lit in a way that promot gre recruit of juvenil an our result demonst that pecc should be view not just as see pred or ecosystem engin for palm and pond bree amphib but also as import ag that affect leaf lit structure and abund of terrest amphib and reptil pecc extirp from overhunt or habit degrad could hav unexpect neg consequ for lit amphib and reptil a divers group already sev threatened by habit loss clim chang diseas and oth anthropog effect worldwid,new,0.5304314199776536,0.48415008948685206,0.4555079131222599,0.437779751928217,0.42748239149047584,0.4229878234761459,0.42378215201150915,0.43026638408730405,0.4440506968150991,0.4690786165112163,0.51497482857477

29,amphib_neotropic,"Assessing the links among environmental contaminants, endocrinology, and parasites to understand amphibian declines in montane regions of Costa Rica","Amphibians inhabiting montane riparian zones in the Neotropics are particularly vulnerable to decline, but the reasons are poorly understood. Because environmental contaminants, endocrine disruption, and pathogens often figure prominently in amphibian declines it is imperative that we understand how these factors are potentially interrelated to affect montane populations. One possibility is that increased precipitation associated with global warming promotes the deposition of contaminants in montane regions. Increased exposure to contaminants, in turn, potentially elicits chronic elevations in circulating stress hormones that could contribute to montane population declines by compromising resistance to pathogens and/or production of sex steroids regulating reproduction. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining contaminant levels, stress and sex steroid levels, and nematode abundances in male drab treefrogs, Smilisca sordida, from lowland and montane populations in Costa Rica. We found no evidence that montane populations were more likely to possess contaminants (i.e., organochlorine, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides or benzidine and chlorophenoxy herbicides) than lowland populations. We also found no evidence of elevational differences in circulating levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, estradiol or progesterone. However, montane populations possessed lower androgen levels, hosted more nematode species, and had higher nematode abundances than lowland populations. Although these results suggested that nematodes contributed to lower androgens in montane populations, we were unable to detect a significant inverse relationship between nematode abundance and androgen level. Our results suggest that montane populations of this species are not at greater risk of exposure to contaminants or chronic stress, but implicate nematodes and compromised sex steroid levels as potential threats to montane populations. ¬© 2018 Leary et al.

30,amphib_neotropic,A stable isotope study of a neotropical stream food web prior to the extirpation of its large amphibian community,"Rapid and massive amphibian population declines have been reported throughout upland areas of the Neotropics. The abundance and species richness of Neotropical amphibian communities suggest that losses of this magnitude are likely to have strong effects at the ecosystem level. To improve understanding of the implications of their loss we used stable isotope analysis to examine trophic relationships in an ecosystem in which amphibians are dominant in a second-order forest stream at 750 m asl in Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama. We analysed Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and C:N ratios of major biotic components (basal resources, invertebrates, amphibians, fish and reptiles) in the stream and of the adjacent riparian food web. Tadpoles (mean Œ¥15N = 4.49‚Ä∞) and adult amphibians (mean Œ¥15N = 5.45‚Ä∞) were intermediate links in the aquatic and terrestrial food web respectively. High Œ¥15N signatures identified fish as top predators in the aquatic food web and snakes and the toad Bufo as top predators in the terrestrial food web. Isotopic signatures clearly distinguished between trophic groups of tadpoles: microbial feeders (Centrolenidae, Œ¥15N range = 0.91-3.05‚Ä∞), herbivores (Rana and Hyla, Œ¥15N range = 4.74-5.15‚Ä∞) and neuston feeders (Colostethus, Œ¥15N range = 5.31-6.40‚Ä∞). Dependence on autotrophic production was indicated by enriched signatures of carbon isotopes in pool dwellers versus those that reside in faster-flowing sections of the stream. High nitrogen concentrations in detrital matter (average 0.8%, C:N = 10.3) suggested that grazing tadpoles enhanced nitrogen fluxes and improved the quality of organic matter available to detritivores.

33,amphib_neotropic,A century of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in Illinois amphibians (1888-1989),"The fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), causes the disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians and is responsible for the worst epizootics in vertebrate history. In some regions of the world (e.g., the Neotropics and Western United States), Bd has caused recent reductions in amphibian population abundance and species richness, while in other regions the impacts are less clear. Although Bd is present in the Midwestern United States, its history and impact in the region is not known. We used a qPCR assay to determine historic Bd prevalence in Illinois, testing 1028 specimens representing 10 anuran species, collected 1888-1989. We used two complementary sets of samples to first assess historic prevalence with the primary set, and used a secondary set to confirm Bd presence and examine older samples with a more sensitive technique. Prevalence varied among species; in the primary dataset of 1008 samples extracted with PrepMan Ultra collected 1892-1989, Bd was found in four species (11.1%, CI: 9.3-13.2%). Rana (. Lithobates) sphenocephala, the southern leopard frog, had the highest prevalence (38.3%, CI 32.7-44.2%); prevalence among other infected species was <7%. Overall prevalence was <10% in most decades but >40% in the 1940s. In the secondary set of 50 samples extracted with Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kits (30 re-swabbed of the original 1008 and 20 additional older specimens), 17 of the 20 additional samples were Bd+ (85.0%, CI 64.0-94.8%) including the oldest Bd+ specimen, which was collected in 1888. We confirmed Bd presence by sequencing 42 Bd+ samples and found ‚â•99% homology with Bd sequences in Genbank. By 1900, Bd was geographically widespread throughout Illinois-40. years earlier than the current oldest estimate in the U.S.-meaning that Illinois amphibians have been coexisting with Bd for at least 126. years. This long period of coexistence from our results raises new questions about the history of Bd in North America, possible coevolution between host and pathogen, and the potential role of Bd in historic population declines. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.007,2-s2.0-84920733529,24,0.46786251700000003,0,a century of batrachochytr dendrobatid in illino amphib the fung pathog batrachochytr dendrobatid bd caus the diseas chytridiomycos in amphib and is respons for the worst epizoot in vertebr hist in som reg of the world e g the neotrop and western unit stat bd has caus rec reduc in amphib pop abund and specy rich whil in oth reg the impact ar less clear although bd is pres in the midwestern unit stat it hist and impact in the reg is not known we us a qpcr assay to determin hist bd prev in illino test specim repres an specy collect we us two compl set of sampl to first assess hist prev with the prim set and us a second set to confirm bd pres and examin old sampl with a mor sensit techn prev vary among specy in the prim dataset of sampl extract with prepm ultr collect bd was found in four specy ci ran lithob sphenocephala the southern leopard frog had the highest prev ci prev among oth infect specy was overal prev was in most decad but in the s in the second set of sampl extract with qiag blood and tissu kit re swab of the origin and addit old specim of the addit sampl wer bd ci includ the oldest bd specim which was collect in we confirm bd pres by sequ bd sampl and found ‚â• homolog with bd sequ in genbank by bd was geograph widespread throughout illino year ear than the cur oldest estim in the u s mean that illino amphib hav been coex with bd for at least year thi long period of coex from our result rais new quest about the hist of bd in nor americ poss coevolv between host and pathog and the pot rol of bd in hist pop declin,new,0.4914542484600957,0.4666309479255934,0.4544498217375923,0.4504124801366178,0.45235245798919593,0.45948584947127746,0.47194676421988047,0.49076430137457083,0.5183038165297046,0.5595698854013218,0.6254337471163763
35,amphib_neotropic,"The value of primary, secondary, and plantation forests for a neotropical herpetofauna","Plantation forests and second-growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation. ¬© 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.",10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00659.x,2-s2.0-34249098657,16,0.435009053,1,the valu of prim second and plant forest for a neotrop herpetofaun plant forest and second grow forest ar becom domin compon of many trop forest landscap yet ther is littl inform avail concern the consequ of diff forestry opt for biodivers conserv in the trop we sampl the leaf lit herpetofaun of prim second and eucalypt plant forest in the jar riv are of northeastern brazil amazon we us four compl sampl techn combin sampl from consecut year and collect leaf lit amphib specy and lizard specy we analys the dat for diff among forest typ regard pattern of alph and bet divers specy abund distribut and commun structure prim rainforest harb sign mor specy but support a simil abund of amphib and lizard comp with adjac area of second grow forest or plant plant forest wer domin by wid rang habit gen second forest fauna contain a numb of specy charact of prim forest habit amphib commun in second forest and eucalypt plant form a nest subset of prim forest specy wherea the specy composit of the lizard commun in plant was distinct and was domin by op are specy although plant forest ar rel impov nat reg forest can help mitig som neg effect of deforest for herpetofaun nevertheless second forest doe not provid a substitut for prim forest and in the abs of furth evid from old success stand we caut against the optim claim that nat forest reg in abandon land wil provid refug for the many specy that ar cur threatened by deforest,new,0.4992895484960527,0.43937314709759423,0.4032217815678077,0.38104033192431486,0.3677829267509813,0.36104942818137387,0.359897014628506,0.36442716393106883,0.37597722220863555,0.39816557524195184,0.4403160469694494
36,amphib_neotropic,Neotropical primary productivity affects biomass of the leaf-litter herpetofaunal assemblage,"Soil fertility and plant productivity are known to vary across the Amazon Basin partially as a function of geomorphology and age of soils. Using data on herpetofaunal abundance collected from 5 A - 5 m and 6 A - 6 m plots in mature tropical forests, we tested whether variation in community biomass of litter frogs and lizards across ten Neotropical sites could be explained by cation exchange capacity, primary productivity or stem turnover rate. About half of the variation in frog biomass (48%) could be attributed to stem turnover rate, while over two-thirds of the variation in lizard biomass (69%) was explained by primary productivity. Biomass variation in frogs resulted from variation in abundance and size, and abundance was related to cation exchange capacity (45% of variation explained), but size was not. Lizard biomass across sites varied mostly with individual lizard size, but not with abundance, and size was highly dependent on primary productivity (85% of variation explained). Soil fertility and plant productivity apparently affect secondary consumers like frogs and lizards through food webs, as biomass is transferred from plants to herbivorous arthropods to secondary consumers. ¬© 2012 Cambridge University Press.",10.1017/S0266467412000430,2-s2.0-84865793596,12,0.412569777,0,neotrop prim produc affect biomass of the leaf lit herpetofaun assembl soil fertil and plant produc ar known to vary across the amazon basin part as a funct of geomorpholog and ag of soil us dat on herpetofaun abund collect from a m and a m plot in mat trop forest we test wheth vary in commun biomass of lit frog and lizard across ten neotrop sit could be explain by cat exchang capac prim produc or stem turnov rat about half of the vary in frog biomass could be attribut to stem turnov rat whil ov two third of the vary in lizard biomass was explain by prim produc biomass vary in frog result from vary in abund and siz and abund was rel to cat exchang capac of vary explain but siz was not lizard biomass across sit vary most with individ lizard siz but not with abund and siz was high depend on prim produc of vary explain soil fertil and plant produc app affect second consum lik frog and lizard through food web as biomass is transfer from plant to herb arthropod to second consum,new,0.41437693082742366,0.3667852030024085,0.3403771617779563,0.3261721184684722,0.3199445569425744,0.31993090799133217,0.32577379317260097,0.3383004163231003,0.35999538182849145,0.39672856656129096,0.46283023238075705
37,amphib_neotropic,Disassembly of a tadpole community by a multi-host fungal pathogen with limited evidence of recovery:,"Emerging infectious diseases can cause host community disassembly, but the mechanisms driving the order of species declines and extirpations following a disease outbreak are unclear. We documented the community disassembly of a Neotropical tadpole community during a chytridiomycosis outbreak, triggered by the generalist fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Within the first 11 months of Bd arrival, tadpole density and occupancy rapidly declined. Species rarity, in terms of tadpole occupancy and adult relative abundance, did not predict the odds of tadpole occupancy declines. But species losses were taxonomically selective, with glassfrogs (Family: Centrolenidae) disappearing the fastest and tree frogs (Family: Hylidae) and dart-poison frogs (Family: Dendrobatidae) remaining the longest. We detected biotic homogenization of tadpole communities, with post-decline communities resembling one another more strongly than pre-decline communities. The entire tadpole community was extirpated within 22 months following Bd arrival, and we found limited signs of recovery within 10 years post-outbreak. Because of imperfect species detection inherent to sampling species-rich tropical communities and the difficulty of devising a single study design protocol to sample physically complex tropical habitats, we used simulations to provide recommendations for future surveys to adequately sample diverse Neotropical communities. Our unique data set on tadpole community composition before and after Bd arrival is a valuable baseline for assessing amphibian recovery. Our results are of direct relevance to conservation managers and community ecologists interested in understanding the timing, magnitude, and consequences of disease outbreaks as emerging infectious diseases spread globally. ¬© 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1002/eap.1443,2-s2.0-85008392216,8,0.40426895,0,disassembl of a tadpol commun by a mult host fung pathog with limit evid of recovery emerg infecty diseas can caus host commun disassembl but the mech driv the ord of specy declin and extirp follow a diseas outbreak ar unclear we docu the commun disassembl of a neotrop tadpol commun dur a chytridiomycos outbreak trig by the gen fung pathog batrachochytr dendrobatid bd within the first month of bd ar tadpol dens and occup rapid declin specy rar in term of tadpol occup and adult rel abund did not predict the od of tadpol occup declin but specy loss wer taxonom select with glassfrog famy centrolenida disappear the fastest and tre frog famy hylida and dart poison frog famy dendrobatida remain the longest we detect biot homog of tadpol commun with post declin commun resembl on anoth mor strongly than pre declin commun the entir tadpol commun was extirp within month follow bd ar and we found limit sign of recovery within year post outbreak becaus of imperfect specy detect inh to sampl specy rich trop commun and the difficul of dev a singl study design protocol to sampl phys complex trop habit we us sim to provid recommend for fut survey to adequ sampl divers neotrop commun our un dat set on tadpol commun composit bef and aft bd ar is a valu baselin for assess amphib recovery our result ar of direct relev to conserv man and commun ecolog interest in understand the tim magnitud and consequ of diseas outbreak as emerg infecty diseas spread glob,new,0.41560673144844507,0.38961683413907844,0.3768104027592356,0.37234690427212663,0.37396115499400445,0.38086819898637303,0.393277226429926,0.41239714829998214,0.4410012235983868,0.48508853669271845,0.5582904429067245
39,amphib_neotropic,Host niche may determine disease-driven extinction risk,"The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) drives declines and extinctions in amphibian communities. However, not all regions and species are equally affected. Here, we show that association with amphibian aquatic habitat types (bromeliad phytotelmata versus stream) across Central America results in the odds of being threatened by Bd being five times higher in stream microhabitats. This differential threat of Bd was supported in our study by a significantly lower prevalence of Bd in bromeliad-associated amphibian species compared to riparian species in Honduran cloud forests. Evidence that the bromeliad environment is less favorable for Bd transmission is exemplified by significantly less suitable physicochemical conditions and higher abundance of Bd-ingesting micro-eukaryotes present in bromeliad water. These factors may inhibit aquatic Bd zoospore survival and the development of an environmental reservoir of the pathogen. Bromeliad phytotelmata thus may act as environmental refuges from Bd, which contribute to protecting associated amphibian communities against chytridiomycosis-driven amphibian declines that threaten the nearby riparian communities. ¬© 2017 Blooi et al.

40,amphib_neotropic,Ultraviolet Radiation Influences Perch Selection by a Neotropical Poison-Dart Frog,"Ambient ultraviolet-B radiation can harm amphibian eggs, larvae and adults. However, some amphibians avoid UV-B radiation when given the opportunity. The strawberry poison dart frog, Oophaga pumilio, is diurnal and males vocalize throughout the day in light gaps under forest canopies that expose them to solar radiation. Previous studies have demonstrated that males calling from high perches are more successful at mating than those at lower perches. We investigated whether frogs at higher perches receive more ultraviolet-B than those calling from lower perches. We also investigated whether frogs on perches receiving relatively low ultraviolet-B levels maintained their positions for longer compared to individuals calling from perches receiving higher levels of ultraviolet-B. Finally, since it has been hypothesized that some animals utilize levels of UV-A as a visual cue to avoid UV-B damage, we artificially elevated ultraviolet-A levels to examine whether males exposed to artificially elevated ultraviolet-A abandoned their perches sooner compared to males exposed to visible light. We found that frogs called from perches receiving low ultraviolet-B regardless of perch height, and that frogs maintain their positions longer on perches receiving low ultraviolet-B compared to perches receiving even slightly higher ultraviolet-B levels. Exposing the frogs to artificially elevated levels of ultraviolet-A radiation caused males to move off of their perches faster than when they were exposed to a control light source. These experiments suggest that ultraviolet radiation plays an important role in frog behavior related to perch selection, even in rainforests where much of the solar radiation is shielded by the forest canopy. ¬© 2012 Kats et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0051364,2-s2.0-84871219919,19,0.36832605,0,ultraviolet rady influ perch select by a neotrop poison dart frog amby ultraviolet b rady can harm amphib eg larva and adult howev som amphib avoid uv b rady when giv the opportun the strawberry poison dart frog oophag pumilio is diurn and mal voc throughout the day in light gap und forest canop that expos them to sol rady prevy study hav demonst that mal cal from high perch ar mor success at mat than thos at low perch we investig wheth frog at high perch receiv mor ultraviolet b than thos cal from low perch we also investig wheth frog on perch receiv rel low ultraviolet b level maintain their posit for long comp to individ cal from perch receiv high level of ultraviolet b fin sint it has been hypothes that som anim util level of uv a as a vis cue to avoid uv b dam we art elev ultraviolet a level to examin wheth mal expos to art elev ultraviolet a abandon their perch soon comp to mal expos to vis light we found that frog cal from perch receiv low ultraviolet b regardless of perch height and that frog maintain their posit long on perch receiv low ultraviolet b comp to perch receiv ev slight high ultraviolet b level expos the frog to art elev level of ultraviolet a rady caus mal to mov off of their perch fast than when they wer expos to a control light sourc thes expery suggest that ultraviolet rady play an import rol in frog behavy rel to perch select ev in rainforest wher much of the sol rady is shield by the forest canop,new,0.34496193572564215,0.3356577396440963,0.33456399937471865,0.3391409280739484,0.34847417427891086,0.36261039792269484,0.38237898661776587,0.40959436050255876,0.44778129615902207,0.5039929679316,0.5928881488486878
42,amphib_neotropic,"Leaf-litter herpetofaunal richness, abundance, and community assembly in mono-dominant plantations and primary forest of northeastern Costa Rica","Given current deforestation and land-use change in species-rich tropical forests, a pressing need in conservation biology is to understand how converted, human-modified landscapes support biodiversity. Here, we measured the species richness, abundance, and community composition of amphibians and reptiles in reference primary forest and mono-dominant plantations of three native tree species (Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, Vochysia guatemalensis) at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northern Costa Rica. Because these plantation species generate markedly different forest-floor habitats, we hypothesized that tree species would support different assemblages of leaf-litter herpetofauna. Primary forest, Virola, and Vochysia supported greater richness of frogs than Pentaclethra. Frog densities were significantly lower in Pentaclethra and Vochysia than in nearby primary forest. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we found Pentaclethra to support significantly different assemblages of frogs and lizards than primary forest reference sites, while Vochysia supported a unique assemblage of frogs. Our results suggest that some tree species plantations can support herpetofaunal assemblages comparable to primary forest in richness, community assembly, and abundance. While herpetofaunal community ecology varies among plantation species, our study provides a compelling example of how plantation landscapes can facilitate the restoration of native fauna on degraded landscapes. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10531-013-0526-0,2-s2.0-84881029094,2,0.343379076,0,leaf lit herpetofaun rich abund and commun assembl in mono domin plant and prim forest of northeastern cost ric giv cur deforest and land us chang in specy rich trop forest a press nee in conserv biolog is to understand how convert hum mod landscap support biodivers her we meas the specy rich abund and commun composit of amphib and reptil in ref prim forest and mono domin plant of three nat tre specy pentaclethr macrolob virol koschny vochys guatemalens at la selv biolog stat in the carib lowland of northern cost ric becaus thes plant specy gen mark diff forest flo habit we hypothes that tre specy would support diff assembl of leaf lit herpetofaun prim forest virol and vochys support gre rich of frog than pentaclethr frog dens wer sign low in pentaclethr and vochys than in nearby prim forest us non met multidimend scal and permut mult analys of vary we found pentaclethr to support sign diff assembl of frog and lizard than prim forest ref sit whil vochys support a un assembl of frog our result suggest that som tre specy plant can support herpetofaun assembl comp to prim forest in rich commun assembl and abund whil herpetofaun commun ecolog vary among plant specy our study provid a compel exampl of how plant landscap can facilit the rest of nat faun on degrad landscap,new,0.3781584952600354,0.3370245602238413,0.3149053271847913,0.30365119483553804,0.29951488702076334,0.3009800539942927,0.30780360440706594,0.32081795640122296,0.34240030036292507,0.37812121836711876,0.44174597367471036
110,bird_antarctic,Population dynamics of Eastern Rockhopper Penguins on Campbell Island in relation to sea surface temperature 1942‚Äì2012: current warming hiatus pauses a long-term decline,"Major population changes of marine mega-fauna are ongoing as global warming, and other anthropogenic drivers affect prey availability. The historical stronghold of the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome filholi) was New Zealand‚Äôs sub-Antarctic Campbell Island, but the population declined by 94¬†% between 1942 and 1984. The apparent mechanism of collapse was warm ocean temperatures causing an inadequate food supply. Eudyptes penguin population declines are ongoing at some breeding sites, highlighting the need to investigate the population trend on Campbell Island since 1984. We estimated the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin breeding population size through physical and photo-counts of birds and nests in 2012, and changes in colony area relative to 1984 and 1996 photographs. We estimated the 2012 population size at 33,239 breeding pairs, a 21.8¬†% decrease from an (adjusted) estimate of 42,528 pairs in 1984. Although substantial, the recent 1984‚Äì2012 decline occurred at a much slower rate (Œª¬†=¬†0.991) than the 1942‚Äì1984 decline (Œª¬†=¬†0.940). Despite great variation in trends between colonies ostensibly linked to differences in predation rates, the recent decline occurred primarily between 1984 and 1996, and thereafter the overall population grew. A 100-year time series of extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures (ERSST) confirmed that the population declined during warm periods and increased during cool periods, but that the initial decline began before increases in regional ERSST. Population growth after 1996 appears related to the current global warming hiatus, lower ERSST, and increased abundance of a key prey species. We predict a continuation of the long-term population decline after warming resumes. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-014-1575-x,2-s2.0-84921743627,19,0.9373345470000001,1,pop dynam of eastern rockhop penguin on campbel island in rel to sea surfac temp ‚äì cur warm hiat paus a long term declin maj pop chang of marin meg faun ar ongo as glob warm and oth anthropog driv affect prey avail the hist stronghold of the eastern rockhop penguin eudypt chrysocome filhol was new zealand‚äôs sub antarct campbel island but the pop declin by ¬† between and the app mech of collaps was warm oc temp caus an inadequ food supply eudypt penguin pop declin ar ongo at som bree sit highlight the nee to investig the pop trend on campbel island sint we estim the eastern rockhop penguin bree pop siz through phys and photo count of bird and nest in and chang in colony are rel to and photograph we estim the pop siz at bree pair a ¬† decreas from an adjust estim of pair in although subst the rec ‚äì declin occur at a much slow rat œª¬† ¬† than the ‚äì declin œª¬† ¬† despit gre vary in trend between colony ostens link to diff in pred rat the rec declin occur prim between and and thereaft the overal pop grew a year tim sery of extend reconstruct sea surfac temp ersst confirm that the pop declin dur warm period and increas dur cool period but that the init declin beg bef increas in reg ersst pop grow aft appear rel to the cur glob warm hiat low ersst and increas abund of a key prey specy we predict a continu of the long term pop declin aft warm resum,new,0.9514409301466583,0.9401844002879464,0.9308238658609276,0.9227033385616866,0.9152882331386556,0.9081660788135926,0.9009616699744749,0.8932359276614249,0.8843251391075184,0.8729514349832527,0.8560573751882882
210,bird_antarctic,Population changes and demography of the Northern Rockhopper penguin on Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands,"We investigated changes in population size and demography of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome moseleyi) between 1971 and 1995 on Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands. During an intensive survey between 1993 and 1995, breeding success was similar to that reported from other sites, although the first egg (A-egg) loss rate was lower on Amsterdam Island than at other localities. The mean age of first return to the breeding site and of first reproduction were respectively X = 4.2 ¬± SD of 2.1 years and X = 4.7 ¬± SD of 1.7 years. The adult survival rate, calculated between 1988 and 1993, was significantly lower one year after banding [X = 72.2 ¬± SD of 1.6%] than in subsequent years [X = 84.0 ¬± SD of 1.1%] due to the effect of banding. Immature survival rate was estimated at 39% during the first year after banding. Two birds banded as chicks have been found in Australia, suggesting that immatures winter off Southern Australia. The population on Amsterdam Island decreased at a rate of 2.7% per year between 1971 and 1993. Using the demographic parameters measured, we calculated a modelled rate of increase of 0.940 between 1988 and 1993, a value close to the observed rate of 0.943. Between 1982 to 1993, mean sea surface temperature near Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands decreased significantly, and this change was significantly related to the decline of Amsterdam Island population during the same period. Mean sea surface temperature decline could affect the Rockhopper Penguin population through changes of distribution and abundance of prey. Other factors such as the large increase of the Sub-Antarctic Fur Seal population at Amsterdam Island between 1971 and 1993 could have reduced the penguin population. Between 1971 and 1993, the Saint Paul population of penguins increased by 5.5% per year, but this is not significantly related to the mean sea surface temperature decrease.

310,bird_antarctic,Albatross populations in peril: A population trajectory for Black-browed Albatrosses at South Georgia,"Simulation modeling was used to reconstruct Black-browed Albatross (Diomedea melanophris) population trends. Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from ""Vulnerable"" to ""Endangered."" Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years. For this population to recover to a status under which it could be ""delisted,"" a 10% increase in survival of all age classes would be needed. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/03-5340,2-s2.0-33645099456,34,0.886828932,1,albatross pop in peril a pop traject for black brow albatross at sou georg sim model was us to reconstruct black brow albatross diomede melanophr pop trend clos approxim to observ dat wer accompl by an vary surv rat reproduc success and prob of return to bree giv success in prevy year the temp shift in an valu coincid with the start of longlin fish at sou georg and pot chang in kril abund we us year of demograph dat from long term study of a bree colony of thi specy at bird island sou georg to valid our model when we us an paramet estim for surv reproduc success and prob of return to bree giv success in prevy year our model traject clos follow the observ chang in bree pop siz ov tim pop grow rat was below replac lambd in most year and was most sensit to chang in adult surv thi support the rec iucn upl of thi specy from vuln to endang comparison of pre and post demograph bef and aft the inceiv of a longlin fishery in the bree are rev a decreas in lambd from to a lif tabl respons expery ltre show that thi declin in lambd was caus most by declin in surv of adult if demograph rat ar maintain the model predict a chant of a pop of few than pair within year for thi pop to recov to a stat und which it could be del a increas in surv of al ag class would be nee,new,0.9182801013039639,0.9010124178800342,0.8871646212287242,0.8758583776720814,0.866350911611078,0.8581185867774833,0.8507807822759466,0.8440231942285837,0.8375286021179325,0.8308586555767489,0.8231869569044687
41,bird_antarctic,Distribution and abundance of the Southern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialoides,"We reviewed published and unpublished literature to establish the status of the breeding distribution and abundance of Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides. The species breeds widely throughout the Antarctic and on peri-Antarctic islands. From breeding population data collated from 73 of these localities, we estimated the minimum global population to be about 400,000 breeding pairs. After adjusting for seasonal variation in numbers of breeding pairs based on studies at Ardery Island, East Antarctica, the total global population is estimated to be at least one million breeding pairs. Of this, 72% nest on islands of the Scotia Sea arc and the South Atlantic Ocean. The precision of the estimate on the total number of breeding pairs is low, as several colony estimates were only available as orders of magnitude. Furthermore, different timing of the surveys and the difficulties of censusing colonial cliff-nesting birds reduced the count accuracy.

The breeding aggregation on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia is believed to be larger than all others combined. We estimated the size of this population by calculating the area of suitable habitat and the density of occupied burrows within it. Some 670,000 occupied nests were estimated for the island at mid-incubation, representing 0.9 million pairs of breeding-age birds associated with South Georgia in the survey seasons (2005/06 and 06/07). This is 40-45% of the previous estimate, but still represents well over half of the global population. If the population is declining due to fishery bycatch, as is likely, the scale of annual mortality in this population alone is at least in the high tens of thousands, and plausibly hundreds of thousands. ¬© 2009 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00300-008-0570-5,2-s2.0-62949087869,8,0.868969016,1,the whit chin petrel procellar aequinoct on sou georg pop siz distribut and glob sign mor whit chin petrel procellar aequinoct ar accid kil in fishery than prob any oth seabird in the world but the pop impact of thi mort is poor understood part becaus ther hav been no rec estim of the specy abund the bree aggreg on the sub antarct island of sou georg is believ to be larg than al oth combin we estim the siz of thi pop by calc the are of suit habit and the dens of occupy burrow within it som occupy nest wer estim for the island at mid incub repres mil pair of bree ag bird assocy with sou georg in the survey season and thi is of the prevy estim but stil repres wel ov half of the glob pop if the pop is declin due to fishery bycatch as is lik the scal of an mort in thi pop alon is at least in the high ten of thousand and plaus hundr of thousand,new,0.8799541028487415,0.8121889491935985,0.7494719124495558,0.6948384511138836,0.6476059519836372,0.6063356350259473,0.5696389201314824,0.536271754332253,0.5050221715439027,0.4744175421557278,0.44196136811363995
73,bird_antarctic,"Linking population trends of Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis) and fish at Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands (Antarctica)","This study aims to provide consistent information to explain the steady declining trend in the number of breeding pairs of Antarctic shag Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis in two colonies on Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, southern Atlantic sector of Antarctica, which was observed during the 1990s up to the mid 2000s over an overall monitoring period of over two decades. It addresses correspondence between long-term population trends of inshore demersal fish and inshore-feeding Antarctic shags of this area, where an intensive commercial fishery for shag prey once operated. The analysis also includes comparable information on diet (by examination of regurgitated pellets), foraging patterns, and breeding output of shags from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, an area where no commercial finfish fishery has ever existed. Integral study of these parameters there showed that, in Antarctic shags, low breeding success and high foraging effort might imply low recruitment and high adult mortality, respectively, with both factors adversely affecting the population trends of this bird. In line with these premises, the declining trend observed in shag colonies on the South Shetland Islands appears to have been influenced by the concomitant decrease in abundance of two of their main prey, the nototheniids Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons, due to intensive industrial fishing in the area in the late 1970s. In comparison, no such pattern occurred for the Danco Coast colonies. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-015-1850-5,2-s2.0-84949517452,21,0.8479249529999999,1,link pop trend of antarct shag phalacrocorax bransfieldens and fish at nelson island sou shetland island antarctic thi study aim to provid consist inform to explain the steady declin trend in the numb of bree pair of antarct shag phalacrocorax bransfieldens in two colony on nelson island sou shetland island southern atl sect of antarctic which was observ dur the s up to the mid s ov an overal monit period of ov two decad it address correspond between long term pop trend of insh demers fish and insh fee antarct shag of thi are wher an intend commerc fishery for shag prey ont op the analys also includ comp inform on diet by examin of regurgit pellet for pattern and bree output of shag from the danco coast western antarct peninsul an are wher no commerc finf fishery has ev ex integr study of thes paramet ther show that in antarct shag low bree success and high for effort might imply low recruit and high adult mort respect with both fact advers affect the pop trend of thi bird in lin with thes prem the declin trend observ in shag colony on the sou shetland island appear to hav been influ by the concomit decreas in abund of two of their main prey the nototheniid notothen rossi and gobionototh gibberifron due to intend indust fish in the are in the lat s in comparison no such pattern occur for the danco coast colony,new,0.8784833781109693,0.8322675489551705,0.794170421967834,0.7628794181513279,0.736483707089323,0.713545564080089,0.69303693422048,0.6741578668822843,0.6561748300724893,0.6381889958408772,0.618653130353068
81,bird_antarctic,Breeding biology and population dynamics of giant petrels Macronectes at South Georgia (Aves: Procellariiformes),"The breeding biology and population dynamics of the two species of giant petrels, Macronectes halli and M. giganteus, were studied at Bird Island, South Georgia during 1978‚Äì81. The mean laying date of M. halli was in early October, five to six weeks ahead of M. giganteus. In both species males take the larger share (c. 54%) of incubation. The eggs of the two species are of the same size but in M. halli the egg formed a significantly higher proportion of the female body weight. On hatching M. giganteus chicks are 5% heavier than M. halli chicks but there are no sexual differences in weight. Brooding and guarding in M. halli is 11 days longer than in M giganteus and males undertake 60‚Äì68% of the duties during this time. Males of both species take five to six days longer to fledge than females and M. halli chicks have a seven to nine day shorter fledging period. The sex ratio amongst chicks is 1: 1. Chick growth (weight, culmen length and wing length) is summarized. Males reach higher peak and fledging weights than females in both species and have significantly larger bills through most of the fledging period. The increase in wing length was similar in both sexes until near the end of the fledging period. Adult M. halli tend to be shorter‚Äêwinged, larger‚Äêbilled and lighter in weight than M. giganteus at Bird Island. Chick mortality was on average c. 10% higher in M. giganteus than in M. halli leading to a lower overall breeding success in the former. Whilst the breeding population of M. giganteus seems to have stayed relatively stable M. halli has increased in numbers over the last 20 years. However 26‚Äê9‚Äê57‚Äì5% of birds colour‚Äêringed in 1978 did not breed in the subsequent two breeding seasons. Mean annual survival of breeding adults was c. 0‚Äì90. Breeding commenced between age 6 and 9 years with males possibly starting earlier than females. The increased population of M. halli and the better survival of their chicks is attributed to the considerable increase in breeding Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella which provide an abundance of carrion for M. halli nestlings during the first 30 days after hatching.

The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding population trends were stable.

111,bird_antarctic,"Population abundance, structure and turnover estimates for leopard seals during winter dispersal combining tagging and photo-identification data","Winter dispersal in leopard seals is poorly understood because of its low density in most of its range. By combining photo-identification and tagging data from Bird Island, South Georgia, in mark-recapture models, leopard seal abundance over the winter of 2005 was estimated as 118 (95% CI: 78-179). Seasonal residents arrived earlier and stayed longer around the island (27 days; 95% CI: 23-32) and their numbers were low and stable over the winter (xÃÑ = 12; 95%CI: 5-28). Most of the seals (81; 95% CI: 31-130) were young transients, stayed only 1-7 days, and arrived later in the season. This suggests (1) very low predatory pressure upon the locally abundant prey populations; (2) two different patterns of winter movements: a winter migration in adult seals with long-term site fidelity, and large numbers of juveniles in dispersal possibly attracted by locally abundant prey colonies, and potentially influenced by increased environmental stress. ¬© 2006 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00300-006-0149-y,2-s2.0-33749858440,10,0.822431295,0,pop abund structure and turnov estim for leopard seal dur wint dispers combin tag and photo id dat wint dispers in leopard seal is poor understood becaus of it low dens in most of it rang by combin photo id and tag dat from bird island sou georg in mark recapt model leopard seal abund ov the wint of was estim as ci season resid ar ear and stay long around the island day ci and their numb wer low and stabl ov the wint xãñ ci most of the seal ci wer young transy stay on day and ar lat in the season thi suggest very low pred press upon the loc abund prey pop two diff pattern of wint mov a wint migr in adult seal with long term sit fidel and larg numb of juvenil in dispers poss attract by loc abund prey colony and pot influ by increas environ stress,new,0.8661802716293179,0.8064984779877257,0.7552352272531817,0.7122404478702608,0.6756562506434267,0.6438136446952014,0.6154205959763517,0.5894342240874036,0.5648807835877513,0.5405750752675803,0.5144694116115406
121,bird_antarctic,"Abundance and breeding of the Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata at the James Ross and Seymour Islands, NE Antarctic Peninsula","The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is experiencing rapid environmental change associated with warming and sea ice retreat, which is likely to affect locally breeding birds. Yet, contrary to the knowledge of bird biology along the maritime West coasts of the AP, there is a remarkable lack of data from the more continental East coast. We report on the distribution, abundance, and breeding of the Antarctic Tern at the James Ross and Seymour islands, the two largest snow-free areas in the NE part of the AP, where this species breeds under harsh climate conditions probably close to its limits. Terns were found breeding in most ice-free areas, with nests located up to 2. 9 km from coastlines at altitudes up to 180 m a. s. l. While the large-scale density was relatively low (c. 450 pairs per 127 km2 of surveyed ice-free area), the local density (total colony area: 3 nests per ha; nest clusters: 100-140 nests per ha) was as high as elsewhere. Mean clutch size (1. 21, n = 196) was smaller than in the west AP or in the maritime Antarctic. Daily nest survival rate during incubation varied between years and locations (mean = 0. 977; 95 % CI: 0. 966-0. 985). While both predation and weather-caused mortality were locally important, the impact of skua predation might be lower in areas with alternative prey (penguin colonies). We suggest that the Antarctic Tern deserves attention as a species potentially suitable for monitoring of environmental impacts upon bird populations around the AP. ¬© 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-012-1251-y,2-s2.0-84872613833,24,0.8214327309999999,0,abund and bree of the antarct tern stern vittat at the jam ross and seymo island ne antarct peninsul the antarct peninsul ap is expery rapid environ chang assocy with warm and sea ic ret which is lik to affect loc bree bird yet cont to the knowledg of bird biolog along the maritim west coast of the ap ther is a remark lack of dat from the mor contin east coast we report on the distribut abund and bree of the antarct tern at the jam ross and seymo island the two largest snow fre area in the ne part of the ap wher thi specy bree und harsh clim condit prob clos to it limit tern wer found bree in most ic fre area with nest loc up to km from coastlin at altitud up to m a s l whil the larg scal dens was rel low c pair per km of survey ic fre are the loc dens tot colony are nest per ha nest clust nest per ha was as high as elsewh mean clutch siz n was smal than in the west ap or in the maritim antarct dai nest surv rat dur incub vary between year and loc mean ci whil both pred and weath caus mort wer loc import the impact of sku pred might be low in area with altern prey penguin colony we suggest that the antarct tern deserv at as a specy pot suit for monit of environ impact upon bird pop around the ap,new,0.860484739747499,0.7900800926152971,0.7297314342701409,0.6796036500753454,0.6374466680488912,0.6011814184692014,0.5691856092773687,0.540146776268371,0.5128397362454084,0.4857703361120318,0.45634728062936486
131,bird_antarctic,"Breeding sites and population of seabirds on Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica","The monitoring of the status and distribution of seabird populations is necessary to understand their spatial and temporal responses to rapid climate changes occurring in the Western Antarctic Peninsula area. We surveyed and mapped Admiralty Bay bird communities and related them to climate variables‚Äîtemperature, temperature anomaly, Antarctic Oscillation Index and El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation Index. We recorded 13 breeding seabird species over three seasons (2009/2010, 2010/2011 and 2011/2012) and mapped 10 of them over an area of 149.5¬†ha. The ice-free areas with the greatest number of species were Point Thomas, Keller Peninsula and Hennequin Point. The most abundant species was the Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) followed by the Chinstrap Penguin (P. antarcticus). We observed that the number of breeding pairs of Gentoo Penguins (P. papua), Chinstrap Penguins and skuas (Catharacta maccormicki and C. antarctica) are related to temperature, temperature anomaly and El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation Index. The size of breeding populations and their distributions have been fluctuating over the last 30¬†years in ice-free areas of Admiralty Bay. Most species showed a decreasing trend from 1978 to 2012, with the exception of Chinstrap Penguins, Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes giganteus) and skuas, which seem to be stable in numbers in the last two decades.

161,bird_antarctic,Relative abundance of large whales around South Georgia (1979-1998),"To assess large-whale stocks following the cessation of land-based South Georgia whaling in 1965, we report three independent sighting databases: a cruise in 1997, observations from Bird Island (NW of South Georgia) between 1979 and 1998, and mariner sightings between 1992 and 1997. All species were rare, with sightings of southern right whales being the most common event. Two right whales photographed off South Georgia matched animals known from Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, a population known to be growing at 7% per annum. In contrast, blue and fin whales appeared to be less abundant. A single blue whale mother-calf pair was observed off the Shag Rocks in February 1997. Extirpation of animals from this particular feeding ground is the most likely reason for ongoing low numbers of all species. Other factors may include competition for krill by traditional predators such as penguins and seals and more recently by humans, an unusually high rate of natural mortality, habitat change such as alteration in sea ice coverage, and/or the impact of ongoing whaling.

181,bird_antarctic,Re-constructing historical Ad√©lie penguin abundance estimates by retrospectively accounting for detection bias,"Seabirds and other land-breeding marine predators are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because of their dependence on marine prey and the accessibility of their populations at breeding colonies. Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Ad√©lie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Ad√©lie penguin population change. Our approach is applicable to abundance data for a wide range of colonial, land-breeding marine species including other penguin species, flying seabirds and marine mammals. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0123540,2-s2.0-84929379144,2,0.800014998,1,re construct hist ad√©lie penguin abund estim by retrospect account for detect bia seabird and oth land bree marin pred ar consid to be us and pract ind of the stat of marin ecosystem becaus of their depend on marin prey and the access of their pop at bree colony hist count of bree pop of thes high ord marin pred ar on of few dat sourc avail for infer past chang in marin ecosystem howev hist abund estim der from thes pop count may be subject to unrecogn bia and uncertainty becaus of vary attend of bird at bree colony and vary tim of past pop survey we retrospect account for detect bia in hist abund estim of the colon land bree ad√©lie penguin through an analys of hist abund estim from bree sit in east antarctic the publ abund estim wer de construct to retriev the raw count dat and then re construct by apply contemp adjust fact obtain from remot op tim laps camera the re construct process incorp spat and temp vary in phenolog and attend by us dat from camera deploy at multipl sit ov multipl year and prop thi uncertainty through to the fin rev abund estim our re construct abund estim wer consist high and mor uncertain than publ estim the re construct estim alt the conclud reach for som sit in east antarctic in rec assess of long term ad√©lie penguin pop chang our approach is appl to abund dat for a wid rang of colon land bree marin specy includ oth penguin specy fly seabird and marin mam,new,0.8455846885476052,0.771183009576854,0.7057587490699657,0.6506528527044511,0.6042567733182298,0.5646900313174689,0.5303730722916725,0.5000305629541066,0.4725689930876551,0.446869285035812,0.4213295583246857
191,bird_antarctic,Long-term population trends in seven Antarctic seabirds at Pointe G√©ologie (Terre Ad√©lie): Human impact compared with environmental change,"Antarctic seabird populations have been much studied over the last decades as bioindicators of the nature of variability in the Southern Ocean marine ecosystem, and most attention has been focused on the role of food supply and the extent of sea ice. In addition, the rapid spread of tourism and the activities of researchers since the early 1960s have raised questions related to their real and potential impact on bird populations. Our data sets start in 1952 for several species of Antarctic seabirds and this study documents the trends over a 14-year period (1985-1999) in seven species breeding on Pointe G√©ologie archipelago (Terre Ad√©lie, Antarctica). This is the first study where the direct impact of destruction of breeding sites (for building of an airstrip) is examined and where such long-term populations trends have been assessed in such a number of Antarctic species at one site. Trends from 1985 show that for the whole archipelago and when excluding islands destroyed, Ad√©lie penguins and south polar skuas were the only species to show a significant increase (> 3.5% annual change). The others species showed opposite trends, three increasing slightly (southern fulmars + 0.4%, cape petrels + 2.3%, snow petrels + 0.9%) and two decreasing (emperor penguin - 0.9%, southern giant petrel - 3.9%). Three species particularly affected by the destruction of their breeding habitat (Ad√©lie penguin, cape petrel, snow petrel) showed the capability to restore their populations. The availability of food and nesting sites is discussed in relation to environmental change. Species feeding on krill (Ad√©lie penguins and cape petrels) increased more than other species; however, decrease of ice cover can increase availability of nesting sites. The importance of long-term studies is shown when assessing the role of human activities in Antarctica compared to larger-scale changes.",10.1007/s003000000193,2-s2.0-0035096817,43,0.799428138,1,long term pop trend in sev antarct seabird at point g√©ologie ter ad√©lie hum impact comp with environ chang antarct seabird pop hav been much study ov the last decad as bioind of the nat of vary in the southern oc marin ecosystem and most at has been focus on the rol of food supply and the ext of sea ic in addit the rapid spread of tour and the act of research sint the ear s hav rais quest rel to their real and pot impact on bird pop our dat set start in for sev specy of antarct seabird and thi study docu the trend ov a year period in sev specy bree on point g√©ologie archipelago ter ad√©lie antarctic thi is the first study wher the direct impact of destruct of bree sit for build of an airstrip is examin and wher such long term pop trend hav been assess in such a numb of antarct specy at on sit trend from show that for the whol archipelago and when exclud island destroy ad√©lie penguin and sou pol skua wer the on specy to show a sign increas an chang the oth specy show opposit trend three increas slight southern fulm cap petrel snow petrel and two decreas emp penguin southern giant petrel three specy particul affect by the destruct of their bree habit ad√©lie penguin cap petrel snow petrel show the cap to rest their pop the avail of food and nest sit is discuss in rel to environ chang specy fee on kril ad√©lie penguin and cap petrel increas mor than oth specy howev decreas of ic cov can increas avail of nest sit the import of long term study is shown when assess the rol of hum act in antarctic comp to larg scal chang,new,0.8525043604456294,0.8069722869636369,0.771712123145171,0.7443692125845628,0.7226327678109848,0.7049358003408086,0.6902777135066844,0.6780332500948508,0.667853171190071,0.6596700222251994,0.6539114265257044
201,bird_antarctic,"Krill (Euphausia superba) abundance and Ad√©lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding performance in the waters off the B√©chervaise Island colony, East Antarctica in 2 years with contrasting ecological conditions","In 2001 and 2003 small-scale acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) distribution and abundance were conducted offshore from an East Antarctic colony of Adelie penguins on Bechervaise Island (67¬∞35‚Ä≤S, 62¬∞49‚Ä≤E) that has been monitored for 15 years. Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early cr√®che stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years. Oceanographically, the two summers differed; in 2003 the mixed layer was fresher and shallower, indicating a delayed melting of sea-ice in the study area when compared to 2001. Satellite observations indicated that the pack-ice directly offshore from the Mawson coast broke out earlier in 2001 and the perennial fast-ice along the coast persisted later in 2003.

221,bird_antarctic,"Ecological drivers of change at South Georgia: The krill surplus, or climate variability","Macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are thought to be one of the most important mesopredators in the Southern Ocean having a greater impact on prey availability and abundance than any other seabird species. Their population centre has long been held to be South Georgia where populations were thought to comprise many million animals. Here we report the results of a recent census of the macaroni population at South Georgia undertaken using aerial survey methods. We report dramatic declines in numbers (~1.0 million breeding pairs) compared to numbers observed in the late 1970s (~5.4 million pairs), but show that these reductions have occurred principally at sites where numbers had previously been very large. During the breeding season, the main foraging grounds of birds from these sites overlap with the foraging grounds of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, a major competitor for their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We suggest that the redistribution of the macaroni penguin population at South Georgia reflects the recent recovery of fur seal populations and thus the ongoing consequences of human intervention at South Georgia, a process which started more than 2 centuries previously. The implied resource competition and the observed population changes may also be exacerbated by recent reductions in Antarctic krill abundance which have been linked with reductions in seasonal sea ice following recent, rapid, regional warming in the Antarctic; however, the recovery of fur seal populations, and the ongoing recovery of krill-eating whale populations argues that tropho-dynamic interactions may be sufficient to explain the observed changes. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

Seals belonged to an open population, and were sampled outside the breeding season and during their northward winter dispersal (April-October). Seals at Bird Island were highly transient (41-63%) with only a limited number of individuals making repeat visits across years. A minimum yearly survival for resident seals was estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.85. The physical environment played an important role in leopard seal abundance, with observations following an apparent 4-year periodicity consistent with the frequency and timing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. Years of low sea-surface temperature (SST) and extensive pack-ice corresponded to a higher number of seals present, earlier arrivals, and longer periods of residency. Peak leopard seal arrivals at Bird Island corresponded to periods of low SST, which was consistent with the pagophilic nature of this species.",10.1017/S0952836904005102,2-s2.0-3142639196,15,0.772810535,1,wint dispers of leopard seal hydrurg leptonyx environ fact influ demograph and season abund the dynam of leopard seal hydrurg leptonyx abund and resid wer investig both within and between year at bird island sou georg us observ of tag and untag individ seal belong to an op pop and wer sampl outsid the bree season and dur their northward wint dispers april octob seal at bird island wer high transy with on a limit numb of individ mak rep visit across year a minim year surv for resid seal was estim to be between and the phys environ play an import rol in leopard seal abund with observ follow an app year period consist with the frequ and tim of the antarct circumpol wav year of low sea surfac temp sst and extend pack ic correspond to a high numb of seal pres ear ar and long period of resid peak leopard seal ar at bird island correspond to period of low sst which was consist with the pagophil nat of thi specy,new,0.835989620777397,0.7631147932992917,0.7034497058950301,0.6556376655152351,0.6166135972727391,0.583977526375853,0.5560461087859695,0.5316145606615535,0.509752538167984,0.4896028874357566,0.47006496121221025
241,bird_antarctic,"Changes in distribution, relative abundance, and species composition of large whales around South Georgia from opportunistic sightings: 1992 to 2011","To examine the general population trends of large whales in South Georgia waters, 2 opportunistic data sets of sightings of large whales from 1991 to 2010 around South Georgia were analyzed: the South Georgia Museum log of whale sightings and the British Antarctic Survey whale sighting reports from the Bird Island research station. Bird Island abuts the northwest tip of South Georgia. The 4 most reported species in both data sets were southern right whale Eubalaena australis, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, minke whale Balaenoptera bonaerensis, and killer whale Orcinus orca. These totally independent data sets showed comparable changes in abundance through time; thus, despite a lack of sighting effort records, inferences could be drawn about changes in relative abundance. The number of reported sightings per 5 yr period from both data sets increased from the 1991 to 1995 period through the 2001 to 2005 period and has since decreased. Species composition of reported sightings has changed over time; southern right whales have become the most sighted species in both data sets, with a peak of reported sightings in the 2001 to 2005 period. Sightings were concentrated around Shag Rocks, at the northwest tip of South Georgia, and along the north/east coastlines of South Georgia; sightings in the bays around South Georgia have increased over time. In an area such as the Antarctic, which poses many difficulties when conducting research, opportunistic data sources such as these, although not ideal, can become invaluable, since such information would otherwise be unattainable. ¬© Inter-Research 2012.",10.3354/esr00471,2-s2.0-84895740260,67,0.766489187,0,chang in distribut rel abund and specy composit of larg whal around sou georg from opportun sight to to examin the gen pop trend of larg whal in sou georg wat opportun dat set of sight of larg whal from to around sou georg wer analys the sou georg muse log of whal sight and the brit antarct survey whal sight report from the bird island research stat bird island abut the northwest tip of sou georg the most report specy in both dat set wer southern right whal eubalaen aust humpback whal megapter novaeanglia mink whal balaenopter bonaerens and kil whal orcin orc thes tot independ dat set show comp chang in abund through tim thu despit a lack of sight effort record inf could be drawn about chang in rel abund the numb of report sight per yr period from both dat set increas from the to period through the to period and has sint decreas specy composit of report sight has chang ov tim southern right whal hav becom the most sight specy in both dat set with a peak of report sight in the to period sight wer cont around shag rock at the northwest tip of sou georg and along the nor east coastlin of sou georg sight in the bay around sou georg hav increas ov tim in an are such as the antarct which pos many difficul when conduc research opportun dat sourc such as thes although not id can becom invalu sint such inform would otherw be unattain,new,0.825154234550319,0.764954496565855,0.7170152851605901,0.679207728139196,0.64889771275177,0.6241812293390836,0.6038223558224182,0.587077455580685,0.5736255934926684,0.5636487907406248,0.5582977235097666

261,bird_antarctic,"Invasive american mink mustela vison in wetlands of the cape horn biosphere reserve, southern Chile: What are they eating?","The impact of alien American mink on the native fauna of oceanic islands has been demonstrated in a number of locations. In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.",10.1017/S0030605308099997,2-s2.0-67349234507,48,0.7618189879999999,0,invas am mink mustel vison in wetland of the cap horn biosph reserv southern chil what ar they eat the impact of aly am mink on the nat faun of oc island has been demonst in a numb of loc in the sub antarct cap horn biosph reserv of southern chil the specy is cur expand in an are wher the nat faun evolv in the abs of terrest pred to evalu any emerg problem we theref investig season vary in prey us by mink on navarino island within the reserv we ident undigest remain in scat collect from the shor of pond ov januarynovemb diet consist main of mam and bird mam includ both nat and exot rod wer the predomin prey in al season but bird wer of eq import dur the sum when bird bree and their abund and divers increas on the island exot rod wer the on ident mam prey item dur wint nat wetland bird constitut a subst proport of mink diet and gre than that report in oth area many bird bree on navarino island ar ground nest a strategy that evolv in the abs of nat mam pred consid the intern import of thi reg our result emphas the nee for an assess of the impact of mink pred on the pop of nat prey,new,0.8291774970882038,0.758507931309655,0.6988036491599311,0.6494758827803322,0.6082306532786512,0.5730536071917458,0.5424098281490287,0.5151187305425323,0.49018356314040035,0.4665959030221227,0.44296791689023507
271,bird_antarctic,Notes on Antarctic wildlife: Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii and emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri,"Systematic observations on birds and mammals were carried out in the 1996/97 austral summer in Antarctica while on a circumnavigation of the entire continent by the Russian icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov. A total of 22 Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii were recorded during the period 9 December 1996‚Äì16 January 1997 of that 65 day cruise, with 75% of them found in light to heavy pack ice conditions. The highest abundance was in the Riiser‚ÄêLarsen Sea (between 14¬∞E and 35¬∞E longitude). Half of the seals were observed over the shelf zone, while others were over continental slope to deep ocean. Discussion of all sea‚Äêice habitats from all sightings of Ross seals from the 1996/97 summer is presented here, along with opportunistic sightings of Ross seals from the same icebreaker in December 1992‚ÄêJanuary 1993 and in 1997/98 along the coastline from about 57¬∞E to 100¬∞E. An unusually large concentration of Ross seals was observed during an 8 h period near Gaussberg (66¬∞ 13‚Ä≤S, 89¬∞35‚Ä≤E) on 7 January 1993, when a minimum of 40 Ross seals were counted. A search for an emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri colony was made in November ‚Äê December 1997 in the area of the West Ice Shelf, where a colony at Pingvin Island was discovered in 1956 and last seen in 1960. The original population of 30 000 birds was not found, but a smaller subcolony of about 200 breeding pairs (estimated) was found, perhaps a remnant of the original colony which was forced to re‚Äêlocate because of a major breakup of West Ice Shelf in 1968. ¬© 2000 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/03014223.2000.9518219,2-s2.0-0033884750,78,0.758892454,0,not on antarct wildl ross seal ommatophoc rossi and emp penguin aptenodyt forster system observ on bird and mam wer carry out in the aust sum in antarctic whil on a circumnavig of the entir contin by the russ icebreak kapit khlebnikov a tot of ross seal ommatophoc rossi wer record dur the period decemb ‚äì janu of that day cru with of them found in light to heavy pack ic condit the highest abund was in the riiser‚äêlarsen sea between ¬∞e and ¬∞e longitud half of the seal wer observ ov the shelf zon whil oth wer ov contin slop to deep oc discuss of al sea‚äêice habit from al sight of ross seal from the sum is pres her along with opportun sight of ross seal from the sam icebreak in decemb ‚äêjanuary and in along the coastlin from about ¬∞e to ¬∞e an unus larg cont of ross seal was observ dur an h period near gaussberg ¬∞ ‚ä≤s ¬∞‚ä≤e on janu when a minim of ross seal wer count a search for an emp penguin aptenodyt forster colony was mad in novemb ‚äê decemb in the are of the west ic shelf wher a colony at pingvin island was discov in and last seen in the origin pop of bird was not found but a smal subcolony of about bree pair estim was found perhap a remn of the origin colony which was forc to re‚äêlocat becaus of a maj breakup of west ic shelf in,new,0.7825675602441834,0.7068661670646226,0.6500443659230694,0.6073803051206381,0.5744830693069761,0.5485459555449258,0.5278859412340922,0.5115590560390569,0.4992138729819754,0.49119735101856193,0.4891778089859671
281,bird_antarctic,"Fish in the diet of the Antarctic shag at four colonies on the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula","The diet of breeding Antarctic shags (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis) was investigated at four colonies on the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula, by the analysis of 616 pellets (regurgitated casts) collected from December 1997 to February 1998. Overall, demersal-benthic fish were the most frequent and important prey at all the colonies, followed by octopods and gastropods. Amongst fish, Notothenia coriiceps was the main prey in all of the sampling sites, followed in similar importance by Gobionotothen gibberifrons at Cape Herschel, Primavera Island and Midas Island and in less importance by Harpagifer antarcticus at Py Point. There were marked differences among colonies in the size of the fish consumed. The largest and the smallest specimens were eaten by shags from Midas Island and Py Point respectively. This was mainly influenced by the number of specimens of the smallest fish species, H. antarcticus, consumed at Py Point. The differences in the diet composition may be related to the different foraging areas used by the shags. Results from this study differ from previous studies around the Antarctic Peninsula. The shags at the Danco Coast preyed markedly more intensively than those at the South Shetland Islands on G. gibberifrons. This finding reflects the low abundance of this fish species in inshore waters (<100 m depth) at the South Shetland Islands and supports the use of the Antarctic shags to monitor trends in local populations of coastal fish species.",10.1017/S095410200200055X,2-s2.0-0036124287,42,0.75501984,0,fish in the diet of the antarct shag at four colony on the danco coast antarct peninsul the diet of bree antarct shag phalacrocorax bransfieldens was investig at four colony on the danco coast antarct peninsul by the analys of pellet regurgit cast collect from decemb to febru overal demers benth fish wer the most frequ and import prey at al the colony follow by octopod and gastropod amongst fish notothen coriicep was the main prey in al of the sampl sit follow in simil import by gobionototh gibberifron at cap herschel primaver island and mida island and in less import by harp antarctic at py point ther wer mark diff among colony in the siz of the fish consum the largest and the smallest specim wer eat by shag from mida island and py point respect thi was main influ by the numb of specim of the smallest fish specy h antarctic consum at py point the diff in the diet composit may be rel to the diff for area us by the shag result from thi study diff from prevy study around the antarct peninsul the shag at the danco coast prey mark mor intend than thos at the sou shetland island on g gibberifron thi find reflect the low abund of thi fish specy in insh wat m dep at the sou shetland island and support the us of the antarct shag to monit trend in loc pop of coast fish specy,new,0.8012541554898003,0.6955828741731691,0.6084004486572026,0.5396937365343921,0.4850133578040232,0.4404739657256787,0.40324852825280516,0.37127010190339893,0.3428980623589086,0.3165254485435982,0.28990392464755577
291,bird_antarctic,Invasive species and land bird diversity on remote South Atlantic islands,"Invasive species pose significant threats to biodiversity, especially on islands. They cause extinctions and population declines, yet little is known about their consequences on the emergent, metacommunity-level patterns of native species in island assemblages. We investigated differences in species-area relationships, nestedness, and occupancy of 9 species of native land birds between island assemblages with and without invasive Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in the Falkland Archipelago. We found that species-area curves, nestedness, and individual species' occurrences differed between island assemblages with and without rats. Rat-free islands had, on average, 2.1 more land bird species than rat-infested islands of similar size. Passerine bird communities on islands with and without rats were significantly nested, but nestedness was significantly higher on rat-free islands than on rat-infested islands. The presence of rats was associated with differences in the incidence of many, but not all bird species. On rat free islands the occurrence of all species increased with island area. The occurrence of most, albeit not all, bird species was lower on islands with than on islands without rats. Two species of conservation concern, Troglodytes aedon cobbi and Cinclodes antarcticus, were abundant on rat-free islands, but absent or found at very low frequencies on islands with rats. The occurrence of three species was not associated with the presence of rats. The patterns presented here can be used to evaluate the consequences of ongoing rat eradications for passerine diversity, distribution, and abundance. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10530-013-0524-x,2-s2.0-84892438011,39,0.748280673,0,invas specy and land bird divers on remot sou atl island invas specy pos sign threats to biodivers espec on island they caus extinct and pop declin yet littl is known about their consequ on the emerg metacommun level pattern of nat specy in island assembl we investig diff in specy are rel nest and occup of specy of nat land bird between island assembl with and without invas norway rat ratt norvegic in the falkland archipelago we found that specy are curv nest and individ specy occur diff between island assembl with and without rat rat fre island had on av mor land bird specy than rat infest island of simil siz passerin bird commun on island with and without rat wer sign nest but nest was sign high on rat fre island than on rat infest island the pres of rat was assocy with diff in the incid of many but not al bird specy on rat fre island the occur of al specy increas with island are the occur of most albeit not al bird specy was low on island with than on island without rat two specy of conserv concern troglodyt aedon cobb and cinclod antarctic wer abund on rat fre island but abs or found at very low frequ on island with rat the occur of three specy was not assocy with the pres of rat the pattern pres her can be us to evalu the consequ of ongo rat erad for passerin divers distribut and abund,new,0.7966003974265384,0.7094945639294132,0.6374415933163865,0.5796647408904977,0.5328662328441719,0.494205862290219,0.4616003728161327,0.43353824002329194,0.40886651154488934,0.3865941094279003,0.36558180324474243
301,bird_antarctic,"Distribution and abundance of marine bird and pinniped populations within Port Foster, Deception Island, Antarctica","Seabirds and pinnipeds were surveyed during four cruises from March 1999 to November 2000 at Port Foster, Deception Island, Antarctica. Abundances and distributions of three species of pinnipeds, Arctocephalus gazella (Antarctic fur seals), Leptonychotes weddelli (Weddell seals), and Lobodon carcinophagus (crabeater seals), and 11 species of marine birds were documented within Port Foster. A. gazella was the dominant pinniped within Port Foster; its abundance has increased since the 1986/87 austral summer season. A. gazella were concentrated at the entrance to Port Foster. More pinnipeds were observed during the austral summer than during the spring. The most dominant seabird, Pygoscelis antarctica (chinstrap penguin), was concentrated along the rocky cliffs behind the beaches where A. gazella hauled out. Larus dominicanus (kelp gull) and Daption capense (cape petrel) were the most dominant flying seabirds. All other seabird species were more widely distributed around Port Foster than P. antarctica. There was no clear trend in abundances of seabirds over the study period. It is possible that the protected area of Port Foster provides refuge for vagrants of colonies along the outer periphery of the island and as a stopover point for migrating species. ¬© 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",10.1016/S0967-0645(03)00096-1,2-s2.0-0038715818,4,0.7451123159999999,1,distribut and abund of marin bird and pinnip pop within port fost deceiv island antarctic seabird and pinnip wer survey dur four cru from march to novemb at port fost deceiv island antarctic abund and distribut of three specy of pinnip arctocephal gazell antarct fur seal leptonychot weddell weddel seal and lobodon carcinophag crab seal and specy of marin bird wer docu within port fost a gazell was the domin pinnip within port fost it abund has increas sint the aust sum season a gazell wer cont at the ent to port fost mor pinnip wer observ dur the aust sum than dur the spring the most domin seabird pygoscel antarctic chinstrap penguin was cont along the rocky cliff behind the beach wher a gazell haul out lar dominican kelp gul and dapt capens cap petrel wer the most domin fly seabird al oth seabird specy wer mor wid distribut around port fost than p antarctic ther was no clear trend in abund of seabird ov the study period it is poss that the protect are of port fost provid refug for vagr of colony along the out periphery of the island and as a stopov point for migr specy,new,0.7960490723940383,0.7257812144521844,0.6726850527678012,0.6325712670662911,0.601441131262832,0.5767096798640768,0.5568148548988503,0.5408712857789129,0.528530637890988,0.5200767480194028,0.5169765936201675
31,bird_antarctic,King penguin population threatened by Southern Ocean warming,"Seabirds are sensitive indicators of changes in marine ecosystems and might integrate and/or amplify the effects of climate forcing on lower levels in food chains. Current knowledge on the impact of climate changes on penguins is primarily based on Antarctic birds identified by using flipper bands. Although flipper bands have helped to answer many questions about penguin biology, they were shown in some penguin species to have a detrimental effect. Here, we present for a Subantarctic species, king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), reliable results on the effect of climate on survival and breeding based on unbanded birds but instead marked by subcutaneous electronic tags. We show that warm events negatively affect both breeding success and adult survival of this seabird. However, the observed effect is complex because it affects penguins at several spatio/temporal levels. Breeding reveals an immediate response to forcing during warm phases of El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation affecting food availability close to the colony. Conversely, adult survival decreases with a remote sea-surface temperature forcing (i.e., a 2-year lag warming taking place at the northern boundary of pack ice, their winter foraging place). We suggest that this time lag may be explained by the delay between the recruitment and abundance of their prey, adjusted to the particular 1-year breeding cycle of the king penguin. The derived population dynamic model suggests a 9% decline in adult survival for a 0.26¬∞C warming. Our findings suggest that king penguin populations are at heavy extinction risk under the current global warming predictions. ¬© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",10.1073/pnas.0712031105,2-s2.0-40649099856,33,0.74427518,0,king penguin pop threatened by southern oc warm seabird ar sensit ind of chang in marin ecosystem and might integr and or ampl the effect of clim forc on low level in food chain cur knowledg on the impact of clim chang on penguin is prim bas on antarct bird ident by us flip band although flip band hav help to answ many quest about penguin biolog they wer shown in som penguin specy to hav a detry effect her we pres for a subantarct specy king penguin aptenodyt patagonic rely result on the effect of clim on surv and bree bas on unband bird but instead mark by subcut electron tag we show that warm ev neg affect both bree success and adult surv of thi seabird howev the observ effect is complex becaus it affect penguin at sev spatio temp level bree rev an immedy respons to forc dur warm phas of el ni√±o southern oscil affect food avail clos to the colony convers adult surv decreas with a remot sea surfac temp forc i e a year lag warm tak plac at the northern bound of pack ic their wint for plac we suggest that thi tim lag may be explain by the delay between the recruit and abund of their prey adjust to the particul year bree cyc of the king penguin the der pop dynam model suggest a declin in adult surv for a ¬∞c warm our find suggest that king penguin pop ar at heavy extinct risk und the cur glob warm predict,new,0.7896459199756066,0.7467056676850968,0.7154952964461003,0.6924929697528907,0.6752622555805324,0.6623705854640815,0.6530365333646903,0.646946750663956,0.6442494706189988,0.6458078765653491,0.6540772711207191

331,bird_antarctic,Divergent responses of Pygoscelis penguins reveal a common environmental driver,"The responses of predators to environmental variability in the Antarctic Peninsula region have exhibited divergent patterns owing to variation in the geographic settings of colonies and predator life-history strategies. Five breeding colonies of Pygoscelis penguins from King George Island and Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were examined to (1) compare the responses of sympatric congeners to recent changes in their Antarctic ecosystem and (2) assess underlying causes for such responses. We used linear regression and correlation analyses to compare indices of abundance, recruitment, and summer breeding performance of the Ad√©lie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica). Breeding colonies of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins have declined by roughly 50% since the mid-1970s, and recruitment indices of Ad√©lie penguins have declined by roughly 80%, but no such patterns are evident for gentoo penguins. Fledging success, however, has remained stable at all breeding colonies. The different trends in abundance and recruitment indices for each species, despite generally similar indices of summer performance, suggest that winter conditions contribute to the divergent responses among the penguins. In particular, strong correlations between indices of penguin and krill recruitment suggest that penguins in the South Shetland Islands may live under an increasingly krill-limited system that has disproportionate effects on the survival of juvenile birds. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00442-007-0781-4,2-s2.0-34548590212,25,0.73186728,1,diverg respons of pygoscel penguin rev a common environ driv the respons of pred to environ vary in the antarct peninsul reg hav exhibit diverg pattern ow to vary in the geograph set of colony and pred lif hist strategies fiv bree colony of pygoscel penguin from king georg island and livingston island sou shetland island antarctic wer examin to comp the respons of symp cong to rec chang in their antarct ecosystem and assess und caus for such respons we us linear regress and correl analys to comp ind of abund recruit and sum bree perform of the ad√©lie p adelia gentoo p papu and chinstrap penguin p antarctic bree colony of ad√©lie and chinstrap penguin hav declin by rough sint the mid s and recruit ind of ad√©lie penguin hav declin by rough but no such pattern ar evid for gentoo penguin fledg success howev has remain stabl at al bree colony the diff trend in abund and recruit ind for each specy despit gen simil ind of sum perform suggest that wint condit contribut to the diverg respons among the penguin in particul strong correl between ind of penguin and kril recruit suggest that penguin in the sou shetland island may liv und an increas kril limit system that has disproport effect on the surv of juvenil bird,new,0.7650308224595467,0.7048111344222002,0.6623756946332822,0.6323952912182427,0.6108387433309425,0.5953710881975127,0.5847567206765065,0.5785160621199633,0.5768941588886848,0.581244742443478,0.5954014157874835
34,bird_antarctic,Relics: penguin population programs.,"What has been responsible for the increase in Chinstrap penguin populations during the past 40 years in maritime Antarctica? One view ascribes it to an increase in availability of their prey brought on by the decrease in baleen whale stocks. The contrary opinion, attributes it to environmental warming. This causes a gradual decrease in the frequency of cold years with extensive winter sea ice cover. A number of penguin monitoring programs are in progress and are expected to provide some answers to these questions. Unfortunately, it is not easy to distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic change since penguins are easily accessible predators of krill and the feeding range of the penguins has almost overlapped with the krill fishery in time and space in the last four decades. Therefore it is important to reconstruct the change of ancient penguin abundance and distribution in the absence of human activity. Many efforts have focused on surveying the abandoned penguin rookeries, but this method has not been able to give a continuous historical record of penguin populations. In several recent studies, ancient penguin excreta was scooped from the penguin relics in the sediments of the lake on penguin rookery, Ardley Island, maritime Antarctica. In these studies, penguin droppings or guano soil deposited in the lake and changes in sediment geochemistry have been used to calculate penguin population changes based upon the geochemical composition of the sediment core. The results suggest that climate change has a significant impact on penguin populations.",10.3184/003685001783239078,2-s2.0-0035222712,74,0.728037947,0,rel penguin pop program what has been respons for the increas in chinstrap penguin pop dur the past year in maritim antarctic on view ascrib it to an increas in avail of their prey brought on by the decreas in baleen whal stock the cont opin attribut it to environ warm thi caus a grad decreas in the frequ of cold year with extend wint sea ic cov a numb of penguin monit program ar in progress and ar expect to provid som answ to thes quest unfortun it is not easy to distinct nat vary from anthropog chang sint penguin ar easy access pred of kril and the fee rang of the penguin has almost overlap with the kril fishery in tim and spac in the last four decad theref it is import to reconstruct the chang of ant penguin abund and distribut in the abs of hum act many effort hav focus on survey the abandon penguin rookery but thi method has not been abl to giv a continu hist record of penguin pop in sev rec study ant penguin excret was scoop from the penguin rel in the sedy of the lak on penguin rookery ardley island maritim antarctic in thes study penguin drop or guano soil deposit in the lak and chang in sedy geochem hav been us to calc penguin pop chang bas upon the geochem composit of the sedy cor the result suggest that clim chang has a sign impact on penguin pop,new,0.7513808366265481,0.7216257299730627,0.7035902273949523,0.692770064986651,0.6867618100071782,0.6844204012495949,0.6853052236613228,0.6894849947597638,0.6976029222232206,0.711286479662818,0.7343873825493374
38,bird_antarctic,Moving polewards in winter: A recent change in the migratory strategy of a pelagic seabird?,"Background: During the non-breeding period, many birds migrate to milder areas, found closer to the equator than their breeding sites. Opposite movements are very rare. In the Southern Ocean, the abundance of 13C declines markedly with more southern latitude, providing a characteristic 13C isoscape. This can be used as a tracer for the movement of seabirds between breeding and inter-breeding areas, by comparing stable isotope ratios of feathers grown at different times of the year.Results: We studied seasonal movements of Thin-billed prions (Aves, Procellariiformes), breeding at the Subantarctic Falkland/Malvinas Islands, compared with those of Wilson's storm-petrels breeding in the Antarctic South Shetland Islands. The two species showed opposite migratory movements. While Wilson's storm-petrels moved to warmer waters north of the Drake Passage in winter, Thin-billed prions showed a reversed movement towards more polar waters. Carbon stable isotope ratios in recent and historical feathers indicated that poleward winter movements of Thin-billed prions were less common historically (45% in 1913-1915), and have only recently become dominant (92% in 2003-2005), apparently in response to warming sea temperatures.Conclusions: This study shows that pelagic seabirds can rapidly change migration strategies within populations, including migration towards more poleward waters in winter. ¬© 2010 Quillfeldt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1742-9994-7-15,2-s2.0-77952318707,13,0.702034278,0,mov poleward in wint a rec chang in the migr strategy of a pel seabird background dur the non bree period many bird migr to mild area found clos to the equ than their bree sit opposit mov ar very rar in the southern oc the abund of c declin mark with mor southern latitud provid a charact c isoscap thi can be us as a trac for the mov of seabird between bree and int bree area by comp stabl isotop ratio of feath grown at diff tim of the year result we study season mov of thin bil prion av procellariiform bree at the subantarct falkland malvina island comp with thos of wilson s storm petrel bree in the antarct sou shetland island the two specy show opposit migr mov whil wilson s storm petrel mov to warm wat nor of the drak pass in wint thin bil prion show a revers mov toward mor pol wat carbon stabl isotop ratio in rec and hist feath ind that poleward wint mov of thin bil prion wer less common hist in and hav on rec becom domin in app in respons to warm sea temp conclud thi study show that pel seabird can rapid chang migr strategies within pop includ migr toward mor poleward wat in wint,new,0.7453973242234384,0.6688431099810713,0.6117929774460527,0.5696768982590138,0.5381136830655454,0.514219502227693,0.4962693053559911,0.4833652096355311,0.4753282799896117,0.47294882800838345,0.4789489503779912

We used remote sensing technology to estimate relative adult bird abundance at two inaccessible emperor penguin colonies in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. We performed supervised classification of 12 panchromatic satellite images of the seven known Ross Sea colonies. We used regression to predict adult bird counts at the inaccessible colonies by relating the number of pixels classified as ""penguin"" in the satellite images of the accessible colonies to corresponding known adult bird counts from aerial photographs or ground counts. While our analysis was hampered by excessive guano and shadows, we used satellite imagery to differentiate between relatively small (<3,000 adult birds) and larger colonies (>5,000 adult birds). Remote sensing technology is logistically less intense and less costly than aerial or ground censuses when the objective is to document penguin presence and/or large emperor penguin population changes (e.g., catastrophic changes).

The most common seabird species observed during the year were the Black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys and the Southern giant-petrel Macronectes giganteus. The seasonal structure of the assemblages presented differences between summer and winter. In terms of abundance, Black-browed albatrosses presented the highest contribution to the assemblage in summer (87.5%).

46,bird_antarctic,Warming effects in the western Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem: The role of population dynamic models for explaining and predicting penguin trends,"The western Antarctica Peninsula and Scotia Sea ecosystems appear to be driven by complex links between climatic variables, primary productivity, krill and Avian predators. There are several studies reporting statistical relationships between climate, krill and Penguin population size. The Ad√©lie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap (P. antarctica) and Gentoo (P. papua) penguins appear to be influenced by interannual variability in sea-ice extent and krill biomass. In this paper we developed simple conceptual models to decipher the role of climate and krill fluctuations on the population dynamics of these three Pygoscelis penguin species inhabiting the Antarctic Peninsula region. Our results suggest that the relevant processes underlying the population dynamics of these penguin species at King George Island (South Shetland Islands) are intra-specific competition and the combined effects of krill abundance and sea-ice cover. Our results using population theoretical models appear to support that climate change, specifically regional warming on the western Antarctic Peninsula, represents a major driver. At our study site, penguins showed species-specific responses to climate change. While Chinstrap penguins were only influenced by krill abundance, the contrasting population trends of Ad√©lie and Gentoo penguins appear to be better explained by the ""sea-ice hypothesis"".

72,bird_antarctic,Chemosensory and thermal cue responses in the sub-Antarctic moth Pringleophaga marioni: Do caterpillars choose Wandering Albatross nest proxies?,"On the South Indian Ocean Province Islands of the sub-Antarctic, most nutrients are processed through a detritus-based food web. On Marion Island, larvae of the moth Pringleophaga marioni are one of the key decomposers. Abundance of these caterpillars is higher in newly abandoned Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) nests than other habitats, and this observation has been explained by hypotheses regarding the thermal and nutrient advantages of nests. These hypotheses require a mechanism for increasing the abundance of caterpillars, since nests are an ephemeral resource, and here, we determine whether caterpillars respond to chemosensory and thermal cues using a laboratory choice chamber approach. Caterpillars show no significant preference for newly abandoned nest material over no other choice, old nest material, and the common mire moss Sanionia uncinata. Caterpillars that are acclimated to warm (15 ¬∞C) conditions do prefer lower (5 ¬∞C) to higher (15 ¬∞C) temperatures, perhaps reflecting negative effects of prolonged exposure to warm temperatures on growth. Caterpillars also show significant avoidance of conspecifics, possibly because of incidental cannibalism previously reported in this species. Thus, we find no empirical support for nest-finding ability in caterpillars based on chemosensory or thermal cues. It is possible that adult females or very early instar caterpillars show such ability, or high caterpillar density and biomass in nests are an incidental consequence of better conditions in the nests or deposition by the birds during nest construction. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-014-1457-2,2-s2.0-84895810574,26,0.539957042,0,chemosens and therm cue respons in the sub antarct moth pringleophag marion do caterpill choos wand albatross nest proxy on the sou ind oc provint island of the sub antarct most nutry ar process through a detrit bas food web on mar island larva of the moth pringleophag marion ar on of the key decompos abund of thes caterpill is high in new abandon wand albatross diomede ex nest than oth habit and thi observ has been explain by hypothes regard the therm and nutry adv of nest thes hypothes requir a mech for increas the abund of caterpill sint nest ar an ephem resourc and her we determin wheth caterpill respond to chemosens and therm cue us a lab cho chamb approach caterpill show no sign pref for new abandon nest mat ov no oth cho old nest mat and the common mir moss sanion uncinat caterpill that ar acclim to warm ¬∞c condit do pref low ¬∞c to high ¬∞c temp perhap reflect neg effect of prolong expos to warm temp on grow caterpill also show sign avoid of conspec poss becaus of incid cannib prevy report in thi specy thu we find no empir support for nest find abl in caterpill bas on chemosens or therm cue it is poss that adult fem or very ear inst caterpill show such abl or high caterpill dens and biomass in nest ar an incid consequ of bet condit in the nest or deposit by the bird dur nest construct,new,0.5360961544348207,0.48677404729193724,0.45628919998022227,0.4376256457719174,0.4270039470098486,0.4226053390599643,0.4238031980606812,0.4309350104375976,0.4455522417235635,0.4714923213351978,0.5179964614238038
82,bird_antarctic,Spatiotemporal heterogeneity in recruitment of larval parasites to shore crab intermediate hosts: The influence of shorebird definitive hosts,"Parasitism is a major biotic determinant of animal population dynamics and community structure. Temporal and spatial heterogeneity in parasitism is commonly observed in intermediate host populations. Understanding the causes of temporal and spatial variation in the recruitment of parasites is crucial if we are to manage host populations and animal communities effectively. Here, the temporal and spatial dynamics of Profilicollis antarcticus and Profilicollis novaezelandensis (Acanthocephala) infections in three species of shore crabs (Macrophthalmus hirtipes, Hemigrapsus edwardsii, and Hemigrapsus crenulatus) are examined in relation to the distribution and abundance of shorebird definitive hosts. Temporal patterns of infection were observed in M. hirtipes but not the other two species.

112,bird_australasia,"Population status, breeding and ecology of Chatham Island tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae chathamensis)","Status, breeding, and foraging of Chatham Island tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae chathamensis) were studied on Rangatira Island, Chatham Islands between January 1995 and May 1999, with short visits made to adjacent Pitt Island throughout this period. The total population was estimated at ‚âà260 adults. Most birds were resident on Rangatira Island in spring, summer and autumn but moved to Pitt Island during the winter. In spring birds commuted between the two islands but became resident on Rangatira when breeding commenced. Radio transmitters were attached to adult tui to monitor breeding. No radio-tagged female bred (n = 13) but at least two of three radio-tagged males raised young. Adult tui were intolerant of disturbance during nesting so estimation of productivity was made by mapping the number of fledgling groups. Flax (Phormium tenax) nectar appeared to be the most important food for breeding tui and birds travelled long distances to visit flowering plants. Fruits of ngaio (Myoporum laetum), matipo (Myrsine chathamica), karamu (Coprosma chathamica), mahoe (Melicytus chathamicus) and muehlenbeckia (Muehlenbeekia australis) were also important foods. Invertebrates were most important when females were feeding their young. The amount of breeding that occurred each season was directly related to the abundance of flax flowers in spring, and in good flax flowering years tui were able to rear two broods. In poor flax flowering years many birds did not breed. Control of feral cats on Pitt Island would most likely result in a significant increase in this breeding population; however planting of flax adjacent to the the forest areas on Chatham Island along with predator control may be necessary before tui can re-establish there. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc. 2004.",,2-s2.0-11344252452,83,0.865944672,1,pop stat bree and ecolog of chatham island tui prosthemader novaeseelandia chathamens stat bree and for of chatham island tui prosthemader novaeseelandia chathamens wer study on rangatir island chatham island between janu and may with short visit mad to adjac pit island throughout thi period the tot pop was estim at ‚âà adult most bird wer resid on rangatir island in spring sum and autumn but mov to pit island dur the wint in spring bird commut between the two island but becam resid on rangatir when bree com radio transmit wer attach to adult tui to monit bree no radio tag fem bred n but at least two of three radio tag mal rais young adult tui wer intol of disturb dur nest so estim of produc was mad by map the numb of fledgl group flax phorm tenax nect appear to be the most import food for bree tui and bird travel long dist to visit flow plant fruit of ngaio myopor laet matipo myrsin chathamic karamu coprosm chathamic maho melicyt chathamic and muehlenbeck muehlenbeek aust wer also import food invertebr wer most import when fem wer fee their young the amount of bree that occur each season was direct rel to the abund of flax flow in spring and in good flax flow year tui wer abl to rear two brood in poor flax flow year many bird did not bree control of fer cat on pit island would most lik result in a sign increas in thi bree pop howev plant of flax adjac to the the forest area on chatham island along with pred control may be necess bef tui can re est ther,new,0.8903978259904245,0.8449060164328721,0.805313446259345,0.7718859956466504,0.7434406522759821,0.718801893468475,0.6970414457990272,0.6774383111173838,0.6594007616506617,0.6423302813214605,0.6254651478128962
212,bird_australasia,"Distribution and numbers of waders in New Zealand, 1983-1994","Population sizes and distribution of waders in New Zealand were determined for the first time during summer and winter, 1983-1994. In winter (June/early July), 163 000 New Zealand breeding and 21 000 Arctic migrant waders were recorded, and in summer (November/early December) 37 000 New Zealand breeding and 166 000 Arctic migrant waders were recorded. Species accounts, including seasonal totals for each year 1983-1994, average counts at favoured sites, and distribution maps are presented for the most abundant New Zealand breeding and Arctic migrant waders. The Pied Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus was the most abundant New Zealand breeding wader; the estimated winter total of over 112 000 birds showed that the population had increased by about 128% since 1970-71. Counts of Pied Stilt Himantopus bimantopus (estimated winter total c. 28 000 birds) and Banded Dotterel Charadrius bicinctus (c. 11 000 birds) provided the first population estimates for these species during winter in New Zealand. However, both are significantly underestimated because many overwinter inland in sites not counted. Also, most of the Banded Dotterel population migrates to Australia following the breeding season. Wrybill Anarhychus frontalis (c. 3900 birds) was next most abundant native species counted in winter, with most birds recorded in the North Island. Counts of Spur-winged Plover Vanellus miles, Variable Oystercatcher Haematopus unicolor, New Zealand Dotterel Charadrius obscurus, Black-fronted Dotterel Charadrius melanops, and Black Stilt H. novaezelandiae also substantially underestimated population sizes because most birds of these species do not use estuarine sites during winter. During summer, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Lesser Knot Calidris canutus, and Turnstone Arenaria interpres were the most abundant of the Northern Hemisphere migrants with estimated populations of c. 102 000, 59 000 and 5100 birds, respectively, representing significant proportions of the East Asian-Australasian flyway populations of these species. Less than 700 birds were recorded during summer for each of the other Northern Hemisphere migrants, including (in decreasing order of abundance) Pacific Golden Plover Pluvialis fulva, Red-necked Stint Calidris rufcollis, Whimbrel Numentus phaeopus, Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea, Sharp-tailed Sandpiper C. acuminata, and Eastern Curlew N. madagascariensis.

Sixty-eight colonies were found of which 51 contained 5-20 nests, 12 21-50 nests, and 5 >50 nests. Altogether there were 2112 nests which equates to a population of c. 5870 birds. Adding the estimated 1650 nests on Motunau Island gave a total population for the subspecies of c. 10,460 birds. The colonies were distributed right around the peninsula with their occurrence increasing from west to east. Most were situated either on the peripheral coast (47%) or inside bays within 1 km of their entrance (38%). All but three of the colonies were on debris slopes below coastal bluffs with the nests concentrated mainly in rock piles. One colony was on an islet, and the other two were on farmland around the heads of bays. Thirty-four of the colonies were considered accessible to introduced mammalian predators, and 14 contained evidence predators had been present.

49,bird_australasia,"Land birds on barrow island: Status, population estimates, and responses to an oil-field development","A census of land birds on Barrow Island, Western Australia was carried out during September and October 2001. A total of 178 transects was conducted in six major vegetation zones, with 777 individuals of 16 species of birds recorded. The six most common species, in order of their abundance, were Spinifexbird (Eremiornis carteri), White-winged Fairy-wren (Malurus leucopterus), Singing Honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), White-breasted Woodswallow (Artamus leucorynchus), Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and Welcome Swallow (Hirundo neoxena). Our total population estimates for these species were generally comparable to those of a survey of Barrow Island in 1976 (Sedgwick 1978), but some differences existed for these and other species. In an analysis of habitat preferences, more complex vegetation zones supported more species. The density of both Spinifexbirds and Singing Honeyeaters was significantly correlated with the number of emergent shrubs. Also, across vegetation zones, the number of different bird species was correlated with the maximum height of vegetation in a habitat. Species richness and numbers of individuals were compared between natural areas, areas surrounding oil pads, and along roadsides. There was no significant difference in species richness across these three areas, but there was a significant increase in number of individuals along road sides. This latter result occurred because disturbed areas along roadsides were colonized by a large species of spinifex, Triodia angusta, which supported greater numbers of birds than other species of spinifex away from roads. The oil-field development on Barrow Island occupies approximately 4% of the land area on the island and appears, at present, to have had a relatively minor impact on the populations of land birds. This conclusion is qualified in that several species of insectivorous birds have declined in numbers over the last 25 years, and the reasons for these declines are not yet known. ¬© Royal Society of Western Australia 2004.",,2-s2.0-23844458192,84,0.839548995,1,land bird on barrow island stat pop estim and respons to an oil field develop a cens of land bird on barrow island western austral was carry out dur septemb and octob a tot of transect was conduc in six maj veget zon with individ of specy of bird record the six most common specy in ord of their abund wer spinifexbird eremiorn carter whit wing fairy wren malur leucopter sing honey lichenostom viresc whit breast woodswallow artam leucorynch zebr finch taeniopyg guttat and welcom swallow hirundo neoxen our tot pop estim for thes specy wer gen comp to thos of a survey of barrow island in sedgwick but som diff ex for thes and oth specy in an analys of habit pref mor complex veget zon support mor specy the dens of both spinifexbird and sing honey was sign correl with the numb of emerg shrubs also across veget zon the numb of diff bird specy was correl with the maxim height of veget in a habit specy rich and numb of individ wer comp between nat area area surround oil pad and along roadsid ther was no sign diff in specy rich across thes three area but ther was a sign increas in numb of individ along road sid thi lat result occur becaus disturb area along roadsid wer colon by a larg specy of spinifex triod angust which support gre numb of bird than oth specy of spinifex away from road the oil field develop on barrow island occupy approxim of the land are on the island and appear at pres to hav had a rel min impact on the pop of land bird thi conclud is qual in that sev specy of insect bird hav declin in numb ov the last year and the reason for thes declin ar not yet known,new,0.8863919281331816,0.8346222168014682,0.7887826439021198,0.7490640231134718,0.7141172426015104,0.6825814006265163,0.653273322950062,0.6250662090751469,0.5966377305950394,0.5659426253256343,0.5288940685180183
52,bird_australasia,"Trends in relative abundance of the eastern curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) in Darwin, Northern Territory","The Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) has recently been uplisted to Critically Endangered under Australian Government legislation due to an ongoing decline of the species population on its non-breeding grounds. Declines have been reported from nearly all monitored sites along the coastline of Australia and at some, local extinction is predicted within the next thirty years. In contrast, numbers recorded at two sites in the Darwin region appear to have increased in the same period. Since 1980 numbers at Lee Point have increased by 9% per year (SE = 2%); at East Arm Wharf in Darwin Harbour, the annual population increase was 17% per year (SE = 9%) for the period of 2009-2015. This local increase over time may reflect changes in bird roosting behaviour and an increase in suitable high tide roosting habitat. The consistent use of an artificial site at East Arm Wharf is promising for adaptive management of the species and other shorebirds that are threatened by the effects of habitat loss along coastlines. ¬© 2015, Australasian Wader Studies Group.

62,bird_australasia,Collapse of an avifauna: Climate change appears to exacerbate habitat loss and degradation,"We characterized changes in reporting rates and abundances of bird species over a period of severe rainfall deficiency and increasing average temperatures. We also measured flowering in eucalypts, which support large numbers of nectarivores characteristic of the region. Location A 30,000-km2 region of northern Victoria, Australia, consisting of limited amounts of remnant native woodlands embedded in largely agricultural landscapes. Methods There were three sets of monitoring studies, pitched at regional (survey programmes in 1995-97, 2004-05 and 2006-08), landscape (2002-03 and 2006-07) and site (1997-2008 continuously) scales. Bird survey techniques used a standard 2-ha, 20-min count method. We used Bayesian analyses of reporting rates to document statistically changes in the avifauna through time at each spatial scale. Results Bird populations in the largest remnants of native vegetation (up to 40,000 ha), some of which have been declared as national parks in the past decade, experienced similar declines to those in heavily cleared landscapes. All categories of birds (guilds based on foraging substrate, diet, nest site; relative mobility; geographical distributions) were affected similarly. We detected virtually no bird breeding in the latest survey periods. Eucalypt flowering has declined significantly over the past 12 years of drought. Main conclusions Declines in the largest woodland remnants commensurate with those in cleared landscapes suggest that reserve systems may not be relied upon to sustain species under climate change. We attribute population declines to low breeding success due to reduced food. Resilience of bird populations in this woodland system might be increased by active management to enhance habitat quality in existing vegetation and restoration of woodland in the more fertile parts of landscapes. ¬© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00578.x,2-s2.0-67149090802,53,0.81841238,1,collaps of an avifaun clim chang appear to exacerb habit loss and degrad we charact chang in report rat and abund of bird specy ov a period of sev rainfal deficy and increas av temp we also meas flow in eucalypt which support larg numb of nect charact of the reg loc a km reg of northern victor austral consist of limit amount of remn nat woodland embed in larg agricult landscap method ther wer three set of monit study pitch at reg survey program in and landscap and and sit continu scal bird survey techn us a standard ha min count method we us bayes analys of report rat to docu stat chang in the avifaun through tim at each spat scal result bird pop in the largest remn of nat veget up to ha som of which hav been decl as nat park in the past decad expery simil declin to thos in heavy clear landscap al categ of bird guild bas on for subst diet nest sit rel mobl geograph distribut wer affect simil we detect virt no bird bree in the latest survey period eucalypt flow has declin sign ov the past year of drought main conclud declin in the largest woodland remn commens with thos in clear landscap suggest that reserv system may not be rely upon to sustain specy und clim chang we attribut pop declin to low bree success due to reduc food resy of bird pop in thi woodland system might be increas by act man to enh habit qual in ex veget and rest of woodland in the mor fertil part of landscap,new,0.8718941942296978,0.8449175687630021,0.8241838672680657,0.8078845976199014,0.7946843024284812,0.7837216924608146,0.774434863144512,0.7664388719305405,0.7594386027576164,0.7531594976176544,0.7472350721247919

In addition, several annotated bird lists have been published since 1905. Over the period 1905 to 2007, 101 species have been recorded from the island, including 41 species of vagrant (species rarely seen with no pattern of occurrence) that have not changed in status over the 102 years. Of the 60 species recorded as part of the island's avifauna, 24 have apparently not changed in status over that period. Thirty-five species have changed in status and/or abundance, including nine species of transequatorial migrant; all Charadriiformes. Seven of these species were formerly absent or vagrants but now are regular visitors, several possibly as a result of range extensions. Two species of transequatorial migrant, formerly regarded as members of the island's avifauna, have become vagrants. Six passerine and one non-passerine species have resident populations that are isolated on the island with no populations on the adjacent mainland. Populations of three of these species are sufficiently different from mainland populations to constitute conservation management units. Rottnest Island is managed as a holiday resort.

83,bird_australasia,Cyclonic and anthropogenic influences on tern populations,"Organisms can be strongly affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic stressors in conjunction, making comprehensive assessments of multiple potential drivers of population dynamics essential. An 18-year dataset obtained for Michaelmas Cay in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, was used to assess population trends for three tern species relative to two potential threatening processes, namely human impacts (as either commercial fishing or tourism) and cyclone activity. We found a positive, 2-year lagged relationship between long-line catch per unit effort in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery in the vicinity of Michaelmas Cay and breeding participation in the two pelagic foraging terns, but not in the inshore foraging tern. The abundance of large pelagic fish may influence recruitment into the breeding populations of the two pelagic terns in the following years through impacts on prey availability. Long-term population trends for all seabirds were not related to localised direct disturbance from cyclones or associated changes in cay size and/or nesting habitat. Current management protocols in place for the tourism industry at the cay appear to be minimising direct human impacts.

The estimated number of Brant, corrected for birds not seen by observers, was 2756 ¬± 413 (standard error) (0.56 ¬± 0.08 birds/km2 on 4930 km2) at the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula - Mackenzie Delta and 3176 ¬± 588 (37.81 ¬± 7.00 birds/km2 on 84 km2) at Campbell Island - Smoke-Moose Delta in Liverpool Bay. Another 76-225 Brant were found on small islands in western Liverpool Bay just outside the survey strata. Thus, the total population estimate for the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, Mackenzie Delta, and western Liverpool Bay was 6100 birds. Numbers of Brant at western Liverpool Bay have apparently increased since the 1970s or 1980s. Several hundred Black Brant also nest at the Anderson River delta (just east of our survey area), where numbers appear to have declined substantially since the 1970s or earlier. Recaptures of banded Brant suggest that some breeding individuals may have shifted from Anderson River to western Liverpool Bay (approximately 70 km west). Significant numbers of previously marked Black Brant were recaptured during banding drives in 1990-1998, and this information provided a Jolly-Seber estimate, which included both survey strata and Anderson River, of 6211 ¬± 868 Brant. The proportion of young birds among flocks captured during banding drives varied greatly from year to year (from 8% to 54% young), indicating that annual reproductive success was quite variable and sometimes low.

113,bird_australasia,"Breeding behaviour and ecology of the sexually size-dimorphic brown songlark, Cinclorhamphus cruralis","The Australian endemic brown songlark, Cinclorhamphus cruralis, is one of the most sexually size-dimorphic of all birds, and yet its breeding ecology remains poorly documented. Here we redress this situation by describing the breeding activities of brown songlarks over three years (1998-2000) in the semi-arid grasslands of south-western New South Wales. Study populations of this nomadic species were selected in late August of each year on the basis of high adult abundance. Adult males at these sites were, on average, 2.3 times heavier than females. Over the three seasons, nesting activities started in early to late August and continued until early November or December. Males were highly polygynous and, on average, occupied territories of about 4.0 ha. Nests were well concealed at the base of small shrubs and grass tussocks or in thick herbage. Clutches ranged in size from 2 to 5 eggs (mean 3.2) and were incubated exclusively by the female for 11-13 days (mean 12.1). Nestlings received a range of invertebrate prey, mainly from the female, for 10-14 days (mean 11.5) before leaving the nest. Only 17% of nesting attempts were estimated to be successful, and each of these nests produced an average of 2.7 fledglings. Predators, including foxes, Vulpes vulpes, and brown snakes, Pseudonaja textilis, were the main cause of nest failure. Some females produced replacement clutches following nest failure, while others laid second clutches after the success of an earlier brood. We speculate that extreme size dimorphism has evolved in this species because (i) males compete physically for breeding territories, and (ii) habitat heterogeneity and excellent visibility of their surroundings allow some males to defend territories of sufficient size to support nesting by multiple females.",10.1071/ZO03034,2-s2.0-1042302427,80,0.79665272,0,bree behavio and ecolog of the sex siz dimorph brown songlark cinclorhamph crur the aust endem brown songlark cinclorhamph crur is on of the most sex siz dimorph of al bird and yet it bree ecolog remain poor docu her we redress thi situ by describ the bree act of brown songlark ov three year in the sem arid grassland of sou western new sou wal study pop of thi nomad specy wer select in lat august of each year on the bas of high adult abund adult mal at thes sit wer on av tim heavy than fem ov the three season nest act start in ear to lat august and continu until ear novemb or decemb mal wer high polygyn and on av occupy territ of about ha nest wer wel cont at the bas of smal shrubs and grass tussock or in thick herb clutch rang in siz from to eg mean and wer incub exclud by the fem for day mean nestl receiv a rang of invertebr prey main from the fem for day mean bef leav the nest on of nest attempt wer estim to be success and each of thes nest produc an av of fledgl pred includ fox vulp vulp and brown snak pseudonaj textil wer the main caus of nest fail som fem produc replac clutch follow nest fail whil oth laid second clutch aft the success of an ear brood we spec that extrem siz dimorph has evolv in thi specy becaus i mal compet phys for bree territ and ii habit heterog and excel vis of their surround allow som mal to defend territ of sufficy siz to support nest by multipl fem,new,0.8265611724043261,0.7823089830474723,0.7466250424161632,0.7179461883267588,0.6946411347473437,0.6755489929265992,0.659941653202596,0.6474641350375773,0.6381765711536422,0.6328026615450619,0.6336320042311725

132,bird_australasia,The importance of eastern China for shorebirds during the non-breeding season,"China is located centrally in the East AsianAustralasian Flyway, and a large proportion of the migratory shorebird population of the Flyway uses its extensive wetlands during migration. However, little is known about the abundance and distribution of shorebirds in China during the non-breeding season. In the non-breeding seasons of 200203 to 200607 we surveyed shorebirds in coastal and inland areas of eastern China, covering an estimated 2500km of inland waterways and 3500km of coastline. We document the abundance and distribution of the main species of shorebirds occurring in the region during the non-breeding season, and present the first population estimates for this period, discuss the accuracy of published population estimates of the Flyway, and describe extensions of range of some species. The total shorebird population in eastern China during the non-breeding season is likely to exceed 1million birds. There were sufficient data for satisfactory population estimates to be made for six of the 27 different species encountered during the surveys (Pied Avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta; Grey Plover, Pluvialis squatarola; Kentish Plover, Charadrius alexandrinus; Eurasian Curlew, Numenius arquata; Spotted Redshank, Tringa erythropus; and Dunlin, Calidris alpina), and suggestions are made for reviews of the population estimates in the Flyway of four of these species and of the Eurasian Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), one of the less common species encountered.

141,bird_australasia,"Waterbird population changes in the wetlands at chongming dongtan in the yangtze river estuary, China","We studied the changes in wetland habitats and waterbird communities between the 1980s and the 2000s at Chongming Dongtan, a Ramsar site in the Yangtze River estuary, an ecologically important region. This region is an important stopover site for shorebirds along the East Asian-Australasian flyway and is extensively used by waterfowl. A net loss of 11% of the wetland area was estimated during study periods at Chongming Dongtan. The change was dependent on wetland types: while the area of artificial habitats such as paddy fields and aquacultural ponds more than doubled, more than 65% of natural habitats including sea bulrush (Scirpus mariqueter) and common reed (Phragmites australis) marshes were lost over the two decades. An exotic plant species introduced from North America, smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), occupied 30% of the vegetated intertidal zone by the 2000s. Although waterbird species richness did not change between the 1980s (110) and the 2000s (111), 13 species found in 1980s were replaced by 14 newly recorded species. Moreover, there were more species with declining trends (58) than with increasing trends (19). The population trends of species were affected by residential status and habitat types. Transients, wintering migrants, and habitat specialists were more likely to show declining trends compared to those breeding at Dongtan (including year-round and summer residents) and habitat generalists. Furthermore, species associated mainly with natural wetlands were more likely to decline than those associated mainly with artificial wetlands. These patterns suggest that the loss and change of wetland habitats at Chongming Dongtan adversely affected local population dynamics and might have contributed to the global decline of some waterbird species. Because Chongming Dongtan provides stopover and wintering habitats for many migratory waterbirds, protection and restoration of natural wetlands at Chongming Dongtan are urgently needed. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s00267-008-9247-7,2-s2.0-67349220382,111,0.786291044,1,waterbird pop chang in the wetland at chongm dongt in the yangtz riv estu chin we study the chang in wetland habit and waterbird commun between the s and the s at chongm dongt a rams sit in the yangtz riv estu an ecolog import reg thi reg is an import stopov sit for shorebird along the east as australas flyway and is extend us by waterfowl a net loss of of the wetland are was estim dur study period at chongm dongt the chang was depend on wetland typ whil the are of art habit such as paddy field and aquacult pond mor than doubl mor than of nat habit includ sea bulrush scirp mariquet and common ree phragmites aust marsh wer lost ov the two decad an exot plant specy introduc from nor americ smoo cordgrass spartin alterniflor occupy of the veget intertid zon by the s although waterbird specy rich did not chang between the s and the s specy found in s wer replac by new record specy moreov ther wer mor specy with declin trend than with increas trend the pop trend of specy wer affect by resid stat and habit typ transy wint migr and habit spec wer mor lik to show declin trend comp to thos bree at dongt includ year round and sum resid and habit gen furtherm specy assocy main with nat wetland wer mor lik to declin than thos assocy main with art wetland thes pattern suggest that the loss and chang of wetland habit at chongm dongt advers affect loc pop dynam and might hav contribut to the glob declin of som waterbird specy becaus chongm dongt provid stopov and wint habit for many migr waterbird protect and rest of nat wetland at chongm dongt ar urg nee,new,0.8453940074285831,0.8118304700290893,0.7858693490061129,0.7651783012101159,0.7481022805013897,0.7335882791876578,0.7209433054066859,0.7096739238522609,0.6993744282828092,0.6896305488571575,0.6798463177006863
152,bird_australasia,Long-term trends in the Australasian gannet (Morus serrator) population in Australia: The effect of climate change and commercial fisheries,"The Australasian gannet (Morus serrator) population has increased considerably over the past century, both in New Zealand and Australia. Since 1980, the population in Australian waters has increased threefold, from 6,600 breeding pairs to approximately 20,000 pairs in 1999-2000, a rate of 6% per year. Reasons for the increase in the Australasian gannet population are poorly understood; here we consider the possible effects of recent fluctuations in climatic and oceanographic conditions, and changes in major local commercial fisheries. A significant trend towards more frequent, and stronger, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation events, warmer summer sea surface temperatures in Bass Strait, increased annual catches and catch per unit effort in the Victorian pilchard (Sardinops sagax) fishery and potential increased discarding of fisheries by catch may account for at least some of the observed increase in the Australasian gannet population. The potential interactive effects of these factors on prey distribution and abundance and consequently on gannet numbers are discussed.",10.1007/s00227-002-0838-1,2-s2.0-0036943681,28,0.768368245,1,long term trend in the australas gannet mor ser pop in austral the effect of clim chang and commerc fishery the australas gannet mor ser pop has increas consid ov the past century both in new zealand and austral sint the pop in aust wat has increas threefold from bree pair to approxim pair in a rat of per year reason for the increas in the australas gannet pop ar poor understood her we consid the poss effect of rec fluctu in clim and oceanograph condit and chang in maj loc commerc fishery a sign trend toward mor frequ and stronger el ni√±o southern oscil ev warm sum sea surfac temp in bass strait increas an catch and catch per unit effort in the vict pilchard sardinop sagax fishery and pot increas discard of fishery by catch may account for at least som of the observ increas in the australas gannet pop the pot interact effect of thes fact on prey distribut and abund and consequ on gannet numb ar discuss,new,0.8138888192043785,0.7927133988175065,0.7781948706629932,0.7679756923924611,0.7607524200407076,0.7558502602876888,0.7529627277182788,0.7520593777157887,0.7534187601140175,0.7578418626122263,0.7673549795045237
162,bird_australasia,Probable consequences of high female mortality for speckled warblers living in habitat remnants,"The effects of habitat fragmentation on the Australian avifauna have been widespread with species richness and abundance declining with reduced remnant size and habitat quality and increased habitat isolation. The speckled warbler, Chthonicola sagittata is one species from the highly fragmented temperate woodlands of eastern Australia that has declined across its range and populations that remain appear to be patchily distributed in habitat remnants. Specific causes of decline are unknown but several aspects of its biology make the species particularly vulnerable to decline in fragmented landscapes. Here, we analyse survey data (presence/absence) of speckled warblers in a large sample of habitat remnants from three regions to identify patterns of occupancy. We explore the effects of patch size on extinction risk using population viability analyses (PVA) and detailed demographic data from a behavioural study of individuals in the Australian Capital Territory, south-eastern Australia. Patch size was a strong predictor of the persistence of speckled warblers in habitat remnants. High density populations had higher probabilities of persisting, and inclusion of an Allee effect during drought decreased the probability of persistence. In the absence of an Allee effect, only high density populations in patches greater than 300 ha and low density populations in patches greater than700 ha had more than an 80% probability of persisting over 100 years. The accelerating decrease in population persistence below approximately 200-400 ha suggests that small populations were particularly vulnerable to stochastic demographic and environmental events. Adult female mortality was the single most important factor in driving population extinction. Our PVA model predictions matched the survey data for the Australian Capital Territory region remarkably well, but failed to predict occupancy rates in remnants in other regions. Differences in occupancy patterns between regions may, however, have resulted from inbreeding depression. This study demonstrates both the strengths and limitations of PVA analysis. PVA can predict occupancy patterns with reasonable accuracy, given good demographic data, but data for one region cannot be used universally for all regions. We highlight the need for studies of demography in different regions to interpret regional patterns of occupancy and to identify mechanisms of decline in remnant habitat. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

172,bird_australasia,"Effects of the Saemangeum Reclamation Project on migratory shorebird staging in the Saemangeum and Geum Estuaries, South Korea","The Saemangeum tidal flat, an important staging site for migratory shorebirds that travel the East Asian-Australasian (EAA) Flyway, was isolated from the eastern Yellow Sea in 2006 as part of a large-scale reclamation project. To gain a better understanding of the impacts that this reclamation has had on the long-distance migratory shorebirds that use the EAA Flyway, we examined the number of shorebirds visiting Saemangeum and three adjacent sites in the Geum Estuary (Yubu Island, the Janghang coastline, and the Geum River Channel) during the spring and fall prior to, and after, completion of the reclamation (2004-2013). A total of 48 shorebird species, including one Critically Endangered, three Endangered, and nine Near Threatened species, were observed over this period. Peak numbers of shorebirds recorded at sites in Saemangeum and the Geum Estuary following completion of the project were 74% below those recorded in 2004 and 2005, the years prior to reclamation activity. In Saemangeum, shorebird abundance declined by approximately 95% and 97.3% during the northward and southward migrations, respectively, as a result of reclamation. Although shorebird populations in the Geum Estuary increased by 5% and 20% during the northwards and southward migrations, respectively, these increases failed to offset the reduction in shorebird abundance in Saemangeum; overall, shorebird abundance at Saemangeum and the three adjacent sites in the Geum Estuary markedly declined over the reclamation period. Given the more favourable conditions of adjacent areas, sites in Saemangeum and the Geum Estuary no longer provide the habitat conditions necessary for long-distance migratory shorebirds. In order to improve habitat for staging migratory birds, we suggest that measures such as the conversion of an abandoned salt farm for use as roosting sites, the construction of artificial barriers to prevent human disturbance, and re-opening of the river-banks to facilitate water flow be implemented. ¬© 2017 BirdLife International.",10.1017/S0959270916000605,2-s2.0-85012294412,43,0.759114952,1,effect of the saemange reclam project on migr shorebird stag in the saemange and geum estu sou kore the saemange tid flat an import stag sit for migr shorebird that travel the east as australas ea flyway was isol from the eastern yellow sea in as part of a larg scal reclam project to gain a bet understand of the impact that thi reclam has had on the long dist migr shorebird that us the ea flyway we examin the numb of shorebird visit saemange and three adjac sit in the geum estu yubu island the janghang coastlin and the geum riv channel dur the spring and fal pri to and aft complet of the reclam a tot of shorebird specy includ on crit endang three endang and nin near threatened specy wer observ ov thi period peak numb of shorebird record at sit in saemange and the geum estu follow complet of the project wer below thos record in and the year pri to reclam act in saemange shorebird abund declin by approxim and dur the northward and southward migr respect as a result of reclam although shorebird pop in the geum estu increas by and dur the northward and southward migr respect thes increas fail to offset the reduc in shorebird abund in saemange overal shorebird abund at saemange and the three adjac sit in the geum estu mark declin ov the reclam period giv the mor favo condit of adjac area sit in saemange and the geum estu no long provid the habit condit necess for long dist migr shorebird in ord to improv habit for stag migr bird we suggest that meas such as the convert of an abandon salt farm for us as roost sit the construct of art barry to prev hum disturb and re op of the riv bank to facilit wat flow be impl,new,0.8099245165977474,0.7697604175138595,0.7397498742534244,0.716978208606166,0.6993426854259754,0.6855561993080285,0.6748776396936151,0.6669568528057532,0.6618134629794341,0.660007167761442,0.6632529321126465
182,bird_australasia,Multi-scale habitat models for reintroduced bird populations: A case study of South Island saddlebacks on Motuara Island,"Understanding resource selection by animals is important when considering habitat suitability at proposed release sites within threatened species recovery programmes. Multi-scale investigatory approaches are increasingly encouraged, as the patchy distribution of suitable habitats in fragmented landscapes often determines species presence and survival. Habitat models applied to a threatened New Zealand forest passerine, the South Island saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus carunculatus), reintroduced to Ulva Island (Stewart Island) found that at landscape scale breeding pairs' preferences for sites near the coast were driven by micro-scale vegetation structure. We tested these results by examining models of breeding site selection by a reintroduced saddleback population on Motuara Island (Marlborough Sounds) at two scales: (1) micro-scale, for habitat characteristics that may drive breeding site selection, and (2) landscape scale, for variations in micro-scale habitat characteristics that may influence site colonisation in breeding pairs. Results indicated that birds on Motuara Island responded similarly to those on Ulva Island, i.e. birds primarily settled at the margins of coastal scrub and forest and later cohorts moved into larger stands of coastal forest where they established breeding territories. Plant species composition was also important in providing breeding saddleback pairs with adequate food supply and nesting support. However, Motuara Island birds differed in their partitioning of habitat use: preferred habitats were used for nesting while birds were foraging outside territorial boundaries or in shared sites. These differences may be explained because Motuara has a more homogeneous distribution of microscale habitats throughout the landscape and a highly bird-populated environment. These results show that resource distribution and abundance across the landscape needs to be accounted for in the modelling of density-bird-habitat relationships. In the search for future release sites, food (invertebrates and fruiting tree species) should be abundant close to available nesting sites, or evenly spread and available throughout the landscape. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",,2-s2.0-46849098963,91,0.750988787,0,mult scal habit model for reintroduc bird pop a cas study of sou island saddleback on motuar island understand resourc select by anim is import when consid habit suit at propos releas sit within threatened specy recovery program mult scal investig approach ar increas enco as the patchy distribut of suit habit in frag landscap oft determin specy pres and surv habit model apply to a threatened new zealand forest passerin the sou island saddleback philesturn carunculat carunculat reintroduc to ulv island stewart island found that at landscap scal bree pair pref for sit near the coast wer driv by micro scal veget structure we test thes result by examin model of bree sit select by a reintroduc saddleback pop on motuar island marlborough sound at two scal micro scal for habit charact that may driv bree sit select and landscap scal for vary in micro scal habit charact that may influ sit colon in bree pair result ind that bird on motuar island respond simil to thos on ulv island i e bird prim settl at the margin of coast scrub and forest and lat cohort mov into larg stand of coast forest wher they est bree territ plant specy composit was also import in provid bree saddleback pair with adequ food supply and nest support howev motuar island bird diff in their partit of habit us prefer habit wer us for nest whil bird wer for outsid territ bound or in shar sit thes diff may be explain becaus motuar has a mor homog distribut of microsc habit throughout the landscap and a high bird pop environ thes result show that resourc distribut and abund across the landscap nee to be account for in the model of dens bird habit rel in the search for fut releas sit food invertebr and fruit tre specy should be abund clos to avail nest sit or ev spread and avail throughout the landscap,new,0.8010743131056897,0.7122486639650298,0.6387645764889708,0.5801069725595589,0.532875251512257,0.4940773159215732,0.46149967098355854,0.4335165215521053,0.40884712857225136,0.38628824869838535,0.3643138689480695
192,bird_australasia,"Population decline of the White-fronted Chat (Epthianura albifrons) in New South Wales, Australia","Habitat modification through urbanisation and the alteration of the natural flows of rivers is a major contributor to the global decline of birds occupying specialist habitats. We measured the extent and pattern of change in range and relative abundance over 25 years of the White-fronted Chat, a small passerine that is predominantly found in saltmarsh. A particular focus of the study was the population in the Sydney region, which is now restricted to two locations in which we measured the response of birds to human disturbance. A significant decline of 65% in the reporting rate of White-fronted Chats was observed over the 25 years, with a decline of 44% over the last 10 years in New South Wales. Historical analysis of the White-fronted Chat in the Sydney region revealed a change in geographical distribution, with the current population now confined to only two of 56 former locations. Surveys of these locations concluded that in 2008, nine White-fronted Chats remained at Newington Nature Reserve and ‚àº20 at Towra Point Nature Reserve. Measurements of the distance at which foraging birds flushed from an approaching observer suggest that this species is more sensitive to human disturbance than other co-occurring species. This study documents the decline of a species listed in 2010 as vulnerable under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, and confirms the need for recovery planning to prevent the further loss of populations, particularly those in the highly urbanised coastal zone. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2011.",10.1071/MU10038,2-s2.0-79955451026,27,0.749100951,1,pop declin of the whit front chat epthianur albifron in new sou wal austral habit mod through urb and the alt of the nat flow of riv is a maj contribut to the glob declin of bird occupy spec habit we meas the ext and pattern of chang in rang and rel abund ov year of the whit front chat a smal passerin that is predomin found in saltmarsh a particul foc of the study was the pop in the sydney reg which is now restrict to two loc in which we meas the respons of bird to hum disturb a sign declin of in the report rat of whit front chat was observ ov the year with a declin of ov the last year in new sou wal hist analys of the whit front chat in the sydney reg rev a chang in geograph distribut with the cur pop now confin to on two of form loc survey of thes loc conclud that in nin whit front chat remain at newington nat reserv and ‚àº at towr point nat reserv meas of the dist at which for bird flush from an approach observ suggest that thi specy is mor sensit to hum disturb than oth co occur specy thi study docu the declin of a specy list in as vuln und the new sou wal threatened specy conserv act and confirm the nee for recovery plan to prev the furth loss of pop particul thos in the high urb coast zon,new,0.7696033952626037,0.7241165382012653,0.6907037046014545,0.6657928277123981,0.6469239558026941,0.6326383303471452,0.6221383961236153,0.6151152720055753,0.6117563376482898,0.6130333141129171,0.6216645216368506
202,bird_australasia,"Use of sandbanks by terns in Queensland, Australia: A priority for conservation in a popular recreational waterway","Many terns (Laridae) from the northern hemisphere overwinter in Australia, but they are rarely covered comprehensively in bird counts in Australian coastal waterways. We conducted censuses over 3 years on terns in an increasingly popular recreational waterway at the northern end of Moreton Bay, known as Caloundra sandbanks, to provide the first overview of the relative abundance of non-breeding tern species on estuary-type sandbanks in Australia. The maximum number of birds counted was &gt; 43,000, of which over 90% belonged to six species of terns. The most abundant tern species was the common tern Sterna hirundo longipennis which reached &gt; 38,000 in one Austral summer. Other northern-breeding migrant terns were the white-winged black tern Chlidonias leucopterus ( &gt; 17,000) and the little tern S. albifrons sinensis ( &gt;11,000), which also breeds in Australia. These migrant terns arrived at Caloundra sandbanks at around late-October and a vast majority had departed by mid-April. Numbers were generally highest from late-December through to early-April. An additional three Australian-breeding terns of smaller population sizes frequented the sandbanks. Density of terns using the habitats could reach a peak of 600 ha-1 during the warmer months of the year, coinciding with peak human recreational activities. In light of the results, Caloundra sandbanks should be regarded as an Area of International Importance based on criteria contained in the Ramsar Convention. The situation at Caloundra sandbanks presents challenges to recreational and tourism issues, requiring review of traditional government priorities in the conservation of wetlands based primarily on waders. ¬© 2006 Springer.",10.1007/s10531-005-6197-8,2-s2.0-33846864898,42,0.7462563179999999,1,us of sandbank by tern in queensland austral a pri for conserv in a popul recr waterway many tern larida from the northern hemisph overwint in austral but they ar rar cov comprehend in bird count in aust coast waterway we conduc census ov year on tern in an increas popul recr waterway at the northern end of moreton bay known as caloundr sandbank to provid the first overview of the rel abund of non bree tern specy on estu typ sandbank in austral the maxim numb of bird count was gt of which ov belong to six specy of tern the most abund tern specy was the common tern stern hirundo longipen which reach gt in on aust sum oth northern bree migr tern wer the whit wing black tern chlidonias leucopter gt and the littl tern s albifron sinens gt which also bree in austral thes migr tern ar at caloundr sandbank at around lat octob and a vast maj had depart by mid april numb wer gen highest from lat decemb through to ear april an addit three aust bree tern of smal pop siz frequ the sandbank dens of tern us the habit could reach a peak of ha dur the warm month of the year coincid with peak hum recr act in light of the result caloundr sandbank should be regard as an are of intern import bas on criter contain in the rams conv the situ at caloundr sandbank pres challeng to recr and tour issu requir review of tradit govern pri in the conserv of wetland bas prim on wad,new,0.8066174619498716,0.756207212863737,0.7171213938141453,0.6868976871329556,0.6632343789351223,0.6445869180094909,0.6300364199027041,0.6191646191718146,0.6120799441563405,0.6097122384180789,0.6148565231780735
213,bird_australasia,Effect of conservation efforts and ecological variables on waterbird population sizes in wetlands of the Yangtze River,"Forage quality and availability, climatic factors, and a wetland's conservation status are expected to affect the densities of wetland birds. However, the conservation effectiveness is often poorly studied. Here, using twelve years' census data collected from 78 wetlands in the Yangtze River floodplain, we aimed to understand the effect of these variables on five Anatidae species, and evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation measures by comparing population trends of these species among wetlands that differ in conservations status. We showed that the slope angle of a wetland and the variation thereof best explain the differences in densities of four species. We also found that the population abundances of the Anatidae species generally declined in wetlands along the Yangtze River floodplain over time, with a steeper decline in wetlands with a lower protection status, indicating that current conservation policies might deliver benefits for wintering Anatidae species in China, as population sizes of the species were buffered to some extent against decline in numbers in wetlands with a higher level protection status. We recommend several protection measures to stop the decline of these Anatidae species in wetlands along the Yangtze River floodplain, which are of great importance for the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. ¬© 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

222,bird_australasia,Monitoring population change in the cryptic and threatened Western Ground Parrot in relation to fire,"Measures of abundance and population trends are necessary for informed management of rare species, but obtaining reliable estimates of sparsely occurring species is an ongoing challenge in conservation biology. It is even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots, monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south-western Australia. Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000. Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown. Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change in frequency of calling of ‚àº13%. The number of listening posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual change of 10%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect an annual change of 5%. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2007.",10.1071/MU06016,2-s2.0-34250882813,51,0.7446024109999999,1,monit pop chang in the crypt and threatened western ground parrot in rel to fir meas of abund and pop trend ar necess for inform man of rar specy but obtain rely estim of spars occur specy is an ongo challeng in conserv biolog it is ev mor difficult when the specy of interest is also crypt we census a pop of on such specy the western ground parrot pezopor wallic flav ov sev year to develop a monit protocol to assist in fut man extend understand of it respons to fir and provid a model that could be us with oth crypt bird specy abund of western ground parrot monit by mean of cal frequ vary from year to year at a study sit in fitzgerald riv nat park sou western austral frequ of cal increas sign from to dur thi tim frequ of cal peak in in part of the study sit that had been unburnt for mor than year and remain high in frequ of cal was simil in a mor rec burnt part of the study are exceiv in may when frequ was low follow a fir that burnt part of thi are fiv month prevy frequ of cal drop sign in both the long unburnt and rec burnt area between and exact reason for thi ar unknown western ground parrot can us rec burnt veget wher it is immedy adjac to an est pop but do not nee fir to cre habit at least in the timesc of year the cur monit protocol wher eight list post ar count approxim three tim each is cap of detect an an chang in frequ of cal of ‚àº the numb of list post would nee to be increas to in ord to detect an an chang of and would nee to be increas to in ord to detect an an chang of,new,0.7911132881492287,0.7580333969219663,0.7337010938424162,0.715514933812674,0.7018071794892061,0.6916033490657962,0.6843839801013978,0.6799802848321269,0.678593720132073,0.6810185376074402,0.6893689574118628
232,bird_australasia,"Analyzing Variability and the Rate of Decline of Migratory Shorebirds in Moreton Bay, Australia","Estimating the abundance of migratory species is difficult because sources of variability differ substantially among species and populations. Recently developed state-space models address this variability issue by directly modeling both environmental and measurement error, although their efficacy in detecting declines is relatively untested for empirical data. We applied state-space modeling, generalized least squares (with autoregression error structure), and standard linear regression to data on abundance of wetland birds (shorebirds and terns) at Moreton Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia. There are internationally significant numbers of 8 species of waterbirds in the bay, and it is a major terminus of the large East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In our analyses, we considered 22 migrant and 8 resident species. State-space models identified abundances of 7 species of migrants as significantly declining and abundance of one species as significantly increasing. Declines in migrant abundance over 15 years were 43-79%. Generalized least squares with an autoregressive error structure showed abundance changes in 11 species, and standard linear regression showed abundance changes in 15 species. The higher power of the regression models meant they detected more declines, but they also were associated with a higher rate of false detections. If the declines in Moreton Bay are consistent with trends from other sites across the flyway as a whole, then a large number of species are in significant decline. ¬©2011 Society for Conservation Biology.",10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01670.x,2-s2.0-79960557286,7,0.7436038159999999,1,analys vary and the rat of declin of migr shorebird in moreton bay austral estim the abund of migr specy is difficult becaus sourc of vary diff subst among specy and pop rec develop stat spac model address thi vary issu by direct model both environ and meas er although their eff in detect declin is rel untest for empir dat we apply stat spac model gen least squ with autoregress er structure and standard linear regress to dat on abund of wetland bird shorebird and tern at moreton bay in southeast queensland austral ther ar intern sign numb of specy of waterbird in the bay and it is a maj termin of the larg east as australas flyway in our analys we consid migr and resid specy stat spac model ident abund of specy of migr as sign declin and abund of on specy as sign increas declin in migr abund ov year wer gen least squ with an autoregress er structure show abund chang in specy and standard linear regress show abund chang in specy the high pow of the regress model meant they detect mor declin but they also wer assocy with a high rat of fals detect if the declin in moreton bay ar consist with trend from oth sit across the flyway as a whol then a larg numb of specy ar in sign declin,new,0.7968075177078787,0.7424996493879751,0.7006199412645688,0.6680075428040922,0.642032566772757,0.6209771295745024,0.6037710198421163,0.5897967219477185,0.5788152669613883,0.5710793894410635,0.5678226028155722
242,bird_australasia,Low seasonal variation in the diet of Rock Shags (Phalacrocorax magellanicus) at a Patagonian colony in Argentina,"The characteristics of the food sources exploited by seabirds are one of the main factors determining the abundance and distribution of those birds. Determination of the diet over the year and between breeding and non-breeding seasons is important in understanding the food sources and their potential relationship with seabird population dynamics. We studied seasonality in the diet of the Rock Shag (Phalacrocorax magellanicus), a seabird endemic to southern Argentina and Chile, at a colony at Punta Loma, Chubut, by analysis of pellets (regurgitated casts) collected weekly during two consecutive non-breeding and breeding seasons in 2002 and 2003. We identified 19 prey-types in the diet. Polychaetes were the most common item, being present in 80-90% of the samples. Fish were also dominant in both non-breeding and breeding seasons (present in 60-80% of the pellets), especially species of Patagonotothen, Ribeiroclinus and Helcogrammoides. Crustaceans and cephalopods were also present in the diet, but to a lesser extent. There was a high overlap in dietary composition between non-breeding and breeding seasons, although more crustaceans and cephalopods were consumed during the non-breeding season in 2002. Results indicate that the food sources of Rock Shags are present in their feeding areas throughout the year, although many of these species are restricted in their availability, are of small size and have low energy content. ¬© Royal Australasian Orinthologists Union 2009.",10.1071/MU07061,2-s2.0-62249146130,41,0.741631988,0,low season vary in the diet of rock shag phalacrocorax magellanic at a patagon colony in argentin the charact of the food sourc exploit by seabird ar on of the main fact determin the abund and distribut of thos bird determin of the diet ov the year and between bree and non bree season is import in understand the food sourc and their pot rel with seabird pop dynam we study season in the diet of the rock shag phalacrocorax magellanic a seabird endem to southern argentin and chil at a colony at punt lom chubut by analys of pellet regurgit cast collect week dur two consecut non bree and bree season in and we ident prey typ in the diet polychaet wer the most common item being pres in of the sampl fish wer also domin in both non bree and bree season pres in of the pellet espec specy of patagonototh ribeiroclin and helcogrammoid crustac and cephalopod wer also pres in the diet but to a less ext ther was a high overlap in diet composit between non bree and bree season although mor crustac and cephalopod wer consum dur the non bree season in result ind that the food sourc of rock shag ar pres in their fee area throughout the year although many of thes specy ar restrict in their avail ar of smal siz and hav low energy cont,new,0.8107359408603532,0.7337124797007423,0.6704805905860209,0.6198557759695408,0.5788472327139003,0.5450042890553916,0.5165910502629291,0.4924146048690257,0.4716884400280353,0.45395245688349245,0.43923587551816606
252,bird_australasia,Long-term wildlife road-kill counts in New Zealand,"We compare the number of medium- sized animals (between rat and dog-size) killed on repeated counts along the same 1660 km of North Island highways in 1984,1994 and 2005 with other counts going back to 1949. Eleven mammal and 14 bird species were recorded, but Australian possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) predominated, and pukekos (Porphyrio porphyrio), mynas (Acridotheres tristis), and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibiceri) were the most common birds. Counts of possums, hedgehogs and rabbits ranged between 0.7 and 89 corpses/100 km, and changed dramatically over six decades. The possum count rose 80% between 1984 and 1994, but declined 60% by 2005. A possible irruption of hedgehogs is reported in 1988-89, followed by an 82% decline in their numbers between 1994 and 2005. Although rabbit hemorrhagic disease was introduced to New Zealand in 1997,rabbit road-kill increased 59% between 1994 and 2005. The relationship between road-kill and traffic volume indicates that roads carrying more than 3000 vehicles per day act as barriers to larger mammals, while vehicles on less busy roads are more dangerous for crossing animals. We suggest that regular counts taken at annual intervals over the same roads is a useful method for gathering information about the changing distribution and relative abundance of certain animals on a provincial or national scale and over long periods of time. Regular counts at seasonal, monthly or weekly intervals are also a rich source of information. ¬© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.",10.1080/03014220909510147,2-s2.0-70249097744,73,0.7403049970000001,0,long term wildl road kil count in new zealand we comp the numb of med siz anim between rat and dog siz kil on rep count along the sam km of nor island highway in and with oth count going back to elev mam and bird specy wer record but aust possum trichosur vulpecul hedgehog erinace europae and rabbit oryctolag cunicul predomin and pukeko porphyrio porphyrio myna acridoth trist and aust magpy gymnorhin tibicer wer the most common bird count of possum hedgehog and rabbit rang between and corps km and chang dram ov six decad the poss count ros between and but declin by a poss irrupt of hedgehog is report in follow by an declin in their numb between and although rabbit hemorrh diseas was introduc to new zealand in rabbit road kil increas between and the rel between road kil and traff volum ind that road carry mor than vehic per day act as barry to larg mam whil vehic on less busy road ar mor dang for cross anim we suggest that regul count tak at an interv ov the sam road is a us method for gath inform about the chang distribut and rel abund of certain anim on a provint or nat scal and ov long period of tim regul count at season month or week interv ar also a rich sourc of inform,new,0.7876689472330937,0.7401335238151194,0.7038274473060534,0.6755645556037998,0.6530441952455587,0.6348264807201368,0.6200436697003942,0.608231098900239,0.5992866444394213,0.5936201744284308,0.5927247263162622

We report on a co-operative project between Maori landowners, the Department of Conservation, and Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research researchers to restore a Northland kukupa population and to examine kukupa nesting success in relation to pest abundance. Ship rats and possums were targeted by trapping and poisoning throughout Motatau Forest (350 ha) from 1997 to 1999; only possums were targeted in 2000. All 13 kukupa nests located before pest control started in late 1997 failed at the egg stage, but all seven nests located in 1998-99 successfully fledged young when trapping and tracking indices of possums and ship rats were less than 4%. After pest control, counts of kukupa and some other bird species increased at Motatau compared with counts in a nearby non-treatment block, suggesting numbers of adult kukupa can be increased in small forest areas by intensive pest control. This increase is due at least partly to increased nest success. Evidence from time-lapse video cameras, sign remaining at nests, and nest success rates under different pest control regimes suggest both ship rats and possums are important predators at kukupa nests. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",,2-s2.0-4344689239,70,0.7361223109999999,0,respons of kukup hemiphag novaeseelandia and oth bird to mam pest control at motatau northland the kukup or new zealand pigeon hemiphag novaeseelandia is grad declin on the new zealand mainland due most to pred by introduc pest mam includ ship rat ratt ratt and brushtail possum trichosur vulpecul we report on a co op project between maor landown the depart of conserv and manaak whenu landc research research to rest a northland kukup pop and to examin kukup nest success in rel to pest abund ship rat and possum wer target by trap and poison throughout motatau forest ha from to on possum wer target in al kukup nest loc bef pest control start in lat fail at the eg stag but al sev nest loc in success fledg young when trap and track ind of possum and ship rat wer less than aft pest control count of kukup and som oth bird specy increas at motatau comp with count in a nearby non tre block suggest numb of adult kukup can be increas in smal forest area by intend pest control thi increas is due at least part to increas nest success evid from tim laps video camera sign remain at nest and nest success rat und diff pest control regim suggest both ship rat and possum ar import pred at kukup nest,new,0.7460530389393575,0.7017308174898241,0.6695807771135378,0.6459959043768035,0.6285605644360748,0.6158839976291245,0.6072709463559054,0.6025809082965201,0.60230782316541,0.6080493272030949,0.623926194527847
272,bird_australasia,Drivers of waterbird communities and their declines on Yangtze River floodplain lakes,"The seasonally flooded Yangtze Valley Floodplain wetlands of China are globally important for wintering waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. These birds have declined in the last 60 years, so understanding factors shaping waterbird distribution and abundance patterns is critical for their conservation. We applied linear mixed models to investigate the effects of climate, winter water area and inundation area (the difference between maximum flooded and winter dry season water area) on waterbird abundance and diversity at 72 lakes in 2005 and 2016. Neither winter water area nor climate featured in the best models, rather inundation area was the key determinant of waterbird abundance and diversity. Future water abstraction and land claim will therefore have greater impacts on waterbird abundance and diversity than likely climate change effects. Significant declines in waterbird abundance and diversity between 2005 and 2016 were not explained by modelled variables and there was no reduction in wetland inundation areas to explain these declines, confirming other factors were responsible. These potentially include declining wetland quality affecting carrying capacity (e.g. flooding phenology, disturbance, habitat loss and degradation, declining water quality caused by eutrophication and pollution) and/or factors limiting migratory waterbird populations at other stages in their life cycle elsewhere. The studied Yangtze lakes are amongst the best for wintering waterbirds and many are protected for their biodiversity, suggesting such protection cannot fully safeguard these internationally shared populations when threatened by other, currently unknown factors. This confirms the urgent need for more research to safeguard these ephemeral lake systems for their global biodiversity significance. ¬© 2017",10.1016/j.biocon.2017.12.029,2-s2.0-85039986278,13,0.735013117,1,driv of waterbird commun and their declin on yangtz riv floodplain lak the season flood yangtz valley floodplain wetland of chin ar glob import for wint waterbird in the east as australas flyway thes bird hav declin in the last year so understand fact shap waterbird distribut and abund pattern is crit for their conserv we apply linear mix model to investig the effect of clim wint wat are and inund are the diff between maxim flood and wint dry season wat are on waterbird abund and divers at lak in and neith wint wat are nor clim feat in the best model rath inund are was the key determin of waterbird abund and divers fut wat abstract and land claim wil theref hav gre impact on waterbird abund and divers than lik clim chang effect sign declin in waterbird abund and divers between and wer not explain by model vary and ther was no reduc in wetland inund area to explain thes declin confirm oth fact wer respons thes pot includ declin wetland qual affect carry capac e g flood phenolog disturb habit loss and degrad declin wat qual caus by eutroph and pollut and or fact limit migr waterbird pop at oth stag in their lif cyc elsewh the study yangtz lak ar amongst the best for wint waterbird and many ar protect for their biodivers suggest such protect cannot ful safeguard thes intern shar pop when threatened by oth cur unknown fact thi confirm the urg nee for mor research to safeguard thes ephem lak system for their glob biodivers sign,new,0.7811537082138542,0.7348587247564019,0.6997315076788992,0.6725534214937874,0.651003070390409,0.6336349918176671,0.6195786442538738,0.6083557475729541,0.5998175253839655,0.5942539270393014,0.5928487098905992
282,bird_australasia,Use of trained dogs to determine the age structure and conservation status of kiwi Apteryx spp. populations,"Specially trained dogs are used to locate many threatened bird species in New Zealand during conservation management and research projects. Systematic searches were made in four forest patches in Northland where many Brown Kiwi Apteryx mantelli had been fitted with bands, wing tags, transponders or radio-transmitters over a 12-year period of experimental management. The percentage of subadult birds found by dogs increased in line with predictions from population models of the changing age structure of the population. The dogs independently found radio-tagged adults and subadults in close proportion to their known abundance. Dogs proved to be an excellent tool to determine the age structure of a kiwi population. With knowledge of the life history of the species involved, this information was used to make an accurate assessment of the conservation status of the study population of Brown Kiwi in Northland. Our results also support the recent downgrading of Little Spotted Kiwi Apteryx owenii from 'Vulnerable' to 'Near Threatened', which was based partly on healthy age ratios found during dog searches on Kapiti Island, rather than on results from a study of their breeding biology on the island which showed unsustainably low chick recruitment. ¬© 2009 BirdLife International.",10.1017/S0959270908007673,2-s2.0-67749111585,23,0.7299058209999999,0,us of train dog to determin the ag structure and conserv stat of kiw apteryx spp pop spec train dog ar us to loc many threatened bird specy in new zealand dur conserv man and research project system search wer mad in four forest patch in northland wher many brown kiw apteryx mantell had been fit with band wing tag transpond or radio transmit ov a year period of expery man the perc of subadult bird found by dog increas in lin with predict from pop model of the chang ag structure of the pop the dog independ found radio tag adult and subadult in clos proport to their known abund dog prov to be an excel tool to determin the ag structure of a kiw pop with knowledg of the lif hist of the specy involv thi inform was us to mak an acc assess of the conserv stat of the study pop of brown kiw in northland our result also support the rec downgrad of littl spot kiw apteryx oweni from vuln to near threatened which was bas part on healthy ag ratio found dur dog search on kapit island rath than on result from a study of their bree biolog on the island which show unsustain low chick recruit,new,0.7655692975027987,0.7155911109692364,0.6781162403856202,0.6497670931148286,0.6280014029822103,0.6112558198350261,0.598657286273728,0.5898608298365172,0.5850671745350632,0.5853435604309492,0.5937213023436648
292,bird_australasia,Wintering waterbirds in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain: Changes in abundance and distribution,"Summary The middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain is a globally important wintering area for waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Ornithologists have reported on wintering waterbirds in the floodplain since the 1950s. However, an integrated analysis of the long-term changes in waterbird diversity is not available. Here, we synthesise existing information on changes in wintering waterbird abundance and distribution in the floodplain, summarise possible influencing factors and propose some priorities for further research. Waterbird richness and abundance have declined over the past 60 years. Declining trends have been observed in a number of areas and species. Nevertheless, a few areas and species showed different trends. In addition, waterbirds have become more concentrated in a few suitable areas such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. Land reclamation, hunting, dam operation and extensive aquaculture are probably the four major threats to wintering waterbirds, while establishment of nature reserves is beneficial to waterbird conservation. Our study suggests that waterbirds in the floodplain are vulnerable, and that effective conservation measures are needed to protect and restore the waterbird diversity of this area.

302,bird_australasia,Population dynamics and prey selection of native and introduced predators during a rodent outbreak in arid Australia,"We examined population dynamics and trophic ecology of a predator-prey system in the Simpson Desert, Australia, consisting of an assemblage of small mammals (body mass < 100 g) and 4 species of predators: the endemic letter-winged kite (Elanus scriptus), a nocturnal-hunting rodent specialist; and 3 introduced mammalian predators (dingo [Canis lupus dingo], European red fox [Vulpes vulpes], and house cat [Felis catus]). This is the 1st comprehensive study of the responses of both the kite and introduced carnivores to a rodent outbreak. The 3.5-year study period included a population outbreak of about 24 months duration involving 3 native rodent species. Mammalian predators and kites exhibited similar population responses. Kites immigrated into the area within 6 months of the outbreak commencing, and remained while rodent abundance was high; however, all birds left the area after rodent populations crashed within a 6-week period. Dingoes and foxes were more abundant than cats and both species increased during the outbreak. All carnivores were resident. The letter-winged kite fed almost entirely on rodents. Rodents were the main prey of the 3 mammalian predators during the outbreak; however, all species had intermediate niche breadths. Dietary overlap between the kite and each carnivore was high during the rodent outbreak. During a nonoutbreak period, predation on rodents by the red fox remained high, whereas that by the dingo declined. We estimated the number of average-sized rodents (body mass 32.65 g) eaten daily by a nonreproducing individual to range from 1 (letter-winged kite) to 6 (red fox). We also estimated that the 3 mammalian predators (combined) captured 11 times as many rodents per day as letter-winged kites. There is considerable potential for food-based competition between the kite and introduced mammalian predators, particularly the red fox and house cat, in arid Australia. ¬© 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.",10.1644/07-MAMM-A-168R.1,2-s2.0-45249120385,54,0.723016122,1,pop dynam and prey select of nat and introduc pred dur a rod outbreak in arid austral we examin pop dynam and troph ecolog of a pred prey system in the simpson desert austral consist of an assembl of smal mam body mass g and specy of pred the endem let wing kit elan scriptus a nocturn hunt rod spec and introduc mam pred dingo can lup dingo europ red fox vulp vulp and hous cat fel cat thi is the st comprehend study of the respons of both the kit and introduc carn to a rod outbreak the year study period includ a pop outbreak of about month dur involv nat rod specy mam pred and kit exhibit simil pop respons kit immigr into the are within month of the outbreak com and remain whil rod abund was high howev al bird left the are aft rod pop crash within a week period dingo and fox wer mor abund than cat and both specy increas dur the outbreak al carn wer resid the let wing kit fed almost entir on rod rod wer the main prey of the mam pred dur the outbreak howev al specy had intermedy nich breadth diet overlap between the kit and each carn was high dur the rod outbreak dur a nonoutbreak period pred on rod by the red fox remain high wherea that by the dingo declin we estim the numb of av siz rod body mass g eat dai by a nonreproduc individ to rang from let wing kit to red fox we also estim that the mam pred combin capt tim as many rod per day as let wing kit ther is consid pot for food bas competit between the kit and introduc mam pred particul the red fox and hous cat in arid austral,new,0.7906298667407364,0.7611377597541811,0.7400429524240584,0.7244923111598117,0.7127697188340908,0.7039289346069885,0.6974835471972619,0.6932741341550841,0.6914727274168853,0.6928114148598439,0.6993183659028251

On Stewart Island, when the abundance of feral cats' primary prey, rats (Rattus spp.), was very low, significantly more cats died or left the study area than when rats were abundant. Cats preferentially preyed on rats regardless of rat abundance. Birds were the main alternative prey but cats did not prey-switch to birds when rat abundance was low, possibly owing to the difficulty of capture, and small mass, of birds compared with rats.

Possum abundance, fecundity, and diet, the condition of common possum-palatable tree species, and the abundance of common forest birds were measured at three sites occupied by possums for c. 10, 20, and 30 years. Possum densities were highest at the site where possums had been present for c. 20 years. Possum fecundity was higher at the site they had recently colonised than at the two sites where they had been present for c. 20-30 years. Diet of possums where they had recently colonised was dominated by highly preferred foods (72% of total diet), whereas these same foods contributed just 36% of total diet at the site where possums had been present for more than two decades. Canopy condition of common possum-preferred trees was scored progressively lower in areas with increasing length of possum occupation, especially at the site where the possum population had apparently declined from its maximum density.

332,bird_australasia,Predation of artificial ground nests in Australian tropical savannas: Inverse edge effects,"Depredation of artificial ground nests was examined in tropical savanna in northern Australia to assess potential predation pressures on nests of the partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii), a declining tropical granivore. Predation rates were examined at two sites, Kakadu National Park (which supported a relatively high density of partridge pigeons) and Berry Springs (which had greater habitat fragmentation and comparatively low partridge pigeon density). The effects of distance from road, understorey structure, topography and nest-microsite concealment on nest predation rates were examined. Artificial-nest predation rates were greater at 150 m from roads than <1 m from the roadside. Predation rates did not vary with understorey structure, topography, or level of nest concealment. There was marked variation between sites, with predation levels at Kakadu more than double those recorded for Berry Springs. Discerning predator identity, or even the size of a predator, from marks left in clay eggs proved difficult and was possible for ‚àº35% of predation events. Of these, 42% of predation events involved predators of a size we considered too small to take a natural partridge pigeon nest. We suggest that extrapolation from artificial to natural ground-nest predation rates be undertaken with caution for landscapes such as Australia's tropical savanna, which supports a high diversity and abundance of small potential predators of artificial nests. There was no evidence of predation by birds, and the methodology proved inadequate for identifying predation by feral cats (Felis catus). ¬© CSIRO 2005.",10.1071/WR04021,2-s2.0-23744476409,77,0.713177154,0,pred of art ground nest in aust trop savanna invers edg effect depr of art ground nest was examin in trop savann in northern austral to assess pot pred press on nest of the partridg pigeon geophap smithi a declin trop gran pred rat wer examin at two sit kakadu nat park which support a rel high dens of partridg pigeon and berry springs which had gre habit frag and comp low partridg pigeon dens the effect of dist from road understorey structure topograph and nest microsit cont on nest pred rat wer examin art nest pred rat wer gre at m from road than m from the roadsid pred rat did not vary with understorey structure topograph or level of nest cont ther was mark vary between sit with pred level at kakadu mor than doubl thos record for berry springs discern pred id or ev the siz of a pred from mark left in clay eg prov difficult and was poss for ‚àº of pred ev of thes of pred ev involv pred of a siz we consid too smal to tak a nat partridg pigeon nest we suggest that extrapol from art to nat ground nest pred rat be undertak with caut for landscap such as austral s trop savann which support a high divers and abund of smal pot pred of art nest ther was no evid of pred by bird and the methodolog prov inadequ for ident pred by fer cat fel cat,new,0.7596692775659639,0.6992402796409826,0.6516258618718127,0.6139484805231782,0.5836405426703809,0.5589267139728612,0.5386426359739972,0.52206905772965,0.5088594279650055,0.4991173729082237,0.4937966663622109
341,bird_australasia,Identifying priority sites and gaps for the conservation of migratory waterbirds in China's coastal wetlands,"Many waterbird species, in particularly migratory shorebirds, on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway depend on the intertidal areas of coastal China. In recent years, these habitats have suffered severe shrinkage as a result of wetland loss and degradation. Identifying critical areas for waterbirds and assessing conservation status has become an urgent priority for biological conservation. Based on the criteria used to designate Ramsar sites and East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) Flyway Network sites, a general framework is proposed and applied to identify priority sites in China's coastal wetlands using a comprehensive waterbird survey dataset. Sites priority were evaluated by using appearance of globally threatened bird species, and bid species exceeding 1% of their global or flyway population, and population abundance. Sites priorities were ranked using an ‚Äúirreplaceability index‚Äù. Totally, 110 sites are proposed as priority sites. Considering the strategic importance of China's coastal wetlands for migratory waterbirds, the conservation status of China's coastal wetlands is inadequate to protect these waterbirds. Currently, 67 of the 110 priority sites lie outside protected areas. Some critical habitats for waterbirds are not included in individual protected areas, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces. Improved protection of these areas is urgently needed. However, conservation efforts in China's coastal wetlands face numerous challenges. Many important intertidal areas are increasingly threatened by ongoing and future reclamation plans. There is an urgent need to re-consider and limit the reclamation, particularly at critical sites, and put in place conservation measures to protect migratory waterbirds and their habitats. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.biocon.2016.07.025,2-s2.0-84995639267,68,0.70424514,0,ident pri sit and gap for the conserv of migr waterbird in chin s coast wetland many waterbird specy in particul migr shorebird on the east as australas flyway depend on the intertid area of coast chin in rec year thes habit hav suff sev shrinkage as a result of wetland loss and degrad ident crit area for waterbird and assess conserv stat has becom an urg pri for biolog conserv bas on the criter us to design rams sit and east as australas flyway partn eaafp flyway network sit a gen framework is propos and apply to ident pri sit in chin s coast wetland us a comprehend waterbird survey dataset sit pri wer evalu by us appear of glob threatened bird specy and bid specy excess of their glob or flyway pop and pop abund sit pri wer rank us an ‚äúirreplaceability index‚äù tot sit ar propos as pri sit consid the strategic import of chin s coast wetland for migr waterbird the conserv stat of chin s coast wetland is inadequ to protect thes waterbird cur of the pri sit lie outsid protect area som crit habit for waterbird ar not includ in individ protect area espec in jiangsu zhejiang and hebe provint improv protect of thes area is urg nee howev conserv effort in chin s coast wetland fac num challeng many import intertid area ar increas threatened by ongo and fut reclam plan ther is an urg nee to re consid and limit the reclam particul at crit sit and put in plac conserv meas to protect migr waterbird and their habit,new,0.7371185128935808,0.6771224776008195,0.632510246500508,0.5991885361790584,0.5739118203354971,0.554651642986434,0.5402602266398837,0.5302520417492851,0.524811110544287,0.5251841342496213,0.5350145394466165
381,bird_australasia,Climate warming and the rainforest birds of the Australian Wet Tropics: Using abundance data as a sensitive predictor of change in total population size,"Global average surface temperatures have increased rapidly over the last 100 years and there is accumulating evidence that climate change is already causing shifts in species' distributions. We use extensive abundance data and expected range shifts across altitudinal gradients to predict changes in total population size of rainforest birds of Australian tropical rainforests in response to climate warming. According to our most conservative model scenario, 74% of rainforest birds of north-eastern Australia are predicted to become threatened (including 26 critically endangered species) as a result of projected mid-range warming expected within the next 100 years. Extinction risk varies according to where along the altitudinal gradient a species is currently most abundant. Upland birds are most affected and are likely to be immediately threatened by even small increases in temperature. In contrast, there is a capacity for the population size of lowland species to increase, at least in the short term. We conclude that abundance data collected across climatic gradients will be fundamental to gaining an understanding of population size change associated with climate warming. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

422,bird_australasia,Temporal variation in a savanna bird assemblage: What changes over 5 years?,"Tropical savanna environments are characterised by annual and decadal patterns of resource change, which can affect the patterning of mobile fauna such as birds. In this study, we sampled 60 sites in northern Queensland, four times from 2004 to 2008. We investigated how the bird richness and abundance, and species turnover changed over the sample years and how this differed with vegetation structure. The mean abundance per site was highest in 2005 (92.1 ¬± 12.0 individuals ha -1) and lowest in 2008 (46.6¬±3.3), whereas species richness per site was highest in 2004 (19.6 ¬± 0.9 species ha -1) and lowest again in 2008 (14.7¬±0.8). Nine species were most abundant in 2004 coincident with extremely high rainfall preceding the survey in that year. Species turnover increased across all sites from 2004 to 2008 and the abundance of 13 species was best accounted for by differences in vegetation structure. Our study demonstrates that local bird communities in the semi-arid fringe of savannas can change rapidly, and mostly where vegetation is modified. This suggests that increased land-use and climate change in northern Australia could have significant effects on the avifauna over fairly short periods. ¬© 2012 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.",10.1071/MU11054,2-s2.0-84857773948,14,0.6693737820000001,1,temp vary in a savann bird assembl what chang ov year trop savann environ ar charact by an and decad pattern of resourc chang which can affect the pattern of mobl faun such as bird in thi study we sampl sit in northern queensland four tim from to we investig how the bird rich and abund and specy turnov chang ov the sampl year and how thi diff with veget structure the mean abund per sit was highest in ¬± individ ha and lowest in ¬± wherea specy rich per sit was highest in ¬± specy ha and lowest again in ¬± nin specy wer most abund in coincid with extrem high rainfal prec the survey in that year specy turnov increas across al sit from to and the abund of specy was best account for by diff in veget structure our study demonst that loc bird commun in the sem arid fring of savanna can chang rapid and most wher veget is mod thi suggest that increas land us and clim chang in northern austral could hav sign effect on the avifaun ov fair short period,new,0.7461529857883473,0.67847501663163,0.6282399951589716,0.5905264357179985,0.5614913837345575,0.5387263300724648,0.5207771230138241,0.5068157920818266,0.49649888100545964,0.49005359689596356,0.48873060932746876

Time of day had no significant effect on total numbers of species, total numbers of individuals of all species, and numbers of New Zealand scaup counted. However, rank abundance plots indicated a time of day effect on counts made at the least elevated of the observer positions.

45,bird_australasia,"Winter habitat use by the endangered, migratory Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolor) in New South Wales","Migratory birds are dependent on a combination of suitable wintering, migration and breeding habitats. Identification and protection of these habitats is essential for the conservation of the birds. The endangered Swift Parrot (Psittacidae:Lathamus discolor) migrates north from Tasmania to south-eastern mainland Australia in search of suitable winter food resources. This 5-year study examines the use of known winter foraging habitats by Swift Parrots on a state-wide scale not previously attempted. Swift Parrots used a diversity of winter foraging habitats in regions of the coast and western slopes of New South Wales each year, including several habitats that occur in endangered ecological communities. The abundance of Swift Parrots in New South Wales fluctuated significantly between years and regions, with coastal areas providing important drought-refuge habitats for a large proportion of the population. Over half of all foraging sites were used repeatedly, highlighting their likely importance for conservation. Landscapes containing winter foraging habitat included scattered trees, remnant vegetation and continuous forests, and Swift Parrots foraged extensively on lerp and nectar from a diversity of tree species within these. The occurrence of Swift Parrots at foraging sites was primarily associated with the abundance of lerp, nectar and non-aggressive competitors. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2008.",10.1071/MU07033,2-s2.0-40749102906,19,0.663953338,1,wint habit us by the endang migr swift parrot latham discol in new sou wal migr bird ar depend on a combin of suit wint migr and bree habit id and protect of thes habit is ess for the conserv of the bird the endang swift parrot psittacida latham discol migr nor from tasman to sou eastern mainland austral in search of suit wint food resourc thi year study examin the us of known wint for habit by swift parrot on a stat wid scal not prevy attempt swift parrot us a divers of wint for habit in reg of the coast and western slop of new sou wal each year includ sev habit that occ in endang ecolog commun the abund of swift parrot in new sou wal fluctu sign between year and reg with coast area provid import drought refug habit for a larg proport of the pop ov half of al for sit wer us rep highlight their lik import for conserv landscap contain wint for habit includ scat tre remn veget and continu forest and swift parrot for extend on lerp and nect from a divers of tre specy within thes the occur of swift parrot at for sit was prim assocy with the abund of lerp nect and non aggress competit,new,0.7202322560280948,0.6502637708010482,0.5986018268954812,0.560282275951676,0.531338539061293,0.5092744712404201,0.4926281559651581,0.4806760240330788,0.47337128231093933,0.47164815584990116,0.47855194108450044
47,bird_australasia,"Climatic seasonality, resource bottlenecks, and abundance of rainforest birds: Implications for global climate change","We demonstrate that within-year climatic variability, particularly rainfall seasonality, is the most significant variable explaining spatial patterns of bird abundance in Australian tropical rainforest. The likely mechanism causing this pattern is a resource bottleneck (insects, nectar, and fruit) during the dry season that limits the population size of many species. The patterns support both the diversity-climatic-stability hypothesis and the species-energy hypothesis but clearly show that seasonality in energy availability may be a more significant factor than annual totals or means. An index of dry season severity is proposed that quantifies the combined effect of the degree of dryness and the duration of the dry season. We suggest that the predicted increases in seasonality due to global climate change could produce significant declines in bird abundance, further exacerbating the impacts of decreased range size, increased fragmentation, and decreased population size likely to occur as a result of increasing temperature. We suggest that increasing climatic seasonality due to global climate change has the potential to have significant negative impacts on tropical biodiversity. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00418.x,2-s2.0-37149021964,10,0.659869649,0,clim season resourc bottleneck and abund of rainforest bird imply for glob clim chang we demonst that within year clim vary particul rainfal season is the most sign vary explain spat pattern of bird abund in aust trop rainforest the lik mech caus thi pattern is a resourc bottleneck insect nect and fruit dur the dry season that limit the pop siz of many specy the pattern support both the divers clim stabl hypothes and the specy energy hypothes but clear show that season in energy avail may be a mor sign fact than an tot or mean an index of dry season sev is propos that quant the combin effect of the degr of dry and the dur of the dry season we suggest that the predict increas in season due to glob clim chang could produc sign declin in bird abund furth exacerb the impact of decreas rang siz increas frag and decreas pop siz lik to occ as a result of increas temp we suggest that increas clim season due to glob clim chang has the pot to hav sign neg impact on trop biodivers,new,0.7221888500872649,0.6737265695423742,0.6390815346782117,0.6141231456990329,0.5960616517229521,0.5832669897445981,0.574878559801721,0.5706131321546359,0.5707705644983121,0.5765842400980111,0.5913261399292858
48,bird_australasia,Do exotic vertebrates structure the biota of Australia? An experimental test in New South Wales,"From 1993 to 2001, we conducted a series of experiments in a mixed grassland-woodland system in central New South Wales (NSW) to quantify the interactions between red foxes and their prey and competitors. Foxes were removed from two areas around the perimeter of Lake Burrendong, and data were collected from these areas and a nearby untreated area before, during, and after the period of fox control. The arrival of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1996 provided an opportunity to examine the interactive effects of controlling foxes and rabbits. In this landscape, typical of central NSW, (a) the fox population was not affected by a large reduction in the abundance of rabbits, or vice versa; (b) the cat population declined in areas where foxes were removed after the large RHD-induced reduction in rabbit numbers, but there was no consistent response to the removal of foxes; (c) the abundance of some macropod species increased in response only to the combined removal of rabbits and foxes; (d) there were no consistent changes in the abundances of bird species in response to the removal of either foxes or rabbits, but there were clear habitat differences in bird species richness; and (e) there was likely to be an increase in woody plant species after the large reduction in rabbit populations by RHD. We conclude that (a) long-term field experiments (more than 3 years) are required to quantify the indirect consequences of controlling foxes and rabbits, and (b) single manipulations, such as fox control or rabbit control, are not necessarily sufficient for the conservation of remnant woodland communities in southeastern Australia. ¬© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",10.1007/s10021-004-0173-0,2-s2.0-33750273032,21,0.659311436,1,do exot vertebr structure the biot of austral an expery test in new sou wal from to we conduc a sery of expery in a mix grassland woodland system in cent new sou wal nsw to quant the interact between red fox and their prey and competit fox wer remov from two area around the perimet of lak burrendong and dat wer collect from thes area and a nearby unt are bef dur and aft the period of fox control the ar of rabbit hemorrh diseas rhd in provid an opportun to examin the interact effect of control fox and rabbit in thi landscap typ of cent nsw a the fox pop was not affect by a larg reduc in the abund of rabbit or vic vers b the cat pop declin in area wher fox wer remov aft the larg rhd induc reduc in rabbit numb but ther was no consist respons to the remov of fox c the abund of som macropod specy increas in respons on to the combin remov of rabbit and fox d ther wer no consist chang in the abund of bird specy in respons to the remov of eith fox or rabbit but ther wer clear habit diff in bird specy rich and e ther was lik to be an increas in woody plant specy aft the larg reduc in rabbit pop by rhd we conclud that a long term field expery mor than year ar requir to quant the indirect consequ of control fox and rabbit and b singl manip such as fox control or rabbit control ar not necess sufficy for the conserv of remn woodland commun in southeastern austral,new,0.7417786244058308,0.7143778035049373,0.6961739366869105,0.6840143017359096,0.6761775274250792,0.671807963112924,0.6705949587812556,0.6726837688999148,0.6787908351297761,0.6906954384348438,0.7125575506952629

Stoat and ship rat (Rattus rattus) captures were used as a measure of relative abundance over time, and rat and mouse (Mus musculus) abundance was indexed using tracking tunnels between spring 2002 and winter 2004. There were major increases in rat captures in spring of 2002 and again in spring of 2003. Stoat captures peaked in the following summers, as rat captures declined. Rats and invertebrates were major components of stoat diet, occurring in 41% and 52% of guts respectively; birds were found in 19%. Changes in these percentages with time indicated that stoats shifted their diet from rats to birds and invertebrates as rat abundance (as indexed by tracking tunnels) decreased. The greatest impact on native species is therefore likely to be when rat abundance is declining after major irruptions, as the increased consumption of birds and invertebrates overlaps with the periods of highest stoat abundance. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",,2-s2.0-46849112595,8,0.651540198,1,diet of sto at okarito kiw sanctu sou westland new zealand the diet of sto mustel ermine caught within the okarito kiw sanctu sou westland new zealand between and was study by assess of gut cont sto and ship rat ratt ratt capt wer us as a meas of rel abund ov tim and rat and mous mus muscul abund was index us track tunnel between spring and wint ther wer maj increas in rat capt in spring of and again in spring of sto capt peak in the follow sum as rat capt declin rat and invertebr wer maj compon of sto diet occur in and of gut respect bird wer found in chang in thes perc with tim ind that sto shift their diet from rat to bird and invertebr as rat abund as index by track tunnel decreas the greatest impact on nat specy is theref lik to be when rat abund is declin aft maj irrupt as the increas consum of bird and invertebr overlap with the period of highest sto abund,new,0.6842647760357142,0.6326631204099433,0.5974564679972262,0.5730809310111897,0.556164092415214,0.5448960172171216,0.5384332113626669,0.5366605303890283,0.5402749601242196,0.5513626367390747,0.575169449002256
56,bird_australasia,Setting conservation priorities for migratory networks under uncertainty,"Conserving migratory species requires protecting connected habitat along the pathways they travel. Despite recent improvements in tracking animal movements, migratory connectivity remains poorly resolved at a population level for the vast majority of species, thus conservation prioritization is hampered. To address this data limitation, we developed a novel approach to spatial prioritization based on a model of potential connectivity derived from empirical data on species abundance and distance traveled between sites during migration. We applied the approach to migratory shorebirds of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Conservation strategies that prioritized sites based on connectivity and abundance metrics together maintained larger populations of birds than strategies that prioritized sites based only on abundance metrics. The conservation value of a site therefore depended on both its capacity to support migratory animals and its position within the migratory pathway; the loss of crucial sites led to partial or total population collapse. We suggest that conservation approaches that prioritize sites supporting large populations of migrants should, where possible, also include data on the spatial arrangement of sites. ¬© 2016 Society for Conservation Biology",10.1111/cobi.12842,2-s2.0-85011305975,2,0.644726207,0,set conserv pri for migr network und uncertainty conserv migr specy requir protect connect habit along the pathway they travel despit rec improv in track anim mov migr connect remain poor resolv at a pop level for the vast maj of specy thu conserv priorit is hamp to address thi dat limit we develop a novel approach to spat priorit bas on a model of pot connect der from empir dat on specy abund and dist travel between sit dur migr we apply the approach to migr shorebird of the east as australas flyway conserv strategies that priorit sit bas on connect and abund met togeth maintain larg pop of bird than strategies that priorit sit bas on on abund met the conserv valu of a sit theref depend on both it capac to support migr anim and it posit within the migr pathway the loss of cruc sit led to part or tot pop collaps we suggest that conserv approach that priorit sit support larg pop of migr should wher poss also includ dat on the spat arrang of sit,new,0.6849767474233583,0.6155615360289554,0.5651206387758315,0.5280976992985534,0.5004520106036157,0.4797248611190335,0.4645277046401713,0.4542536718602437,0.44906345370503253,0.45033354112493623,0.4622209883440334
61,bird_australasia,Large-scale spatial and temporal dynamics of the vulnerable and highly mobile superb parrot,"Aim: To investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the vulnerable and highly mobile superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii) across its range in south-eastern mainland Australia. Location: South-eastern Australia (27¬∞-37¬∞S latitude and 141¬∞-151¬∞E longitude). Methods: We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to model time-specific bird atlas occurrence data against time-specific plant productivity data, plus a range of environmental predictor variables. We then examined the effects of environmental variables on the temporal and spatial patterns of predicted abundance and distribution of the superb parrot using a correlative mapping approach. Results: Key findings from GAM analysis were: (1) there was a strong positive relationship between abundance and plant productivity in all regions, but (2) the response of abundance to other predictor variables often differed between regions. Correlative mapping predictions of the abundance and distribution of the superb parrot also indicated that: (1) predicted abundance varied through time and space, (2) predicted abundance sometimes decreased in all regions, but at other times some regions had high abundance when others had low, and (3) changes in plant productivity (and therefore climate) were associated with this variation. Main conclusion: The superb parrot favours productive landscapes that are also favoured for agriculture. Movements appear to be associated with seasonal and year to year climate variability. Thus, variation in the recorded abundance of the superb parrot may mask population trends, suggesting that existing population estimates are unreliable. Also, high abundances in some areas, and at some times, may reflect deteriorating habitat conditions elsewhere rather than species recovery. Temporal variability in the distribution of the superb parrot makes it difficult to identify specific drought refugia. Consequently, through time, as key habitat continues to deteriorate, the species will become increasingly vulnerable and threatened. Whole-landscape habitat conservation and restoration strategies are therefore needed to sustain superb parrot populations in the long-term. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01603.x,2-s2.0-33846450258,16,0.632853398,1,larg scal spat and temp dynam of the vuln and high mobl superb parrot aim to investig the spat and temp dynam of the vuln and high mobl superb parrot polytel swainsoni across it rang in sou eastern mainland austral loc sou eastern austral ¬∞ ¬∞s latitud and ¬∞ ¬∞e longitud method we us gen addit model gam to model tim spec bird atla occur dat against tim spec plant produc dat plu a rang of environ predict vary we then examin the effect of environ vary on the temp and spat pattern of predict abund and distribut of the superb parrot us a correl map approach result key find from gam analys wer ther was a strong posit rel between abund and plant produc in al reg but the respons of abund to oth predict vary oft diff between reg correl map predict of the abund and distribut of the superb parrot also ind that predict abund vary through tim and spac predict abund sometim decreas in al reg but at oth tim som reg had high abund when oth had low and chang in plant produc and theref clim wer assocy with thi vary main conclud the superb parrot favo produc landscap that ar also favo for agricult mov appear to be assocy with season and year to year clim vary thu vary in the record abund of the superb parrot may mask pop trend suggest that ex pop estim ar unrely also high abund in som area and at som tim may reflect detery habit condit elsewh rath than specy recovery temp vary in the distribut of the superb parrot mak it difficult to ident spec drought refug consequ through tim as key habit continu to detery the specy wil becom increas vuln and threatened whol landscap habit conserv and rest strategies ar theref nee to sustain superb parrot pop in the long term,new,0.6759276443306866,0.6062662278583199,0.5577168044653551,0.5230381878314216,0.49761152151080584,0.47882265171655164,0.46524183536554303,0.4562200158294598,0.4517932390852015,0.4529736095469027,0.4628644443101281

We recorded a high rate of incidence and large numbers of the hyper-aggressive noisy miner Manorina melanocephala (Passeriformes: Meliphagidae) at the majority of our survey sites, a phenomenon rarely reported in non-cleared landscapes. As shown by numerous studies in fragmented landscapes, the distribution of this species in our study had a substantial negative effect upon the distribution of small passerine species. Noisy miners exerted the strongest influence upon small passerine abundance, and masked any forest management effects. However, key habitat features important for small passerines were identified, including a relatively high density of large trees and stems in the midstorey. Selective logging appeared to exert a minimal effect upon noisy miner abundance, whereas grazing intensity had a profound, positive influence. Noisy miners were most abundant in intensively grazed forest with minimal midstorey and a low volume of coarse woody debris. Higher road density in the forest landscape also corresponded with increased numbers of noisy miners. Reduction in grazing pressure in Brigalow Belt forests has the potential to benefit small passerine assemblages across large areas through moderating noisy miner abundance. The strong relationship between noisy miners and small passerines suggests that noisy miner abundance could act as an easily measured indicator of forest condition, potentially contributing to monitoring of forest management outcomes. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.",10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01979.x,2-s2.0-69549103166,18,0.629720442,0,impact of graz select log and hyp aggress on diurn bird faun in intact forest landscap of the brigalow belt queensland the impact of forest man on diurn bird assembl and abund was investig in contigu tract of eucalypt forest in the brigalow belt bioreg sou cent queensland sit wer loc across three level of livestock graz intens and three level of select log intens within the most extend habit typ corymb citriodor domin forest we record a high rat of incid and larg numb of the hyp aggress noisy min manorin melanocephal passeriform meliphagida at the maj of our survey sit a phenomenon rar report in non clear landscap as shown by num study in frag landscap the distribut of thi specy in our study had a subst neg effect upon the distribut of smal passerin specy noisy min exert the strongest influ upon smal passerin abund and mask any forest man effect howev key habit feat import for smal passerin wer ident includ a rel high dens of larg tre and stem in the midstorey select log appear to exert a minim effect upon noisy min abund wherea graz intens had a profound posit influ noisy min wer most abund in intend graz forest with minim midstorey and a low volum of coars woody debr high road dens in the forest landscap also correspond with increas numb of noisy min reduc in graz press in brigalow belt forest has the pot to benefit smal passerin assembl across larg area through mod noisy min abund the strong rel between noisy min and smal passerin suggest that noisy min abund could act as an easy meas ind of forest condit pot contribut to monit of forest man outcom,new,0.6925957120191498,0.607503309483026,0.5458428405687555,0.5006516031470742,0.46660399803243213,0.44042046807816004,0.4201459495075266,0.40467104548942995,0.39351558171808315,0.38692260829964537,0.3863479520250781
74,bird_australasia,Determinants of local abundance in a major radiation of Australian passerines (Aves: Meliphagoidea),"Aim: To identify the factors that contribute to variation in abundance (population density), and to investigate whether habitat breadth and diet breadth predict macroecological patterns in a suborder of passerine birds (Meliphagoidea). Location: Australia (including Tasmania). Methods: Mean abundance data were collated from site surveys of bird abundance (the Australian Bird Count); range size and latitudinal position data from published distribution maps; and body mass and diet breadth information from published accounts. A diversity index of habitats used (habitat breadth) was calculated from the bird census data. We used bivariate correlation and multiple regression techniques, employing two phylogenetic comparative methods: phylogenetic generalized least squares and independent contrasts. Results: Body mass and latitude were the only strong predictors of abundance, with larger-bodied and lower-latitude species existing at lower densities. Together, however, body mass and latitude explained only 11.1% of the variation in mean abundance. Range size and habitat breadth were positively correlated, as were diet breadth and body mass. However, neither range size, nor habitat breadth and diet breadth, explained patterns in abundance either directly or indirectly. Main conclusions: Levels of abundance (population density) in meliphagoid birds are most closely linked to body mass and latitudinal position, but not range size. As with many other macroecological analyses, we find little evidence for aspects of niche breadth having an effect on patterns of abundance. We hypothesize that evolutionary age may also have a determining effect on why species tend to be rarer (less abundant) in the tropics. ¬© 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01432.x,2-s2.0-33645997682,3,0.610155132,0,determin of loc abund in a maj rady of aust passerin av meliphagoide aim to ident the fact that contribut to vary in abund pop dens and to investig wheth habit bread and diet bread predict macroecolog pattern in a subord of passerin bird meliphagoide loc austral includ tasman method mean abund dat wer col from sit survey of bird abund the aust bird count rang siz and latitudin posit dat from publ distribut map and body mass and diet bread inform from publ account a divers index of habit us habit bread was calc from the bird cens dat we us biv correl and multipl regress techn employ two phylogenet comp method phylogenet gen least squ and independ contrast result body mass and latitud wer the on strong predict of abund with larg body and low latitud specy ex at low dens togeth howev body mass and latitud explain on of the vary in mean abund rang siz and habit bread wer posit correl as wer diet bread and body mass howev neith rang siz nor habit bread and diet bread explain pattern in abund eith direct or indirect main conclud level of abund pop dens in meliphagoid bird ar most clos link to body mass and latitudin posit but not rang siz as with many oth macroecolog analys we find littl evid for aspect of nich bread hav an effect on pattern of abund we hypothes that evolv ag may also hav a determin effect on why specy tend to be rar less abund in the trop,new,0.6476306512672679,0.5448740018886618,0.47168458402040414,0.4191569834992829,0.3803486690273537,0.3509691355472239,0.32845654159656706,0.31133993667142107,0.29895130667533615,0.2915099199806019,0.2908576490532459
77,bird_australasia,"Latitudinal gradients in abundance, and the causes of rarity in the tropics: A test using Australian honeyeaters (Aves: Meliphagidae)","Several studies have uncovered interspecific latitudinal gradients in abundance (population density) such that tropical species tend to be, on average, less abundant than species at higher latitudes. The causes of this relationship remain poorly studied, in contrast to the relative wealth of literature examining the relationship to latitude of other variables such as range size and body mass. We used a cross-species phylogenetic comparative approach and a spatial approach to examine three potential determining factors (distribution, reproductive output and climate) that might explain why abundance correlates with latitude, using data from 54 species of honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) in woodland environments in eastern Australia. There is a strong positive correlation between mean abundance and latitude in these birds. Reproductive output (clutch size) was positively linked to both abundance and latitude, but partial correlation analysis revealed that clutch size is not related to abundance once the effects of latitude are removed. A subsequent multiple regression model that also considered range size, clutch size and body mass showed that latitude is the only strong predictor of abundance in honeyeaters. In the separate spatial analysis, the climatic variables that we considered (temperature, rainfall and seasonality) were all strongly linked to latitude, but none served as a better predictor of abundance than latitude per se, either individually or collectively. The most intriguing result of our analyses was that the cross-species latitudinal pattern in abundance was not evident within species. This suggests an intrinsic cause of the pattern of 'rarity in the tropics' in Australian honeyeaters. We suggest that evolutionary age may provide a key to understanding patterns of abundance in these birds. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.",10.1007/s00442-006-0456-6,2-s2.0-33748040772,6,0.5906585670000001,0,latitudin grady in abund and the caus of rar in the trop a test us aust honey av meliphagida sev study hav uncov interspec latitudin grady in abund pop dens such that trop specy tend to be on av less abund than specy at high latitud the caus of thi rel remain poor study in contrast to the rel weal of lit examin the rel to latitud of oth vary such as rang siz and body mass we us a cross specy phylogenet comp approach and a spat approach to examin three pot determin fact distribut reproduc output and clim that might explain why abund correl with latitud us dat from specy of honey meliphagida in woodland environ in eastern austral ther is a strong posit correl between mean abund and latitud in thes bird reproduc output clutch siz was posit link to both abund and latitud but part correl analys rev that clutch siz is not rel to abund ont the effect of latitud ar remov a subsequ multipl regress model that also consid rang siz clutch siz and body mass show that latitud is the on strong predict of abund in honey in the sep spat analys the clim vary that we consid temp rainfal and season wer al strongly link to latitud but non serv as a bet predict of abund than latitud per se eith individ or collect the most intrigu result of our analys was that the cross specy latitudin pattern in abund was not evid within specy thi suggest an intrins caus of the pattern of rar in the trop in aust honey we suggest that evolv ag may provid a key to understand pattern of abund in thes bird,new,0.6399486097305882,0.5584529173211352,0.5015602199317923,0.460943151169449,0.4311233144489217,0.408920907319154,0.3925411542058305,0.3810888810666075,0.3744259334660227,0.37344548090783203,0.3812118272621439
100,bird_australasia,Hybridisation between mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and grey duck (A. superciliosa) on Lord Howe Island and management options,"Introduced mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) occur on many islands of the South Pacific, where they hybridise with the resident grey duck (A. superciliosa). In October 2007, we conducted systematic surveys of Lord Howe Island to estimate the abundance and distribution of grey ducks, mallards, and their hybrids. Hybrids were common in areas of high public use, particularly where there was mown or grazed grass. Phenotypic characteristics suggest that mallards are now dominant and have supplanted the native grey duck, with 81% of birds classified as mallard or mallard-like hybrids, 17% as intermediate hybrids and only 2% as grey duck-like hybrids. No pure grey duck were observed. These hybrids pose direct and indirect economic, social and environmental impacts to Lord Howe Island. A management program to remove mallards using trapping, shooting and opportunistic capture by hand was conducted in October 2007. Standardised indices of duck abundance before and after management indicates that the total population was reduced by 71.7%. Eradication of mallard and hybrids from Lord Howe Island is considered achievable with a program of education, monitoring, and continued control to prevent re-establishment. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",,2-s2.0-58149216174,12,0.511806189,0,hybrid between mallard ana platyrhyncho and grey duck a supercilios on lord how island and man opt introduc mallard ana platyrhyncho occ on many island of the sou pac wher they hybrid with the resid grey duck a supercilios in octob we conduc system survey of lord how island to estim the abund and distribut of grey duck mallard and their hybrid hybrid wer common in area of high publ us particul wher ther was mown or graz grass phenotyp charact suggest that mallard ar now domin and hav suppl the nat grey duck with of bird class as mallard or mallard lik hybrid as intermedy hybrid and on as grey duck lik hybrid no pur grey duck wer observ thes hybrid pos direct and indirect econom soc and environ impact to lord how island a man program to remov mallard us trap shoot and opportun capt by hand was conduc in octob standard ind of duck abund bef and aft man ind that the tot pop was reduc by erad of mallard and hybrid from lord how island is consid achiev with a program of educ monit and continu control to prev re est,new,0.5016796294316469,0.4525809167363725,0.42303777951035704,0.40565061472929537,0.3964810754358231,0.3937064832808097,0.39679691868650624,0.4062977342731284,0.4241771871120315,0.45516789463342605,0.5106577597826536

114,bird_nearctic,Long-term demography of the Northern Goshawk in a variable environment,"The Nearctic northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillis) is a resident of conifer, broadleaf, and mixed forests from the boreal to the southwestern montane regions of North America. We report on a 20-year mark-recapture investigation (1991‚Äì2010) of the distribution and density of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change (Œª) of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern Arizona, USA. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding territories, representing approximately 87% of an estimated 144 total territories based on a mean distance of 3.8 km between territory centers in a 1,728-km2 study area. The salient demographic feature of the population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs, brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a current year ranged from 8% to 86% (x = 37%, SE = 4.51), annual mean nest failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12% to 48% (overall (x) = 23%, SE = 2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful nests (fledged ‚â•1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall x = 2.0 young, SE = 0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey abundance. The best breeding years (1992‚Äì1993, 77‚Äì87% of pairs laid eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8% of pairs laid eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success was 83% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling sex ratio did not differ from unity (53% M; n = 410 M, 366 F) but was significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year. Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations, suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex. Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population averaged 43% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years of study (1999‚Äì2010), an estimated 46% of breeding recruits were locally born and 54% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes. Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged ‚â•4 years based on plumage at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of Œª for breeding adults (M, 0.94, SE = 0.037; F, 0.98, SE = 0.038) provided only weak evidence for a population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top survival model, models including age + sex were competitive, evidencing lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the occurrence of sex effects in the top Œª model. Lower male survival may result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more frequent production (53%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770 ha (equal to 3 goshawk territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires burned another 30,945 ha during our study and killed most (&gt;64%) of the forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult Œª estimates overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the 20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists, especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire. ¬© 2017 The Wildlife Society. ¬©

214,bird_nearctic,"Seasonal and longitudinal variation in the abundance and diversity of shorebirds (aves, charadriiformes) on Atalaia beach in Northeastern Brazil","Many Nearctic shorebirds cover vast areas during their annual migrations, and depend on an ample network of stopover and wintering areas for their survival. In this study, long-term data are presented on the occurrence of shorebirds at one such site on the coast of the state of Sergipe in northeastem Brazil. A 5-km long stretch of Atalaia Beach was surveyed each month between July 2003 and May 2006 (1-6 surveys per month, total = 101). The surveys resulted in records of three resident shorebird species (Vanellus chilensis, Charadrius collaris and Charadrius wilsonia) and ten Nearctic migrants (Charadriidae and Scolopacidae). The local abundance of these migrants followed a predictable pattern, with the main influx starting at the end of September, during the boreal autumn (with Charadrius semipalmatus arriving slightly earlier). The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and the Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) were the most abundant species throughout the study period, peaking at 1200 and 700 birds, respectively, in November-February. Some sanderlings (Calidris alba). Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), and Semipalmated plovers (C. semipalmatus) almost certainly overwinter at the site, and remained in the study area throughout the year, whereas the bimodal distribution of the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) indicates the use of the beach as a stopover during migration to wintering sites further south. Whilst more species were recorded during the first year, counts were lower than in subsequent years, possibly reflecting natural fluctuations in abundance or migration patterns. Overall, the data indicate that the site may be an important stopover or wintering site for populations of at least five species of Nearctic migrants, while it may be visited periodically by a number of other species. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",,2-s2.0-79952126419,11,0.857401897,1,season and longitudin vary in the abund and divers of shorebird av charadriiform on atala beach in northeastern brazil many nearct shorebird cov vast area dur their an migr and depend on an ampl network of stopov and wint area for their surv in thi study long term dat ar pres on the occur of shorebird at on such sit on the coast of the stat of sergip in northeastem brazil a km long stretch of atala beach was survey each mon between july and may survey per mon tot the survey result in record of three resid shorebird specy vanell chilens charadri coll and charadri wilson and ten nearct migr charadriida and scolopacida the loc abund of thes migr follow a predict pattern with the main influx start at the end of septemb dur the bor autumn with charadri semipalmat ar slight ear the semipalm sandpip calidr pusill and the semipalm plov charadri semipalmat wer the most abund specy throughout the study period peak at and bird respect in novemb febru som sanderl calidr alb ruddy turnston arenar interpr and semipalm plov c semipalmat almost certain overwint at the sit and remain in the study are throughout the year wherea the bimod distribut of the whit rump sandpip calidr fuscicol ind the us of the beach as a stopov dur migr to wint sit furth sou whilst mor specy wer record dur the first year count wer low than in subsequ year poss reflect nat fluctu in abund or migr pattern overal the dat ind that the sit may be an import stopov or wint sit for pop of at least fiv specy of nearct migr whil it may be visit period by a numb of oth specy,new,0.8977302780354561,0.866358146988747,0.8402054969983367,0.8181589518513386,0.7989965717812338,0.7817817470522257,0.7657854898069584,0.7503547279982401,0.7347508404467171,0.7178398508212969,0.6973393498842091

Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ¬± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ¬± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ¬± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ¬± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ¬± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ¬± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ¬± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ¬± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6. Additional data from multiple species, especially measures of habitat-specific demography and dispersal, will improve our understanding of the relative impacts of the breeding, migratory, and winter periods on population dynamics of migratory birds and thus enhance future conservation efforts.",10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00599.x,2-s2.0-0036107393,30,0.84251267,0,vary in surv of a migr songbird throughout it an cyc demograph dat from both bree and non bree period ar nee to man pop of migr bird many of which ar declin in abund and ar of conserv concern although habit assocy and to a less ext reproduc biolog ar known for many migr specy few study hav meas surv rat of thes bird at diff part of their an cyc cormack jol seb model and akaik s inform crit model select wer us to investig season vary in surv of a nearct neotrop migr songbird the black throated blu warbl dendroic caerulesc season and an surv wer estim from resight of colo ring individ on bree ground in new hampshir us from to and on wint quart in jamaic west indy from to warbl wer study each year dur the may august bree period in new hampshir and dur the octob march overwint period in jamaic in new hampshir mal had high an surv ¬± and recapt prob ¬± than did fem surv ¬± recapt ¬± in jamaic an surv ¬± and recapt ¬± prob did not diff between sex an surv and recapt prob of young bird i e yearl in new hampshir and hatch year bird in jamaic did not diff from adult ind that from the tim hatch year individ acquir territ on wint quart in mid octob they surv as wel as adult within the sam habit month surv prob dur the sum may august and wint octob march stat period wer high for mal in new hampshir and ¬± for mal in jamaic and for fem in both loc thes an and season surv estim wer us to calc warbl surv for the migr period month surv prob dur migr rang from to ¬± thu app mort rat wer at least tim high dur migr comp to that in the stat period and mor than of app an mort of d caerulesc occur dur migr addit dat from multipl specy espec meas of habit spec demograph and dispers wil improv our understand of the rel impact of the bree migr and wint period on pop dynam of migr bird and thu enh fut conserv effort,new,0.89624475720878,0.8699244684255669,0.8480160308289068,0.8295758843640609,0.8136772625261787,0.7996182763768438,0.7868667873308722,0.7749807345525174,0.7635282530216092,0.7519303257328444,0.7391601698048573
53,bird_nearctic,New species records and changes in abundance of waterfowl in northwest Greenland,"Breeding populations of Nearctic and Palearctic waterfowl have undergone significant changes in abundance and distribution over the past 50 years. The Avanersuaq District in northwest Greenland is home to an assemblage of waterfowl from both geographic areas; however, minimal historic or current information is available on species abundance. In 2008 and 2009, we conducted field surveys in Greenland from 76.00¬∞ to 77.35¬∞N for breeding and non-breeding waterfowl and have collected anecdotal field notes of avian observations over a 20-year period (1993-2012). During these periods, we documented the first observation of a Ross's goose (Chen rossii) and the first confirmed breeding by lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in Greenland. Northern pintails (Anas acuta) were observed for the first time in northwest Greenland, and a previously unknown breeding location for brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) was also identified. Local populations of greater snow (C. c.) and Canada geese (B. canadensis) have increased in size. The Booth Sound and Drown Bay wetland areas and many islands throughout the Avanersuaq District were identified as critical habitat for both breeding and non-breeding waterfowl. Further increases in waterfowl abundance, including more frequent rare and new visitors, are likely in the study area as breeding populations further south continue to increase and an ameliorating climate allows for a longer breeding season. These results will prove useful as a baseline for comparisons with future surveys. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-014-1520-z,2-s2.0-84905243565,6,0.819291984,1,new specy record and chang in abund of waterfowl in northwest greenland bree pop of nearct and palearct waterfowl hav undergon sign chang in abund and distribut ov the past year the avanersuaq district in northwest greenland is hom to an assembl of waterfowl from both geograph area howev minim hist or cur inform is avail on specy abund in and we conduc field survey in greenland from ¬∞ to ¬∞n for bree and non bree waterfowl and hav collect anecdot field not of av observ ov a year period dur thes period we docu the first observ of a ross s goos chen rossi and the first confirm bree by less snow gees chen caerulesc caerulesc in greenland northern pintail ana acut wer observ for the first tim in northwest greenland and a prevy unknown bree loc for brent gees brant bernicl hrot was also ident loc pop of gre snow c c and canad gees b canadens hav increas in siz the boo sound and drown bay wetland area and many island throughout the avanersuaq district wer ident as crit habit for both bree and non bree waterfowl furth increas in waterfowl abund includ mor frequ rar and new visit ar lik in the study are as bree pop furth sou continu to increas and an am clim allow for a long bree season thes result wil prov us as a baselin for comparison with fut survey,new,0.8633214647616313,0.8238609337457016,0.7917632722293385,0.7657454075390532,0.7443059814438238,0.7263403171658889,0.7111083781314195,0.6981462665320637,0.6872321186760831,0.6784305278524121,0.672425257338784
63,bird_nearctic,Habitat quality and habitat selection of golden-winged warblers in Costa Rica: An application of hierarchical models for open populations,"Identifying high-quality habitat is integral to effective species conservation efforts and requires information about habitat-specific abundance and demographics. This information is lacking for many species of conservation concern because of the inherent difficulties associated with implementing mark-recapture studies at large spatial scales. The golden-winged warbler Vermivora chrysoptera is a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird experiencing a long-term population decline; yet no information about non-breeding season habitat quality or habitat selection exists to inform conservation efforts. We used a novel hierarchical model that requires only spatially and temporally replicated count data to estimate habitat-specific abundance, apparent survival, recruitment and detection probability of golden-winged warblers wintering in Costa Rica. We quantified habitat selection at the home-range level using radiotelemetry. Golden-winged warblers were absent from tropical dry forest and were most abundant in premontane evergreen forest. Within their home ranges, golden-winged warblers selected microhabitat features associated with intermediate disturbance that reflected their preference for foraging in hanging dead leaves. Consistent with other evidence of a declining population, local population size decreased over the duration of the study. The rate of decrease was higher during the non-breeding season than among seasons. We found no differences in apparent survival or recruitment among habitat types; however, our estimates of these parameters were imprecise. Synthesis and applications. Golden-winged warblers are forest-dependent species during the non-breeding season and have specialized microhabitat requirements that make them vulnerable to ongoing tropical deforestation. However, advanced secondary forests can provide the requisite microhabitat features, and because we found no evidence of reduced survival in this habitat type, regenerating forest on degraded lands may be an effective component of a conservation strategy for this species. Our study also demonstrates that information on population dynamics and habitat quality can be obtained using repeated counts instead of mark-recapture methods. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

76,bird_nearctic,"Shorebird seasonal abundance and habitat-use patterns in punta rasa, samboromb√≥n bay, Argentina","Shorebird assemblage composition and habitat-use patterns were characterized at Punta Rasa during the austral summer, autumn and winter. Compared to other sites within the region, this area showed high species richness, reflected by a total of 22 species recorded within a relatively short time frame. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by the use of estuarine mudflats and oceanic sandy beaches as feeding habitats. During low tide, more species used estuarine environments, achieving the highest total densities. Abundance patterns and assemblage composition also changed seasonally. Maximum total abundance occurred during the austral summer, and minimum total abundance during the austral winter. During the austral summer, the assemblage was dominated by Nearctic migrants such as American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica) and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). In addition, Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus) and American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) were abundant during the austral autumn. The Red Knot (Calidris canutus), a shorebird that dominated the austral autumn assemblage 25 years ago, was recorded in relatively small numbers during this study, probably reflecting the global population trend of a subspecies of the Red Knot (C. c. rufa) in the past two decades. During the austral winter, resident birds largely dominated the assemblage. However, it is noteworthy that some individuals of nine Nearctic migrant species remained in the area. In the case of the endangered Red Knot, Punta Rasa is, along with Lagoa do Peixe in Brazil, one of the sites in South America with the highest known abundances during the austral winter. .",10.1675/063.038.0109,2-s2.0-84926505057,4,0.739160613,1,shorebird season abund and habit us pattern in punt ras samboromb√≥n bay argentin shorebird assembl composit and habit us pattern wer charact at punt ras dur the aust sum autumn and wint comp to oth sit within the reg thi are show high specy rich reflect by a tot of specy record within a rel short tim fram diff in assembl structure wer driv by the us of estuarin mudfl and oc sandy beach as fee habit dur low tid mor specy us estuarin environ achiev the highest tot dens abund pattern and assembl composit also chang season maxim tot abund occur dur the aust sum and minim tot abund dur the aust wint dur the aust sum the assembl was domin by nearct migr such as am gold plov pluv dominic hudson godwit limos haemastic and whit rump sandpip calidr fuscicol in addit two band plov charadri falklandic and am oystercatch haematop palliat wer abund dur the aust autumn the red knot calidr canut a shorebird that domin the aust autumn assembl year ago was record in rel smal numb dur thi study prob reflect the glob pop trend of a subspecy of the red knot c c ruf in the past two decad dur the aust wint resid bird larg domin the assembl howev it is noteworthy that som individ of nin nearct migr specy remain in the are in the cas of the endang red knot punt ras is along with lago do peix in brazil on of the sit in sou americ with the highest known abund dur the aust wint,new,0.8035038167551183,0.7442249634261047,0.6978168892115573,0.6612611675293237,0.6317749105290167,0.607465651293515,0.5870944236977153,0.569851744214504,0.5552249394034948,0.542947316524179,0.533059352934531
84,bird_nearctic,"Migratory connectivity of a widely distributed songbird, the american redstart (Setophaga Ruticilla)","Determining the degree of connectivity between breeding and wintering populations is critical for understanding the ecology and evolution of migratory systems. We analyzed stable hydrogen isotopic compositions in tail feathers (Œ¥Dw) collected from 26 sites in 11 countries throughout the wintering range of the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), a Nearctic- Neotropical migratory passerine bird. Feathers were assumed to have molted on the breeding grounds, and Œ¥Dw was used to estimate breeding origin. Values of Œ¥Dw were highly correlated with longitude of sampling location, indicating that breeding populations were generally distributed along the east-west axis of the wintering grounds. Within the Caribbean region, Florida, and Bahamas, Œ¥Dw values were negatively correlated with winter latitude, which suggests that American Redstarts exhibit a pattern of chain migration in which individuals wintering at northern latitudes are also the most northern breeders. To identify the most probable breeding regions, we used a likelihood-assignment test incorporated with a prior probability of breeding abundance using Bayes's rule. Expected Œ¥D values of feathers from five breeding regions were based on interpolated Œ¥D values from a model of continent-wide growing-season Œ¥D values in precipitation (Œ¥Dp) and were adjusted to account for a discrimination factor between precipitation and feathers. At most wintering locations, breeding assignments were significantly different from expected frequencies based on relative breeding abundance. Birds wintering in eastern and western Mexico had a high probability of breeding in northwest and midwest North America, whereas birds in the Greater and Lesser Antilles were likely to have originated from breeding regions in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Migratory connectivity, such as we report here, implies that the dynamics of breeding and nonbreeding populations may be linked at a regional scale. These results provide a key opportunity for studying the year-round ecology and evolution of spatially connected populations in a migratory species. ¬© The American Ornithologists' Union 2006.",10.1642/0078-6594(2006)61[14:MCOAWD]2.0.CO;2,2-s2.0-67449166603,14,0.735613152,0,migr connect of a wid distribut songbird the am redstart setophag ruticill determin the degr of connect between bree and wint pop is crit for understand the ecolog and evolv of migr system we analys stabl hydrog isotop composit in tail feath œ¥dw collect from sit in country throughout the wint rang of the am redstart setophag ruticill a nearct neotrop migr passerin bird feath wer assum to hav molt on the bree ground and œ¥dw was us to estim bree origin valu of œ¥dw wer high correl with longitud of sampl loc ind that bree pop wer gen distribut along the east west ax of the wint ground within the carib reg florid and bahama œ¥dw valu wer neg correl with wint latitud which suggest that am redstart exhibit a pattern of chain migr in which individ wint at northern latitud ar also the most northern bree to ident the most prob bree reg we us a lik assign test incorp with a pri prob of bree abund us bay s rul expect œ¥d valu of feath from fiv bree reg wer bas on interpol œ¥d valu from a model of contin wid grow season œ¥d valu in precipit œ¥dp and wer adjust to account for a discrimin fact between precipit and feath at most wint loc bree assign wer sign diff from expect frequ bas on rel bree abund bird wint in eastern and western mexico had a high prob of bree in northwest and midwest nor americ wherea bird in the gre and less antil wer lik to hav origin from bree reg in the northeast and southeast respect migr connect such as we report her imply that the dynam of bree and nonbree pop may be link at a reg scal thes result provid a key opportun for study the year round ecolog and evolv of spat connect pop in a migr specy,new,0.7514806903873245,0.691503481584263,0.6470932758447164,0.614471734055296,0.5903809883352104,0.5727211833102556,0.5602942030262367,0.5526017397280479,0.549866366489033,0.5534077857599254,0.5670274685287449
93,bird_nearctic,Use of semi-intensive shrimp farms as alternative foraging areas by migratory shorebird populations in tropical areas,"Evaluating the ability of anthropogenic habitats to serve as surrogates for natural habitats is an increasingly relevant issue in conservation biology. This issue is especially urgent in tropical coastal wetlands that support large concentrations of migratory shorebird populations and are under pressure from development. Here we evaluated the species composition, abundance, and habitat use of Nearctic migratory shorebirds using recently harvested aquaculture ponds during two non-breeding seasons at shrimp farms surrounding Bah√≠a Santa Mar√≠a (BSM), northwestern Mexico. We also estimated shorebird densities at intertidal units in BSM during and after the harvesting season to explore the connectivity with shrimp farms. Over 25,000 individuals of 25 shorebird species used the surveyed farms (1/413% of shrimp-farm development in BSM; 2014-2015: 10 farms, 994 ha; 2015-2016: 8 farms, 924 ha) during the harvest season. The most abundant species were: Western Sandpiper Calidris mauri, Willet Tringa semipalmata, Marbled Godwit Limosa fedoa, dowitchers Limnodromus spp., Black-necked Stilt Himantopus mexicanus and American Avocet Recurvirostra americana. Numbers of birds decreased as the harvest cycle progressed. Most birds (> 70%) were foraging on the ponds, regardless of tidal stage, while numbers increased during high tide for the most abundant species. At surveyed intertidal areas, shorebird densities were overall similar within and between non-breeding seasons. These results indicate that shrimp farms offer ephemeral but consistent foraging habitats used by non-breeding shorebirds, even in vast coastal wetlands offering a high availability of natural intertidal mudflats. Assuming a similar shorebird use in other shrimp ponds not surveyed within BSM, a significant proportion (> 1% of the biogeographic population) of Willet, Marbled Godwit, and Western Sandpiper, as well as imperilled Red Knot Calidris canutus, might use shrimp farms throughout the harvesting season. Before including current semi-intensive shrimp farms within management plans of BSM, further research is mandatory to assess their utility as alternative foraging habitats for shorebird conservation at tropical areas.

102,bird_nearctic,Experimentally reducing neighbor density affects reproduction and behavior of a migratory songbird,"Because populations of territorial birds are relatively stable compared to those of other animal taxa, they are often considered to be tightly regulated. However, the mechanisms that produce density-dependent feedbacks on demographic rates and thus regulate these populations are poorly understood, particularly for migratory species. We conducted a three-year density-reduction experiment to investigate the behavioral mechanisms that regulate the abundance of a Nearctic-Neotropical migrant passerine, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), during the breeding season. We found that the number of young fledged per territory, territory size, and the proportion of time males spent foraging were significantly greater on territories around which neighbor density was experimentally reduced compared to control territories. Territory quality, proportion of nests depredated per territory, and male countersinging rates were not statistically different between treatments. These results indicate that individuals with more neighbors (i.e., in neighborhoods with greater conspecific density) have reduced breeding productivity. The results also suggest that a crowding mechanism that mediates interactions among territory-holders could generate the density dependence needed to regulate local abundance, at least in areas of homogeneous, high-quality habitat. The effect of the neighbor-density reduction on warbler fecundity and behavior varied with annual fluctuations in weather and food availability, and was strongest in 1997, an El Ni√±o year, when conditions for breeding were least favorable. This variation in our experimental results among years implies that density dependence due to crowding may have its strongest impact on local abundance when environmental conditions are relatively poor.",10.1890/03-0272,2-s2.0-5344234508,9,0.723639417,0,expery reduc neighb dens affect reproduc and behavy of a migr songbird becaus pop of territ bird ar rel stabl comp to thos of oth anim tax they ar oft consid to be tight reg howev the mech that produc dens depend feedback on demograph rat and thu reg thes pop ar poor understood particul for migr specy we conduc a three year dens reduc expery to investig the behavy mech that reg the abund of a nearct neotrop migr passerin the black throated blu warbl dendroic caerulesc dur the bree season we found that the numb of young fledg per territ territ siz and the proport of tim mal spent for wer sign gre on territ around which neighb dens was expery reduc comp to control territ territ qual proport of nest depr per territ and mal counters rat wer not stat diff between tre thes result ind that individ with mor neighb i e in neighb with gre conspec dens hav reduc bree produc the result also suggest that a crowd mech that medy interact among territ hold could gen the dens depend nee to reg loc abund at least in area of homog high qual habit the effect of the neighb dens reduc on warbl fecund and behavy vary with an fluctu in weath and food avail and was strongest in an el ni√±o year when condit for bree wer least fav thi vary in our expery result among year imply that dens depend due to crowd may hav it strongest impact on loc abund when environ condit ar rel poor,new,0.7498545692476709,0.6919682001848247,0.6487207288945017,0.6160613446231009,0.5909310090454332,0.5714260616082372,0.5564387022014177,0.5454435276987706,0.5384838987451732,0.5364556545889768,0.5421746696463149
115,bird_nearctic,"Impacts of habitat fragmentation on pairing success of male Ovenbirds, Seiurus aurocapillus, in Southern New Brunswick","Populations of some species of nearctic-neotropical migrant birds have been declining in recent years, and much attention has focused on fragmentation of North American forests by agriculture, urbanization, and forest harvesting as one of the causes for the declines. This study evaluated the hypothesis that fragments of mature forest in a managed-forest landscape in southern New Brunswick were suboptimal habitat for Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) compared to large tracts of similar forest. There were no significant differences in pairing success or territorial density of male Ovenbirds between fragments and contiguous forest sites in 1992 and 1993. However, when only smallest fragments were considered mating success and density were lower but differences were not significant.

123,bird_nearctic,Seasonal abundance of migrant birds and food resources in panamanian mangrove forests,"We studied temporal variation in abundance of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants, particularly the Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea), and American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) in two black mangrove sites of central Panama from September 1993 through May 1995. The two sites, on the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts, differ importantly in annual rainfall, tide amplitude, and seasonal invertebrate abundance. Most migrant species varied temporally in abundance with the opposite pattern at each site, suggesting mid-winter movements correlated with abundance of food resources. Because of their wide geographic distribution and their particular response to hydrographic factors, mangroves are likely to have a temporally complementary role in sustaining migrant populations throughout the Neptropics. However, variations in migrant numbers reported in other Neotropical habitats could also reflect large-scale movements by migrants.

133,bird_nearctic,North American Brant: Effects of changes in habitat and climate on population dynamics,"We describe the importance of key habitats used by four nesting populations of nearctic brant (Branta bernicla) and discuss the potential relationship between changes in these habitats and population dynamics of brant. Nearctic brant, in contrast to most geese, rely on marine habitats and native intertidal plants during the non-breeding season, particularly the seagrass, Zostera, and the macroalgae, Ulva. Atlantic and Eastern High Arctic brant have experienced the greatest degradation of their winter habitats (northeastern United States and Ireland, respectively) and have also shown the most plasticity in feeding behavior. Black and Western High Arctic brant of the Pacific Flyway are the most dependent on Zostera, and are undergoing a shift in winter distribution that is likely related to climate change and its associated effects on Zostera dynamics. Variation in breeding propensity of Black Brant associated with winter location and climate strongly suggests that food abundance on the wintering grounds directly affects reproductive performance in these geese. In summer, salt marshes, especially those containing Carex and Puccinellia, are key habitats for raising young, while lake shorelines with fine freshwater grasses and sedges are important for molting birds. Availability and abundance of salt marshes has a direct effect on growth and recruitment of goslings and ultimately, plays an important role in regulating size of local brant populations. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00942.x,2-s2.0-20844434333,10,0.693381625,0,nor am brant effect of chang in habit and clim on pop dynam we describ the import of key habit us by four nest pop of nearct brant brant bernicl and discuss the pot rel between chang in thes habit and pop dynam of brant nearct brant in contrast to most gees rely on marin habit and nat intertid plant dur the non bree season particul the seagrass zoster and the macroalga ulv atl and eastern high arct brant hav expery the greatest degrad of their wint habit northeastern unit stat and ireland respect and hav also shown the most plast in fee behavy black and western high arct brant of the pac flyway ar the most depend on zoster and ar undergo a shift in wint distribut that is lik rel to clim chang and it assocy effect on zoster dynam vary in bree propens of black brant assocy with wint loc and clim strongly suggest that food abund on the wint ground direct affect reproduc perform in thes gees in sum salt marsh espec thos contain carex and puccinell ar key habit for rais young whil lak shorelin with fin freshw grass and sedg ar import for molt bird avail and abund of salt marsh has a direct effect on grow and recruit of gosl and ultim play an import rol in reg siz of loc brant pop,new,0.7458607866664855,0.7127028646963365,0.6899886441995303,0.6743161912845359,0.663634330822614,0.6568353877668265,0.6534080430655861,0.6533044941023489,0.6570066276238528,0.6659208269160611,0.6836315739112835
142,bird_nearctic,The plight of migrant birds wintering in the caribbean: Rainfall effects in the annual cycle,"Here, we summarize results of migrant bird research in the Caribbean as part of a 75th Anniversary Symposium on research of the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF). The fate of migratory birds has been a concern stimulating research over the past 40 years in response to population declines documented in long-term studies including those of the IITF and collaborators in Puerto Rico's Gu√°nica dry forest. Various studies indicate that in addition to forest loss or fragmentation, some migrant declines may be due to rainfall variation, the consequences of which may carry over from one stage of a migrant's annual cycle to another. For example, the Gu√°nica studies indicate that rainfall extremes on either the temperate breeding or tropical wintering grounds affect migrant abundance and survival differently depending on the species. In contrast, IITF's collaborative studies of the migrant Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) in the Bahamas found that late winter droughts affect its annual survival and breeding success in Michigan. We review these IITF migrant studies and relate them to other studies, which have improved our understanding of migrant ecology of relevance to conservation. Particularly important is the advent of the full annual cycle (FAC) approach. The FAC will facilitate future identification and mitigation of limiting factors contributing to migrant population declines, which for some species, may be exacerbated by global climate change. ¬© 2017 by the authors.",10.3390/f8040115,2-s2.0-85017371653,24,0.684734863,1,the plight of migr bird wint in the carib rainfal effect in the an cyc her we summ result of migr bird research in the carib as part of a th annivers sympos on research of the unit stat depart of agricult forest serv intern institut of trop forestry iitf the fat of migr bird has been a concern stim research ov the past year in respons to pop declin docu in long term study includ thos of the iitf and collab in puerto rico s gu√°nica dry forest vary study ind that in addit to forest loss or frag som migr declin may be due to rainfal vary the consequ of which may carry ov from on stag of a migr s an cyc to anoth for exampl the gu√°nica study ind that rainfal extrem on eith the temp bree or trop wint ground affect migr abund and surv diff depend on the specy in contrast iitf s collab study of the migr kirtland s warbl setophag kirtlandi in the bahama found that lat wint drought affect it an surv and bree success in michig we review thes iitf migr study and rel them to oth study which hav improv our understand of migr ecolog of relev to conserv particul import is the adv of the ful an cyc fac approach the fac wil facilit fut id and mitig of limit fact contribut to migr pop declin which for som specy may be exacerb by glob clim chang,new,0.7510580996072124,0.7174347779404859,0.6940941199595538,0.6777184805309971,0.6663146951007995,0.6587860479508785,0.654608787889117,0.6537077442739306,0.656518151801167,0.6643626854691369,0.6806135120042374
153,bird_nearctic,Habitat-specific effects of food abundance on the condition of ovenbirds wintering in Jamaica,"1. Food availability has been considered one of the most important factors limiting bird populations, yet the effects of food abundance on non-breeding insectivores has rarely been investigated. We studied the effects of food abundance on the body condition of ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus L.), a sexually monomorphic, ground-foraging, Neotropical-Nearctic migrant warbler during two winters in three habitats on their wintering grounds in Jamaica. 2. Prey biomass decreased from early to late winter in all habitats. Concurrently, ovenbird body mass, corrected for differences in structural size, decreased significantly in five of six habitat-year combinations. Only in second growth scrub habitat in the 1995-96 winter did ovenbirds show no decrease in corrected body mass, and during this period there was no significant decrease in ant biomass, the dominant prey item of ovenbirds in all habitats. 3. Significant positive correlations were found between ovenbirds' rate of feather regrowth and the biomass of ants on their home ranges in early winter, and between overwinter change in ovenbird body mass and the biomass of ants on their home ranges in late winter. 4. The results of both the habitat- and home-range-based analyses suggest a similar threshold of ant biomass (2.5-3.0 mg m-2), below which ovenbirds did not maintain their body mass. 5. The results suggest that late winter rainfall mediates the biomass of prey abundance, which in turn affects the ovenbirds' overwinter body condition.",10.1046/j.1365-2656.2000.00447.x,2-s2.0-0033799710,12,0.684104065,0,habit spec effect of food abund on the condit of ovenbird wint in jamaic food avail has been consid on of the most import fact limit bird pop yet the effect of food abund on non bree insect has rar been investig we study the effect of food abund on the body condit of ovenbird seiur aurocapill l a sex monomorph ground for neotrop nearct migr warbl dur two wint in three habit on their wint ground in jamaic prey biomass decreas from ear to lat wint in al habit concur ovenbird body mass correct for diff in structural siz decreas sign in fiv of six habit year combin on in second grow scrub habit in the wint did ovenbird show no decreas in correct body mass and dur thi period ther was no sign decreas in ant biomass the domin prey item of ovenbird in al habit sign posit correl wer found between ovenbird rat of feath regrow and the biomass of ant on their hom rang in ear wint and between overwint chang in ovenbird body mass and the biomass of ant on their hom rang in lat wint the result of both the habit and hom rang bas analys suggest a simil threshold of ant biomass mg m below which ovenbird did not maintain their body mass the result suggest that lat wint rainfal medy the biomass of prey abund which in turn affect the ovenbird overwint body condit,new,0.686451603336232,0.6204916114314539,0.5731159574951513,0.5385700192257817,0.5129270350392248,0.49388552012157,0.4801849109855699,0.4713090564734963,0.4674759800275571,0.47004181490570546,0.48291587292030513
163,bird_nearctic,"Distribution and abundance of non-breeding shorebirds along the coasts of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina","The coast of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina, includes a remarkable diversity of habitats and is used by more than fifteen Nearctic shorebird species during the austral summer months. We evaluated non-breeding shorebird distribution and abundance patterns along the Buenos Aires coastal zone and determined shorebird use of different coastal landscapes. Surveys were conducted in December 2000, and January and February 2001, using line-transect methods. The data were classified based on five previously defined coastal landscapes. Fifty four localities were surveyed covering 93 kilometers of coastline. A total of 44 waterbird species corresponding to 13 families were recorded. Shorebirds (Scolopacidae, Charadriidae, Haematopodidae and Recurvirostridae) accounted for approximately 45% of recorded waterbirds, including 14 nearctic species. Shorebird species recorded per locality varied from one to eleven, with 61% of the localities having one to four species. The most common were the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis), Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus), American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica) and the Sanderling (Calidris alba). Shorebird species richness and abundance varied significantly among coastal landscapes, with the highest values recorded in estuarine saltmarshes of Bah√≠a Samboromb√≥n and Bah√≠a Blanca. Among marine landscapes, the highest abundance and number of species were recorded in sandy beaches with ""restinga"" patches.

173,bird_nearctic,"Winter habitat quality, population limitation, and conservation of neotropical-nearctic migrant birds","Recent declines in Neotropical-Nearctic migrant songbird populations are often attributed to events during the nonbreeding season, such as tropical habitat conversion and drought. Support for this hypothesis in most species, however, is largely anecdotal or conjectural. There is a dearth of demographic information about migrants on their Neotropical winter grounds. Such data are needed to identify specific ecological factors influencing survival, dispersal, and, ultimately, population abundances aggregated over multiple habitats at regional spatial scales. In this paper, we review several lines of evidence, emphasizing results of our research on paruline warblers in Jamaica, which indicate that migrant passerines often compete intraspecifically in winter for preferred quality habitats and that their populations may be limited at least in part by ecological conditions in winter. The demographic and ecological evidence supporting this hypothesis for migrant passerines includes: (1) differing densities among habitats, suggesting variation in habitat suitability; (2) strong territoriality, site attachment, and site fidelity; (3) experimental demonstrations of habitat saturation; (4) nonrandom distributions of sex and age classes among habitats; (5) overwinter decline of body mass by individuals occupying the most drought-stressed habitats; and (6) different residence times among habitats, suggesting differences in survival or dispersal.

183,bird_nearctic,Migratory flows and foraging habitat selection by shorebirds along the northeastern coast of Brazil: The case of Ba√≠a de Todos os Santos,"Large numbers of Nearctic shorebirds migrate and winter along the coast of northeastern Brazil, but there is little information on their migratory flows, foraging ecology, and on the structure of the species assemblages that they form with resident shorebirds. We studied these issues on intertidal flats of Ba√≠a de Todos os Santos (Bahia), the second largest bay in Brazil. During a full year cycle we carried out weekly bird counts in an intertidal area of 280 ha divided in sectors, where we also measured environmental parameters. The analyses of weekly counts resulted in a detailed phenology of use of the area by shorebirds. Five species were resident and ten were Nearctic migrants. Several of the latter had clear peaks in numbers in March and October, revealing the use of the bay as a stopover during both the north-bound and south-bound migration flows. A canonical correspondence analysis of the relationship between environmental parameters and bird numbers indicated that the foraging bird assemblage could be divided into five main groups, occupying distinct ecological gradients in the study area. The most important factors driving this structure were invertebrate prey abundance, percentage of fine sediments, area of mangrove cover and distance to channels. Our findings imply that maintenance of the diversity of intertidal habitats in this bay is crucial to satisfy the particular habitat requirements of resident and migrant shorebirds using the northeastern coastal regions of Brazil. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.001,2-s2.0-84655169241,25,0.641394631,0,migr flow and for habit select by shorebird along the northeastern coast of brazil the cas of ba√≠ de todo os santo larg numb of nearct shorebird migr and wint along the coast of northeastern brazil but ther is littl inform on their migr flow for ecolog and on the structure of the specy assembl that they form with resid shorebird we study thes issu on intertid flat of ba√≠ de todo os santo bah the second largest bay in brazil dur a ful year cyc we carry out week bird count in an intertid are of ha divid in sect wher we also meas environ paramet the analys of week count result in a detail phenolog of us of the are by shorebird fiv specy wer resid and ten wer nearct migr sev of the lat had clear peak in numb in march and octob rev the us of the bay as a stopov dur both the nor bound and sou bound migr flow a canon correspond analys of the rel between environ paramet and bird numb ind that the for bird assembl could be divid into fiv main group occupy distinct ecolog grady in the study are the most import fact driv thi structure wer invertebr prey abund perc of fin sedy are of mangrov cov and dist to channel our find imply that maint of the divers of intertid habit in thi bay is cruc to satisfy the particul habit requir of resid and migr shorebird us the northeastern coast reg of brazil,new,0.7035128933992394,0.6433807849412376,0.6010652434198476,0.5709195992981175,0.5491213664627878,0.5334687152833131,0.5227920978533448,0.5166533463958624,0.5153344795646582,0.5202443975067953,0.5353545325215356
193,bird_nearctic,Distribution of nearctic-neotropical migratory birds along a South American elevation gradient during spring migration,"The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia has been identified as a critical spring stopover site for at least one Neotropical migratory bird species prior to crossing the Caribbean sea on migration. The strategic location of the Sierra suggests that other South American wintering migrants may stopover there, but no information is available on the migrant community during spring or how they distribute themselves between habitats and across the broad elevational gradient. Here, we present species richness and densities of migratory landbirds obtained through standardized census and captures along an elevation gradient (100-2,100 m) covering two habitats, forest and shade coffee, during two consecutive spring migrations. The migrant community (~39 species) showed a peak in species richness and abundance at mid elevations (700-1,700 m), mirroring the pattern often observed in communities of resident Neotropical birds. However, individually the abundance of the commonest species peaked at different elevations and showed high annual variability. We also found within-species differences in density between shade-coffee and forest at the same elevation, possibly reflecting differences in habitat quality for some species. Factors such as food availability and predation risk are expected to be critical in shaping the distribution of migrants during stopover, and further research is required to identify the drivers of the observed elevational patterns. This study contributes to our knowledge of the life histories of migrants during stopover and highlights the habitats and elevations where conservation measures would protect the highest number of species and individuals at a South American stopover site. ¬© 2015 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",10.1676/14-017.1,2-s2.0-84925016635,13,0.637205206,0,distribut of nearct neotrop migr bird along a sou am elev grady dur spring migr the sierr nevad de sant mart in northern colomb has been ident as a crit spring stopov sit for at least on neotrop migr bird specy pri to cross the carib sea on migr the strategic loc of the sierr suggest that oth sou am wint migr may stopov ther but no inform is avail on the migr commun dur spring or how they distribut themselv between habit and across the broad elev grady her we pres specy rich and dens of migr landbird obtain through standard cens and capt along an elev grady m cov two habit forest and shad coff dur two consecut spring migr the migr commun specy show a peak in specy rich and abund at mid elev m mir the pattern oft observ in commun of resid neotrop bird howev individ the abund of the commonest specy peak at diff elev and show high an vary we also found within specy diff in dens between shad coff and forest at the sam elev poss reflect diff in habit qual for som specy fact such as food avail and pred risk ar expect to be crit in shap the distribut of migr dur stopov and furth research is requir to ident the driv of the observ elev pattern thi study contribut to our knowledg of the lif hist of migr dur stopov and highlight the habit and elev wher conserv meas would protect the highest numb of specy and individ at a sou am stopov sit,new,0.7295278080902999,0.6500213978140126,0.5902394334998688,0.5448111056864264,0.5092786725750962,0.48073092034879056,0.45729581912709305,0.4377347533635198,0.42118518923310977,0.40700782972399097,0.3946576389299507
203,bird_nearctic,Nearctic avian migrants in coffee plantations and forest fragments of south-western Guatemala,"Habitats at intermediate and upper elevations of the volcanic Cordillera of southwestern Guatemala harbour a diverse terrestrial vertebrate fauna that includes at least 423 avian species, 108 of which are known to be Nearctic migrants, and 43 of which are known or suspected to have both resident and long-distance migrant populations. During the course of floral and faunal inventories in a proposed Multiple Use Area in this region from 1987 through 1991, FIIT researchers collected or observed 254 avian species, of which 44 are regarded as Nearctic migrants and 26 are known or suspected to have both resident and long-distance migrant populations. Study sites included climax and selectively logged lower montane forest fragments, as well as subtropical agroecosystems. Data are presented to support the conclusion that a significantly higher percentage of resident avian species reported from this region in the literature continue to occupy these habitats than do species known to undertake cyclical longdistance migrations. Non-quantitative, historical reports of relative abundance of all Nearctic avian migrants in the region during the early and mid-twentieth century are compared with current status of these species. Threats to Nearctic avian migrants in the western Guatemalan highlands are discussed, and areas of future research for ornithologists working with this community in the region are proposed. Recommendations are made to preserve or improve habitats on wintering grounds and along migration routes considered to be of critical importance for the long-term survival of a number of threatened and vulnerable Nearctic avian migrants in Guatemala. ¬© 1994, Birdlife International.

215,bird_nearctic,Optimal conservation of migratory species,"Background. Migratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea-regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range. Conclusions/Significance. We demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms. ¬© 2007 Martin et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0000751,2-s2.0-40749094008,28,0.631360257,0,optim conserv of migr specy background migr anim compr a sign port of biodivers worldwid with an invest for their conserv excess sev bil doll design effect conserv plan pres enorm challeng migr specy ar influ by multipl ev across land and sea reg that ar oft sep by thousand of kilomet and span intern bord to dat conserv strategies for migr specy fail to tak into account how migr anim ar spat connect between diff period of the an cyc i e migr connect bring into quest the util and efficy of cur conserv effort methodolog princip find her we report the first framework for determin an optim conserv strategy for a migr specy employ a decid theoret approach us dynam optim we address the problem of how to alloc resourc for habit conserv for a neotrop nearct migr bird the am redstart setophag ruticill whos wint habit is und threat our first conserv strategy us the acquisit of wint habit bas on land cost rel bird dens and the rat of habit loss to maxim the abund of bird on the wint ground our second strategy maxim bird abund across the entir rang of the specy by ad the constraint of maintain a minim perc of bird within each bree reg in nor americ us inform on migr connect as estim from stabl hydrog isotop in feath we show that fail to tak into account migr connect may doom som reg pop to extinct wherea includ inform on migr connect result in the protect of the specy across it entir rang conclud sign we demonst that conserv strategies for migr anim depend crit upon two fact knowledg of migr connect and the correct stat of the conserv problem our framework can be us to ident efficy conserv strategies for migr tax worldwid includ insect bird mam and marin org,new,0.6976403217063439,0.640519871703757,0.5992575049308569,0.5691800146853548,0.5470117478587195,0.530789183993676,0.5194428751453803,0.5125762871742239,0.5104946900407763,0.5146530075130737,0.5291952624156312
223,bird_nearctic,Avian response to timber harvesting applied experimentally to manage Cerulean Warbler breeding populations,"Timber harvesting has been proposed as a management tool to enhance breeding habitat for the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea), a declining Neotropical-Nearctic migratory songbird that nests in the canopy of mature eastern deciduous forests. To evaluate how this single-species management focus might fit within an ecologically based management approach for multiple forest birds, we performed a manipulative experiment using four treatments (three intensities of timber harvests and an unharvested control) at each of seven study areas within the core Cerulean Warbler breeding range. We collected pre-harvest (one year) and post-harvest (four years) data on the territory density of Cerulean Warblers and six additional focal species, avian community relative abundance, and several key habitat variables. We evaluated the avian and habitat responses across the 3-32m2ha-1 residual basal area (RBA) range of the treatments. Cerulean Warbler territory density peaked with medium RBA (~16m2ha-1). In contrast, territory densities of the other focal species were negatively related to RBA (e.g., Hooded Warbler [Setophaga citrina]), were positively related to RBA (e.g., Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]), or were not sensitive to this measure (Scarlet Tanager [Piranga olivacea]). Some species (e.g., Hooded Warbler) increased with time post-treatment and were likely tied to a developing understory, whereas declines (e.g., Ovenbird) were immediate. Relative abundance responses of additional species were consistent with the territory density responses of the focal species. Across the RBA gradient, greatest separation in the avian community was between early successional forest species (e.g., Yellow-breasted Chat [Icteria virens]) and closed-canopy mature forest species (e.g., Ovenbird), with the Cerulean Warbler and other species located intermediate to these two extremes. Overall, our results suggest that harvests within 10-20m2ha-1 RBA yield the largest increases in Cerulean Warblers, benefit additional disturbance-dependent species, and may retain closed-canopy species but at reduced levels. Harvests outside the optimum RBA range for Cerulean Warblers can support bird assemblages specifically associated with early or late (closed-canopy) successional stages. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.foreco.2013.07.037,2-s2.0-84899053373,7,0.620047639,1,av respons to timb harvest apply expery to man cer warbl bree pop timb harvest has been propos as a man tool to enh bree habit for the cer warbl setophag cerule a declin neotrop nearct migr songbird that nest in the canop of mat eastern decidu forest to evalu how thi singl specy man foc might fit within an ecolog bas man approach for multipl forest bird we perform a manip expery us four tre three intens of timb harvest and an unharvest control at each of sev study area within the cor cer warbl bree rang we collect pre harvest on year and post harvest four year dat on the territ dens of cer warbl and six addit foc specy av commun rel abund and sev key habit vary we evalu the av and habit respons across the mha resid bas are rba rang of the tre cer warbl territ dens peak with med rba mha in contrast territ dens of the oth foc specy wer neg rel to rba e g hood warbl setophag citrin wer posit rel to rba e g ovenbird seiur aurocapill or wer not sensit to thi meas scarlet tan pirang olivace som specy e g hood warbl increas with tim post tre and wer lik tied to a develop underst wherea declin e g ovenbird wer immedy rel abund respons of addit specy wer consist with the territ dens respons of the foc specy across the rba grady greatest sep in the av commun was between ear success forest specy e g yellow breast chat icter vir and clos canop mat forest specy e g ovenbird with the cer warbl and oth specy loc intermedy to thes two extrem overal our result suggest that harvest within mha rba yield the largest increas in cer warbl benefit addit disturb depend specy and may retain clos canop specy but at reduc level harvest outsid the optim rba rang for cer warbl can support bird assembl spec assocy with ear or lat clos canop success stag,new,0.6435619961431658,0.5827568980050697,0.5414323567899778,0.5128653717355973,0.492978451423642,0.4795584354956612,0.47152879484944116,0.46864806042050877,0.4715743786467526,0.48251073025355634,0.5072394390059884
233,bird_nearctic,Structure and organization of canopy bird assemblages in Central Amazonia,"I analyzed the species composition, structure, and trophic organization of bird assemblages in the forest canopy around Manaus, Brazil. Using three canopy towers located in primary terra firme forests, I conducted 117 censuses over a 13 month period, recording 160 bird species. The three study sites had similar species richness (between 126 and 128 species), sharing 95 species in common, which accounted for >90% of all individual records. Most species recorded in the canopy (110) belonged to the core canopy avifauna. The other 50 species included migrants (13), species that feed overhead (8), species from lower strata (15), night birds (3), and vagrants or visitors from open areas and second-growth forests (11). Most of those species, however, appeared in very low numbers in the forest canopy, except understory frugivores, which regularly fed on canopy fruits. Among the migratory species were some Nearctic (6), Austral (3), and species probably holding both migratory and resident populations in the area (4). Additionally, I found evidence that two species of parrots perform seasonal movements, leaving the forest canopy around Manaus during the dry season. Frugivores dominated the canopy avifauna in abundance, but contradicting results reported from other Neotropical forest canopies, insectivores and frugivores had equal species richness. The canopy avifauna was highly homogeneous among sites in terms of species richness, distribution among abundance classes, and number of species in each feeding guild, habitat, and microhabitat. As in Costa Rica, the canopy avifauna of Manaus was mostly composed by typical canopy bird species, and not by edge-living species as reported from Panama. I suggest that habitat fragmentation may affect the bird community composition in the forest canopy, allowing a higher influx of opportunistic species.",,2-s2.0-1242310487,23,0.617967752,1,structure and org of canop bird assembl in cent amazon i analys the specy composit structure and troph org of bird assembl in the forest canop around mana brazil us three canop tow loc in prim terr firm forest i conduc census ov a mon period record bird specy the three study sit had simil specy rich between and specy shar specy in common which account for of al individ record most specy record in the canop belong to the cor canop avifaun the oth specy includ migr specy that fee overhead specy from low strata night bird and vagr or visit from op area and second grow forest most of thos specy howev appear in very low numb in the forest canop exceiv underst frug which regul fed on canop fruit among the migr specy wer som nearct aust and specy prob hold both migr and resid pop in the are addit i found evid that two specy of parrot perform season mov leav the forest canop around mana dur the dry season frug domin the canop avifaun in abund but contradict result report from oth neotrop forest canop insect and frug had eq specy rich the canop avifaun was high homog among sit in term of specy rich distribut among abund class and numb of specy in each fee guild habit and microhabit as in cost ric the canop avifaun of mana was most compos by typ canop bird specy and not by edg liv specy as report from panam i suggest that habit frag may affect the bird commun composit in the forest canop allow a high influx of opportun specy,new,0.7150892510806446,0.6266704101164456,0.5616203496184078,0.5133548688098492,0.4764535305960177,0.44746841533955894,0.4242624972415605,0.40550622982115236,0.3903893402815471,0.3785463169763075,0.3701020057216629
243,bird_nearctic,Coding sequence polymorphism in avian mitochondrial genomes reflects population histories,"Nucleotide sequence diversity at mitochondrial protein-coding loci from 72 species of birds from different geographical regions was analysed in order to test the hypothesis that temperate zone species show population genetic effects of past glaciation. Temperate zone species showed reduced nucleotide diversity in comparison to tropical mainland species, suggesting that the latter have long-term effective population sizes due to population bottleneck effects during the most recent glaciation. This hypothesis was further supported by evidence of an unusually high estimated rate of population growth in species breeding in North America and wintering in the New World tropics (Nearctic migrants), consistent with population expansion after a bottleneck. Nearctic migrants also showed evidence of an abundance of rare nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) polymorphisms, a pattern suggesting that slightly deleterious polymorphisms drifted to high frequencies during a bottleneck and are now being eliminated by selection. Because the shape of the North American land mass limited the area available for refugia during glaciation, the bottleneck effects are predicted to have been particularly strong in Nearctic migrants, and this prediction was supported. The reduced genetic diversity of Nearctic migrants provides an additional basis for concern for the survival of these species, which are threatened by loss of habitat in the winter range and by introduced disease. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03242.x,2-s2.0-33947507808,8,0.615138295,0,cod sequ polymorph in av mitochondr genom reflect pop hist nucleotid sequ divers at mitochondr protein cod loc from specy of bird from diff geograph reg was analys in ord to test the hypothes that temp zon specy show pop genet effect of past glacy temp zon specy show reduc nucleotid divers in comparison to trop mainland specy suggest that the lat hav long term effect pop siz due to pop bottleneck effect dur the most rec glacy thi hypothes was furth support by evid of an unus high estim rat of pop grow in specy bree in nor americ and wint in the new world trop nearct migr consist with pop expand aft a bottleneck nearct migr also show evid of an abund of rar nonsynonym amino acid alt polymorph a pattern suggest that slight deletery polymorph drift to high frequ dur a bottleneck and ar now being elimin by select becaus the shap of the nor am land mass limit the are avail for refug dur glacy the bottleneck effect ar predict to hav been particul strong in nearct migr and thi predict was support the reduc genet divers of nearct migr provid an addit bas for concern for the surv of thes specy which ar threatened by loss of habit in the wint rang and by introduc diseas,new,0.6417090460189874,0.603945006624389,0.5795759493206928,0.5640067359336725,0.5546945309384466,0.5503890919233044,0.5506670127322315,0.5558095365541665,0.5670167836579169,0.58722893058915,0.6234487510958153
253,bird_nearctic,"Patterns of density, diversity, and the distribution of migratory strategies in the Russian boreal forest avifauna","Aim: Comparisons of the biotas in the Palaearctic and Nearctic have focused on limited portions of the two regions. The purpose of this study was to assess the geographic pattern in the abundance, species richness, and importance of different migration patterns of the boreal forest avifauna of Eurasia from Europe to East Asia as well as their relationship to climate and forest productivity. We further examine data from two widely separated sites in the New World to see how these conform to the patterns found in the Eurasian system. Location: Boreal forest sites in Russia and Canada. Methods: Point counts were conducted in two to four boreal forest habitats at each of 14 sites in the Russian boreal forest from near to the Finnish border to the Far East, as well as at two sites in boreal Canada. We examined the abundance and species richness of all birds, and specific migratory classes, against four gradients (climate, primary productivity, latitude, and longitude). We tested for spatial autocorrelation in both dependent and independent variables using Moran's I to develop spatial correlograms. For each migratory class we used maximum likelihood to fit models, first assuming uncorrelated residuals and then assuming spatially autocorrelated residuals. For models assuming unstructured residuals we again generated correlograms on model residuals to determine whether model fitting removed spatial autocorrelation. Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion, adjusted for small sample size. Results: Overall abundance was highest at the eastern and western extremes of the survey region and lowest at the continent centre, whereas the abundance of tropical and short-distance migrants displayed an east-west gradient, with tropical migrants increasing in abundance in the east (and south), and short-distance migrants in the west. Although overall species richness showed no geographic pattern, richness within migratory classes showed patterns weaker than, but similar to, their abundance patterns described above. Overall abundance was correlated with climate variables that relate to continentality. The abundances of birds within different migration strategies were correlated with a second climatic gradient - increasing precipitation from west to east. Models using descriptors of location generally had greater explanatory value for the abundance and species-richness response variables than did those based on climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Main conclusions: The distribution patterns for migrant types were related to both climatic and locational variables, and thus the patterns could be explained by either climatic regime or the accessibility of winter habitats, both historically and currently. Non-boreal wintering habitat is more accessible from both the western and eastern ends than from the centre of the boreal forest belt, but the tropics are most accessible from the eastern end of the Palaearctic boreal zone, in terms of distance and the absence of geographical barriers. Based on comparisons with Canadian sites, we recommend that future comparative studies between Palaearctic and Nearctic faunas be focused more on Siberia and the Russian Far East, as well as on central and western Canada.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01954.x,2-s2.0-53949112445,19,0.598347449,0,pattern of dens divers and the distribut of migr strategies in the russ bor forest avifaun aim comparison of the biota in the palaearct and nearct hav focus on limit port of the two reg the purpos of thi study was to assess the geograph pattern in the abund specy rich and import of diff migr pattern of the bor forest avifaun of euras from europ to east as as wel as their rel to clim and forest produc we furth examin dat from two wid sep sit in the new world to see how thes conform to the pattern found in the euras system loc bor forest sit in russ and canad method point count wer conduc in two to four bor forest habit at each of sit in the russ bor forest from near to the fin bord to the far east as wel as at two sit in bor canad we examin the abund and specy rich of al bird and spec migr class against four grady clim prim produc latitud and longitud we test for spat autocorrel in both depend and independ vary us mor s i to develop spat correlogram for each migr class we us maxim lik to fit model first assum uncorrel resid and then assum spat autocorrel resid for model assum unstruct resid we again gen correlogram on model resid to determin wheth model fit remov spat autocorrel model wer comp us akaik s inform crit adjust for smal sampl siz result overal abund was highest at the eastern and western extrem of the survey reg and lowest at the contin cent wherea the abund of trop and short dist migr display an east west grady with trop migr increas in abund in the east and sou and short dist migr in the west although overal specy rich show no geograph pattern rich within migr class show pattern weak than but simil to their abund pattern describ abov overal abund was correl with clim vary that rel to contin the abund of bird within diff migr strategies wer correl with a second clim grady increas precipit from west to east model us describ of loc gen had gre expl valu for the abund and specy rich respons vary than did thos bas on clim dat and the norm diff veget index ndvi main conclud the distribut pattern for migr typ wer rel to both clim and loc vary and thu the pattern could be explain by eith clim regim or the access of wint habit both hist and cur non bor wint habit is mor access from both the western and eastern end than from the cent of the bor forest belt but the trop ar most access from the eastern end of the palaearct bor zon in term of dist and the abs of geograph barry bas on comparison with canad sit we recommend that fut comp study between palaearct and nearct fauna be focus mor on siber and the russ far east as wel as on cent and western canad,new,0.6939868334859308,0.6063757193203997,0.5421772456580686,0.4947112777057433,0.45863158058662296,0.43054041116150105,0.40832918765278164,0.39069216012497304,0.3768549518225735,0.36649636462458696,0.3598622937231926
293,bird_nearctic,Avian use of black-tailed prairie dog colonies in shortgrass prairie,"Downward trends in populations of many grassland bird species are of conservation concern. Declines in black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) populations result in loss of habitat for birds and other species associated with their colonies. We measured abundance, diversity, and species composition of avian communities on prairie dog colonies and noncolony sites in the Texas Panhandle. More resident species (P < 0.001) occurred on prairie dog colonies than on noncolony areas whereas, more nearctic-neoptropical migrants (P = 0.003) and nearctic-temperate migrants (P < 0.001) occurred on noncolony sites. Total avian abundance was greater (P < 0.001) on noncolony sites than at prairie dog colonies, and differed by season (P < 0.001). Barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), and chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina) were more abundant on noncolony sites than on prairie dog colonies. Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), Cassin's sparrow (Peucaea cassinnii), and lark bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys) abundances were greater on prairie dog colonies. Vegetative alterations made by prairie dogs may not influence bird populations as much in these shortgrass prairies as has been reported in mixed-grass prairies.

303,bird_nearctic,"Site-specific variation in food resources, sex ratios, and body condition of an overwintering migrant songbird","Territorial social behavior of wintering Nearctic-Neotropic migrant songbirds places males and females in direct conflict over access to winter space and resources. Outcomes of this intersexual competition can vary by species and habitat, but information has been collected for only a small subset of migrant species. We investigated the available food resources, sex ratios, and body condition of territorial Bicknell's Thrushes (Catharus bicknelli) wintering in the Dominican Republic between 1999 and 2008 at two ecologically distinct wet-forest sites, one in high-elevation cloud forest and the other in mid-elevation rainforest. Arthropod abundance was greater in cloud forest habitat, which was occupied by proportionally more males, the larger-bodied sex (74% male). By contrast, both sexes occurred at parity in rainforest habitat (53% male), where soft-bodied fruit was the predominant dietary resource. Body condition of cloud forest males was comparable to that of rainforest males, but cloud forest females were in poorer body condition than rainforest females. Females at the cloud forest site may face a greater likelihood of agonistic interactions with larger-bodied males and the thermoregulatory demands of roosting in colder night temperatures (0-12¬∞C).

Intensive management for pine specialists such as the Red-cockaded Woodpecker may negatively impact both Nearctic-Neotropical and Temperate Zone migrants associated with hardwood vegetation. To evaluate possible positive and negative associations, we surveyed avian communities from 1995-1997 using point counts within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cavity tree clusters and mature forest control sites in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly (P. taeda)-shortleaf (P. echinata) pine habitats. In general, sites managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers supported more diverse and numerous bird populations than mature forest control sites. During the breeding season in loblolly-shortleaf and longleaf pine habitats, respectively, species richness was 47% and 23% greater, avian abundance was 57% and 65% greater, and bird species diversity was 25% and 21% greater within managed Red-cockaded Woodpecker cluster sites than within control sites.

333,bird_nearctic,Structure and seasonality of nearctic Culex pipiens populations,"The abundance and structure of urban autogenous and anautogenous populations of Culex pipiens mosquitoes were documented systematically in Boston, MA, during three successive years. Autogenous larvae become abundant mainly in enclosed sites and anautogenous larvae in sites that provide free access and egress. Both populations begin to proliferate when the water temperature exceeds 15¬∞C during June. Larval anautogenous mosquitoes increase in abundance 10-fold in two weeks and autogenous in three weeks. Although anautogenous larvae rapidly disappear after mid-August when winter diapause commences, the abundance of autogenous larvae continues to increase until mid-October. The forms generally are reproductively isolated in nature but occasionally hybridize during August and thereafter. Anautogenous females feed mainly on birds; autogenous females generally never feed on blood; and hybrid females appear to feed indiscriminately on avian or mammalian hosts. Such northern C. p. pipiens mosquitoes range as far south as 33¬∞N.

The main purpose of this paper was to advance into the knowledge of the ecological features that allow those species to survive in urban environments and to identify which sets of characters enhance the risk of local extinction. Location: Puebla-Cholula Conurbation (PCC), in M√©xico, a developing country between the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions. Methods: First, 355 qualitative point counts (Echantillonnage Frecuentiels Progressifs) were performed in 21 green areas of the PCC to determine the regional distribution and local abundance of 51 species. Then, groups of species were formed through multivariate cluster analysis as a function of their similarity in distribution and abundance. Finally, bird species were characterized (body length, body mass, type of diet and migration status) and multivariate clusters were analyzed to look for differences between groups (through Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA), and also with the avifauna from evergreen oak forest communities described in the literature. Results: Regional distribution of great-tailed grackle, house finch and house sparrow were maximal, since they were found in all the 21 study areas; local abundances of these species, plus those of inca dove and rock dove, were also high (incidence > 50 %). Regional distribution of seven species (like acorn woodpecker, townsend's warbler or rose-breasted grosbeak) was minimal, since they were located in just one site; and six species exhibited very low local abundances (incidence < 5 %). Cluster analysis formed 3 groups. The abovementioned 5 species with the largest distribution and abundance were included in Group #1, typically urban: thus, the most common species, urban exploiters, were mainly granivorous, resident and had a body size larger than all the remaining species. Urban avoiders (Group #3: ""rare"" species, with a small regional distribution and local abundance) were mainly insectivorous, included resident, wintering and transient species, and had the smallest body size. Conclusions: Classification analysis formed three groups of species, similar to those described in the literature of developed countries in temperate latitudes. Ecological features of urban exploiters are not the same than those of ""rare"" species, neither than those of the bird fauna from natural forest communities. If urban growth keeps provoking the conversion of natural forest habitats into urban environments, green urban areas most likely could not maintain viable populations of many of these bird species.",,2-s2.0-53249140669,16,0.544789559,0,ecolog charact of the avifaun of the urb park of the city of puebl m√©xico caracterizaci√≥n ecol√≥gica de la avifaun de los parqu urbano de la ciudad de puebl m√©xico aim urb can caus the disorg of loc biota espec in trop biodivers rich latitud although som nat specy can continu inhabit urb green area the main purpos of thi pap was to adv into the knowledg of the ecolog feat that allow thos specy to surv in urb environ and to ident which set of charact enh the risk of loc extinct loc puebl cholul conurb pcc in m√©xico a develop country between the nearct and neotrop reg method first qualit point count echantillon frecuentiel progress wer perform in green area of the pcc to determin the reg distribut and loc abund of specy then group of specy wer form through mult clust analys as a funct of their simil in distribut and abund fin bird specy wer charact body leng body mass typ of diet and migr stat and mult clust wer analys to look for diff between group through kruskal wal anov and also with the avifaun from evergreen oak forest commun describ in the lit result reg distribut of gre tail grackl hous finch and hous sparrow wer maxim sint they wer found in al the study area loc abund of thes specy plu thos of inc dov and rock dov wer also high incid reg distribut of sev specy lik acorn woodpeck townsend s warbl or ros breast grosbeak was minim sint they wer loc in just on sit and six specy exhibit very low loc abund incid clust analys form group the abov specy with the largest distribut and abund wer includ in group typ urb thu the most common specy urb exploit wer main gran resid and had a body siz larg than al the remain specy urb avoid group rar specy with a smal reg distribut and loc abund wer main insect includ resid wint and transy specy and had the smallest body siz conclud class analys form three group of specy simil to thos describ in the lit of develop country in temp latitud ecolog feat of urb exploit ar not the sam than thos of rar specy neith than thos of the bird faun from nat forest commun if urb grow keep provok the convert of nat forest habit into urb environ green urb area most lik could not maintain viabl pop of many of thes bird specy,new,0.61199278584882,0.500729856994952,0.4247926758808415,0.37201172284951894,0.33386183030716526,0.30537137897670086,0.2836595342486112,0.2670519969340171,0.2546499859671296,0.24624167959295956,0.24258140958620536
351,bird_nearctic,Avian community and microhabitat associations of cerulean warblers in Alabama,"Cerulean Warblers (Dendroica cerulea) have experienced one of the highest population declines of any neotropical-Nearctic migratory species in North America. We performed point counts and habitat assessments in areas used and unused by Cerulean Warblers in northern Alabama during the 2005 and 2006 breeding seasons to examine their avian associations and identify microhabitat features that best explained their occurrence. We detected on average ‚àº50 Cerulean Warbler males (total) in three disjunct populations during each breeding season. Areas used by Cerulean Warblers were characterized by avian communities with significantly higher species richness, diversity, and abundance compared to areas where they were not detected. Correspondence analysis related Cerulean Warblers to inhabitants of riparian, bottomland deciduous forests (e.g., Kentucky Warbler [Oporornis formosus], Acadian Flycatcher [Empidonax virescens], and Northern Parula [Parula americana]) and two edge specialists (Blue-winged Warbler [Vermivora cyanoptera] and Indigo Bunting [Passerina cyanea]) suggesting Cerulean Warblers in our study areas may be tolerant of some habitat disturbance within an otherwise largely forested landscape.

The aim of the present paper is to describe a new species of Maritrema parasitizing the Nearctic Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii in its wintering areas in Patagonia, Argentina. We also analyze and compare the microphallid diversity in two host species. We collected 44 C. bairdii and 50 Calidris fuscicollis in search of helminths. Trematodes were found only in C. bairdii.

116,bird_neotropic,Long-term dynamics of a wood thrush population breeding in a forest fragment,"The dynamics of a population of wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) in a Delaware woodlot from 1974 through 1990 did not meet all predictions of the forest-fragmentation hypothesis, which posits that declining abundance of Neotropical, migratory, forest songbirds results from poor reproduction in, and immigration to, forest fragments. Abundance declined at an average rate of 4% per year over the period 1978 through 1987, equalling the national decline found by the Breeding Bird Survey for those years, but recovered by 1990 to pre-decline levels. Abundance of previous residents followed a similar pattern, the only population component to do so. Abundance of new immigrants and of returning, locally produced young was generally stable. Throughout the study, reproductive rates were high enough to maintain the population at the return rates observed early and late in the study. However, a sustained episode of reduced production per female and of an increased percentage of adults failing to produce any young generally coincided with the decline in abundance. When the failure rate later dropped, return rate and abundance subsequently increased. [The authors] conclude that a period of elevated, predation-caused failure prompted greater emigration by an ever-young, less-site-faithful population. High emigration coupled with stable immigration, stable recruitment of local young, and even normal mortality of residents would yield a declining population. A regional predation episode could cause a broader decline in abundance through several mechanisms that could reduce the number of available immigrants.",,2-s2.0-0033131244,115,0.897719829,1,long term dynam of a wood thrush pop bree in a forest frag the dynam of a pop of wood thrushes hylocichl mustelin in a delaw woodlot from through did not meet al predict of the forest frag hypothes which posit that declin abund of neotrop migr forest songbird result from poor reproduc in and immigr to forest frag abund declin at an av rat of per year ov the period through equal the nat declin found by the bree bird survey for thos year but recov by to pre declin level abund of prevy resid follow a simil pattern the on pop compon to do so abund of new immigr and of return loc produc young was gen stabl throughout the study reproduc rat wer high enough to maintain the pop at the return rat observ ear and lat in the study howev a sustain episod of reduc produc per fem and of an increas perc of adult fail to produc any young gen coincid with the declin in abund when the fail rat lat drop return rat and abund subsequ increas the auth conclud that a period of elev pred caus fail prompt gre emigr by an ev young less sit faith pop high emigr coupl with stabl immigr stabl recruit of loc young and ev norm mort of resid would yield a declin pop a reg pred episod could caus a broad declin in abund through sev mech that could reduc the numb of avail immigr,new,0.9225487169253277,0.9010141950316412,0.8827903516546679,0.8670657246395417,0.8530297932902345,0.8400492851300865,0.8275904220748603,0.8151080489681543,0.801889727541743,0.7866893987592104,0.7667633817913398
216,bird_neotropic,Thirty-year bird population trends in an unfragmented temperate deciduous forest: Importance of habitat change,"Abundances of forest birds in an unfragmented, undisturbed, and relatively mature temperate deciduous forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, changed markedly between 1969 and 1998. Total numbers of birds (all species combined) declined from 210-220 individuals/10 ha in the early 1970s to 70-90/10 ha in the 1990s. Of the 24 regularly occurring species, 12 decreased significantly (four to local extinction), three increased significantly, and nine remained relatively constant in abundance. Nine of the 12 declining species were Neotropical migrants. Most species exhibited similar trends on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in New Hampshire during the same 30 year period and on three replicate study sites in nearby sections of the White Mountains from 1986-1998. Probable causes of trends were diverse and differed among species. Most could be accounted for by individual species' responses to events occurring primarily in the local breeding area. The most important local factor affecting bird abundance was temporal change in forest vegetation structure, resulting from natural forest succession and local disturbances. Four species that declined markedly and in some cases disappeared completely from the study plot (Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus; Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina; Philadelphia Vireo, Vireo philadelphicus; and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) appear to attain peak abundance in early or mid successional forests. Species preferring more mature forests, such as Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), increased significantly in abundance over the 30 year study. Other important factors influencing bird abundances were food availability and events in the migratory and winter periods. Nest-predation rates, although varying among years, showed no long-term pattern that would account for population declines, and brood parasites were absent from this forest. Findings from this study demonstrate that major changes in bird abundances occur over time even in undisturbed and relatively mature forests, and illustrate the need for considering habitat requirements of individual species and how habitat suitability changes over time when trying to assess the causes of their long-term population trends. The results also imply that any conclusions about the effects of other factors affecting forest bird abundances, such as increased nest predation or brood parasitism associated with habitat fragmentation, must also account for successional changes that may be affecting habitat suitability.",10.2307/4089923,2-s2.0-0034789342,33,0.878662638,1,thirty year bird pop trend in an unfr temp decidu forest import of habit chang abund of forest bird in an unfr undisturb and rel mat temp decidu forest at the hubbard brook expery forest new hampshir chang mark between and tot numb of bird al specy combin declin from individ ha in the ear s to ha in the s of the regul occur specy decreas sign four to loc extinct three increas sign and nin remain rel const in abund nin of the declin specy wer neotrop migr most specy exhibit simil trend on bree bird survey bbs rout in new hampshir dur the sam year period and on three reply study sit in nearby sect of the whit mountain from prob caus of trend wer divers and diff among specy most could be account for by individ specy respons to ev occur prim in the loc bree are the most import loc fact affect bird abund was temp chang in forest veget structure result from nat forest success and loc disturb four specy that declin mark and in som cas disappear complet from the study plot least flycatch empidonax minim wood thrush hylocichl mustelin philadelph vireo vireo philadelphic and am redstart setophag ruticill appear to attain peak abund in ear or mid success forest specy prefer mor mat forest such as black throated green warbl dendroic vir and ovenbird seiur aurocapill increas sign in abund ov the year study oth import fact influ bird abund wer food avail and ev in the migr and wint period nest pred rat although vary among year show no long term pattern that would account for pop declin and brood parasit wer abs from thi forest find from thi study demonst that maj chang in bird abund occ ov tim ev in undisturb and rel mat forest and illust the nee for consid habit requir of individ specy and how habit suit chang ov tim when try to assess the caus of their long term pop trend the result also imply that any conclud about the effect of oth fact affect forest bird abund such as increas nest pred or brood parasit assocy with habit frag must also account for success chang that may be affect habit suit,new,0.9250009916175608,0.8939995435023753,0.8655899706015838,0.8395627251168715,0.8151310031108797,0.7914583495016551,0.7676516527726075,0.7425835184758232,0.7144977736100652,0.6800259131257262,0.6313623390822617
315,bird_neotropic,"Population trends in grassland, shrubland, and forest birds in eastern North America","Many species of terrestrial birds have shown substantial population declines in eastern North America. The results of the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and other long-term surveys show that the populations of most species of grassland and shrubland specialists have declined during the past 25 years. These declines are primarily due to land-use changes, particularly the growth of forest on abandoned farmland and pasture, and the intensification of agriculture on the remaining farmland. Many grassland and shrubland bird species are dependent on ephemeral habitats that quickly become unsuitable due to vegetation change. Only continual disturbance, such as fire, mowing, grazing, or logging, will maintain habitats for these species. Populations of forest migrants have also declined at particular sites, but the evidence for overall population declines throughout eastern North America is not conclusive. Results of the BBS indicate, in fact, that populations of most species of forest migrants have shown an overall increase during the past 25 years. Long-term trends are difficult to discern, however, because the abundance of forest migrants has fluctuated greatly, generally increasing between 1966 and 1979, and decreasing after 1978. Regardless of past trends in populations of forest migrants, there is cause for concern for their future. Both the breeding habitat (large areas of uninterrupted forest) and winter habitat (tropical forests and other natural or seminatural tropical habitats) needed by many species of forest migrants are threatened with degradation or destruction. The future of both early-succession and forest birds depends on careful management of regional landscapes to maintain a diversity of habitat types, with relatively large areas of continuous grassland, shrubland, and forest.",,2-s2.0-0032636265,177,0.85962881,1,pop trend in grassland shrubland and forest bird in eastern nor americ many specy of terrest bird hav shown subst pop declin in eastern nor americ the result of the bree bird survey bbs and oth long term survey show that the pop of most specy of grassland and shrubland spec hav declin dur the past year thes declin ar prim due to land us chang particul the grow of forest on abandon farmland and past and the intens of agricult on the remain farmland many grassland and shrubland bird specy ar depend on ephem habit that quick becom unsuit due to veget chang on contin disturb such as fir mow graz or log wil maintain habit for thes specy pop of forest migr hav also declin at particul sit but the evid for overal pop declin throughout eastern nor americ is not conclud result of the bbs ind in fact that pop of most specy of forest migr hav shown an overal increas dur the past year long term trend ar difficult to discern howev becaus the abund of forest migr has fluctu gre gen increas between and and decreas aft regardless of past trend in pop of forest migr ther is caus for concern for their fut both the bree habit larg area of uninterrupt forest and wint habit trop forest and oth nat or semin trop habit nee by many specy of forest migr ar threatened with degrad or destruct the fut of both ear success and forest bird depend on car man of reg landscap to maintain a divers of habit typ with rel larg area of continu grassland shrubland and forest,new,0.9120814882383678,0.8822888452383493,0.8562026425978878,0.8330316333927206,0.8117908929472288,0.7916187220031888,0.7716950659483492,0.751061976552106,0.7282942785068526,0.7007107360264824,0.6621239361423207
410,bird_neotropic,"Seasonal and longitudinal variation in the abundance and diversity of shorebirds (aves, charadriiformes) on Atalaia beach in Northeastern Brazil","Many Nearctic shorebirds cover vast areas during their annual migrations, and depend on an ample network of stopover and wintering areas for their survival. In this study, long-term data are presented on the occurrence of shorebirds at one such site on the coast of the state of Sergipe in northeastem Brazil. A 5-km long stretch of Atalaia Beach was surveyed each month between July 2003 and May 2006 (1-6 surveys per month, total = 101). The surveys resulted in records of three resident shorebird species (Vanellus chilensis, Charadrius collaris and Charadrius wilsonia) and ten Nearctic migrants (Charadriidae and Scolopacidae). The local abundance of these migrants followed a predictable pattern, with the main influx starting at the end of September, during the boreal autumn (with Charadrius semipalmatus arriving slightly earlier). The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and the Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) were the most abundant species throughout the study period, peaking at 1200 and 700 birds, respectively, in November-February. Some sanderlings (Calidris alba). Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), and Semipalmated plovers (C. semipalmatus) almost certainly overwinter at the site, and remained in the study area throughout the year, whereas the bimodal distribution of the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) indicates the use of the beach as a stopover during migration to wintering sites further south. Whilst more species were recorded during the first year, counts were lower than in subsequent years, possibly reflecting natural fluctuations in abundance or migration patterns. Overall, the data indicate that the site may be an important stopover or wintering site for populations of at least five species of Nearctic migrants, while it may be visited periodically by a number of other species. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",,2-s2.0-79952126419,61,0.857401897,1,season and longitudin vary in the abund and divers of shorebird av charadriiform on atala beach in northeastern brazil many nearct shorebird cov vast area dur their an migr and depend on an ampl network of stopov and wint area for their surv in thi study long term dat ar pres on the occur of shorebird at on such sit on the coast of the stat of sergip in northeastem brazil a km long stretch of atala beach was survey each mon between july and may survey per mon tot the survey result in record of three resid shorebird specy vanell chilens charadri coll and charadri wilson and ten nearct migr charadriida and scolopacida the loc abund of thes migr follow a predict pattern with the main influx start at the end of septemb dur the bor autumn with charadri semipalmat ar slight ear the semipalm sandpip calidr pusill and the semipalm plov charadri semipalmat wer the most abund specy throughout the study period peak at and bird respect in novemb febru som sanderl calidr alb ruddy turnston arenar interpr and semipalm plov c semipalmat almost certain overwint at the sit and remain in the study are throughout the year wherea the bimod distribut of the whit rump sandpip calidr fuscicol ind the us of the beach as a stopov dur migr to wint sit furth sou whilst mor specy wer record dur the first year count wer low than in subsequ year poss reflect nat fluctu in abund or migr pattern overal the dat ind that the sit may be an import stopov or wint sit for pop of at least fiv specy of nearct migr whil it may be visit period by a numb of oth specy,new,0.9018506211115943,0.8613723806269017,0.8252633963753274,0.7932908504026507,0.7643871580405944,0.73751983539402,0.7117529880767309,0.6861211824126681,0.6593793746488519,0.6294531037615035,0.5919628365903268

This technique would be especially valuable for tracking species poorly monitored by breeding and wintering season counts, such as boreal- nesting songbirds that winter in the tropics. Numbers of migrants counted vary with weather and other factors, however, and we need to demonstrate that migration counts give accurate results. Population trends for 1979-91 were calculated for 13 songbird species captured during autumn mist netting at 2 sites in southern Michigan. All species were northern-nesters occurring at the study sites only as transients. Annual indices of abundance were derived from a multiple regression of daily number of newly-captured birds on independent variables for date, weather, moon phase and year. Trends in the annual capture indices were significantly and positively correlated with trends in breeding bird survey (BBS) data from presumed breeding grounds in Michigan and Ontario, and were of similar magnitude.

65,bird_neotropic,Population declines in North American birds that migrate to the neotropics,"Using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the authors determined that most Neotropical migrant bird species that breed in forests of the E USA and Canada have recently (1978-1987) declined in abundance after a period of stable or increasing populations. Most permanent residents and temperate-zone migrants did not show a general pattern of decrease during this period. Field data from Mexico were used to classify a subset of the neotropical migrants as using forest or scrub habitats during winter. Population declines during 1978-1987 were significantly greater among the forest-wintering species, while populations of scrub-wintering species increased. The same subset of neotropical migrants also showed overall declines in forest-breeding species, but no significant differences existed between species breeding in forest and scrub habitats. Neotropical migrant species that primarily use forested habitats in either wintering or breeding areas are declining, but a statistically significant association between habitat and population declines was detected only in the tropics. -Authors",10.1073/pnas.86.19.7658,2-s2.0-0024747012,174,0.8520525309999999,1,pop declin in nor am bird that migr to the neotrop us dat from the nor am bree bird survey the auth determin that most neotrop migr bird specy that bree in forest of the e us and canad hav rec declin in abund aft a period of stabl or increas pop most perm resid and temp zon migr did not show a gen pattern of decreas dur thi period field dat from mexico wer us to class a subset of the neotrop migr as us forest or scrub habit dur wint pop declin dur wer sign gre among the forest wint specy whil pop of scrub wint specy increas the sam subset of neotrop migr also show overal declin in forest bree specy but no sign diff ex between specy bree in forest and scrub habit neotrop migr specy that prim us forest habit in eith wint or bree area ar declin but a stat sign assocy between habit and pop declin was detect on in the trop auth,new,0.9079070866932193,0.8667270794506068,0.828460859977428,0.7933601853675647,0.7606897672320362,0.7295602567021209,0.699029634248799,0.6679780608667439,0.6347880892168577,0.5965552056103589,0.5469234661724744

We counted Cardinals in each season of the year along nine line transects laid out in a dense, border, and open section of the forest. Using Distance program we estimated the population density on this site in 2.1 individuals per ha. Cardinal abundance was lower in the dense forest than in the border and open forest. Cardinal group size and juvenile abundance were also lower in the dense forest than in the open and border forest. The seasonal distribution of Cardinal abundance was different between habitats. The dense forest showed a slight increase during the breeding season, but there were no definite trends in other habitats. Results of this study indicate that habitat characteristics on a small scale are important in determining the abundance of Red-crested Cardinals. Since Cardinals intensively used pastures adjacent to forests, this is likely the cause of the lower abundance in the dense forest. We concluded that combination of dense and open forests in a grassland matrix would be suitable habitat for the conservation of Red-crested Cardinal populations. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",,2-s2.0-84865721989,160,0.8470381640000001,1,habit structure influ the abund of the red crest cardin paroar coronat in a temp forest of argentin la estructur del h√°bitat influy en la abundanc del card com√∫n paroar coronat en un bosqu templado de argentin we analys the influ of forest structure on the habit us of the red crest cardin paroar coronat in a temp forest in cent east argentin dur we count cardin in each season of the year along nin lin transect laid out in a dens bord and op sect of the forest us dist program we estim the pop dens on thi sit in individ per ha cardin abund was low in the dens forest than in the bord and op forest cardin group siz and juvenil abund wer also low in the dens forest than in the op and bord forest the season distribut of cardin abund was diff between habit the dens forest show a slight increas dur the bree season but ther wer no definit trend in oth habit result of thi study ind that habit charact on a smal scal ar import in determin the abund of red crest cardin sint cardin intend us past adjac to forest thi is lik the caus of the low abund in the dens forest we conclud that combin of dens and op forest in a grassland matrix would be suit habit for the conserv of red crest cardin pop,new,0.8890919508555672,0.8388888859363121,0.7937238588325256,0.7535601572086507,0.7171789814554059,0.683332875997637,0.650835670252524,0.6183965048311492,0.5842583209262227,0.5453811504755912,0.4952911676117146
85,bird_neotropic,Drivers of demographic decline across the annual cycle of a threatened migratory bird,"Migratory species are rapidly declining but we rarely know which periods of the annual cycle are limiting for most species. This knowledge is needed to effectively allocate conservation resources to the periods of the annual cycle that best promote species recovery. We examined demographic trends and response to human footprint for Canada warblers (Cardellina canadensis), a threatened Neotropical migrant, using range-wide data (1993-2016) from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program on the breeding grounds. Declines in abundance were steepest in the eastern breeding region, followed by the western region. Breeding productivity did not decline in any region. In contrast, we observed declining recruitment in all regions, low apparent survival in the east and west, and a decline in apparent survival in the east. Abundance declined with increasing disturbance around MAPS stations. Between 1993 and 2009, the human footprint index on the breeding range increased by 0.11% in contrast to a 14% increase on the wintering range. Landscape-scale disturbance on the breeding grounds may influence abundance in some regions; however, the observed trends in demography and footprint suggests limitation during the non-breeding period as the likely driver of overall declines, particularly for eastern populations. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-018-25633-z,2-s2.0-85046897777,176,0.84611289,1,driv of demograph declin across the an cyc of a threatened migr bird migr specy ar rapid declin but we rar know which period of the an cyc ar limit for most specy thi knowledg is nee to effect alloc conserv resourc to the period of the an cyc that best promot specy recovery we examin demograph trend and respons to hum footprint for canad warbl cardellin canadens a threatened neotrop migr us rang wid dat from the monit av produc and surv map program on the bree ground declin in abund wer steepest in the eastern bree reg follow by the western reg bree produc did not declin in any reg in contrast we observ declin recruit in al reg low app surv in the east and west and a declin in app surv in the east abund declin with increas disturb around map stat between and the hum footprint index on the bree rang increas by in contrast to a increas on the wint rang landscap scal disturb on the bree ground may influ abund in som reg howev the observ trend in demograph and footprint suggest limit dur the non bree period as the lik driv of overal declin particul for eastern pop,new,0.8958354499583888,0.8715322163565431,0.8518054404844062,0.8354670393339528,0.8215065435510144,0.8092015434897071,0.7980175433183578,0.7875035251345129,0.7771907844393222,0.7663924506039466,0.7537863310313287
94,bird_neotropic,Variation in survivorship of a migratory songbird throughout its annual cycle,"1. Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ¬± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ¬± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ¬± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ¬± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ¬± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ¬± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ¬± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ¬± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6. Additional data from multiple species, especially measures of habitat-specific demography and dispersal, will improve our understanding of the relative impacts of the breeding, migratory, and winter periods on population dynamics of migratory birds and thus enhance future conservation efforts.",10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00599.x,2-s2.0-0036107393,141,0.84251267,0,vary in surv of a migr songbird throughout it an cyc demograph dat from both bree and non bree period ar nee to man pop of migr bird many of which ar declin in abund and ar of conserv concern although habit assocy and to a less ext reproduc biolog ar known for many migr specy few study hav meas surv rat of thes bird at diff part of their an cyc cormack jol seb model and akaik s inform crit model select wer us to investig season vary in surv of a nearct neotrop migr songbird the black throated blu warbl dendroic caerulesc season and an surv wer estim from resight of colo ring individ on bree ground in new hampshir us from to and on wint quart in jamaic west indy from to warbl wer study each year dur the may august bree period in new hampshir and dur the octob march overwint period in jamaic in new hampshir mal had high an surv ¬± and recapt prob ¬± than did fem surv ¬± recapt ¬± in jamaic an surv ¬± and recapt ¬± prob did not diff between sex an surv and recapt prob of young bird i e yearl in new hampshir and hatch year bird in jamaic did not diff from adult ind that from the tim hatch year individ acquir territ on wint quart in mid octob they surv as wel as adult within the sam habit month surv prob dur the sum may august and wint octob march stat period wer high for mal in new hampshir and ¬± for mal in jamaic and for fem in both loc thes an and season surv estim wer us to calc warbl surv for the migr period month surv prob dur migr rang from to ¬± thu app mort rat wer at least tim high dur migr comp to that in the stat period and mor than of app an mort of d caerulesc occur dur migr addit dat from multipl specy espec meas of habit spec demograph and dispers wil improv our understand of the rel impact of the bree migr and wint period on pop dynam of migr bird and thu enh fut conserv effort,new,0.8974662840772918,0.866945017533451,0.8405719225209439,0.817611318232615,0.7971606455399222,0.7784695895845075,0.7609101304327062,0.7438816798141328,0.7266866504761462,0.7082153258954685,0.6862372267764508
103,bird_neotropic,"Factors influencing the decline of Neotropical migrants in a northeastern forest fragment: isolation, fragmentation, or mosaic effects?","Breeding bird populations at Sapsucker Woods, Ithaca, NY, were analyzed by comparing vegetation and bird censuses conducted in 1949-50 and 1979-80 for the eastern portion of the Sapsucker Woods. Seventeen censuses conducted between 1957 and 1974 were also analyzed. Declines or local extinctions occurred in 10 Neotropical migrant species between 1949 and 1980. Species richness and abundance of the nonmigratory population increased. Although species turnover rates were highly variable, species richness of the total breeding population remained constant. Pair-wise comparisons of 20 yearly Shannon diversity indices revealed little significant variation. Wide-ranging raptor species nested regularly over a period totaling 35 years. Observed declines in breeding densities of Neotropical migrants and concurrent increases in resident species can be explained best by patterns of forest successional change affected by land-use history. Land-use history at local and regional scales can have significant effects on patterns of bird distribution and abundance, particularly with respect to the cumulative effects of gap-phase succession resulting from loss of individual canopy trees. To distinguish bird population changes resulting from local successional patterns from other influences, it is essential that vegetation data be collected and analyzed in parallel with bird population data. In this more dynamic context, reported declines in populations of eastern woodland songbirds, attributed to forest fragmentation, insularization, and even tropical deforestation, might need to be qualified.",,2-s2.0-0032669222,169,0.8408443320000001,1,fact influ the declin of neotrop migr in a northeastern forest frag isol frag or mosa effect bree bird pop at sapsuck wood ithac ny wer analys by comp veget and bird census conduc in and for the eastern port of the sapsuck wood seventeen census conduc between and wer also analys declin or loc extinct occur in neotrop migr specy between and specy rich and abund of the nonmigr pop increas although specy turnov rat wer high vary specy rich of the tot bree pop remain const pair wis comparison of year shannon divers ind rev littl sign vary wid rang rapt specy nest regul ov a period tot year observ declin in bree dens of neotrop migr and concur increas in resid specy can be explain best by pattern of forest success chang affect by land us hist land us hist at loc and reg scal can hav sign effect on pattern of bird distribut and abund particul with respect to the cum effect of gap phas success result from loss of individ canop tre to distinct bird pop chang result from loc success pattern from oth influ it is ess that veget dat be collect and analys in parallel with bird pop dat in thi mor dynam context report declin in pop of eastern woodland songbird attribut to forest frag insul and ev trop deforest might nee to be qual,new,0.9005748423674553,0.8573766236654293,0.8178854942062697,0.7822135319322175,0.7494857471966617,0.718727391409475,0.6889641664517687,0.6590998066132515,0.6276201415078517,0.5918897769295387,0.5462658093345631
117,bird_neotropic,On the ecology and conservation of the critically endangered Masafuera Rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae),"The Masafuera Rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae) is a little known, critically endangered, endemic bird species of Alexander Selkirk Island, Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile. The last assessment reported a population as low as 140 individuals. Possible causes for its decline could be habitat loss and degradation, and potentially a lack of nest sites. We conducted a new population assessment using point counts and investigated habitat use patterns during the post-breeding season of 2006 and 2007. We also installed 81 nest boxes (in three areas) to study the species' breeding ecology and to increase potential nest sites. Our estimated mean rayadito abundance for 2006 was 0.54 ¬±0.19 ind/ha (mean ¬± SE, approximately 250 individuals in the southern area). We could not survey all the areas where the rayadito might be found, but extrapolating to a conservative estimate of potential habitat of 1000 ha we estimate a total population size of 500 individuals (148-932, Cl 95%). We found a significant positive relationship between number of rayaditos and canelo (Drymis confertifolia) cover (GLM Poisson, P = 0.045), with canelo coverage approximately 8% of the southern area. A year after establishment, seven out of 42 boxes (southern group) had been occupied: three complete and four incomplete nests. All three complete nests had a supporting structure (1042.99 ¬± 18.16 cm3) of canelo and tree-fern (Dicksonia externa) rootlets and a soft cup (313.68 ¬± 112.08 cm3) of petrel (Pterodroma externa and P. longirostris) feathers. Our results showed rayadito population levels similar to what was found in the late 1980s, although the species still faces considerable threats. The probability of box occupation was not affected by tree diameter or box placement height. These results suggest that canelo trees and nest boxes could be used in the restoration of the rayadito habitat.

124,bird_neotropic,"Long-term declines and decadal patterns in population trends of songbirds in western North America, 1979-1999","We analyzed population trends from a constant-effort mist-netting study conducted in central coastal California during the autumns of 1979-1999. Of 31 taxa captured in sufficient numbers, 16 underwent statistically significant declines and none increased. Twice as many species declined from 1989-1999 as compared to 1979-1989. Overall, our results were similar to those of regional Breeding Bird Surveys determined for the same species during the same period. In an attempt to identify possible causes for trends, we grouped species by various life-history categories including nest height, nest type, likelihood of cowbird parasitism, wintering location, winter food preference, and tolerance for human presence on the breeding grounds. All groups underwent significant declines, although high nesters, common cowbird hosts, and Neotropical migrants declined faster than their respective counterparts. While life-history attributes explained differences in trends between groups, there was significant heterogeneity of trends within groups. Capture rates of certain species and groups appeared to be affected by various climate variables, and accelerating declines since 1990 may reflect effects of large-scale climate cycles, particularly on long-distance migrants. We suggest that long-term population trajectories of songbird populations across North America may be better understood in the context of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Interpretation of our results is, in some cases, problematic due to the complex interaction of methodological limitations and environmental variables, especially habitat change on the study site.

134,bird_neotropic,"Diversity, biogeography, abundance, and conservation of the birds of Mocha Island National Reserve, Chile","The avifauna of Mocha Island is analysed according to species richness, habitat use, and reproductive status, and the first quantitative population estimates of forest landbirds are presented basing on unbiased survey data as a basis for conservation. We recorded a total of 100 species, including non-breeders. Among all recorded taxa, landbirds (n = 48 spp. or 48 %) exhibit higher species numbers when compared to shore- and seabirds (38), and freshwater birds (14). Within the documented breeding avifauna (n = 54 spp.) landbirds take an even relative higher value, amounting to 88 % (or 42 spp.). Austral and Neotropical species are most numerous within the landbird assemblage, reflecting the closest biogeographical realm. When comparing different Chilean avifaunas, southern mainland ecosystems show the highest landbird richness (90), followed by Chiloe Island (61), Mocha Island (42), and remote Juan Fernandez Islands (11). From line transects surveyed, 884 bird individuals belonging to 18 resident forest landbird species were recorded (averaging 10.3 ind/ha). We calculated the total population size of forest landbirds in the reserve (2300 ha) being 23,681 individuals. Two of the three endemic taxa (Mocha Rayadito and Mocha Chucao) show relatively high population sizes of about 4,100 and 3,700 individuals, respectively. The Mocha Thrush shows a population of about 670 individuals in forests, but is equally abundant in anthropogenic pastures around. Future conservation management of Mocha Island should consider richness, composition, and abundance of landbirds reported in this study, with emphasis on breeding ecology of the three mentioned endemics. Priority should be put on controlling illegal timber extraction, bird hunting and chick collecting, as well as on sensitization of local people to avoid introducing alien species. ¬© Senckenberg Gesellschaft f√ºr Naturforschung, 2016.",,2-s2.0-85013103838,171,0.826980713,0,divers biogeograph abund and conserv of the bird of moch island nat reserv chil the avifaun of moch island is analys accord to specy rich habit us and reproduc stat and the first quantit pop estim of forest landbird ar pres bas on unbias survey dat as a bas for conserv we record a tot of specy includ non bree among al record tax landbird n spp or exhibit high specy numb when comp to shor and seabird and freshw bird within the docu bree avifaun n spp landbird tak an ev rel high valu amount to or spp aust and neotrop specy ar most num within the landbird assembl reflect the closest biogeograph realm when comp diff chil avifauna southern mainland ecosystem show the highest landbird rich follow by chilo island moch island and remot juan fernandez island from lin transect survey bird individ belong to resid forest landbird specy wer record av ind ha we calc the tot pop siz of forest landbird in the reserv ha being individ two of the three endem tax moch rayadito and moch chucao show rel high pop siz of about and individ respect the moch thrush show a pop of about individ in forest but is eq abund in anthropog past around fut conserv man of moch island should consid rich composit and abund of landbird report in thi study with emphas on bree ecolog of the three ment endem pri should be put on control illeg timb extract bird hunt and chick collect as wel as on sensit of loc peopl to avoid introduc aly specy,new,0.8256700632830045,0.7452651033397028,0.6764833193445543,0.6196179571568806,0.5722516820357062,0.5320451308006215,0.49715139947737885,0.46611124889670497,0.43764657414540664,0.4103668412655242,0.38216982474158234
143,bird_neotropic,Geostatistics as a tool for examining hypothesized declines in migratory songbirds,"Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate significant declines in the populations of several species of songbirds, including several Neotropical migrants. These declines have been attributed to habitat destruction and fragmentation on the breeding grounds, in strategic migratory stopover sites, and on the wintering grounds. Using BBS data from the 1967-1989 period and universal kriging, we produced maps of abundance change for two declining species of wood warblers to test hypothetical spatial scenarios of decline over entire breeding ranges. These species were the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) and the Prairie Warbler (D. discolor). We found considerable variability in the location of areas of decline when comparing successive 5-yr periods. In some comparisons, areas of decline were concentrated in the centers of abundance of these species, and in others, they were scattered throughout their range. We also found that the direction and intensity of population trends was quite sensitive to the methods used for calculating abundance. Our results indicate that, even for species where significant longterm declines have been reported, considerable variation exists in the direction of abundance change, both geographically and temporally. Although most of the long-term declines reported in particular species at local and regional scales are undeniable, gaps in our knowledge still prevent us from incorporating these trends into a global model of the annual cycle of Neotropical migrants.",10.2307/2265654,2-s2.0-0030422765,38,0.824104064,1,geost as a tool for examin hypothes declin in migr songbird dat from the nor am bree bird survey bbs ind sign declin in the pop of sev specy of songbird includ sev neotrop migr thes declin hav been attribut to habit destruct and frag on the bree ground in strategic migr stopov sit and on the wint ground us bbs dat from the period and univers krig we produc map of abund chang for two declin specy of wood warbl to test hypothet spat scenario of declin ov entir bree rang thes specy wer the cer warbl dendroic cerule and the prairy warbl d discol we found consid vary in the loc of area of declin when comp success yr period in som comparison area of declin wer cont in the cent of abund of thes specy and in oth they wer scat throughout their rang we also found that the direct and intens of pop trend was quit sensit to the method us for calc abund our result ind that ev for specy wher sign longterm declin hav been report consid vary ex in the direct of abund chang both geograph and temp although most of the long term declin report in particul specy at loc and reg scal ar undeny gap in our knowledg stil prev us from incorp thes trend into a glob model of the an cyc of neotrop migr,new,0.8800951842305842,0.8412749355637152,0.8084346578153135,0.7803962794652131,0.7558189344355264,0.7336492393856066,0.7130463134822422,0.6932389991423868,0.6733367200629384,0.6519516850804534,0.6262460985548751
155,bird_neotropic,Population dynamics of breeding Neotropical migrants in a fragmented Illinois landscape,"Several lines of evidence suggest that an archipelago of small (<70 ha) woodlots in central Illinois is a population sink for most breeding Neotropical migrants. Although the three intensively studied woodlots were small (14-65 ha), they contained several species that are considered area-sensitive elsewhere in their range, including the worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). Populations of six Neotropical migrants declined by at least 50% and none increased by more than 10% during the five years (1985-1989) of the study. Mist-net data suggest very low (ca. 15%) return rates of adults between years with only a small core of adults returning year after year. Data on nesting success indicate that most nests fail because of high predation rates (ca. 80% of open cup nests) and brood parasitism (ca. 76% of nests of Neotropical migrants) by the omnipresent, abundant brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Parasitized nests with more than one cowbird egg were the rule rather than the exception, and contained an average of 3.3 cowbird eggs for Neotropical migrants. Wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nests averaged nearly four times as many cowbird eggs as host eggs (4.6 vs. 1.2). Ground-nesting species such as the ovenbird and Kentucky warbler (Oporornis formosus) appear to be less susceptible to brood parasitism than shrub-nesting species. Midsummer mist-net data also showed little evidence of reproduction by Neotropical migrants as hatching year:adult ratios averaged 0.1 compared with ratios of >1.0 for many year-round residents and short-distance migrants.

164,bird_neotropic,Range-wide effects of breeding- and nonbreeding-season climate on the abundance of a Neotropical migrant songbird,"Geographic variation in the population dynamics of a species can result from regional variability in climate and how it affects reproduction and survival. Identifying such effects for migratory birds requires the integration of population models with knowledge of migratory connectivity between breeding and nonbreeding areas. We used Bayesian hierarchical models with 26 years of Breeding Bird Survey data (1982-2007) to investigate the impacts of breeding- and nonbreeding-season climate on abundance of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) across the species range. We focused on 15 populations defined by Bird Conservation Regions, and we included variation across routes and observers as well as temporal trends and climate effects. American Redstart populations that breed in eastern North America showed increased abundance following winters with higher plant productivity in the Caribbean where they are expected to overwinter. In contrast, western breeding populations showed little response to conditions in their expected wintering areas in west Mexico, perhaps reflecting lower migratory connectivity or differential effects of winter rainfall on individuals across the species range. Unlike the case with winter climate, we found few effects of temperature prior to arrival in spring (March-April) or during the nesting period (May-June) on abundance the following year. Eight populations showed significant changes in abundance, with the steepest declines in the Atlantic Northern Forest (3.4%/yr) and the greatest increases in the Prairie Hardwood Transition (4%/yr). This study emphasizes how the effects of climate on populations of migratory birds are context dependent and can vary depending on geographic location and the period of the annual cycle. Such knowledge is essential for predicting regional variation in how populations of a species might vary in their response to climate change. ¬© 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/10-1757.1,2-s2.0-80051875975,21,0.8160656490000001,1,rang wid effect of bree and nonbree season clim on the abund of a neotrop migr songbird geograph vary in the pop dynam of a specy can result from reg vary in clim and how it affect reproduc and surv ident such effect for migr bird requir the integr of pop model with knowledg of migr connect between bree and nonbree area we us bayes hierarch model with year of bree bird survey dat to investig the impact of bree and nonbree season clim on abund of am redstart setophag ruticill across the specy rang we focus on pop defin by bird conserv reg and we includ vary across rout and observ as wel as temp trend and clim effect am redstart pop that bree in eastern nor americ show increas abund follow wint with high plant produc in the carib wher they ar expect to overwint in contrast western bree pop show littl respons to condit in their expect wint area in west mexico perhap reflect low migr connect or diff effect of wint rainfal on individ across the specy rang unlik the cas with wint clim we found few effect of temp pri to ar in spring march april or dur the nest period may jun on abund the follow year eight pop show sign chang in abund with the steepest declin in the atl northern forest yr and the greatest increas in the prairy hardwood transit yr thi study emphas how the effect of clim on pop of migr bird ar context depend and can vary depend on geograph loc and the period of the an cyc such knowledg is ess for predict reg vary in how pop of a specy might vary in their respons to clim chang,new,0.8574499877275432,0.8060402044953142,0.7615808802989045,0.7234885973976855,0.6903597358893114,0.6609207996772695,0.6341002611652322,0.6089090195437872,0.5842363310259232,0.5583898499486887,0.5280152307937397
174,bird_neotropic,Demographic response of a neotropical migrant songbird to forest management and climate change scenarios,"Demographic models for species sensitive to human activities that are still relatively common are of particular interest to compare the relative influence of human land use and climate on population trends. Yet, data limitations often restrict our ability to interpret the numerical response of species to habitat alteration and climatic change adds to this challenge. In this study, we used habitat-specific demographic information from an individually-marked population of Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and a forest timber supply model to project population trends over an 80-year horizon. We modelled changes in Ovenbird abundance, productivity, and population growth rate as a function of harvesting scenarios (no harvest, forestry-as-usual, and increased [10% or 20%] harvesting intensity) and projected impacts of climate change (0%, 10%, and 50% reductions in population size over the 80-year period), as well as contrasting assumptions about population dynamics (i.e. open vs. closed population). Among the many effects of climate change, it has been hypothesized that reductions in annual snow cover will occur, causing deeper and more frequent frost penetration into the soil and, in turn, a reduction in invertebrate (food) abundance during the following breeding season. Our models suggest that the study area currently is a demographic sink (Œª=. 0.920) for Ovenbirds, although some habitat types still act as demographic sources. Over the first 7. years, a large decline in abundance of territorial males (~25%) is projected, unless population levels are maintained through immigration. Interestingly, when we allowed for immigration from outside the study area, population growth rate remained <1 because a larger proportion of the population occupied habitat types acting as sinks. Over an 80-year period, the climate change scenarios we simulated were more likely to have negative impacts (5-49%) than forestry activities, whether we applied the current management plan or more intensive harvesting scenarios. To our knowledge, this study used some of the most detailed habitat-specific demographic information available for a North American forest songbird to model the relative influence of land use, climate, and population dynamics on population trends. Future studies should examine the possibility of synergistic effects between harvesting and climate change, to model their influence on Ovenbird or other species foraging on litter invertebrates. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.foreco.2015.10.002,2-s2.0-84946212401,79,0.8116989809999999,0,demograph respons of a neotrop migr songbird to forest man and clim chang scenario demograph model for specy sensit to hum act that ar stil rel common ar of particul interest to comp the rel influ of hum land us and clim on pop trend yet dat limit oft restrict our abl to interpret the num respons of specy to habit alt and clim chang ad to thi challeng in thi study we us habit spec demograph inform from an individ mark pop of ovenbird seiur aurocapill and a forest timb supply model to project pop trend ov an year horizon we model chang in ovenbird abund produc and pop grow rat as a funct of harvest scenario no harvest forestry as us and increas or harvest intens and project impact of clim chang and reduc in pop siz ov the year period as wel as contrast assum about pop dynam i e op vs clos pop among the many effect of clim chang it has been hypothes that reduc in an snow cov wil occ caus deep and mor frequ frost penet into the soil and in turn a reduc in invertebr food abund dur the follow bree season our model suggest that the study are cur is a demograph sink œª for ovenbird although som habit typ stil act as demograph sourc ov the first year a larg declin in abund of territ mal is project unless pop level ar maintain through immigr interest when we allow for immigr from outsid the study are pop grow rat remain becaus a larg proport of the pop occupy habit typ act as sink ov an year period the clim chang scenario we sim wer mor lik to hav neg impact than forestry act wheth we apply the cur man plan or mor intend harvest scenario to our knowledg thi study us som of the most detail habit spec demograph inform avail for a nor am forest songbird to model the rel influ of land us clim and pop dynam on pop trend fut study should examin the poss of synerg effect between harvest and clim chang to model their influ on ovenbird or oth specy for on lit invertebr,new,0.8531511841396434,0.83322255967923,0.8181889491126261,0.8064610358447787,0.7970744283377786,0.7894463088977339,0.7832093425972085,0.778122084748579,0.7740251216215729,0.7707806616051809,0.7682687632358687
184,bird_neotropic,Rainfall and population dynamics of Grey Pileated Finch Coryphospingus pileatus (Aves: Passeriformes) in a Neotropical dry forest,"In tropical dry environments rainfall periodicity may affect demographic parameters, resulting in fluctuations in bird abundance. We used capture‚Äìrecapture data for the Grey Pileated Finch from a Neotropical dry forest to evaluate the hypothesis that intra- and inter-annual survival, individuals entrance and population abundance, are related to local rainfall. Sampling occurred across 3¬†years, with individuals captured, tagged and evaluated for age and presence of brood patch every 14¬†days. Using the POPAN formulation, we generated demographic models to evaluate study population temporal dynamics. Best-fit models indicated a low apparent annual survival in the first year (16%) compared to other years (between 47 and 62%), with this low value associated with an extreme drought. The abundance of juveniles at each capture occasion was significantly dependent on the accumulated precipitation in the previous 14¬†days, and the juvenile covariate was a strong predictor of the intra-annual entrance probability (natality). Individuals entrance during the reproductive period corresponded to 53, 52 and 75% of total ingress for each year, respectively. The trend in sampled population size indicated positive exponential growth (Ninitial = 50, Nlast = 600), with intra-annual fluctuations becoming progressively more intense. Low survival was relevant during population decline at study onset, while at study end intense Individuals entrance promoted rapid population growth. Thus, the indirect effects of rainfall and the combined effect of two demographic rates operated synergistically on the immediate population abundance of Grey Pileated Finch, an abundant bird in a Neotropical dry forest. ¬© 2018, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10144-018-0624-7,2-s2.0-85048255782,1,0.8077227490000001,1,rainfal and pop dynam of grey pil finch coryphosping pileat av passeriform in a neotrop dry forest in trop dry environ rainfal period may affect demograph paramet result in fluctu in bird abund we us capture‚äìrecaptur dat for the grey pil finch from a neotrop dry forest to evalu the hypothes that intr and int an surv individ ent and pop abund ar rel to loc rainfal sampl occur across ¬†years with individ capt tag and evalu for ag and pres of brood patch every ¬†days us the pop form we gen demograph model to evalu study pop temp dynam best fit model ind a low app an surv in the first year comp to oth year between and with thi low valu assocy with an extrem drought the abund of juvenil at each capt occas was sign depend on the accum precipit in the prevy ¬†days and the juvenil cov was a strong predict of the intr an ent prob nat individ ent dur the reproduc period correspond to and of tot ingress for each year respect the trend in sampl pop siz ind posit expon grow ninit nlast with intr an fluctu becom progress mor intens low surv was relev dur pop declin at study onset whil at study end intens individ ent promot rapid pop grow thu the indirect effect of rainfal and the combin effect of two demograph rat op synerg on the immedy pop abund of grey pil finch an abund bird in a neotrop dry forest,new,0.8488481630018764,0.8200902140303149,0.7978023618858753,0.7799657741183221,0.7652244067341051,0.7527299040281402,0.7419295635589385,0.7324377339550501,0.7239635296757474,0.7162192444850382,0.7088244292935874
194,bird_neotropic,"Neotropical austral migrant landbirds: Population trends and habitat use in the Central Monte Desert, Argentina","We studied density changes of two groups of Neotropical austral migrant landbirds - the South American temperate-tropical (SATT) and cold-temperate (SACT) migratory systems - in the main habitat types of the central Monte desert of Argentina (open Prosopis flexuosa woodland and Larrea cuneifolia shrubland) over 10 years. Five species, all tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae) made up SATT, whereas only two of the seven species of SACT were tyrannids. Densities of both SATT and SACT were higher in open woodland than in shrubland. SATT density did not differ among years, but SACT density did, having lower values in 1994 in both habitats. In subsequent years, SACT densities increased but did not reach values similar to those previous to 1994. The decline in 1994 coincided with a two-year drought period that began in 1993, but lower density in the following years did not appear to be related to climatic conditions in the study area, suggesting a low capacity of SACT species to recover population abundance after periods of stress. In contrast, SATT density was not associated with local climatic conditions, possibly because several SATT species used the study area only as a stopover site. During the breeding season, birds of both migratory systems disproportionately use the open woodland, which offers more sites to nest and feed than does the shrubland. Although most SATT and SACT species are abundant and not currently of conservation concern, human activities in the central Monte desert promote the structural simplification of the habitat, which could threaten future populations of Neotropical austral migrant landbirds in this ecosystem. ¬© The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.",10.1525/cond.2008.110.1.70,2-s2.0-57649145717,112,0.8054555170000001,1,neotrop aust migr landbird pop trend and habit us in the cent mont desert argentin we study dens chang of two group of neotrop aust migr landbird the sou am temp trop sat and cold temp sact migr system in the main habit typ of the cent mont desert of argentin op prosop flexuos woodland and larre cuneifol shrubland ov year fiv specy al tyr flycatch tyrannida mad up sat wherea on two of the sev specy of sact wer tyrannid dens of both sat and sact wer high in op woodland than in shrubland sat dens did not diff among year but sact dens did hav low valu in in both habit in subsequ year sact dens increas but did not reach valu simil to thos prevy to the declin in coincid with a two year drought period that beg in but low dens in the follow year did not appear to be rel to clim condit in the study are suggest a low capac of sact specy to recov pop abund aft period of stress in contrast sat dens was not assocy with loc clim condit poss becaus sev sat specy us the study are on as a stopov sit dur the bree season bird of both migr system disproport us the op woodland which off mor sit to nest and fee than doe the shrubland although most sat and sact specy ar abund and not cur of conserv concern hum act in the cent mont desert promot the structural simpl of the habit which could threaten fut pop of neotrop aust migr landbird in thi ecosystem,new,0.8488090994698533,0.8036088941279745,0.7666214079025685,0.7360048032873974,0.7099570020727427,0.6871733744564783,0.6667071289450811,0.6478005440026303,0.6297215990320112,0.6115078803050978,0.5913962892119813
204,bird_neotropic,Recommendations for monitoring avian populations with point counts: A case study in southeastern Brazil,"In the northern hemisphere, bird counts have been fundamental in gathering data to understand population trends. Due to the seasonality of the northern hemisphere, counts take place during two clearly defined moments in time: the breeding season (resident birds) and winter (after migration). Depending on location, Neotropical birds may breed at any time of year, may or may not migrate, and those patterns are not necessarily synchronous among species. Also in contrast to the northern hemisphere, population trends and the impact of rapid urbanization and deforestation are unknown and unmonitored. Throughout one year, we used point counts to better understand temporal patterns of bird species richness and relative abundance in the state of S√£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil, to examine how to implement similar bird counts in tropical America. We counted birds twice each day on 10 point transects (20 points day-1), separated by 200 m, with a 100 m limited detection radius in a semideciduous tropical forest. Both species richness and bird abundance were greater in the morning, but accumulation curves suggest that longer-duration afternoon counts would reach the same total species as in morning counts. Species richness and bird abundance did not vary seasonally and unique species were counted every month; relatively few species (20%) were present in all months. Most (84%) known forest species in the area were encountered. We suggest that point counts can work here as they do in the northern hemisphere. We recommend that transects include at least 20 points and that the simplest timing of bird counts would also be seasonal, using timing of migration of austral migrants (and six months later) to coordinate counts. We propose that bird counts in Brazil, and elsewhere in Latin America, would provide data to help understand population trends, but would require greater effort than in temperate latitudes due to greater species richness and different dynamics of reproduction and migration. With collaboration among ornithologists and coordinated bird surveys, we may develop a technique for the tropics that would yield information for population trends and conservation of birds, similar to counts in temperate latitudes.",10.1590/S0031-10492013003200001,2-s2.0-84890308523,179,0.8040743920000001,0,recommend for monit av pop with point count a cas study in southeastern brazil in the northern hemisph bird count hav been funda in gath dat to understand pop trend due to the season of the northern hemisph count tak plac dur two clear defin mom in tim the bree season resid bird and wint aft migr depend on loc neotrop bird may bree at any tim of year may or may not migr and thos pattern ar not necess synchron among specy also in contrast to the northern hemisph pop trend and the impact of rapid urb and deforest ar unknown and unmonit throughout on year we us point count to bet understand temp pattern of bird specy rich and rel abund in the stat of s√£o paulo southeastern brazil to examin how to impl simil bird count in trop americ we count bird twic each day on point transect point day sep by m with a m limit detect radi in a semidecidu trop forest both specy rich and bird abund wer gre in the morn but accum curv suggest that long dur afternoon count would reach the sam tot specy as in morn count specy rich and bird abund did not vary season and un specy wer count every mon rel few specy wer pres in al month most known forest specy in the are wer encount we suggest that point count can work her as they do in the northern hemisph we recommend that transect includ at least point and that the simplest tim of bird count would also be season us tim of migr of aust migr and six month lat to coordin count we propos that bird count in brazil and elsewh in latin americ would provid dat to help understand pop trend but would requir gre effort than in temp latitud due to gre specy rich and diff dynam of reproduc and migr with collab among ornitholog and coordin bird survey we may develop a techn for the trop that would yield inform for pop trend and conserv of bird simil to count in temp latitud,new,0.8740976136198574,0.8212330522292747,0.7740512953004142,0.7324073469348588,0.6950812173293887,0.6608511611141327,0.6286066446324534,0.5972278911503283,0.5653261445477782,0.5306740534129742,0.4887205161375401
217,bird_neotropic,Evaluating Great Smoky Mountains National Park as a population source for the Wood Thrush,"The prevailing fragmentation paradigm predicts that large, intact forests are acting as population sources for Neotropical migrant landbirds. We used the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as a model for evaluating the role Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the largest national park in the eastern United States) may play in maintaining regional songbird populations. We estimated the annual productivity of Wood Thrushes in the park by combining observations on the birds' distribution, abundance, and productivity with estimates of habitat availability. We estimated a breeding population of approximately 10,000 nesting pairs using habitat models developed from over 2500 point-count censuses conducted across the park. Data from 426 nests monitored from 1992 to 1997 produced a daily nest survival rate of 0.96. We estimated an annual fecundity of 2.76 fledglings per breeding pair, based on a model that incorporated the re-nesting behavior of Wood Thrushes. Results indicate that the park is producing approximately 3000 surplus female young each year. Daily nest survival rates were below those reported in other studies of Wood Thrushes in large forest tracts. The relatively high productivity of 3.31 nestlings per successful nest suggests that, in the absence of predation, the park provides high-quality nesting habitat for Wood Thrushes, but that it may also support a more diverse and abundant predator community than more disturbed or less contiguous sites. The difficulties of estimating the size of continental breeding bird populations make assessing the significance of the park within a regional landscape context problematic, but our estimates suggest that, although the park is functioning as a substantial population source on a local scale, its potential to sustain regional or continental Wood Thrush populations is limited. Our findings suggest that species such as the Wood Thrush are capable of moderate levels of surplus productivity in high-quality habitat, but that extensive areas of suitable habitat outside protected areas and other public lands will be required to sustain continental breeding populations.",10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98606.x,2-s2.0-0033864264,201,0.8032669809999999,0,evalu gre smoky mountain nat park as a pop sourc for the wood thrush the prevail frag paradigm predict that larg intact forest ar act as pop sourc for neotrop migr landbird we us the wood thrush hylocichl mustelin as a model for evalu the rol gre smoky mountain nat park the largest nat park in the eastern unit stat may play in maintain reg songbird pop we estim the an produc of wood thrushes in the park by combin observ on the bird distribut abund and produc with estim of habit avail we estim a bree pop of approxim nest pair us habit model develop from ov point count census conduc across the park dat from nest monit from to produc a dai nest surv rat of we estim an an fecund of fledgl per bree pair bas on a model that incorp the re nest behavy of wood thrushes result ind that the park is produc approxim surpl fem young each year dai nest surv rat wer below thos report in oth study of wood thrushes in larg forest tract the rel high produc of nestl per success nest suggest that in the abs of pred the park provid high qual nest habit for wood thrushes but that it may also support a mor divers and abund pred commun than mor disturb or less contigu sit the difficul of estim the siz of contin bree bird pop mak assess the sign of the park within a reg landscap context problem but our estim suggest that although the park is funct as a subst pop sourc on a loc scal it pot to sustain reg or contin wood thrush pop is limit our find suggest that specy such as the wood thrush ar cap of mod level of surpl produc in high qual habit but that extend area of suit habit outsid protect area and oth publ land wil be requir to sustain contin bree pop,new,0.8253793225861354,0.782357234473737,0.7479768054343509,0.7204758905245708,0.6981166260568608,0.679662301631191,0.6642941943106887,0.651497371520396,0.6410232678557956,0.6329020484085521,0.6277594387967049
224,bird_neotropic,Understanding population change in migratory songbirds: Long-term and experimental studies of Neotropical migrants in breeding and wintering areas,"Effective conservation and management of migratory bird species requires an understanding of when and how their populations are limited and regulated. Since 1969, my colleagues and I have been studying migratory songbird populations in their breeding quarters at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire, USA, and since 1986, in their winter quarters in the Greater Antilles (Jamaica). Long-term data on the abundance and demography of these populations, coupled with experimental tests of mechanisms, indicate that processes operating in the breeding area (e.g. density-dependent fecundity, food limitation) are sufficient to limit and regulate the local abundance of these species. At the same time, limiting factors operating in the non-breeding season (e.g. climate-induced food limitation in winter quarters and especially mortality during migration) also have important impacts on migrant populations. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that limiting processes during the winter period can carry over into the breeding season and affect reproductive output. These findings clearly demonstrate that to understand changes in abundance of long-distance migrant species requires knowledge of events operating throughout the annual cycle, which presents a challenge to researchers, managers and others concerned with the welfare of these species. ¬© 2007 The Author.",10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00685.x,2-s2.0-36448986813,16,0.800972076,1,understand pop chang in migr songbird long term and expery study of neotrop migr in bree and wint area effect conserv and man of migr bird specy requir an understand of when and how their pop ar limit and reg sint my colleagu and i hav been study migr songbird pop in their bree quart at the hubbard brook expery forest in nor cent new hampshir us and sint in their wint quart in the gre antil jamaic long term dat on the abund and demograph of thes pop coupl with expery test of mech ind that process op in the bree are e g dens depend fecund food limit ar sufficy to limit and reg the loc abund of thes specy at the sam tim limit fact op in the non bree season e g clim induc food limit in wint quart and espec mort dur migr also hav import impact on migr pop furtherm rec study hav shown that limit process dur the wint period can carry ov into the bree season and affect reproduc output thes find clear demonst that to understand chang in abund of long dist migr specy requir knowledg of ev op throughout the an cyc which pres a challeng to research man and oth concern with the welf of thes specy,new,0.8504402907180283,0.8015067234953678,0.7606973629978131,0.7267999973975099,0.6981462819097625,0.6734184910637744,0.6516472841292842,0.6320973472740804,0.6141588961167748,0.5971973565949954,0.580314878781339

We show that most birds wintering on western Caribbean islands come from the northern portion of the species' North American breeding range, whereas those on more easterly islands are primarily from southern breeding areas. Although segregated by breeding latitude, birds within local wintering areas derive from a wide range of breeding longitudes, indicating considerable population mixing with respect to breeding longitude.

244,bird_neotropic,Diversity and abundance of landbirds in a northeastern industrial forest,"We studied abundance and diversity of landbirds in all successional stages of habitat in an industrial forest landscape in northern Maine. Of 9 broad habitat categories, clearcuts and mature hardwood forests had the lowest avian diversity, but these 2 habitats each contained many individual species that showed their maximum abundance in those habitats. Greatest avian diversity was found in 2 young forest types (6-20 yr following harvesting). Young, even-aged regeneration had the greatest abundance of individual birds per unit area, whereas mature hardwood had the lowest total abundance. Ten of 37 Neotropical migrant species had their highest abundance in the 2 youngest stages of forest (clearcuts and regeneration) whereas 13 of 37 species had their highest abundance in the 3 mature forest types. Short-distance migrants had highest abundances in early-successional habitats, and mature softwood stands contained the greatest number of resident species. The presence or absence at a point count station of 10 late-successional species (of 37) and 13 early-successional species (of 35) was related to the amount of similar habitat within 1 km of the point count center (homogeneous landscapes). Few species showed highest abundances in heterogeneous landscapes. Spatially consolidating harvesting might enhance both early- and late-successional species simultaneously. Based on species-habitat associations identified in this study, estimated population trends in a ] 270 km2 section of our study area did not correlate well with Breeding Bird Survey results for the state of Maine (1981-1992). This discrepancy probably resulted because few Breeding Bird Survey routes occur in the industrial forest of northern Maine, and because of different trends in habitat abundances inside and outside of he study area. This result indicates there might be important subregional differences in landbird population trends. Current timber harvest rates likely will result in a decrease in abundance of mature forest in Maine's industrial forest. Many early-successional species; including some of conservation concern, will benefit from this trend. Abundances of mature-forest species probably will decrease. The challenge industry and conservation biologists face is how to construct dynamic landscapes that balance the age-class distribution of the forest and maintain mature forest species.",10.2307/3802179,2-s2.0-0030758856,25,0.7959747890000001,1,divers and abund of landbird in a northeastern indust forest we study abund and divers of landbird in al success stag of habit in an indust forest landscap in northern main of broad habit categ clearcut and mat hardwood forest had the lowest av divers but thes habit each contain many individ specy that show their maxim abund in thos habit greatest av divers was found in young forest typ yr follow harvest young ev ag reg had the greatest abund of individ bird per unit are wherea mat hardwood had the lowest tot abund ten of neotrop migr specy had their highest abund in the youngest stag of forest clearcut and reg wherea of specy had their highest abund in the mat forest typ short dist migr had highest abund in ear success habit and mat softwood stand contain the greatest numb of resid specy the pres or abs at a point count stat of lat success specy of and ear success specy of was rel to the amount of simil habit within km of the point count cent homog landscap few specy show highest abund in heterog landscap spat consolid harvest might enh both ear and lat success specy simult bas on specy habit assocy ident in thi study estim pop trend in a km sect of our study are did not correl wel with bree bird survey result for the stat of main thi discrep prob result becaus few bree bird survey rout occ in the indust forest of northern main and becaus of diff trend in habit abund insid and outsid of he study are thi result ind ther might be import subreg diff in landbird pop trend cur timb harvest rat lik wil result in a decreas in abund of mat forest in main s indust forest many ear success specy includ som of conserv concern wil benefit from thi trend abund of mat forest specy prob wil decreas the challeng industry and conserv biolog fac is how to construct dynam landscap that bal the ag class distribut of the forest and maintain mat forest specy,new,0.8591219286395579,0.8027339970751222,0.7543732853672274,0.7132570892081078,0.6776047559692363,0.6458627413114777,0.6167549050713682,0.5891125632235308,0.5615891221249993,0.5321254192945266,0.49651477547894235
263,bird_neotropic,Density-dependent immigration promotes population stability in a long-distance migratory bird,"The spatial structure of populations determines the relative importance of reproduction, survival and movement on population dynamics. However, the mechanisms by which local individuals and immigrants interact and the subsequent effects of immigrants on productivity are poorly known. We developed an integrated population model (IPM) to study the extent and consequences of immigration on the dynamics of a neotropical migrant (American redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) over an 11-year period in Ontario, Canada. New immigrants represented the majority of the study population each year with higher immigration rates for males than females and for first-year breeders than breeders in their second year or older. Immigration was negatively density dependent, with immigrants replacing previously established breeders in a compensatory manner following their death or emigration. Because of the tradeoff between immigration and apparent survival, neither had a strong influence on population growth and reproductive output was most strongly correlated with a change in abundance between years. However, if immigration ceased, the study population would become locally extinct within 7¬†years and thus immigrants were essential for local population persistence. We found no evidence for reduced breeding success when immigrants represented a higher proportion of the study population. Our research highlights the importance of movement in the stability of open populations and the strong correlation between the fates of local breeders and the number of immigrants entering the population. We recommend the use of IPMs to address the spatial scale over which immigration occurs and how different scales influence its contribution to population dynamics. ¬© 2017, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.",10.1007/s10144-017-0582-5,2-s2.0-85020067100,11,0.793071706,1,dens depend immigr promot pop stabl in a long dist migr bird the spat structure of pop determin the rel import of reproduc surv and mov on pop dynam howev the mech by which loc individ and immigr interact and the subsequ effect of immigr on produc ar poor known we develop an integr pop model ipm to study the ext and consequ of immigr on the dynam of a neotrop migr am redstart setophag ruticill ov an year period in ontario canad new immigr repres the maj of the study pop each year with high immigr rat for mal than fem and for first year bree than bree in their second year or old immigr was neg dens depend with immigr replac prevy est bree in a compens man follow their dea or emigr becaus of the tradeoff between immigr and app surv neith had a strong influ on pop grow and reproduc output was most strongly correl with a chang in abund between year howev if immigr ceas the study pop would becom loc extinct within ¬†years and thu immigr wer ess for loc pop persist we found no evid for reduc bree success when immigr repres a high proport of the study pop our research highlight the import of mov in the stabl of op pop and the strong correl between the fat of loc bree and the numb of immigr ent the pop we recommend the us of ipm to address the spat scal ov which immigr occ and how diff scal influ it contribut to pop dynam,new,0.819459440859053,0.7938900375763153,0.7751748782193614,0.7612205436937375,0.7506880280554555,0.7427981006786195,0.7371337466003343,0.733549753788687,0.7322044572998989,0.7337114623605754,0.7397939126301039

283,bird_neotropic,Basin-wide effects of game harvest on vertebrate population densities in Amazonian forests: implications for animal-mediated seed dispersal,"Vertebrate responses to hunting are widely variable for target and nontarget species depending on the history of hunting and productivity of any given site and the life history traits of game species. We provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of changes in population density or other abundance estimates for 30 mid-sized to large mammal, bird and reptile species in 101 hunted and nonhunted, but otherwise undisturbed, Neotropical forest sites. The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative. Populations of all species combined declined across greater differences in hunting pressure by up to 74.8 percent from their numeric abundance in less intensively hunted sites, but harvest-sensitive species faired far worse. Of the 30 species examined, 22 declined significantly at high levels of hunting. Body size significantly affected the direction and magnitude of abundance changes, with large-bodied species declining faster in overhunted sites. Frugivorous species showed more marked declines in abundance in heavily hunted sites than seed predators and browsers, regardless of the effects of body size. The implications of hunting for seed dispersal are discussed in terms of community dynamics in semi-defaunated tropical forests. ¬© 2007 The Author(s).",10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00272.x,2-s2.0-34247329805,3,0.787377843,0,basin wid effect of gam harvest on vertebr pop dens in amazon forest imply for anim medy see dispers vertebr respons to hunt ar wid vary for target and nontarget specy depend on the hist of hunt and produc of any giv sit and the lif hist trait of gam specy we provid a comprehend met analys of chang in pop dens or oth abund estim for mid siz to larg mam bird and reptil specy in hunt and nonhunt but otherw undisturb neotrop forest sit the dat set was analys us both an unnest approach bas on pop dens estim and a nest approach in which pairw comparison of abund met wer restrict to geograph group of sit shar simil habit and soil condit thi result in geograph clust of sit within which pop abund estim wer comp across diff level of hunt press av nest chang in abund across increas gre level of hunt press rang from mod posit to high neg pop of al specy combin declin across gre diff in hunt press by up to perc from their num abund in less intend hunt sit but harvest sensit specy fair far wors of the specy examin declin sign at high level of hunt body siz sign affect the direct and magnitud of abund chang with larg body specy declin fast in overhunt sit frug specy show mor mark declin in abund in heavy hunt sit than see pred and brows regardless of the effect of body siz the imply of hunt for see dispers ar discuss in term of commun dynam in sem defaun trop forest,new,0.8225861648669192,0.7606653884065228,0.7089338183510627,0.6656246359739459,0.6285324134970559,0.5959383057090389,0.5665332013841122,0.5392245425590386,0.5129193547250117,0.4861711684808776,0.4564099685126474
294,bird_neotropic,A long-term study on the dynamics of guild structure among predatory vertebrates at a semi-arid Neotropical site,"Diets and populations of 10 species of predatory vertebrates (two foxes, four falconiforms, four owls) were monitored in semi-desert scrub at Auco, Chile. Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors",10.2307/3545099,2-s2.0-0027386301,86,0.779302536,1,a long term study on the dynam of guild structure among pred vertebr at a sem arid neotrop sit diet and pop of specy of pred vertebr two fox four falconiform four owl wer monit in sem desert scrub at auco chil pellet bird and fec fox collect month contain ident remain of smal mam bird reptil amphib larg insect oth arthropod and in som fox fec fruit for non mam prey season vary in avail appear to be mor pronount than long term vary avail of the eight specy of smal mam vary rel littl between pred bree and non bree season but declin by an ord of magnitud through the first yr of the study rath than respond to thes shift in food avail by diverg in diet dur lean tim and converg opportun dur fat tim pred respond in idiosyncr way pred of al specy tend to maintain specy spec mean in siz of prey tak regardless of shift in the rel avail of prey siz class two owl specy maintain strict mam diet throughout the declin in mam abund wherea two oth owl plu the two fox specy maintain a tight fee guild bas on arthropod as wel as mam and oth food group the four falconiform fail to maintain consist diet from season to season and consequ end up temp in un posit in diet hyperspac or els join temp on of the two consist guild the degr to which falconiform diet wer un in a giv season show no clear rel to food abund chang in us of habit did howev rel to chang in food abund non of the falconiform resid continu in the study are throughout the period from auth,new,0.8548727509288185,0.8087130177468642,0.7704495718384202,0.7385183951665492,0.7111576734201596,0.6870314320407099,0.6651315730200092,0.6446068960557032,0.624557724449507,0.6037063022406463,0.5795837267913926

316,bird_neotropic,Source-sink population dynamics may complicate the interpretation of long-term census data,"We examined the reproductive success and long-term population dynamics of Neotropical migrant birds in the fragmented landscapes of Illinois. Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self-sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source-sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism.

352,bird_neotropic,Changes in bird abundance in eastern North America: Urban sprawl and global footprint?,"The abundance of birds recorded in the North American Breeding Bird Survey decreased by up to 18 percent between 1966 and 2005. The abundance of US and Canadian resident species decreased by 30 percent, and that of migrants within the United States and Canada decreased by 19 percent. By contrast, Neotropical migrants increased by up to 20 percent. Land-cover changes in northern latitudes therefore seem more consequential for bird populations than those occurring in Neotropical habitats. Lower abundances were most marked for resident breeding birds that used open, edge, and wetland habitats, the environments most affected by human disturbances-particularly urban sprawl-in northern latitudes. The abundance of resident and migrant forest-dwelling birds increased (although trends va ried from species to species), with the increases seeming to follow the 20th-century expansion of forest area in northern latitudes, rather than the loss of Neotropical forests. The geographic footprint of changes in bird abundance linked to habitat changes in North America may thus be extending southward, with negative effects on birds that use open habitats and positive effects on forest birds. ¬© 2007 American Institute of Biological Sciences.",10.1641/B570410,2-s2.0-34247201031,9,0.770538466,1,chang in bird abund in eastern nor americ urb sprawl and glob footprint the abund of bird record in the nor am bree bird survey decreas by up to perc between and the abund of us and canad resid specy decreas by perc and that of migr within the unit stat and canad decreas by perc by contrast neotrop migr increas by up to perc land cov chang in northern latitud theref seem mor consequ for bird pop than thos occur in neotrop habit low abund wer most mark for resid bree bird that us op edg and wetland habit the environ most affect by hum disturb particul urb sprawl in northern latitud the abund of resid and migr forest dwel bird increas although trend va ried from specy to specy with the increas seem to follow the th century expand of forest are in northern latitud rath than the loss of neotrop forest the geograph footprint of chang in bird abund link to habit chang in nor americ may thu be extend southward with neg effect on bird that us op habit and posit effect on forest bird,new,0.8481794719765905,0.7790821613487705,0.7185587824769037,0.6665451480007745,0.6212713367407874,0.5810040688513037,0.5442470723597677,0.5096045744007798,0.47548837548405243,0.43953000307810497,0.3970517586127527
382,bird_neotropic,Seasonality in abundance and detection bias of birds in a tropical dry forest in north-eastern South America,"Seasonal fluctuations in bird abundance are expected in semi-arid environments, but estimates may be biased if detectability is not considered. In a tropical dry forest in north-eastern Brazil, we evaluated whether bird abundance is highly seasonal, and associated with time-specific variability in detectability. We mark-recaptured birds with mist nets over three field visits (3487 records from 75 species), and used closed-capture models to estimate detectability and abundance in birds divided into three groups (all, residents, insectivores). In the two dry periods, the best models resulted in capture estimates at least three times larger than recapture, and both estimates were twice that of when rains occurred on the day preceding sampling. Abundance varied between dry and wet periods from 4.0 (from 115 ¬± 34 to 479 ¬± 144) to 13 times (183 ¬± 8 to 2463 ¬± 351). Estimates were 1.5-3.2 times greater in the dry period when behavioural responses of birds were excluded from capture-recapture models. Meanwhile, in the wet period the relative abundance was between 33-76% smaller than best-fit models estimated. This study found variation in avian abundance greater than that observed in other Neotropical dry forests, and indicates that biases may be common when not including detectability.

401,bird_neotropic,Climate and food synchronize regional forest bird abundances,"Analysis of synchrony in population fluctuations can help to identify factors that regulate populations and the scales at which these factors exert their influence. Using 15 years of data on the abundances of songbirds at four replicate forest sites in New Hampshire, USA, we addressed two main questions: (1) Are forest bird populations synchronous at the scale measured (tens of kilometers), and if so, (2) what environmental factors are responsible for the synchrony? Nine of the 10 bird species we examined exhibited significant spatial synchrony across the four sites. Within nesting and foraging species groups, tree nesters and foliage gleaners exhibited the highest spatial synchrony. Long-distance (Neotropical) migrants exhibited higher spatial synchrony than did short-distance migrants or year-round residents. Synchrony within and among six species of long-distance, migratory, insectivorous birds was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in the abundance of lepidopteran larvae, a primary food type during the breeding season, which in turn have been shown to be influenced by El Ni√±o/La Ni√±a global climate patterns. Abundances of year-round resident species were related to another large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Winter weather can have both direct (e.g., via temperature-mediated mortality) and indirect (e.g., via winter food availability) effects on year-round resident species. We do not believe that predation on adults or nests accounted for the observed synchrony. Dispersal among regional populations in this system may have played a role but is likely a product of the influence of regionally synchronous caterpillar fluctuations on bird reproduction. Long-term regional population trends may have contributed to the observed synchrony for some species, but we do not consider these trends to be primary factors. Our findings of population synchrony support the importance of food and climate in influencing forest bird abundances and have broad implications for potential responses of bird and insect populations to climate change.",10.1890/02-0639,2-s2.0-1342288313,15,0.758908893,1,clim and food synchron reg forest bird abund analys of synchrony in pop fluctu can help to ident fact that reg pop and the scal at which thes fact exert their influ us year of dat on the abund of songbird at four reply forest sit in new hampshir us we address two main quest ar forest bird pop synchron at the scal meas ten of kilomet and if so what environ fact ar respons for the synchrony nin of the bird specy we examin exhibit sign spat synchrony across the four sit within nest and for specy group tre nest and foly gle exhibit the highest spat synchrony long dist neotrop migr exhibit high spat synchrony than did short dist migr or year round resid synchrony within and among six specy of long dist migr insect bird was correl with synchron fluctu in the abund of lepidopt larva a prim food typ dur the bree season which in turn hav been shown to be influ by el ni√±o la ni√±a glob clim pattern abund of year round resid specy wer rel to anoth larg scal clim phenomenon the nor atl oscil wint weath can hav both direct e g via temp medy mort and indirect e g via wint food avail effect on year round resid specy we do not believ that pred on adult or nest account for the observ synchrony dispers among reg pop in thi system may hav play a rol but is lik a produc of the influ of reg synchron caterpill fluctu on bird reproduc long term reg pop trend may hav contribut to the observ synchrony for som specy but we do not consid thes trend to be prim fact our find of pop synchrony support the import of food and clim in influ forest bird abund and hav broad imply for pot respons of bird and insect pop to clim chang,new,0.832225188103495,0.7828691395580147,0.7428560895564781,0.7100199360704873,0.6823376230444095,0.6583628155748283,0.6370573427907573,0.617605910921175,0.5992434851246788,0.5810123613250099,0.561267744740285
481,bird_neotropic,"Estimating breeding season abundance of golden-cheeked warblers in Texas, USA","Population abundance estimates using predictive models are important for describing habitat use and responses to population-level impacts, evaluating conservation status of a species, and for establishing monitoring programs. The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23 males/ha (95% CI = 0.197-0.252, n = 301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95% CI: 223,927-302,620). Our results provide the first abundance estimate using habitat and count data from a sampling design focused on range-wide inference. Managers can use the resulting model as a tool to support conservation planning and guide recovery efforts. ¬© 2012 The Wildlife Society.",10.1002/jwmg.352,2-s2.0-84864629519,24,0.749111675,0,estim bree season abund of gold cheek warbl in texa us pop abund estim us predict model ar import for describ habit us and respons to pop level impact evalu conserv stat of a specy and for est monit program the gold cheek warbl setophag chrysoparia is a neotrop migr bird that was list as fed endang in becaus of threats rel to loss and frag of it woodland habit sint list abund estim for the specy hav main rely on loc pop study on publ land and qualit bas method our goal was to estim bree pop siz of mal warbl us a predict model bas on met for patch of woodland habit throughout the specy bree rang we first conduc occup survey to determin rang wid distribut we then conduc standard point count survey on a subset of the init sampl loc to estim dens of mal mean observ patch spec dens was mal ha ci n we model the rel between patch spec dens of mal and woodland patch charact siz and landscap composit and predict patch occup the prob of patch occup der from a model that us patch siz and landscap composit as predict vary whil address effect of spat rel best predict patch spec dens we predict patch spec dens as a funct of occup prob and estim abund of mal warbl across woodland patch account for mil ha of pot warbl habit us a mont carlo sim our approach yield a rang wid mal warbl pop estim of ci our result provid the first abund estim us habit and count dat from a sampl design focus on rang wid inf man can us the result model as a tool to support conserv plan and guid recovery effort,new,0.7917272125196559,0.7195490525343661,0.6600438670903661,0.6116774307987455,0.5718736782651337,0.5385480840001342,0.5101888296293268,0.4857141971356085,0.4643611150775222,0.4455806087922124,0.42907338301885134
721,bird_neotropic,Population abundance and biomass of large-bodied birds in Amazonian flooded and unflooded forests,"Little is known about the contribution of different forest types to the beta-diversity, abundance and biomass of the avifauna in lowland Amazonia. This paper presents data on the large-bodied bird assemblages of adjacent upland (terra firme) and seasonally flooded (v√°rzea and igap√≥) forests in the lower Rio Pur√∫s region of central-western Brazilian Amazonia. We focus our analysis on 23 large-bodied canopy and terrestrial bird species from 10 families, on the basis of 2,044 bird sightings obtained during line-transect censuses conducted over a two-year period. Large toucans comprised the most numerically abundant large birds in terra firme and iga√≥ forests, whereas macaws were the most abundant in nutrient-rich v√°rzea forests that were seasonally inundated by white-water. The aggregate population density of all bird species in terra firme forest was slightly higher than that in v√°rzea forest. Igap√≥ forest, which was seasonally inundated by black-water, sustained the lowest population densities. Terra firme and v√°rzea forests differed considerably in species composition and abundance whereas igap√≥ forest shared many species with both terra firme and v√©rzea. Our results suggest that Amazonian floodplain forests play a major role in the persistence and community dynamics of the large-bodied forest birds. ¬© Birdlife International 2008.",10.1017/S0959270908000130,2-s2.0-44249117596,7,0.6986349390000001,1,pop abund and biomass of larg body bird in amazon flood and unflood forest littl is known about the contribut of diff forest typ to the bet divers abund and biomass of the avifaun in lowland amazon thi pap pres dat on the larg body bird assembl of adjac upland terr firm and season flood v√°rzea and igap√≥ forest in the low rio pur√∫s reg of cent western brazil amazon we foc our analys on larg body canop and terrest bird specy from famy on the bas of bird sight obtain dur lin transect census conduc ov a two year period larg touc compr the most num abund larg bird in terr firm and iga√≥ forest wherea macaw wer the most abund in nutry rich v√°rzea forest that wer season inund by whit wat the aggreg pop dens of al bird specy in terr firm forest was slight high than that in v√°rzea forest igap√≥ forest which was season inund by black wat sustain the lowest pop dens terr firm and v√°rzea forest diff consid in specy composit and abund wherea igap√≥ forest shar many specy with both terr firm and v√©rzea our result suggest that amazon floodplain forest play a maj rol in the persist and commun dynam of the larg body forest bird,new,0.7442662152133097,0.6532189831429493,0.5833309818117821,0.5297592487578553,0.48760582857360085,0.45350614017941837,0.4252453396544819,0.40132949868203815,0.3806757834969249,0.36241335478884534,0.34555854650177253
741,bird_neotropic,Migrants in Neotropical bird communities: An assessment of the breeding currency hypothesis,"1. Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4. Other factors may interact with the availability of food for nestlings to limit the populations of resident birds below carrying capacities set by non-breeding season arthropod abundance, thereby creating a set of resources available to non-breeding migrants. ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00928.x,2-s2.0-16244419776,13,0.696474003,0,migr in neotrop bird commun an assess of the bree cur hypothes expl for the integr of migr and non migr resid bird in the neotrop hav been comply by the paradox that arthropod abund ar low when bird abund reach their an peak the bree cur hypothes off an expl for thi paradox by post that resid bird ar limit in the bree season by the avail of larg arthropod suit for reproduc wherea the carry capac of al bird in the non bree season is limit by the avail of arthropod suit for self maint of adult field dat from jamaic support thi hypothes among sit the ratio of migr to resid bird abund was correl neg with the ratio of larg arthropod biomass in the bree season to tot arthropod biomass in the non bree season howev aft control for effect of arthropod season migr to resid bird abund ratio wer high in hum disturb than undisturb sit oth fact may interact with the avail of food for nestl to limit the pop of resid bird below carry capac set by non bree season arthropod abund thereby cre a set of resourc avail to non bree migr,new,0.7631186861935123,0.6801808789399362,0.613878889667283,0.5616538162150927,0.5199865868504465,0.4861862111115981,0.4584073654786499,0.4354430251561193,0.4165983693434908,0.4016882559396306,0.39132914193520024
761,bird_neotropic,Seasonal abundance of migrant birds and food resources in panamanian mangrove forests,"We studied temporal variation in abundance of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants, particularly the Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea), and American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) in two black mangrove sites of central Panama from September 1993 through May 1995. The two sites, on the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts, differ importantly in annual rainfall, tide amplitude, and seasonal invertebrate abundance. Most migrant species varied temporally in abundance with the opposite pattern at each site, suggesting mid-winter movements correlated with abundance of food resources. Because of their wide geographic distribution and their particular response to hydrographic factors, mangroves are likely to have a temporally complementary role in sustaining migrant populations throughout the Neptropics. However, variations in migrant numbers reported in other Neotropical habitats could also reflect large-scale movements by migrants.

We studied a population of Tropical Kingbirds (Tyrannus melancholicus), a primarily insectivorous species, in eastern Bolivia to examine relationships between rainfall, food availability, and foraging strategies throughout the year. Our study site in the southern Amazon Basin was characterized by strong seasonal variation in the abundance of the kingbird's main insect prey (coleopterans and hymenopterans), with reduced abundance during the nonbreeding season which largely overlaps the dry season. Overall, mean search times for insect prey by Tropical Kingbirds during the breeding (96.9 ¬± 85.6 [SD] sec) and nonbreeding (83.7 ¬± 91.2 sec) seasons did not differ (P= 0.23). However, during the nonbreeding season, kingbird search times were negatively, but nonsignificantly, correlated with coleopteran abundance (r2= 0.43, P= 0.16) and significantly and negatively correlated with hymenopteran abundance (r2= 0.72, P= 0.03). Although insect abundance differed seasonally, kingbird search times did not, perhaps because kingbirds forage on a greater variety of insects during the nonbreeding season or, during the breeding season, kingbird search times may be influenced by the need to monitor and defend nests as well as constraints on the types of prey that can be fed to nestlings. However, the reduced abundance of their primary insect prey and negative relationships between the abundance of those prey and search times during the dry, nonbreeding season suggest that Tropical Kingbirds in southern Amazonia may be food limited, potentially explaining why some migrate and spend that season elsewhere. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

88,bird_neotropic,Reduced Density and Nest Survival of Ground-Nesting Songbirds Relative to Earthworm Invasions in Northern Hardwood Forests,"European earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) are spreading into previously earthworm-free forests in the United States and Canada and causing substantial changes, including homogenization of soil structure, removal of the litter layer, and reduction in arthropod abundance and species richness of understory plants. Whether these changes affect songbirds that nest and forage on the forest floor is unknown. In stands with and without earthworms in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Wisconsin (U.S.A.), we surveyed for, monitored nests of, and measured attributes of habitat of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Hermit Thrushes (Catharus guttatus), both ground-dwelling songbirds, and we sampled earthworms at survey points and nests. Bird surveys indicated significantly lower densities of Ovenbirds and Hermit Thrushes in relation to Lumbricus invasions at survey point and stand extents (3.1 and 15-20 ha, respectively). Modeling of Ovenbird nest survival (i.e., the probability that nestlings successfully fledge) indicated that lower survival probabilities were associated with increased sedge cover and decreased litter depth, factors that are related to Lumbricus invasions, possibly due to reduced nest concealment or arthropod abundance. Our findings provide compelling evidence that earthworm invasions may be associated with local declines of forest songbird populations. ¬© 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.",10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01719.x,2-s2.0-80052574165,8,0.6748325059999999,0,reduc dens and nest surv of ground nest songbird rel to earthworm invas in northern hardwood forest europ earthworm lumbric spp ar spreading into prevy earthworm fre forest in the unit stat and canad and caus subst chang includ homog of soil structure remov of the lit lay and reduc in arthropod abund and specy rich of underst plant wheth thes chang affect songbird that nest and for on the forest flo is unknown in stand with and without earthworm in the chequamegon nicolet nat forest wisconsin u s a we survey for monit nest of and meas attribut of habit of ovenbird seiur aurocapill and hermit thrushes cathar guttat both ground dwel songbird and we sampl earthworm at survey point and nest bird survey ind sign low dens of ovenbird and hermit thrushes in rel to lumbric invas at survey point and stand ext and ha respect model of ovenbird nest surv i e the prob that nestl success fledg ind that low surv prob wer assocy with increas sedg cov and decreas lit dep fact that ar rel to lumbric invas poss due to reduc nest cont or arthropod abund our find provid compel evid that earthworm invas may be assocy with loc declin of forest songbird pop,new,0.6761888023594823,0.6172045211089965,0.5751599603731096,0.5445808969836784,0.5219190921046946,0.505117414994828,0.4930510183505354,0.48524820997228113,0.4818676382227821,0.4840046995214855,0.49480838252857995

Abundance, density and territory size were also characterized for several understorey insectivores.

1101,bird_neotropic,"Effects of forest heterogeneity on occurrence and abundance of the scale-backed antbird, Hylophylax poecilinotus (Aves: Thamnophilidae), in the Amazon forest","Recently, a significant number of studies on neotropical forest bird communities have focused on factors influencing their richness, abundance, and habitat selection. However, few of them have considered populations or individual species, and how habitat structure affects their distribution and abundance. In this study, we investigated how the combined effects of some forest structure components affect the occurrence and abundance of a resident bird species, the scale-backed antbird Hylophylax poecilinotus (Cabanis, 1847). We tested the null hypothesis of no difference between the variation in forest structure components at locations where birds occurred and at locations where they did not. In a pristine Terra Firme forest at the Ducke Reserve, Manaus, we recorded bird occurrence and abundance using mist nets in 56 transects (1 km long each) within a 9 √ó 9 km trail grid covering 6400 ha. Also in the same 56 transects, we set 50 √ó 50 m plots and recorded the following seven components of forest structure and landscape: 1) canopy opening, 2) leaf litter, 3) tree abundance, 4) logs, 5) snags, 6) streams, and 7) elevation. We evaluated their effects on avian occurrence and abundance by using models of Multiple Logistic Regression (for bird occurrence) and Multiple Linear Regression (for bird abundance). The results suggested that H. poecilinotus occurred significantly more often in lowland areas, in areas located farther away from streams, and in areas bearing thicker leaf litter. Hylophylax poecilinotus was also more abundant in lowland areas and in areas located further away from streams. Overall, the results indicated that environmental heterogeneity produced by variation in forest structure components affects habitat use by this bird species in the Amazon forest.",,2-s2.0-59349111661,2,0.6404515829999999,0,effect of forest heterog on occur and abund of the scal back antbird hylophylax poecilinot av thamnophilida in the amazon forest rec a sign numb of study on neotrop forest bird commun hav focus on fact influ their rich abund and habit select howev few of them hav consid pop or individ specy and how habit structure affect their distribut and abund in thi study we investig how the combin effect of som forest structure compon affect the occur and abund of a resid bird specy the scal back antbird hylophylax poecilinot cab we test the nul hypothes of no diff between the vary in forest structure compon at loc wher bird occur and at loc wher they did not in a pristin terr firm forest at the duck reserv mana we record bird occur and abund us mist net in transect km long each within a √ó km trail grid cov ha also in the sam transect we set √ó m plot and record the follow sev compon of forest structure and landscap canop op leaf lit tre abund log snag streams and elev we evalu their effect on av occur and abund by us model of multipl log regress for bird occur and multipl linear regress for bird abund the result suggest that h poecilinot occur sign mor oft in lowland area in area loc farth away from streams and in area bear thick leaf lit hylophylax poecilinot was also mor abund in lowland area and in area loc furth away from streams overal the result ind that environ heterog produc by vary in forest structure compon affect habit us by thi bird specy in the amazon forest,new,0.7069807173955701,0.5868452298916097,0.49623039676223374,0.4290232430511741,0.37800166744959035,0.3381038179031163,0.30601657633406537,0.27953303043334815,0.2570799791126768,0.23739398872741893,0.219074771758883
127,bird_neotropic,Population size and behavior pattern of grus canadensis (Aves: Gruidae) in two localities of Cuba [Tama√±o poblacional y patr√≥n de conducta de Grus canadensis (Aves: Gruidae) en dos localidades de Cuba],"The availability of information on species abundance in the Neotropic is insufficient, and this prevents the execution of precise analysis and the definition of adequate conservation strategies for endemic and threatened species. This study aimed to analyze the population size of the endemic and threatened subspecies Grus canadensis nesiotes. For this, a simultaneous census was undertaken in 24 count stations in Isla de la Juventud (IJ) and 32 stations in Ciego de √Åvila (CA), Cuba, during two consecutive days between 2008 and 2010. Abundance and behavior pattern (instantaneous method) were analyzed by habitat type, to help understand how cranes modify their behavioral pattern when the natural habitat is changed. Flocks in IJ had three individuals, and between 1.9 ¬± 1.5 and 2.8 ¬± 1.5 in CA. Population size in IJ was 164 individuals, and in CA of 137, 141 and 168 individuals for the 2008-2010 period, respectively. The counting efficacy was high (IJ: 91 %; CA: 81-87 %) and the numerical concordance was intermediate (IJ: 45.4 %; CA: 72 %). When comparing the habitat type, the abundance was higher in natural savannahs (83), followed by coastal flats (59), pines (23) and cattle pastures (7) in IJ; while in CA, marsh grasslands hosted the greatest abundance for the three years period (130; 120; 112), followed by grassland with palms (2; 17; 51) and cattle pastures (5; 4; 5). The cranes were fed more in cattle pas¬≠tures and were more alert in natural savannas and marsh grasslands. The frequency of feeding and alert behaviors was different from the natural savannah/coastal flats and natural savannah/cattle pastures combinations in IJ. For CA, differences were found between marsh grasslands and marsh grasslands with palms.

138,bird_neotropic,Endemism and local rarity in birds of neotropical montane rainforest,"Species' rarity is expressed and measured at a variety of spatial scales, and rarity at different scales could be correlated. Considerable empirical evidence has supported a positive correlation between spatial distribution and local numerical abundance of species, which could create a syndrome of rarity for species limited in geographic distribution and occurring at low densities even in their primary habitats. We used auditory-count data and range information for birds in the Tilar√°n mountains of Costa Rica to examine the abundance-distribution relationship in cloud forest species and to determine if endemic species (limited to Costa Rican-Panamanian highlands or Central America) are locally rare or restricted in ecological distribution. We found a positive correlation between abundance and distribution at the smallest spatial scale: species occupying few sites in the study area had low abundances where they occur. At larger scales, geographical distribution measured categorically was correlated with local ecological amplitude (zones occupied). Local abundance, however, was not correlated across all species with estimates of range size (km2), although most endemics exhibited below-median abundance. Within families with endemics and cosmopolitan species, 72% of narrow endemics were among the rarest species. For most narrow endemics, we rejected the possibility that they are sufficiently specialized within their habitats to reach relatively high densities. A conclusive test of the abundance-distribution relationship at large spatial scales and evaluation of global population size for endemics will require a comprehensive analysis using abundance data from throughout species' ranges. Such analyses for tropical species will be a long time coming, but it is meanwhile prudent to recognize that many endemics are threatened at several spatial scales, including the risks of small local populations. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

147,bird_neotropic,"Territory switching behavior in a sedentary tropical passerine, the dusky antbird (Cercomacra tyrannina)","Demographic data from an 8-year study of a marked population showed that switching territories and mates is common in both genders of dusky antbirds (Cercomacra tyrannina), a sedentary neotropical passerine with year-round territories and pairbonds. We conducted 22 experimental removals and followed six natural disappearances to examine territory switching. Antbirds quickly abandoned territories and mates to move to openings created by experimental removals. Pairing with the resident on a new territory was rapid. Unmated birds attracted new mates by singing a gender-specific song that differed from songs given by mated birds. There were no gender differences in replacement time or rate. Some vacancies, experimental and natural, were not filled, suggesting that floaters were rare. Territory and mate switching were not related to immediate enhancement of reproductive success because the probability of reproducing successfully was equally poor on all territories. Territory switching may be an overlooked but common tropical form of territoriality that increases individual survivorship during periods of low food abundance (dry season). We suggest that switching is favored when low annual reproductive success enhances selection for a long lifespan as the primary means to increase reproductive success.",10.1093/beheco/11.6.648,2-s2.0-0034580859,20,0.601183632,1,territ switch behavy in a sed trop passerin the dusky antbird cercomacr tyrannin demograph dat from an year study of a mark pop show that switch territ and mat is common in both gend of dusky antbird cercomacr tyrannin a sed neotrop passerin with year round territ and pairbond we conduc expery remov and follow six nat disappear to examin territ switch antbird quick abandon territ and mat to mov to op cre by expery remov pair with the resid on a new territ was rapid unm bird attract new mat by sing a gend spec song that diff from song giv by mat bird ther wer no gend diff in replac tim or rat som vac expery and nat wer not fil suggest that flo wer rar territ and mat switch wer not rel to immedy enh of reproduc success becaus the prob of reproduc success was eq poor on al territ territ switch may be an overlook but common trop form of territ that increas individ surv dur period of low food abund dry season we suggest that switch is fav when low an reproduc success enh select for a long lifesp as the prim mean to increas reproduc success,new,0.6239341596256756,0.582855569287804,0.5553138825730004,0.5368588040310782,0.5249539855176614,0.5183080171713812,0.5164452925823051,0.5195880799264545,0.5288702678946515,0.5470906755155057,0.5809317605385461
154,bird_neotropic,"Efficiency, bias, and consistency of visual and aural surveys of curassows (Cracidae) in tropical forests","Curassows are among the most threatened Neotropical birds, so reliable methods for estimating their abundance are needed to discern distribution patterns and manage populations. Based on the assumptions that the distance to booming curassows cannot be determined reliably and that curassow calling is unpredictable, it has been suggested that curassow abundance should be estimated only through surveys using visual cues. Based on line-transect surveys of Great Curassows (Crax rubra) conducted in a lowland tropical forest in Costa Rica, we show that distance to booming curassows can be measured accurately in the field. We also show that line-transect aural surveys sample curassows over large areas across all forest vertical strata and provide precise estimates of their abundance, but are biased towards detecting males. In contrast, line-transect visual surveys sample only small areas of forest understory and are imprecise, but appear not to be biased towards any sex or age class.

165,bird_neotropic,Bird abundance and diversity across a hardwood gradient within early seral plantation forest,"The extensive removal of competing broadleaved shrubs in forest plantations typically results in structural and compositional simplification of early seral habitat. However, information on the tradeoffs between such intensive forestry practices and biodiversity is scant. Here we assess the magnitude and direction of potential impacts of intensive forest management on populations of early seral-associated breeding birds. Observed population declines of several Neotropical migrant bird species are hypothesized to be linked to the loss of early seral habitat on the breeding grounds. We investigated the association between broadleaved hardwood cover and avian abundance and diversity in intensively managed early seral Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands of the Pacific Northwest. Bird species richness decreased across an elevational gradient, but did not vary as a function of either local vegetation composition or structure. In contrast, bird abundance was strongly associated with hardwood cover at local and landscape scales, especially for foliage-gleaning species. We found strong support for the existence of a threshold in relative bird abundance as a function of hardwood at the stand scale; abundance doubled with an increase from 1% to ‚àº6% hardwood and then reached a plateau. Though abundance of leaf-gleaners increased even more strongly across a gradient in hardwood cover, evidence for a distinct threshold was less clear. We conclude that when early seral hardwood forest is scarce, even small increases in hardwood may provide substantial conservation benefits. However, for some species (i.e., foliage gleaners), there may be more direct trade-offs in abundance and juvenile recruitment with hardwood management intensity. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.foreco.2011.01.018,2-s2.0-79952040223,5,0.567913887,0,bird abund and divers across a hardwood grady within ear ser plant forest the extend remov of compet broadleav shrubs in forest plant typ result in structural and composit simpl of ear ser habit howev inform on the tradeoff between such intend forestry pract and biodivers is scant her we assess the magnitud and direct of pot impact of intend forest man on pop of ear ser assocy bree bird observ pop declin of sev neotrop migr bird specy ar hypothes to be link to the loss of ear ser habit on the bree ground we investig the assocy between broadleav hardwood cov and av abund and divers in intend man ear ser dougla fir pseudotsug menziesi stand of the pac northwest bird specy rich decreas across an elev grady but did not vary as a funct of eith loc veget composit or structure in contrast bird abund was strongly assocy with hardwood cov at loc and landscap scal espec for foly gle specy we found strong support for the ex of a threshold in rel bird abund as a funct of hardwood at the stand scal abund doubl with an increas from to ‚àº hardwood and then reach a plateau though abund of leaf gle increas ev mor strongly across a grady in hardwood cov evid for a distinct threshold was less clear we conclud that when ear ser hardwood forest is scarc ev smal increas in hardwood may provid subst conserv benefit howev for som specy i e foly gle ther may be mor direct trad off in abund and juvenil recruit with hardwood man intens,new,0.6065016440769884,0.5457283882839525,0.5051711610402995,0.4775016381167085,0.45844462813025433,0.44570459743491603,0.4381508824485081,0.43546948736821817,0.4381702637016722,0.44809837669974534,0.47009269422263017
118,bird_oceanic,Long-term trends in abundance of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) assessed by non-lethal capture rates in a coastal fishery,"Sea turtle populations underwent severe decline in historical times, mainly through harvesting eggs and adults on nesting beaches. With the reduction of this threat in many areas, coupled with other conservation actions, some populations have demonstrated encouraging recovery, although remaining below their previous levels and undergone additional modern threats such as incidental capture in fisheries and pollution. Trends in sea turtle populations have usually been assessed through monitoring of females or nests on nesting beaches. Here we present data from a 22-year monitoring period for a juvenile green sea turtle Chelonia mydas mixed-stock in southeastern Brazil that were incidentally captured in passive non-lethal pound nets. A total of 3639 green turtles were captured in 5323 fishing days.pound‚àí1 with mortality rate of 2%. Captures occurred in all months, but bycatch rates, excluding recapture events, were higher in September and October, probably due to the recruitment of turtles migrating from southern areas, as well as recruits from the oceanic zone. Capture rates increased by 9.2% per year in the period from 1995 to 2016, in line with increasing source populations, particularly the main source contributor at Ascension Island, but also Trindade Island (Brazil) and Aves Island (Venezuela). Mean Curved Carapace Length of green turtles was higher during austral summer/early autumn and decreased markedly in May, probably due to the small-sized individuals that recruited to the study site. We show that the incidental capture of sea turtles in non-lethal fisheries, such as Brazilian pound nets, could also provide data on trends of populations nesting in distant places, and can contribute to the assessment of population status of sea turtles within Regional Management Units throughout the Atlantic Ocean. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.008,2-s2.0-85018655985,14,0.9209295690000001,1,long term trend in abund of green sea turtl chelon myda assess by non leth capt rat in a coast fishery sea turtl pop underw sev declin in hist tim main through harvest eg and adult on nest beach with the reduc of thi threat in many area coupl with oth conserv act som pop hav demonst enco recovery although remain below their prevy level and undergon addit modern threats such as incid capt in fishery and pollut trend in sea turtl pop hav us been assess through monit of fem or nest on nest beach her we pres dat from a year monit period for a juvenil green sea turtl chelon myda mix stock in southeastern brazil that wer incid capt in pass non leth pound net a tot of green turtl wer capt in fish day pound‚àí with mort rat of capt occur in al month but bycatch rat exclud recapt ev wer high in septemb and octob prob due to the recruit of turtl migr from southern area as wel as recruit from the oc zon capt rat increas by per year in the period from to in lin with increas sourc pop particul the main sourc contribut at ascend island but also trindad island brazil and av island venezuel mean curv carapac leng of green turtl was high dur aust sum ear autumn and decreas mark in may prob due to the smal siz individ that recruit to the study sit we show that the incid capt of sea turtl in non leth fishery such as brazil pound net could also provid dat on trend of pop nest in dist plac and can contribut to the assess of pop stat of sea turtl within reg man unit throughout the atl oc,new,0.9323516437112704,0.9195527852390168,0.9092593783182955,0.900609693967846,0.8929688352186244,0.8858912574299115,0.8790201927703303,0.8719988377684618,0.8643611712160507,0.8553059526563015,0.8431332295612262
218,bird_oceanic,"Population status, breeding and ecology of Chatham Island tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae chathamensis)","Status, breeding, and foraging of Chatham Island tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae chathamensis) were studied on Rangatira Island, Chatham Islands between January 1995 and May 1999, with short visits made to adjacent Pitt Island throughout this period. The total population was estimated at ‚âà260 adults. Most birds were resident on Rangatira Island in spring, summer and autumn but moved to Pitt Island during the winter. In spring birds commuted between the two islands but became resident on Rangatira when breeding commenced. Radio transmitters were attached to adult tui to monitor breeding. No radio-tagged female bred (n = 13) but at least two of three radio-tagged males raised young. Adult tui were intolerant of disturbance during nesting so estimation of productivity was made by mapping the number of fledgling groups. Flax (Phormium tenax) nectar appeared to be the most important food for breeding tui and birds travelled long distances to visit flowering plants. Fruits of ngaio (Myoporum laetum), matipo (Myrsine chathamica), karamu (Coprosma chathamica), mahoe (Melicytus chathamicus) and muehlenbeckia (Muehlenbeekia australis) were also important foods. Invertebrates were most important when females were feeding their young. The amount of breeding that occurred each season was directly related to the abundance of flax flowers in spring, and in good flax flowering years tui were able to rear two broods. In poor flax flowering years many birds did not breed. Control of feral cats on Pitt Island would most likely result in a significant increase in this breeding population; however planting of flax adjacent to the the forest areas on Chatham Island along with predator control may be necessary before tui can re-establish there. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc. 2004.",,2-s2.0-11344252452,42,0.865944672,1,pop stat bree and ecolog of chatham island tui prosthemader novaeseelandia chathamens stat bree and for of chatham island tui prosthemader novaeseelandia chathamens wer study on rangatir island chatham island between janu and may with short visit mad to adjac pit island throughout thi period the tot pop was estim at ‚âà adult most bird wer resid on rangatir island in spring sum and autumn but mov to pit island dur the wint in spring bird commut between the two island but becam resid on rangatir when bree com radio transmit wer attach to adult tui to monit bree no radio tag fem bred n but at least two of three radio tag mal rais young adult tui wer intol of disturb dur nest so estim of produc was mad by map the numb of fledgl group flax phorm tenax nect appear to be the most import food for bree tui and bird travel long dist to visit flow plant fruit of ngaio myopor laet matipo myrsin chathamic karamu coprosm chathamic maho melicyt chathamic and muehlenbeck muehlenbeek aust wer also import food invertebr wer most import when fem wer fee their young the amount of bree that occur each season was direct rel to the abund of flax flow in spring and in good flax flow year tui wer abl to rear two brood in poor flax flow year many bird did not bree control of fer cat on pit island would most lik result in a sign increas in thi bree pop howev plant of flax adjac to the the forest area on chatham island along with pred control may be necess bef tui can re est ther,new,0.8484813771788113,0.7962026022560679,0.7530489459416935,0.718218049917318,0.6898646411931466,0.6664780539742095,0.6470167257971392,0.6308321424414478,0.6176351313137196,0.6075885948995119,0.6017528786995144

This study includes new data on the biological diversity and abundance of the region and research and management recommendations. We conducted surveys and over 300 research SCUBA dives among the remote Phoenix Islands: Nikumaroro (Gardner), McKean, Manra (Sydney), Kanton (Aba-Riringa), Enderbury, Orona (Hull) and Rawaki (Phoenix), only excluding Birnie Island due to time limitations. Corals, benthic and mobile invertebrates, fishes, algae, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals were surveyed at each site. Deep-sea life was sampled during seven deployments of an autonomous digital video camera system to 1,000 m depth at Kanton, Manra, and Orona. Coral reef and fish communities were surveyed using rapid assessment methods, small benthic fishes were collected using rotenone as a stunning agent, marine algae were collected by hand primarily during SCUBA dives, and a deepdrop collecting net was deployed to sample deep-sea animals. The reefs show evidence of the extreme isolation of these islands, pounded on three sides by the large ocean swells of the Pacific with only a narrow protected side to the west providing protection for anchorage. Coral species diversity of the islands was moderately high. While lacking in some corals dominant in other major reef areas, the reefs have interesting species assemblages, with prolific growth of some species normally subdominant in other reef areas. The reefs were in an excellent state of health, at the time of these surveys free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific recently and with no evidence of any coral diseases. Our data include new distribution records for species of algae, coral and fishes. Fish communities were abundant and diverse and included pelagic fishes such as tuna and oceanic mackerels. Significant populations of grey reef, whitetip reef, and blacktip reef sharks were also observed indicating a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Reef macropredators (trevally, Napoleon wrasse) were also abundant. The deep-sea camera recorded images of deep-water sharks including six-gilled and Pacific sleeper sharks. Marine mammal sightings include bottlenose dolphins, Pacific spinner dolphins, beaked whales (Mesoplodon spp.), and unidentified whales. Sea birds observed on Rawaki, McKean, Enderbury, and Orona Islands included tens of thousands of nesting spectacled terns (grey-backed), sooty terns, white fairy-terns, brown noddies, blue-grey noddies, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-footed boobies, red-tailed tropic birds, great frigate birds and lesser frigate birds.

The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding population trends were stable.

57,bird_oceanic,Using large scale surveys to investigate seasonal variations in seabird distribution and abundance. Part II: The Bay of Biscay and the English Channel,"Seabird distributions and the associated seasonal variations remain challenging to investigate, especially in oceanic areas. Recent advances in telemetry have provided considerable information on seabird ecology, but still exclude small species, non-breeding birds and individuals from inaccessible colonies from any scientific survey. To overcome this issue and investigate seabird distribution and abundance in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA), large-scale aerial surveys were conducted in winter 2011-12 and summer 2012 over a 375,000¬†km2 area encompassing the English Channel (EC) and the Bay of Biscay (BoB). Seabird sightings, from 15 taxonomic groups, added up to 17,506 and 8263 sightings in winter and summer respectively, along 66,307¬†km. Using geostatistical methods, density maps were provided for both seasons. Abundance was estimated by strip transect sampling. Most taxa showed marked seasonal variations in their density and distribution. The highest densities were recorded during winter for most groups except shearwaters, storm-petrels, terns and large-sized gulls. Subsequently, the abundance in winter nearly reached one million individuals and was 2.5 times larger than in summer. The continental shelf and the slope in the BoB and the EC were identified as key areas for seabird conservation, especially during winter, as birds from northern Europe migrate southward after breeding. This large-scale study provided a synoptic view of the seabird community in the ENA, over two contrasting seasons. Our results highlight that oceanic areas harbour an abundant avifauna. Since most of the existing marine protected areas are restricted to the coastal fringe, the importance of oceanic areas in winter should be considered in future conservation plans. Our work will provide a baseline for the monitoring of seabird distribution at sea, and could inform the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.dsr2.2016.11.012,2-s2.0-85007441209,18,0.8268861120000001,0,us larg scal survey to investig season vary in seabird distribut and abund part ii the bay of biscay and the engl channel seabird distribut and the assocy season vary remain challeng to investig espec in oc area rec adv in telemetry hav provid consid inform on seabird ecolog but stil exclud smal specy non bree bird and individ from inaccess colony from any sci survey to overcom thi issu and investig seabird distribut and abund in the eastern nor atl en larg scal aer survey wer conduc in wint and sum ov a ¬†km are encompass the engl channel ec and the bay of biscay bob seabird sight from taxonom group ad up to and sight in wint and sum respect along ¬†km us geost method dens map wer provid for both season abund was estim by strip transect sampl most tax show mark season vary in their dens and distribut the highest dens wer record dur wint for most group exceiv shearw storm petrel tern and larg siz gul subsequ the abund in wint near reach on mil individ and was tim larg than in sum the contin shelf and the slop in the bob and the ec wer ident as key area for seabird conserv espec dur wint as bird from northern europ migr southward aft bree thi larg scal study provid a synopt view of the seabird commun in the en ov two contrast season our result highlight that oc area harbo an abund avifaun sint most of the ex marin protect area ar restrict to the coast fring the import of oc area in wint should be consid in fut conserv plan our work wil provid a baselin for the monit of seabird distribut at sea and could inform the eu marin strategy framework direct,new,0.8628816255463051,0.78744938587813,0.7194160050260167,0.6609817514989431,0.6108332941067844,0.5671641364186467,0.5283486077522994,0.49296367564319715,0.45961882990118724,0.42658805607719025,0.39098995572184675

86,bird_oceanic,Assessing the impacts of fishing and habitat loss on the Lord Howe Island population of flesh-footed shearwaters,"The flesh-footed shearwater Puffinus carneipes is a medium-sized seabird with a single eastern Australian population breeding on Lord Howe Island. Other breeding populations exist in New Zealand, south-western Western Australia and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. Tagging and banding studies indicate that breeding birds of the Lord Howe Island population inhabit waters mainly to the west of the Island during October to May. Birds then migrate north to waters surrounding Japan during the Austral winter. Seabirds are attracted to the baited hooks of longline vessels and can become snagged and drown as the line sinks into the water. Observations of flesh-footed shearwater (FFS) bycatch in Australian waters have been recorded on both Japanese and domestic longline fishing vessels. Increased observer coverage between 2002 and 2004 on Australian longline vessels, in order to monitor the effectiveness of an under-water setting chute and various line-weighting regimes, showed large bycatch rates of seabirds, and in particular flesh-footed shearwaters (Baker and Wise, 2005). In addition, substantial reductions in colony size have occurred on the island due to housing development. As a consequence of these sources of additional mortality, concerns have been expressed about the population's sustainability. Australia has international and national obligations to ensure that fishery interactions with seabird populations are not deleterious to their populations. The ""incidental catch (or by-catch) of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations"" has been listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as a key threatening process for seabirds (Environment Australia, 1998). Flesh-footed shearwaters were nominated as being at risk from longline fishing. This paper presents a quantitative impact assessment that fully integrates information on the biology, foraging distributions, links to oceanography, fishing interactions (Northern and Southern Hemisphere), and potential impacts from housing on Lord Howe Island. A discrete age-, sex- and colony-structured model is developed that accounts for natural and fishing mortality, together with potential consequences from the loss of nesting habitat on Lord Howe Island. The model is able to fit to tagging data on breeding foraging distributions. These data assist the model in predicting where the birds might be when at sea. The birds' position is assumed to be a function of time of year, sea surface temperature and longitude. Using the predicted positions, the model fits to data on the observed bycatch from the Australian domestic longline fishery. These data enable the model to predict the probability of catching a bird, given various operational characteristics (e.g. setting at night). The model also fits to data from the two surveys of breeding abundance that have occurred on Lord Howe Island.",,2-s2.0-80052979401,63,0.806503312,1,assess the impact of fish and habit loss on the lord how island pop of flesh foot shearw the flesh foot shearw puffin carneip is a med siz seabird with a singl eastern aust pop bree on lord how island oth bree pop ex in new zealand sou western western austral and st paul island in the ind oc tag and band study ind that bree bird of the lord how island pop inhabit wat main to the west of the island dur octob to may bird then migr nor to wat surround jap dur the aust wint seabird ar attract to the bait hook of longlin vessel and can becom snag and drown as the lin sink into the wat observ of flesh foot shearw ffs bycatch in aust wat hav been record on both japanes and domest longlin fish vessel increas observ cov between and on aust longlin vessel in ord to monit the effect of an und wat set chut and vary lin weight regim show larg bycatch rat of seabird and in particul flesh foot shearw bak and wis in addit subst reduc in colony siz hav occur on the island due to hous develop as a consequ of thes sourc of addit mort concern hav been express about the pop s sustain austral has intern and nat oblig to ens that fishery interact with seabird pop ar not deletery to their pop the incid catch or by catch of seabird dur oc longlin fish op has been list und the environ protect and biodivers conserv act as a key threatening process for seabird environ austral flesh foot shearw wer nomin as being at risk from longlin fish thi pap pres a quantit impact assess that ful integr inform on the biolog for distribut link to oceanograph fish interact northern and southern hemisph and pot impact from hous on lord how island a discret ag sex and colony structured model is develop that account for nat and fish mort togeth with pot consequ from the loss of nest habit on lord how island the model is abl to fit to tag dat on bree for distribut thes dat assist the model in predict wher the bird might be when at sea the bird posit is assum to be a funct of tim of year sea surfac temp and longitud us the predict posit the model fit to dat on the observ bycatch from the aust domest longlin fishery thes dat en the model to predict the prob of catch a bird giv vary op charact e g set at night the model also fit to dat from the two survey of bree abund that hav occur on lord how island,new,0.8190609725034625,0.7509422913437356,0.6940283001207677,0.6472642603066578,0.6083278703240451,0.5752654876301941,0.5466188340393582,0.5212871764755581,0.49837462055019227,0.4769961396396761,0.45598911621351523

Spatial distribution of nest sites was closely associated with environmental features in all surveyed years.

104,bird_oceanic,Shorebird distributions on ocean beaches of Northern California [Distribuci√≥n de aves playeras en las playas oce√°nicas del Norte California],"Use of coastal beaches by nonbreeding shorebirds along the Pacific coast of North America is poorlv understood because survey efforts have targeted large bays and wetlands where birds concentrate. Consequently, we studied coastal shorebird distributions and community composition by conducting monthly surveys at 40, 0.5-km linear plots along sandy beaches of coastal northern California from January through April 1996. We recorded 12 species, whose ranked abundances were consistent between winter (January-February) and spring (March-April). However, five of the six commonest species were more abundant in winter than spring. Among beaches, we detected a mean of 2.6 ¬± 2.3 (SD; range: 0-9) species and 12.0 ¬± 14.1 (range: 0-62) individuals. Number of species correlated positively with total shorebird abundance. Most species' abundances varied greatlv among sites; nine taxa had aggregated spatial distributions, one species was hyper-dispersed, and two species were randomly distributed among beaches. Species composition of the shorebird community was highly nested, partly because abundant species were more widespread in their occurrence than less-numerous taxa. More species and individuals occurred at sites near Humboldt Bay, probably because high tides forced birds off their principal feeding areas within the bay to adjacent beaches. Variation in shorebird use of beaches suggests that some areas are more important to wintering and migrating shorebirds than other locations. Although current levels of human activity in coastal northern California do not appear to influence distributions of nonbreeding shorebirds, we suggest that monitoring and management plans be considered to minimize potential negative impacts of recreational activities, which are certain to increase with human population size and recreational use of beaches.",10.1648/0273-8570-71.1.1,2-s2.0-0034391507,7,0.7803443809999999,0,shorebird distribut on oc beach of northern californ distribuci√≥n de av playera en las playa oce√°nicas del nort californ us of coast beach by nonbree shorebird along the pac coast of nor americ is poorlv understood becaus survey effort hav target larg bay and wetland wher bird cont consequ we study coast shorebird distribut and commun composit by conduc month survey at km linear plot along sandy beach of coast northern californ from janu through april we record specy whos rank abund wer consist between wint janu febru and spring march april howev fiv of the six commonest specy wer mor abund in wint than spring among beach we detect a mean of ¬± sd rang specy and ¬± rang individ numb of specy correl posit with tot shorebird abund most specy abund vary greatlv among sit nin tax had aggreg spat distribut on specy was hyp dispers and two specy wer random distribut among beach specy composit of the shorebird commun was high nest part becaus abund specy wer mor widespread in their occur than less num tax mor specy and individ occur at sit near humboldt bay prob becaus high tid forc bird off their princip fee area within the bay to adjac beach vary in shorebird us of beach suggest that som area ar mor import to wint and migr shorebird than oth loc although cur level of hum act in coast northern californ do not appear to influ distribut of nonbree shorebird we suggest that monit and man plan be consid to minim pot neg impact of recr act which ar certain to increas with hum pop siz and recr us of beach,new,0.8397411687109242,0.772989656489963,0.7160032263336965,0.6680517198619267,0.6270303767540796,0.5910971577748376,0.5587861181721084,0.5288423021463712,0.49997758957628474,0.47044337329489977,0.4370236272870577
119,bird_oceanic,Decline of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) associated with a collapse of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in a Nova Scotia estuary,"Mean numbers of migrant Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in Antigonish Harbour in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada) during October to December were similar (approx. 450-500 birds) for the period 1998-2000. Similarly, during this period, geese used two foraging sites. However, in 2001, the average number of birds decreased by half and the primary foraging sites were used only rarely. This coincided with a decline of about 95% in the biomass of roots and rhizomes of eelgrass (Zostera marina) that occurred between October 2000 and 2001. Eelgrass is the principal food of geese in this estuary. In addition, there was a reduction of around 50% in the numbers of common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), which feed on invertebrates associated with eelgrass. Lower than usual weekly abundances of geese and goldeneye are probably the result of an unusually short residence time in the estuary, rather than a decline in the total number of visiting migrants. We attribute these changes in the distribution and abundance of geese and goldeneyes to the dramatic decline in eelgrass.",10.1007/s101520100075,2-s2.0-0036767802,19,0.7772972440000001,1,declin of canad gees brant canadens and common goldeney bucephal clangul assocy with a collaps of eelgrass zoster marin in a nov scot estu mean numb of migr canad gees brant canadens in antigon harbo in the southern gulf of st lawr canad dur octob to decemb wer simil approx bird for the period simil dur thi period gees us two for sit howev in the av numb of bird decreas by half and the prim for sit wer us on rar thi coincid with a declin of about in the biomass of root and rhizom of eelgrass zoster marin that occur between octob and eelgrass is the princip food of gees in thi estu in addit ther was a reduc of around in the numb of common goldeney bucephal clangul which fee on invertebr assocy with eelgrass low than us week abund of gees and goldeney ar prob the result of an unus short resid tim in the estu rath than a declin in the tot numb of visit migr we attribut thes chang in the distribut and abund of gees and goldeney to the dram declin in eelgrass,new,0.8243775310445931,0.7903506652427289,0.7648437176240274,0.7452746277587899,0.7298906670729847,0.7176460502402279,0.7079551209150258,0.7005660290808217,0.6955604202909081,0.6935381641293684,0.6962451976561961
125,bird_oceanic,"Changes in abundance and at-sea distribution of seabirds in the Bay of Biscay prior to, and following the ‚ÄúErika‚Äù oil spill","We investigated the impact of the ‚ÄúErika‚Äù oil spill in the Bay of Biscay (France) on seabird populations. Relative abundance and spatial distribution at sea between 1980-1999 and 2000-2002 periods were compared. This study took place in a standardized monitoring at sea carried out with Coast Guard vessels following the line transect method. This work rests on 107 551 standardized counts of one minute before ‚ÄúErika‚Äù and 23 449 after the oil spill. There was not a simple correlation between the number of individuals found oiled and the numerical variation of the populations at sea during the two years following the accident. The guillemot Uria aalge, the most frequently collected species in the north of the Bay of Biscay, showed no decrease in at sea abundance during the two years following the pollution. Conversely, some species found in small numbers on the coast (e.g. divers Gavia sp., razorbill Alca torda, common scoter Melanitta nigra) decreased significantly at sea (20 to 80%). Overall, marine bird populations declined significantly in the northern sector of the Bay of Biscay (48¬∞32' to 46¬∞58' north) and increased in the southern sector (45¬∞13' to 43¬∞15' north), whereas decreases and increases occurred in the central sector (46¬∞57' to 45¬∞14' north). Changes in the spatial distribution of the species after the ‚ÄúErika‚Äù oil spill occurred through disappearance or retraction (Bay of Vilaine, Houat-Hoedic archipelago), or through displacement and reinforcement (Gouf of Capbreton).

144,bird_oceanic,"Invasive american mink mustela vison in wetlands of the cape horn biosphere reserve, southern Chile: What are they eating?","The impact of alien American mink on the native fauna of oceanic islands has been demonstrated in a number of locations. In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.",10.1017/S0030605308099997,2-s2.0-67349234507,38,0.7618189879999999,0,invas am mink mustel vison in wetland of the cap horn biosph reserv southern chil what ar they eat the impact of aly am mink on the nat faun of oc island has been demonst in a numb of loc in the sub antarct cap horn biosph reserv of southern chil the specy is cur expand in an are wher the nat faun evolv in the abs of terrest pred to evalu any emerg problem we theref investig season vary in prey us by mink on navarino island within the reserv we ident undigest remain in scat collect from the shor of pond ov januarynovemb diet consist main of mam and bird mam includ both nat and exot rod wer the predomin prey in al season but bird wer of eq import dur the sum when bird bree and their abund and divers increas on the island exot rod wer the on ident mam prey item dur wint nat wetland bird constitut a subst proport of mink diet and gre than that report in oth area many bird bree on navarino island ar ground nest a strategy that evolv in the abs of nat mam pred consid the intern import of thi reg our result emphas the nee for an assess of the impact of mink pred on the pop of nat prey,new,0.8233072369903897,0.7512173381555576,0.6906978172235706,0.6410872569475417,0.5999544794321474,0.5651927774543634,0.5352286649775528,0.5088896846056169,0.48525063595238266,0.46347552657983837,0.44261587902769467
156,bird_oceanic,Dietary change in Cape gannets reflects distributional and demographic shifts in two South African commercial fish stocks,"Seabirds are upper trophic level predators, and are often highly sensitive to changes in the availability of their prey. Altered prey assemblages resulting from fluctuations in oceanographic conditions may be mirrored by shifts in seabird diet. Long-term studies of dietary change in seabirds therefore provide valuable insight into the nature of environmental shifts within the systems in which they forage. In recent decades, the Agulhas region in South Africa has undergone significant oceanographic change related to warming and intensification of the Agulhas current. Concurrent with this change, the population ofCape gannets Morus capensis at Bird Island, Algoa Bay, has grownrapidly, probably as a result of an increased availability of its dominant prey items, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus.Using one of the longest andmost complete time-series available on diet of a seabird (spanning 34 years), we tested for changes in composition and the abundance of dominant prey species of this population. These observed changeswere also comparedwith acoustic survey estimates of their biomass, and annual catch data. Since 1979, the prey composition has remained similar, but the dietary contribution of sardine and anchovy, which fluctuated inversely to each other, increased over the study period. These shifts seemto be reflective of fluctuations in the stock size of sardine and anchovy. Conversely, a third species, saury Scomberesox saurus, dominant in the non-breedingdiet of the 1980s, decreased significantly in dietary abundance over the following two decades. It is likely that dietary shifts of Cape gannets at Bird Island were related to climate-mediated oceanographic change. The implications of such changes are discussed. ¬© International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

166,bird_oceanic,"Influence of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic Ocean on a parasite, Echinorhynchus gadi (Acanthocephala) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) occurring off coastal Labrador, Canada","A study was conducted to determine the influence of environmental change on an endoparasite, Echinorhynchus gadi (Acanthocephala) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) over a 30-year period off the coast of Labrador in the north-western Atlantic, North Atlantic Fisheries Organization subareas 2J-3K. Cod, once an abundant fish species that had been commercially exploited for many decades, declined precipitously during the mid-1980s onwards. This decline was attributed to climatic changes that affected the entire food chain from zooplankton to fish, sea birds and marine mammals. A monitoring programme was introduced, sampling cod by otter trawling using research vessels. The fish, after capture, were frozen at - 20¬∞C, subsequently thawed and the digestive tract removed and examined for the parasite in 2006. Data from samples taken in 1976, 1980-81, 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2003 were compared statistically with those collected in 2006. The results indicate a decline in the prevalence and mean abundance of E. gadi in 1986 with a minimum in 2000 but increasing gradually in 2003 and 2006. These changes were coincident initially with a decline of oceanic temperature and the entire food web, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), a preferred prey of cod and primary source of E. gadi. The increase in prevalence and mean abundance of the parasite in 2006 were associated with an increase of oceanic temperature and the return of small schools of capelin to offshore areas. Cod older than 4 years harboured a greater abundance of E. gadi than younger fish, while no difference was observed between the sexes. The results suggest that the abundance of E. gadi can be useful as a bioindicator of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic. ¬© 2008 Cambridge University Press.",10.1017/S0022149X0897615X,2-s2.0-55949132378,24,0.7548359920000001,1,influ of environ chang in the nor western atl oc on a parasit echinorhynch gad acanthocephal of atl cod gad morhu occur off coast labrad canad a study was conduc to determin the influ of environ chang on an endoparasit echinorhynch gad acanthocephal of atl cod gad morhu ov a year period off the coast of labrad in the nor western atl nor atl fishery org subarea j k cod ont an abund fish specy that had been commerc exploit for many decad declin precipit dur the mid s onward thi declin was attribut to clim chang that affect the entir food chain from zooplankton to fish sea bird and marin mam a monit program was introduc sampl cod by ot trawl us research vessel the fish aft capt wer froz at ¬∞c subsequ thaw and the digest tract remov and examin for the parasit in dat from sampl tak in and wer comp stat with thos collect in the result ind a declin in the prev and mean abund of e gad in with a minim in but increas grad in and thes chang wer coincid init with a declin of oc temp and the entir food web includ capelin mallot villos a prefer prey of cod and prim sourc of e gad the increas in prev and mean abund of the parasit in wer assocy with an increas of oc temp and the return of smal schools of capelin to offsh area cod old than year harbo a gre abund of e gad than young fish whil no diff was observ between the sex the result suggest that the abund of e gad can be us as a bioind of environ chang in the nor western atl,new,0.7521609226221818,0.7022260465740853,0.6657023786570571,0.6384368394426458,0.6176368804519395,0.6016575037356187,0.5895768262248566,0.5809751534439876,0.5758998888247571,0.5750569312720205,0.580546845683186
175,bird_oceanic,Distribution and abundance patterns of bird community and raptor populations in the Andaman archipelago,"A qualitative survey of tile terrestrial bird community (sixty-five species) and a quantitative analysis of the five-diurnal raptor assemblage were carried out on 33 islands of the oceanic Andaman archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. Among seven geographical parameters island area was the main determinant of species richness for both the whole bird community and each category of species associated with four habitat types. Species richness decreased most markedly with island size in the smallest islands and in open habitat species. The rarest forest species were the most extinction prone with decreasing island size. Specific habitat selection was the most prominent ecological correlate of inter island species distribution. Observed species distribution patterns did not fit the random species placement or equiprobable occurrence hypotheses. Raptors were primarily forest species, two of them restricted to forest interior, two more tolerant of fragmentation and one naturally associated with mangroves. Unexpectedly, the two rarest and most area sensitive raptors were the two smallest species with a strong active flight, whereas the most abundant and widespread species was the most forest interior and endemic taxon. Both raptor species richness, species frequency of occurrence and abundance indices decreased with island area, which was consistently tile most significant determinant of every species' occurrence and abundance. There was a significant correlation between abundance or frequency of occurrence of every raptor species and the proportion of their preferred habitat type. No relationship was found between habitat niche breadth or local abundance of any species and their distribution range among islands. The hypothesis of random composition of species assemblages on islands was not supported because of species specific habitat selection. Any evidence of interspecific competitive exclusion was limited to the striking habitat segregation of the two congeneric serpent eagles. A metapopulation structure was suggested by small population distribution patterns, observed sea crossing and tile circumstances of an apparent extinction.",10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00348.x,2-s2.0-0030618891,55,0.754064106,0,distribut and abund pattern of bird commun and rapt pop in the andam archipelago a qualit survey of til terrest bird commun sixty fiv specy and a quantit analys of the fiv diurn rapt assembl wer carry out on island of the oc andam archipelago in the bay of beng among sev geograph paramet island are was the main determin of specy rich for both the whol bird commun and each categ of specy assocy with four habit typ specy rich decreas most mark with island siz in the smallest island and in op habit specy the rarest forest specy wer the most extinct pron with decreas island siz spec habit select was the most promin ecolog correl of int island specy distribut observ specy distribut pattern did not fit the random specy plac or equiprob occur hypothes rapt wer prim forest specy two of them restrict to forest intery two mor tol of frag and on nat assocy with mangrov unexpect the two rarest and most are sensit rapt wer the two smallest specy with a strong act flight wherea the most abund and widespread specy was the most forest intery and endem taxon both rapt specy rich specy frequ of occur and abund ind decreas with island are which was consist til most sign determin of every specy occur and abund ther was a sign correl between abund or frequ of occur of every rapt specy and the proport of their prefer habit typ no rel was found between habit nich bread or loc abund of any specy and their distribut rang among island the hypothes of random composit of specy assembl on island was not support becaus of specy spec habit select any evid of interspec competit exclud was limit to the striking habit segreg of the two cong serp eagl a metapop structure was suggest by smal pop distribut pattern observ sea cross and til circumst of an app extinct,new,0.8351216075761626,0.7504682172782265,0.6772814662035174,0.6164429088045665,0.5654441336821205,0.5217460006443012,0.4832862617703449,0.4483458423310174,0.4152624748373264,0.381945589708289,0.3447906527662821

195,bird_oceanic,"Avian abundances on yap, federated states of Micronesia, after typhoon sudall","Typhoons can add to chronic threats such as incremental habitat loss and pressure from feral predators to jeopardize the unique biodiversity of Pacific Ocean islands. Typhoon Sudall severely damaged Yap, Federated States of Micronesia, in April 2004. To establish an initial assessment of consequences of the typhoon for the avian community on this poorly studied island, we surveyed birds along line transects in mangroves, savannah, and forest on Yap during the last week of August 2004. We found all expected 22 resident species in abundances whose rank order was very similar to results from surveys in the early 1980s. Most-common species were White Tern, Plain White-eye, Micronesian Starling, Micronesian Myzomela, and Yap Monarch. All five species were common in all three major habitats, mangroves, upland forest, and savannah, although terns nested primarily in forests. Least commonly encountered resident species were Common Cicadabird, Micronesian Pigeon, and White-throated Ground-Dove. We found one to six individuals of each of those species. We also encountered 27 species of migratory birds, including the first record for Yap of Greater Scaup. Populations of birds appeared to be about 50% lower across all resident species than estimates from 1983-1984, suggesting the possibility that Typhoon Sudall caused widespread mortality. However, other possible explanations for reduced abundances exist, which we review briefly.

205,bird_oceanic,"Shorebird seasonal abundance and habitat-use patterns in punta rasa, samboromb√≥n bay, Argentina","Shorebird assemblage composition and habitat-use patterns were characterized at Punta Rasa during the austral summer, autumn and winter. Compared to other sites within the region, this area showed high species richness, reflected by a total of 22 species recorded within a relatively short time frame. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by the use of estuarine mudflats and oceanic sandy beaches as feeding habitats. During low tide, more species used estuarine environments, achieving the highest total densities. Abundance patterns and assemblage composition also changed seasonally. Maximum total abundance occurred during the austral summer, and minimum total abundance during the austral winter. During the austral summer, the assemblage was dominated by Nearctic migrants such as American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica) and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). In addition, Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus) and American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) were abundant during the austral autumn. The Red Knot (Calidris canutus), a shorebird that dominated the austral autumn assemblage 25 years ago, was recorded in relatively small numbers during this study, probably reflecting the global population trend of a subspecies of the Red Knot (C. c. rufa) in the past two decades. During the austral winter, resident birds largely dominated the assemblage. However, it is noteworthy that some individuals of nine Nearctic migrant species remained in the area. In the case of the endangered Red Knot, Punta Rasa is, along with Lagoa do Peixe in Brazil, one of the sites in South America with the highest known abundances during the austral winter. .",10.1675/063.038.0109,2-s2.0-84926505057,13,0.739160613,1,shorebird season abund and habit us pattern in punt ras samboromb√≥n bay argentin shorebird assembl composit and habit us pattern wer charact at punt ras dur the aust sum autumn and wint comp to oth sit within the reg thi are show high specy rich reflect by a tot of specy record within a rel short tim fram diff in assembl structure wer driv by the us of estuarin mudfl and oc sandy beach as fee habit dur low tid mor specy us estuarin environ achiev the highest tot dens abund pattern and assembl composit also chang season maxim tot abund occur dur the aust sum and minim tot abund dur the aust wint dur the aust sum the assembl was domin by nearct migr such as am gold plov pluv dominic hudson godwit limos haemastic and whit rump sandpip calidr fuscicol in addit two band plov charadri falklandic and am oystercatch haematop palliat wer abund dur the aust autumn the red knot calidr canut a shorebird that domin the aust autumn assembl year ago was record in rel smal numb dur thi study prob reflect the glob pop trend of a subspecy of the red knot c c ruf in the past two decad dur the aust wint resid bird larg domin the assembl howev it is noteworthy that som individ of nin nearct migr specy remain in the are in the cas of the endang red knot punt ras is along with lago do peix in brazil on of the sit in sou americ with the highest known abund dur the aust wint,new,0.8127348786935663,0.7460569549880001,0.6915681400850893,0.6472361505731015,0.6104648048169178,0.5792768151565477,0.5522520281782802,0.5283322050742333,0.506641840919467,0.48628100496078613,0.4659001591441818

Data were collected from January 1997 to October 1998, corresponding to 123 fishing days targeting sharks using bottom longline. We also present the results of 10 days of fishing activities targeting tunas and marlins by the same fleet using pelagic longline, in order to determine the importance of the shark bycatch in these fisheries around the offshore islands. A total of 15 shark species representing five families were captured during the study period. The catch composition and CPUE values expressed in weight and number showed that the most abundant species were Carcharhinus perezi and C. falciformis for Los Roques Archipelago and La Blanquilla Island, while C perezi and Ginglymostoma cirratum were more common in Las Aves Archipelago. In Los Roques Archipelago, C perezi and C falciformis were most common during the second half of the year; a similar trend was observed for the rest of the shark species caught by the fishery. A positive relationship was observed between CPUE and fishing depth in the case of C. perezi and C falciformis off Los Roques Archipelago: CPUE by weight increases with depth, while CPUE by number decreases with depth.

225,bird_oceanic,"Effects of el ni√±o 1982-83 on benthos, fish and fisheries off the south american pacific coast","Biological effects of El Ni√±o (EN) were first detected on the Peruvian coast and have been reported for some of the major events during this century, especially those of 1925-26, 1940-41 and 1972-73. EN 1982-83 exceeded all these earlier events in strength and duration, and was the first to be investigated in more detail, both on a latitudinal gradient and including, for the first time, the benthic subsystem of the Humboldt Current upwelling area off the west coast of South America. Despite the fact that the coverage of the area of major impact (over 4,000 km of coastline) was by no means complete, and that most of the causes and mechanisms behind the observed changes remained unclear due to the lack of experimental (e.g. tolerance) studies, the observational evidence and the fluctuations observed in the landing statistics have contributed a great deal to our understanding of the way in which a major EN event affects the upwelling system as a whole. In the pelagic subsystem, a surface temperature increase of up to 11¬∞C, the effects of which could be traced down to at least 1,000 m depth, led to a tropicalization of the ecosystem, the disruption of the normal food web, and induced changes in species composition and migrations of a large number of fish and invertebrate species populations. This resulted in a general impoverishment of this system. The consequences for some commercially important species, which had already been damaged by former EN events and the impact of overfishing, were severe off Peru and Ecuador although there were certain positive effects due to the inshore migration of various oceanic mackerels and the southward migration of (sub)tropical fish species such as dolphinfish and skipjack tuna. These beneficial effects were, however, only of minor importance for the fisheries, which were not equipped to deal with the new target species. In the benthic subsystem, a factor of major importance, besides the increase in temperature, was the marked increase of dissolved oxygen at the seafloor during and after the event. Despite mass mortalities of many of the cold-water adapted invertebrate species on sandy beaches, shallow soft bottoms and in the rocky intertidal zone, the overall effect on fisheries was rather positive. In the case of commercially exploited shellfish (‚Äúmariscos‚Äù), this was due to an increased immigration of subtropical species, mostly crustaceans, as well as increases in abundance of some local species more tolerant of warm water such as the Peruvian scallop. This led to an unprecedented boom of some fisheries on the northern and central Peruvian coast. For the demersal fisheries and the artisanal finfish fishery, the immediate effects of EN were detrimental due to a general dispersal and downslope migration of many species, but the long-term effects appeared to have been beneficial: improved feeding conditions at the seafloor and decreased fishing pressure caused a major recruitment success of some species such as Pacific hake, and this may provide increased catches several years after EN. The primary EN effects described in this review apparently induced many secondary effects. The disruption of the pelagic food web caused mortalities and reproductive failures of guano birds and seals; mortalities (including marine algae) and increases in population abundance in shallow water led to temporary changes in species composition and successional processes that remain to be studied in more detail. On the whole, however, recovery of most species occurred rapidly, and relatively few long-term effects have remained, demonstrating the remarkable resilience of the upwelling ecosystem. ¬© 1990, Elsevier B.V.

254,bird_oceanic,"Changes in bird species composition on a remote and well-forested Wallacean Island, South-East Asia","In South-East Asia patterns of forest loss can predict the number of threatened birds. On the oceanic islands of Wallacea, small-scale agriculture, rather than commercial logging, is the main cause of forest loss and conversion, but few studies have directly examined their responses to land use. In 2001, I studied the birds of primary forest and anthropogenic gardens on the well-forested, and remote, Damar Island (198 km2) in the Banda Sea. Furthermore, I examined broad changes to the islands bird fauna by comparing baseline bird lists obtained in the 19th century with 2001 data. The conversion of primary forest to garden resulted in substantial changes in avifaunal composition, and to the abundance of individual bird species, particularly to frugivorous and globally restricted-range species. Of 15 common birds, four were significantly more abundant in primary forest (blue-tailed imperial pigeon Ducula concinna, northern fantail Rhipidura rufiventris, golden whistler Pachycephala pectoralis and red-chested flowerpecker Dicaeum maugei) and one (scaly-breasted honeyeater Lichmera squamata) was more abundant in garden habitat. Incidental observations provided further evidence that many forest specialists (including the island endemic Damar flycatcher Ficedula henrici) rarely, if ever, used garden habitats notwithstanding its relative proximity. The number of resident birds recorded in 2001 (39) was similar to the 1890s (38), but six forest-dependent passerines were extirpated between samples. These losses are associated with the conversion of 25% of the primary forest to modified habitat since the 1890s, but given the sparse species and environmental change data available it is impossible to definitively pinpoint this as the only cause underlying the species losses. This study demonstrates that remote and relatively well-forested islands are not immune to the threatening processes impacting bird populations elsewhere in South-East Asia. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

264,bird_oceanic,Long-term population trends of Sooty Shearwater (Puffinus griseus) revealed by hunt success,"The annual hunt of Muttonbirds (chicks of the Sooty Shearwater, Puffinus griseus), undertaken by the Rakiura MƒÅori people of southern New Zealand, is economically and socially integral to their cultural identity. Muttonbirders concerned at ensuring that the hunt remains viable for coming generations have provided catch records to help ascertain historic trends in hunt success. Analysis of eight catch diaries for a 67-year period demonstrates considerable consistency across diaries in the variability of hunt success, as measured by annualized mean daily hunt tallies. A conservative estimate of the overall annual decline in hunt success is-1.89% (95% CI:-1.14% to-2.65%). Birders' observations of a changing relationship between chick quality and hunt success was evidenced across diaries. Reduced hunt success from the 1990s indicates that possible adult ""knockdowns"" and/or sustained substantial reductions in breeding proportions have occurred. Chick size has remained constant, suggesting little change in the provisioning environment. Catch per unit effort data, provided by a single diary, confirms a link between variability in annual hunt success and chick abundance. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are correlated with hunt success and chick size, respectively. Interannual PDO+ (or PDO-) values are correlated with higher (or lower) tallies, whereas SAM+ (or SAM -) values are associated with larger (or smaller) chick size. Uncertainty in the relationship between the breeding Sooty Shearwater population, chick catch, and environmental perturbation in their feeding grounds could be reduced with the inclusion of hunt time in all diary records. Ongoing prolonged decline in a top-trophic-level predator such as the Sooty Shearwater raises serious concern that long-term oceanic changes have been occurring and that long-term sustainability of muttonbirding is in doubt. ¬© 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/09-0813.1,2-s2.0-79958852967,60,0.707019582,1,long term pop trend of sooty shearw puffin grise rev by hunt success the an hunt of muttonbird chick of the sooty shearw puffin grise undertak by the rakiur mƒåori peopl of southern new zealand is econom and soc integr to their cult id muttonbird concern at ens that the hunt remain viabl for com gen hav provid catch record to help ascertain hist trend in hunt success analys of eight catch diary for a year period demonst consid consist across diary in the vary of hunt success as meas by an mean dai hunt tal a conserv estim of the overal an declin in hunt success is ci to bird observ of a chang rel between chick qual and hunt success was evid across diary reduc hunt success from the s ind that poss adult knockdown and or sustain subst reduc in bree proport hav occur chick siz has remain const suggest littl chang in the provid environ catch per unit effort dat provid by a singl diary confirm a link between vary in an hunt success and chick abund the pac decad oscil pdo and the southern annul mod sam ar correl with hunt success and chick siz respect interan pdo or pdo valu ar correl with high or low tal wherea sam or sam valu ar assocy with larg or smal chick siz uncertainty in the rel between the bree sooty shearw pop chick catch and environ perturb in their fee ground could be reduc with the includ of hunt tim in al diary record ongo prolong declin in a top troph level pred such as the sooty shearw rais sery concern that long term oc chang hav been occur and that long term sustain of muttonbird is in doubt,new,0.7371007897043964,0.7088457661330309,0.6898607171499044,0.6771709483354306,0.6690541725514948,0.6646203228359349,0.6635255033174962,0.6658867505323465,0.672398323959562,0.684800910980939,0.7072424665307788
274,bird_oceanic,Trends in carbon flux to seabirds in the Peruvian upwelling system: Effects of wind and fisheries on population regulation,"We hypothesized that change in the annual population size of guano-producing seabirds (cormorant, Phalacrocorax bougainvillii; booby, Sula variegata; pelican, Pelecanus thagus) is a response to changes in primary and secondary production of the Peruvian upwelling system. We tested this hypothesis by modeling nitrate input through upwelling to the upper layers of the ocean off Peru between 6¬∞ and 14¬∞S using data on wind stress and sea surface temperature. The model predicted the amount of carbon fixed by primary production each year from 1925 to 2000, which was then apportioned to the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass and ultimately to the seabird population and the anchovy fishery, the largest single-species fishery on Earth. The model predicted a marked increase in primary production as a consequence of increasing wind stress. It overestimated the anchovy biomass after the collapse of the fishery in 1972, but closely predicted the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to the mid-1960s, and their decline thereafter, explaining about 94% of the variation in seabird numbers from 1925 to 2000. The model indicates the seabirds consumed 14.4% of the available anchovies and, thus, that seabirds consumed 2.3% of the new production, before the development of the anchovy fishery, and only 2.2% of the available anchovies and 0.3% of the new production after the development of the fishery. The model results clarify the roles that environmental and anthropogenic factors may have had in regulating the guano-producing seabird populations. It indicates that the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to 1955 was likely a response to increased productivity of the Peruvian upwelling system and that the subsequent drastic decline in seabird abundance was likely due to competition for food with the fishery, which caught ‚àº85% of the anchovies, which otherwise would have been available for the seabirds. This model also shows that an increase in oceanic primary production promotes reproductive success and population growth in higher trophic level organisms.",10.1111/j.1365-2419.2004.00283.x,2-s2.0-2442626623,40,0.70641852,1,trend in carbon flux to seabird in the peruv upwel system effect of wind and fishery on pop reg we hypothes that chang in the an pop siz of guano produc seabird corm phalacrocorax bougainvilli booby sul variegat pel pelecan thag is a respons to chang in prim and second produc of the peruv upwel system we test thi hypothes by model nit input through upwel to the up lay of the oc off peru between ¬∞ and ¬∞s us dat on wind stress and sea surfac temp the model predict the amount of carbon fix by prim produc each year from to which was then apport to the peruv anchovy engra ring biomass and ultim to the seabird pop and the anchovy fishery the largest singl specy fishery on ear the model predict a mark increas in prim produc as a consequ of increas wind stress it overestim the anchovy biomass aft the collaps of the fishery in but clos predict the grow of seabird pop from to the mid s and their declin thereaft explain about of the vary in seabird numb from to the model ind the seabird consum of the avail anchovy and thu that seabird consum of the new produc bef the develop of the anchovy fishery and on of the avail anchovy and of the new produc aft the develop of the fishery the model result clar the rol that environ and anthropog fact may hav had in reg the guano produc seabird pop it ind that the grow of seabird pop from to was lik a respons to increas produc of the peruv upwel system and that the subsequ drast declin in seabird abund was lik due to competit for food with the fishery which caught ‚àº of the anchovy which otherw would hav been avail for the seabird thi model also show that an increas in oc prim produc promot reproduc success and pop grow in high troph level org,new,0.7392351200491662,0.7044680416474202,0.6807531036710537,0.6644020131459335,0.6532504301904762,0.6461634816959699,0.6426559479375891,0.6427600691874956,0.6471244106224829,0.6574858662093106,0.6781149003208267

Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4. Other factors may interact with the availability of food for nestlings to limit the populations of resident birds below carrying capacities set by non-breeding season arthropod abundance, thereby creating a set of resources available to non-breeding migrants. ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00928.x,2-s2.0-16244419776,4,0.696474003,0,migr in neotrop bird commun an assess of the bree cur hypothes expl for the integr of migr and non migr resid bird in the neotrop hav been comply by the paradox that arthropod abund ar low when bird abund reach their an peak the bree cur hypothes off an expl for thi paradox by post that resid bird ar limit in the bree season by the avail of larg arthropod suit for reproduc wherea the carry capac of al bird in the non bree season is limit by the avail of arthropod suit for self maint of adult field dat from jamaic support thi hypothes among sit the ratio of migr to resid bird abund was correl neg with the ratio of larg arthropod biomass in the bree season to tot arthropod biomass in the non bree season howev aft control for effect of arthropod season migr to resid bird abund ratio wer high in hum disturb than undisturb sit oth fact may interact with the avail of food for nestl to limit the pop of resid bird below carry capac set by non bree season arthropod abund thereby cre a set of resourc avail to non bree migr,new,0.779804756060678,0.6939802104936179,0.6241292900034812,0.5688430351059394,0.5248063923583975,0.4892524005735747,0.46022033040786037,0.4364128246836049,0.4170827947488018,0.40207689640385075,0.392169891194439

318,bird_oceanic,Sampling mobile oceanic fishes and sharks: Implications for fisheries and conservation planning,"Tuna, billfish, and oceanic sharks [hereafter referred to as ‚Äòmobile oceanic fishes and sharks‚Äô (MOFS)] are characterised by conservative life-history strategies and highly migratory behaviour across large, transnational ranges. Intense exploitation over the past 65 years by a rapidly expanding high-seas fishing fleet has left many populations depleted, with consequences at the ecosystem level due to top-down control and trophic cascades. Despite increases in both CITES and IUCN Red Listings, the demographic trajectories of oceanic sharks and billfish are poorly quantified and resolved at geographic and population levels. Amongst MOFS trajectories, those of tunas are generally considered better understood, yet several populations remain either overfished or of unknown status. MOFS population trends and declines therefore remain contentious, partly due to challenges in deriving accurate abundance and biomass indices. Two major management strategies are currently recognised to address conservation issues surrounding MOFS: (i) internationally ratified legal frameworks and their associated regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs); and (ii) spatio-temporal fishery closures, including no-take marine protected areas (MPAs). In this context, we first review fishery-dependent studies relying on data derived from catch records and from material accessible through fishing extraction, under the umbrella of RFMO-administrated management. Challenges in interpreting catch statistics notwithstanding, we find that fishery-dependent studies have enhanced the accuracy of biomass indices and the management strategies they inform, by addressing biases in reporting and non-random effort, and predicting drivers of spatial variability across meso- and oceanic scales in order to inform stock assessments. By contrast and motivated by the increase in global MPA coverage restricting extractive activities, we then detail ways in which fishery-independent methods are increasingly improving and steering management by exploring facets of MOFS ecology thus far poorly grasped. Advances in telemetry are increasingly used to explore ontogenic and seasonal movements, and provide means to consider MOFS migration corridors and residency patterns. The characterisation of trophic relationships and prey distribution through biochemical analysis and hydro-acoustics surveys has enabled the tracking of dietary shifts and mapping of high-quality foraging grounds. We conclude that while a scientific framework is available to inform initial design and subsequent implementation of MPAs, there is a shortage in the capacity to answer basic but critical questions about MOFS ecology (who, when, where?) required to track populations non-extractively, thereby presenting a barrier to assessing empirically the performance of MPA-based management for MOFS. This sampling gap is exacerbated by the increased establishment of large (&gt;10000 km2) and very large MPAs (VLMPAs, &gt;100000 km2) - great expanses of ocean lacking effective monitoring strategies and survey regimes appropriate to those scales. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate the use of a non-extractive protocol to measure MOFS population recovery and MPA efficiency. We further identify technological avenues for monitoring at the VLMPA scale, through the use of spotter planes, drones, satellite technology, and horizontal acoustics, and highlight their relevance to the ecosystem-based framework of MOFS management. ¬© 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",10.1111/brv.12246,2-s2.0-85028973645,61,0.692280096,1,sampl mobl oc fish and shark imply for fishery and conserv plan tun billf and oc shark hereaft refer to as ‚äòmobile oc fish and sharks‚äô mof ar charact by conserv lif hist strategies and high migr behavio across larg transn rang intens exploit ov the past year by a rapid expand high sea fish fleet has left many pop deplet with consequ at the ecosystem level due to top down control and troph cascad despit increas in both cit and iucn red list the demograph traject of oc shark and billf ar poor quant and resolv at geograph and pop level amongst mof traject thos of tuna ar gen consid bet understood yet sev pop remain eith overf or of unknown stat mof pop trend and declin theref remain contenty part due to challeng in der acc abund and biomass ind two maj man strategies ar cur recogn to address conserv issu surround mof i intern rat leg framework and their assocy reg fishery man org rfmos and ii spatio temp fishery clos includ no tak marin protect area mpa in thi context we first review fishery depend study rely on dat der from catch record and from mat access through fish extract und the umbrell of rfmo admin man challeng in interpret catch stat notwithstand we find that fishery depend study hav enh the acc of biomass ind and the man strategies they inform by address bias in report and non random effort and predict driv of spat vary across meso and oc scal in ord to inform stock assess by contrast and mot by the increas in glob mpa cov restrict extract act we then detail way in which fishery independ method ar increas improv and ste man by expl facet of mof ecolog thu far poor grasp adv in telemetry ar increas us to expl ontog and season mov and provid mean to consid mof migr corrid and resid pattern the charact of troph rel and prey distribut through biochem analys and hydro acoust survey has en the track of diet shift and map of high qual for ground we conclud that whil a sci framework is avail to inform init design and subsequ impl of mpa ther is a short in the capac to answ bas but crit quest about mof ecolog who when wher requir to track pop non extract thereby pres a barry to assess empir the perform of mpa bas man for mof thi sampl gap is exacerb by the increas est of larg gt km and very larg mpa vlmpas gt km gre expans of oc lack effect monit strategies and survey regim appropry to thos scal to address thi shortcom we demonst the us of a non extract protocol to meas mof pop recovery and mpa efficy we furth ident technolog avenu for monit at the vlmpa scal through the us of spot plan dron satellit technolog and horizont acoust and highlight their relev to the ecosystem bas framework of mof man,new,0.718739307737659,0.6629288324679763,0.6219457230756879,0.591507533679275,0.5685528765015917,0.5512304251619632,0.5385068987545806,0.5299565602142826,0.5257722237668377,0.5271242438977622,0.5375029332703183
334,bird_oceanic,Top predator distribution and abundance across the eastern Gulf of Alaska: Temporal variability and ocean habitat associations,"We studied interannual variation in marine bird and mammal distribution and abundance in the eastern Gulf of Alaska (GOA) over 8 years, 1996-2003. We identified and enumerated seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans along a replicated 1500 km survey path, representing 450 km2 of coastal and 2000 km 2 of oceanic habitat. Near-surface temperature (5 m depth) fluctuated considerably from year to year, in part due to the timing of the survey, with an early survey in 1996 and a late survey in 2002. Many species were observed across the entire gradient, particularly procellariiform (tubenose) seabirds and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). We observed peaks in abundance in the oceanic zone in 1998, 2001, and 2002, owing primarily to influxes of dark shearwaters (Puffinus spp.) and Leach's storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leuchora). Rank correlations indicated similar year-to-year changes in density between species, and species-specific responses to temperature and ocean productivity as indexed by nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations. We developed topographic/bathymetric models of habitat selection for the coastal zone. Although we found some distinct habitat preferences in this zone, overall we observed a continuum in the marine bird and mammal community across the entire eastern GOA. The strength of the coupling between coastal and oceanic environments as provided by variation in top predator dispersion appears related to large-scale variations in oceanography, though we have yet to fully investigate causal mechanisms. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

383,bird_oceanic,"Supercolonies of the invasive yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes., on an oceanic island: Forager activity patterns, density and biomass","Ants have the capacity to reach unusually high densities, mostly in their introduced ranges. Numerical dominance is often cited as key to the ability of exotic ants to displace native ant species, reduce the abundance of invertebrates and negatively impact upon bird, land crab and other vertebrate populations. On Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, the yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes (Jerdon), forms supercolonies, where extremely high densities of foraging ants have contributed to 'invasional meltdown' in rainforest areas. Densities of up to 2254 foraging ants per m2 and a biomass of 1.85 g per m2 were recorded, and nest densities reached 10.5 nest entrances per m2. Populations of A. gracilipes can overcome and kill red endemic land crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis) over 100 times their own biomass. This is the highest recorded density of foraging ants, and adds another element to the definition of 'supercolony' of unicolonial ants. This paper documents one extreme in a continuum of densities of unicolonial, invasive ant species and highlights the need to incorporate forager densities into invasive ant research. ¬© Birkh√§user Verlag, 2005.",10.1007/s00040-005-0800-6,2-s2.0-23944515511,16,0.653710583,0,supercolony of the invas yellow crazy ant anoplolep gracilip on an oc island for act pattern dens and biomass ant hav the capac to reach unus high dens most in their introduc rang num domin is oft cit as key to the abl of exot ant to displac nat ant specy reduc the abund of invertebr and neg impact upon bird land crab and oth vertebr pop on christmas island ind oc the yellow crazy ant anoplolep gracilip jerdon form supercolony wher extrem high dens of for ant hav contribut to invas meltdown in rainforest area dens of up to for ant per m and a biomass of g per m wer record and nest dens reach nest ent per m pop of a gracilip can overcom and kil red endem land crab gecarcoide nat ov tim their own biomass thi is the highest record dens of for ant and ad anoth el to the definit of supercolony of unicolon ant thi pap docu on extrem in a continu of dens of unicolon invas ant specy and highlight the nee to incorp for dens into invas ant research,new,0.6652254695891447,0.5885314197443067,0.5338520557057422,0.49443837497026916,0.46546933349465164,0.44407008501888184,0.4286362501129328,0.41845129430480815,0.41362921564740796,0.4155129137221979,0.42817516816384793
402,bird_oceanic,Apex marine predator declines ninety percent in association with changing oceanic climate,"Three time series of pelagic bird abundance collected in disparate portions of the California Current reveal a 90% decline in Sooty Shearwater (Puffinus griseus) abundance between 1987 and 1994. This decline is negatively correlated with a concurrent rise in sea-surface temperatures; Sooty Shearwaters have declined while sea temperatures have risen. There is a nine-month lag in the response by shearwaters to changing temperatures. The geographical scale of our study demonstrates that the decline of Sooty Shearwaters is not a localized phenomenon, nor can it be ascribed to a short-term distributional shift. The Sooty Shearwater is the numerically dominant species of the California Current System (CCS) in summer (austral winter), with an estimated population in the late 1970s of 5 million individuals. If the observed warming of the waters of the California Current System is an irreversible manifestation of a changing global climate, then the impact upon Sooty Shearwater populations seems likely to be profound. ¬© 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.",10.1046/j.1365-2486.1997.d01-130.x,2-s2.0-0031005673,6,0.649622936,1,apex marin pred declin nin perc in assocy with chang oc clim three tim sery of pel bird abund collect in disp port of the californ cur rev a declin in sooty shearw puffin grise abund between and thi declin is neg correl with a concur ris in sea surfac temp sooty shearw hav declin whil sea temp hav ris ther is a nin mon lag in the respons by shearw to chang temp the geograph scal of our study demonst that the declin of sooty shearw is not a loc phenomenon nor can it be ascrib to a short term distribut shift the sooty shearw is the num domin specy of the californ cur system ccs in sum aust wint with an estim pop in the lat s of mil individ if the observ warm of the wat of the californ cur system is an irrevers manifest of a chang glob clim then the impact upon sooty shearw pop seem lik to be profound,new,0.6863206674513447,0.6618560685736316,0.6470744845627355,0.6383883917991022,0.6340311157531422,0.6331964218327425,0.6356489689990692,0.641624096625622,0.651953938974372,0.6685638023627877,0.6958735858724228
58,bird_oceanic,"Effects of wildfire on endemic breeding birds in a Pinus canariensis Forest of Tenerife, Canary Islands","Fire is a key ecological force in pine forests worldwide, and faunal responses to this disturbance have been a major topic of ecology, yet little is known for oceanic island environments. Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Friugilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future post-fire management plans.

Our results corroborate earlier suggestions that Long-tailed Ducks exhibit ecological plasticity in selecting winter habitat and food. The majority of Long-tailed Ducks occurred in hard-bottom habitats where they relied on the bivalve Mytilus edulis; however, some of the population wintered in less productive, soft-bottom habitats where they employed a prey-selective foraging strategy, in which they fed on less abundant, but energy rich, crustaceans.

631,bird_oceanic,Multiple links between species diversity and temporal stability in bird communities across North America,"Background: In experimental systems, the temporal stability of entire ecological communities usually increases with the number of species (called 'species richness'). In contrast, ecology has not discovered the pattern of stability with the complement of richness, which is evenness of species abundances. The job has been more difficult because many measures of species diversity combine richness with evenness. Questions: Does the correlation of richness with stability occur in natural systems? What is the relationship of evenness to stability? Does diversity increase or decrease the stability of individual species populations? What mechanisms explain the relationships, if any, between diversity and stability? Data: The 1966-2009 results of 1676 North American Breeding Bird (BBS) survey routes across the USA and Canada. Altogether, 617 bird species were registered with an average of 105 species observed per route. Climate variables were taken from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Climate Services Canada databases. Analytical methods: Disentangle richness from evenness and study their separate effects on stability. Perform statistical analysis of biological variables developed from the BBS data. Control for biological and climatic influences. Results: Both the number of bird species and the evenness of their distributions positively affect the stability of entire bird communities. But richness and evenness do so through a contrasting set of mechanisms. Also, richness and evenness both positively affect the stability of individual populations. The link between evenness and mean population stability can be partly, but not completely, explained in terms of a previously established relationship between the mean and variance of abundance known as Taylor's Law. ¬© 2011.",,2-s2.0-84856941914,22,0.513535748,1,multipl link between specy divers and temp stabl in bird commun across nor americ background in expery system the temp stabl of entir ecolog commun us increas with the numb of specy cal specy rich in contrast ecolog has not discov the pattern of stabl with the compl of rich which is ev of specy abund the job has been mor difficult becaus many meas of specy divers combin rich with ev quest doe the correl of rich with stabl occ in nat system what is the rel of ev to stabl doe divers increas or decreas the stabl of individ specy pop what mech explain the rel if any between divers and stabl dat the result of nor am bree bird bbs survey rout across the us and canad altogeth bird specy wer reg with an av of specy observ per rout clim vary wer tak from the us nat oc and atmosph admin and clim serv canad databas analys method disentangl rich from ev and study their sep effect on stabl perform stat analys of biolog vary develop from the bbs dat control for biolog and clim influ result both the numb of bird specy and the ev of their distribut posit affect the stabl of entir bird commun but rich and ev do so through a contrast set of mech also rich and ev both posit affect the stabl of individ pop the link between ev and mean pop stabl can be part but not complet explain in term of a prevy est rel between the mean and vary of abund known as tayl s law,new,0.5694340707975767,0.5256044677095919,0.49874647968532987,0.48243449165210217,0.4732500626520451,0.4695217637555629,0.47060853460129937,0.4766561315035222,0.4887338495735567,0.5095866523618846,0.5458917001415259
641,bird_oceanic,"Bird communities in two oceanic island forests fragmented by roads on Tenerife, Canary Islands","Although most studies on road effects on birds have been conducted on continental grounds, road fragmentation on oceanic islands is often heavier. We assessed variation in bird communities near (‚â§25 m) and far (>100 m) from forest roads dividing laurel and pine forests on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Line transects were used as the census technique. We compared community structure and species responses between both forests, and among forest interior and edges of paved and unpaved roads. We analysed richness and diversity of species in these different situations, and tested for significance in bird community descriptors and species abundance responses to road proximity. The bird community of the laurel forest showed significantly higher average population density, richness, diversity and evenness than that of the pine forest. None of the two forests showed significant differences in community descriptors between edge and interior, except for a higher evenness along unpaved roads in the laurel forest. However, the bird community showed more overall abundances, richness and diversity on unpaved than on asphalt road edges in laurel forest. Excepting two passerines (Turdus merula in laurel forest and Phylloscopus canariensis in pine forest), all species had similar abundances on road edges and forest interior regardless of forest type. Most species might be regarded as forest generalists. Changes detected between edge and interior on road-fragmented forests were, overall, small at the bird community level. Managers should consider the effects of road edge and road type on the more sensitive species in present and future road planning.

66,bird_oceanic,Ocean circulation off east Antarctica affects ecosystem structure and sea-ice extent,"Sea ice and oceanic boundaries have a dominant effect in structuring Antarctic marine ecosystems. Satellite imagery and historical data have identified the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as a site of enhanced biological productivity. Meso-scale surveys off the Antarctic peninsula have related the abundances of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) to inter-annual variations in sea-ice extent. Here we have examined the ecosystem structure and oceanography spanning 3,500 km of the east Antarctic coastline, linking the scales of local surveys and global observations. Between 80¬∞and 150¬∞E there is a threefold variation in the extent of annual sea-ice cover, enabling us to examine the regional effects of sea ice and ocean circulation on biological productivity. Phytoplankton, primary productivity, Antarctic krill, whales and seabirds were concentrated where winter sea-ice extent is maximal, whereas salps were located where the sea-ice extent is minimal. We found enhanced biological activity south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current rather than in association with it. We propose that along this coastline ocean circulation determines both the sea-ice conditions and the level of biological productivity at all trophic levels.",10.1038/35020053,2-s2.0-0034601473,25,0.50788918,0,oc circ off east antarctic affect ecosystem structure and sea ic ext sea ic and oc bound hav a domin effect in structuring antarct marin ecosystem satellit imagery and hist dat hav ident the southern bound of the antarct circumpol cur as a sit of enh biolog produc meso scal survey off the antarct peninsul hav rel the abund of antarct kril euphaus superb and salp salp thompson to int an vary in sea ic ext her we hav examin the ecosystem structure and oceanograph span km of the east antarct coastlin link the scal of loc survey and glob observ between ¬∞and ¬∞e ther is a threefold vary in the ext of an sea ic cov en us to examin the reg effect of sea ic and oc circ on biolog produc phytoplankton prim produc antarct kril whal and seabird wer cont wher wint sea ic ext is maxim wherea salp wer loc wher the sea ic ext is minim we found enh biolog act sou of the southern bound of the antarct circumpol cur rath than in assocy with it we propos that along thi coastlin oc circ determin both the sea ic condit and the level of biolog produc at al troph level,new,0.5746446722428165,0.44450641166725247,0.36501027095789357,0.31470377763599705,0.28100811078009685,0.25756015201385735,0.2410772459835495,0.22989496903481915,0.22340431110295716,0.22206030972358765,0.22832414026018102
69,bird_oceanic,The pelagic distribution of marine birds in a heterogeneous environment,"In this paper I review recent, small‚Äêscale, process‚Äêoriented studies of the pelagic distribution of marine birds. I examine the roles played by a variety of hydrographic features, including steep flow gradients (fronts) and water column stratification, in determining the abundance or availability of avian prey. The ice edge/marginal ice zone is a frontal area of particular interest in polar regions. In most oceanic systems we have examples of avian use of a feature, hut only poor information on the importance of the feature for supporting the population as a whole. I review recent studies of the spatial and numerical concordance of marine birds and their prey, and find that these studies have yielded mixed results, with correlations stronger for piscivorous birds, particularly murres foraging on capelin, than for planktivores. Review of investigations of multispecies interactions during foraging shows that flock foraging has both beneficial and negative aspects. Interspecific facilitation of foraging occurs in numerous interactions involving both other species of birds and marine mammals. However, co‚Äêoccurrence of predators may occur because both seek the same prey, and caution must be used in assessing mutualistic interactions between predatory species.

711,bird_oceanic,What determines the temporal changes of species degree and strength in an oceanic island plant-disperser network?,"Network models of frugivory and seed dispersal are usually static. To date, most studies on mutualistic networks assert that interaction properties such as species' degree (k) and strength (s) are strongly influenced by species abundances. We evaluated how species' degree and strength change as a function of temporal variation not only in species abundance, but also in species persistence (i.e., phenology length). In a two-year study, we collected community-wide data on seed dispersal by birds and examined the seasonal dynamics of the above-mentioned interaction properties. Our analyses revealed that species abundance is an important predictor for plant strength within a given sub-network. However, our analyses also reveal that species' degree can often be best explained by the length of fruiting phenology (for plants degree) or by the number of fruiting species (for dispersers degree), which are factors that can be decoupled from the relative abundance of the species participating in the network. Moreover, our results suggest that generalist dispersers (when total study period is considered) act as temporal generalists, with degree constrained by the number of plant species displaying fruits in each span. Along with species identity, our findings underscore the need for a temporal perspective, given that seasonality is an inherent property of many mutualistic networks. ¬© 2012 Gonz√°lez-Castro et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0041385,2-s2.0-84864245897,15,0.381473884,0,what determin the temp chang of specy degr and strength in an oc island plant dispers network network model of frug and see dispers ar us stat to dat most study on mut network assert that interact property such as specy degr k and strength s ar strongly influ by specy abund we evalu how specy degr and strength chang as a funct of temp vary not on in specy abund but also in specy persist i e phenolog leng in a two year study we collect commun wid dat on see dispers by bird and examin the season dynam of the abov ment interact property our analys rev that specy abund is an import predict for plant strength within a giv sub network howev our analys also rev that specy degr can oft be best explain by the leng of fruit phenolog for plant degr or by the numb of fruit specy for dispers degr which ar fact that can be decoupl from the rel abund of the specy particip in the network moreov our result suggest that gen dispers when tot study period is consid act as temp gen with degr constrain by the numb of plant specy display fruit in each span along with specy id our find undersc the nee for a temp perspect giv that season is an inh property of many mut network,new,0.3871321261604057,0.34815965510038904,0.3259738207727038,0.3140492380002051,0.3091858039889421,0.31004129407943937,0.3164415330996603,0.32928862868714565,0.35106888883127496,0.3875996955635745,0.45319177456563053

510,bird_palearctic,Seasonal abundance of migrant birds and food resources in panamanian mangrove forests,"We studied temporal variation in abundance of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants, particularly the Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea), and American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) in two black mangrove sites of central Panama from September 1993 through May 1995. The two sites, on the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts, differ importantly in annual rainfall, tide amplitude, and seasonal invertebrate abundance. Most migrant species varied temporally in abundance with the opposite pattern at each site, suggesting mid-winter movements correlated with abundance of food resources. Because of their wide geographic distribution and their particular response to hydrographic factors, mangroves are likely to have a temporally complementary role in sustaining migrant populations throughout the Neptropics. However, variations in migrant numbers reported in other Neotropical habitats could also reflect large-scale movements by migrants.

A mid-monthly counting scheme runs from October to March (all species, both geese and swans), additional counts being organised for Greylag Geese in Semptember and Brent Geese in May (Tab. 1). Prior to 1993, only geese were taken into account whereas census work was mainly undertaken during periods of peak-occurrence of the various species. Seven goose and three swan species occur as regular visitors to The Netherlands. Most abundant species are White-fronted, Greylag, Barnacle and Brent Geese. In all species numbers recorded are of international importance (Tab. 13). Occurrence of Bewick's Swan and Pink-footed, White-fronted, Greylag, Barnacle and Brent Geese highlight the important position of the Netherlands in the West-Palearctic network of flyways. The entire Svalbard population of Pinkfooted Goose stages in the Netherlands in autumn (November). Since the 1960s most species have shown a marked increase (Fig. 2). This trend conforms with overal West-Palearctic trends, often attributed to better protection measures (lower hunting pressure), improvement of feeding habitats in winter and/or changes in flyways. Results of Dutch counts suggest that in most species population growth has levelled off during the 1990s. Fluctuations in numbers over the past decades may be due to severe winter conditions, resulting in an influx of species which regularly winter in the Baltic or eastern Europe (e.g. Whooper Swan, Tundra and Taiga Bean Goose), or in an efflux of birds wintering in The Netherlands to the British Isles and Belgium and northern France (e.g. Bewick's Swan, White-fronted Goose). Since there were no severe winters during 1990/91-1994/95 (Fig. 1), goose and swan numbers as well as seasonal patterns and distribution throughout the country refect the situation in mild winters. The series of mild winters from 1986/87 onwards, eventually may have contributed to increasing numbers of wintering Bewick's Swans and Greylag Geese, whereas numbers of Whooper Swan and Taiga and Tundra Bean Geese have dropped to a lower level as compared to the 1980s.",,2-s2.0-0031669248,51,0.7406984585545779,1,goos and swan numb in the netherland ganz en zwan in nederland in thi pap summ result of goos and swan count in the netherland from through pres inform on numb and perc of first year bird tab trend fig season pattern fig and spat distribut fig a mid month count scheme run from octob to march al specy both gees and swan addit count being org for greyl gees in semptemb and brent gees in may tab pri to on gees wer tak into account wherea cens work was main undertak dur period of peak occur of the vary specy sev goos and three swan specy occ as regul visit to the netherland most abund specy ar whit front greyl barnac and brent gees in al specy numb record ar of intern import tab occur of bewick s swan and pink foot whit front greyl barnac and brent gees highlight the import posit of the netherland in the west palearct network of flyway the entir svalbard pop of pinkfoot goos stag in the netherland in autumn novemb sint the s most specy hav shown a mark increas fig thi trend conform with ov west palearct trend oft attribut to bet protect meas low hunt press improv of fee habit in wint and or chang in flyway result of dutch count suggest that in most specy pop grow has level off dur the s fluctu in numb ov the past decad may be due to sev wint condit result in an influx of specy which regul wint in the balt or eastern europ e g whoop swan tundr and taig bean goos or in an efflux of bird wint in the netherland to the brit isl and belg and northern frant e g bewick s swan whit front goos sint ther wer no sev wint dur fig goos and swan numb as wel as season pattern and distribut throughout the country refect the situ in mild wint the sery of mild wint from onward ev may hav contribut to increas numb of wint bewick s swan and greyl gees wherea numb of whoop swan and taig and tundr bean gees hav drop to a low level as comp to the s,new,0.770802928112026,0.7500346649936624,0.7369428921322059,0.7288219570344051,0.7241932957940025,0.7223285512502678,0.7229664708694781,0.7262254430567482,0.7326920304128804,0.7438068622752877,0.7629716210683649
87,bird_palearctic,"A tropical volcano, high predation pressure, and the breeding biology of Arctic waterbirds: A circumpolar review of breeding failure in the summer of 1992","Although periodic breeding failures of Arctic-nesting birds on a regional scale are common, a breeding failure encompassing almost the entire Arctic in the same year is exceptional. In the spring and summer of 1992, however, the aerosol cloud resulting from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo (Philippines) had reached the high northern latitudes and caused significant cooling in most of the Arctic, with widespread negative consequences for Arctic-breeding birds. At the same time, low abundance of small rodents and high abundance of predators presented additional problems for breeding birds in parts of the Palearctic. We compiled data on breeding biology of Arctic waterfowl and waders from more than 30 field studies to illuminate in what ways the circumpolar bad weather and predation influenced the breeding season of Arctic birds in 1992. Most projects reported a higher proportion of nonbreeders and a delayed onset of nest initiation compared to other years. Hatching and fledging success of the low number of late breeders was reduced. In addition, some projects reported lower clutch sizes and increased adult mortality. Detailed data from field studies are complemented by data on overall reproductive success of waterfowl and wader populations collected from staging and wintering grounds. In total, there was an almost complete reproductive failure for waders and waterfowl throughout the Arctic in 1992, suggesting a short-term effect on global waterbird populations.

107,bird_palearctic,Studies of West Palearctic birds: Turtle dove,"The Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur has declined, in terms of both range and abundance, throughout much of northern Europe over the last 30 years. Until recently, the species was relatively poorly studied in the modern agricultural landscape in Britain. Concerns over its conservation status prompted an intensive research programme to gather information on its breeding ecology, identify the causes of the recent decline and make recommendations to aid its recovery and conservation. Turtle Doves require tall, overgrown bushes for nesting and short weed-rich areas for feeding, but agricultural intensification has markedly reduced the availability and suitability of these habitats. Over the last 40 years, Turtle Doves have switched from foraging in 'natural habitats' to those created by humans, and their diet is now primarily seeds from cultivated plants. The number of chicks fledged per pair per year is today almost half that in the 1960s, while autumn migration has become significantly earlier. Many management options to help to conserve the species can be achieved within the current UK agri-environment policy framework. ¬© British Birds 98.",,2-s2.0-14244269812,19,0.748725055125462,1,study of west palearct bird turtl dov the turtl dov streptopelia turt has declin in term of both rang and abund throughout much of northern europ ov the last year until rec the specy was rel poor study in the modern agricult landscap in britain concern ov it conserv stat prompt an intend research program to gath inform on it bree ecolog ident the caus of the rec declin and mak recommend to aid it recovery and conserv turtl dov requir tal overgrown bush for nest and short wee rich area for fee but agricult intens has mark reduc the avail and suit of thes habit ov the last year turtl dov hav switch from for in nat habit to thos cre by hum and their diet is now prim see from cult plant the numb of chick fledg per pair per year is today almost half that in the s whil autumn migr has becom sign ear many man opt to help to conserv the specy can be achiev within the cur uk agr environ policy framework,new,0.7847877458014038,0.7611914104105376,0.7450410621783167,0.7339544454843083,0.7265179464844169,0.7219838220947686,0.7200426728638347,0.7207481781700261,0.7246010880461137,0.7329148513790831,0.7489117090058818
1110,bird_palearctic,The decline of raptors in West Africa: Long-term assessment and the role of protected areas,"Comparative large-scale roadside counts (8353 km), through Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, conducted in 1969-73, were repeated 30-35 years later with the same observer and methodology and at the same season. The transect was divided into three geographical zones and between protected and unprotected areas. All diurnal raptors were recorded (22 801 individuals), as well as large game birds. Large vultures suffered a dramatic decline (98%) outside protected areas. The Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus population also collapsed in some regions, but survived in central Burkina Faso. Conversely, their abundance index did not decrease significantly in national parks. Four eagle species decreased by 86-93% and seven were not even recorded in the later study outside protected areas; by contrast, in national parks, only three species had declined marginally. Smaller Accipitridae (kites, goshawks, buzzards) also exhibited significant declines outside but not within national parks where woodland species reached their highest densities. The Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, mostly European migrants, declined sharply everywhere. African falcons decreased only outside protected areas. Among Palearctic migrants, Montagu's Circus pygargus and Pallid Harriers C. macrourus decreased significantly, Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus less markedly, and Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus and Booted Eagle Hieraaetus pennatus not at all. Similar trends had previously been documented in Cameroon. They are associated with human population growth and development, global habitat degradation and ecosystem impoverishment (woodcutting, agricultural intensification, overgrazing, desertification). Heavy use of pesticides, control of locust outbreaks and overhunting have suppressed major food sources. Vultures may suffer from a shortage of carcasses, poisoning for predator control or persecution for trade of meat and body parts. Protected areas play a prominent role in the maintenance of vulture and eagle populations, even though they currently cover less than 2% of the Sudan zone and are virtually absent in the Sahel. ¬© 2006 British Ornithologists' Union.",10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00531.x,2-s2.0-33645851938,32,0.8057402488032758,1,the declin of rapt in west afric long term assess and the rol of protect area comp larg scal roadsid count km through burkin faso mal and nig conduc in wer rep year lat with the sam observ and methodolog and at the sam season the transect was divid into three geograph zon and between protect and unprotect area al diurn rapt wer record individ as wel as larg gam bird larg vult suff a dram declin outsid protect area the hood vult necrosyrt monach pop also collaps in som reg but surv in cent burkin faso convers their abund index did not decreas sign in nat park four eagl specy decreas by and sev wer not ev record in the lat study outsid protect area by contrast in nat park on three specy had declin margin smal accipitrida kit goshawk buzzard also exhibit sign declin outsid but not within nat park wher woodland specy reach their highest dens the common kestrel falco tinnuncul most europ migr declin sharply everywh afr falcon decreas on outsid protect area among palearct migr montagu s circ pygarg and pallid harry c macrour decreas sign short toed eagl circaet gallic less mark and marsh harry circ aeruginos and boot eagl hieraaet pennat not at al simil trend had prevy been docu in cameroon they ar assocy with hum pop grow and develop glob habit degrad and ecosystem impov woodcut agricult intens overgraz desert heavy us of pesticid control of locust outbreak and overhunt hav suppress maj food sourc vult may suff from a short of carcass poison for pred control or persecut for trad of meat and body part protect area play a promin rol in the maint of vult and eagl pop ev though they cur cov less than of the sud zon and ar virt abs in the sahel,new,0.8315249362917465,0.8014786482196895,0.7793441735900813,0.7627329237363039,0.7499982942977604,0.7401540756096571,0.7326436106332107,0.7272157401213285,0.7239109282962765,0.7232184477744927,0.7266509490975034

Few post-breeding movements were over 20 km before the end of September. Subsequent- year breeding site fidelity was high in May to August. Migratory T p philomelos moved southwest in autumn on a broad front. Scandinavian and northwest Russian birds moved down the northwest coast of continental Europe arriving in large numbers in southwest France in October; many adults then moved on to winter in west Iberia. Those ringed in central Europe, from Switzerland to Belarus, tended to follow the Rhine‚ÄìRh√¥ne route to the French Mediterranean before dispersing to winter in east Iberia, the Balearics and Algeria. Southeast European birds moved to north and west Italy in the autumn/early winter, many adults moving on to Corsica or Sardinia. Birds breeding in the Netherlands and northwest Germany appear to have two migration patterns. A short-distance group dispersed through Belgium to northwest France in autumn/early winter, moving on to England and Wales in late winter. A long-distance group migrated to southeast Biscay in October, many then moving on in midwinter to west Iberia. Recoveries of birds ringed in the Netherlands and northwest Germany showed a change to a more sedentary population after 1989, raising the possibility that the less migratory T p clarkei has increased in abundance relative to T p philomelos in this area. Subspecific identification would be useful to assess future changes in range boundaries of philomelos and clarkei within northern Europe. ¬© 2006 British Trust for Ornithology.",10.1080/03078698.2006.9674340,2-s2.0-33745113749,24,0.78888457536,0,post bree dispers bree sit fidel and migr wint area of migr pop of song thrush turd philomelo in the western palearct song thrush turd philomelo ring recovery dat gath ov year in cent nor and east europ wer analys in their bree zon and in migr wint area in europ nor afric and the near east few post bree mov wer ov km bef the end of septemb subsequ year bree sit fidel was high in may to august migr t p philomelo mov southwest in autumn on a broad front scandinav and northwest russ bird mov down the northwest coast of contin europ ar in larg numb in southwest frant in octob many adult then mov on to wint in west iber thos ring in cent europ from switzerland to belar tend to follow the rhine‚äìrh√¥n rout to the french mediter bef dispers to wint in east iber the balear and alger southeast europ bird mov to nor and west ita in the autumn ear wint many adult mov on to corsic or sardin bird bree in the netherland and northwest germany appear to hav two migr pattern a short dist group dispers through belg to northwest frant in autumn ear wint mov on to england and wal in lat wint a long dist group migr to southeast biscay in octob many then mov on in midwint to west iber recovery of bird ring in the netherland and northwest germany show a chang to a mor sed pop aft rais the poss that the less migr t p clarke has increas in abund rel to t p philomelo in thi are subspec id would be us to assess fut chang in rang bound of philomelo and clarke within northern europ,new,0.8293169129752634,0.7840274735881094,0.7480856246462984,0.7196352933410444,0.696766804636601,0.6781280026669739,0.6628425264857732,0.6503899758674788,0.6405616172194922,0.633526248172287,0.6302238124030457

Up to now, available information has indicated that the species only occurs in small numbers in this area (maximum four nests found in 1966). In 2001 and 2002 high abundances of small rodents were observed at Hardangervidda. We then found 12 and 9 nesting pairs of Long-tailed Skuas, respectively. In addition, one nest was found by other observers in both years, and several birds were observed in areas that we did not manage to cover, suggesting that at least 15 pairs may have bred in 2001. The whole area was not covered in 2002, but observations of clutch size and nest density indicated similar numbers of breeding pairs. Most breeding pairs were in both years concentrated within an area of about 20 km2. The density here was similar to what is reported from more central parts of the species range in Fennoscandia (mean neighbouring distance = 815 m, 0.83 pairs/km2; Fig. 2). No birds were observed at all in 2003, probably due to very low small rodent abundance, although the area was only visited once this summer.

157,bird_palearctic,"Influence of climate change on the abundance, distribution and phenology of woodland bird species in temperate regions","There is now overwhelming evidence that an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere has caused global temperatures to increase by 0.6¬∞C since 1900 and further increases of between 1.4 and 5.8¬∞C are predicted over the next century. Changes in climatic conditions have already influenced the demography, phenology and distribution of a wide range of plant and animal taxa. This review focuses on the impacts, both observed and potential, of climate change on birds breeding in temperate woodlands of the Western Palaearctic, a significant proportion of which are currently declining. Changes in ambient temperatures and patterns of precipitation may have direct and indirect effects on the survival rates and productivity of bird species, thus influencing population sizes. For some species or populations, the timing of events such as egg-laying and return from the wintering grounds is also changing in relation to shifts in the peak of food availability during the breeding season. The degree to which different individuals are able to track these temporal changes will have a significant bearing on population sizes and distributions in the future. Unless active management steps are taken, the relatively low dispersal rates of tree species may lead to a decrease in the total area of some woodland habitat types as losses at the southern edge of the range are likely to occur much more quickly than expansion at the northern edge. In addition, the dispersal rates of many woodland birds are themselves low, which could affect their ability to move to new habitat patches if currently occupied areas become unsuitable. Thus, woodland birds may be particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00729.x,2-s2.0-36448972743,10,0.712234162784413,1,influ of clim chang on the abund distribut and phenolog of woodland bird specy in temp reg ther is now overwhelm evid that an increas in the cont of greenh gas in the ear s atmosph has caus glob temp to increas by ¬∞c sint and furth increas of between and ¬∞c ar predict ov the next century chang in clim condit hav already influ the demograph phenolog and distribut of a wid rang of plant and anim tax thi review focus on the impact both observ and pot of clim chang on bird bree in temp woodland of the western palaearct a sign proport of which ar cur declin chang in amby temp and pattern of precipit may hav direct and indirect effect on the surv rat and produc of bird specy thu influ pop siz for som specy or pop the tim of ev such as eg lay and return from the wint ground is also chang in rel to shift in the peak of food avail dur the bree season the degr to which diff individ ar abl to track thes temp chang wil hav a sign bear on pop siz and distribut in the fut unless act man step ar tak the rel low dispers rat of tre specy may lead to a decreas in the tot are of som woodland habit typ as loss at the southern edg of the rang ar lik to occ much mor quick than expand at the northern edg in addit the dispers rat of many woodland bird ar themselv low which could affect their abl to mov to new habit patch if cur occupy area becom unsuit thu woodland bird may be particul suscept to the impact of clim chang,new,0.7736658394637298,0.7275476521440467,0.6929821743438057,0.6669337119621591,0.6471120781633485,0.6320770625701111,0.6209903358283468,0.6134653778569954,0.6095484614691938,0.6099220062552567,0.6166271147015572
167,bird_palearctic,"Patterns of density, diversity, and the distribution of migratory strategies in the Russian boreal forest avifauna","Aim: Comparisons of the biotas in the Palaearctic and Nearctic have focused on limited portions of the two regions. The purpose of this study was to assess the geographic pattern in the abundance, species richness, and importance of different migration patterns of the boreal forest avifauna of Eurasia from Europe to East Asia as well as their relationship to climate and forest productivity. We further examine data from two widely separated sites in the New World to see how these conform to the patterns found in the Eurasian system. Location: Boreal forest sites in Russia and Canada. Methods: Point counts were conducted in two to four boreal forest habitats at each of 14 sites in the Russian boreal forest from near to the Finnish border to the Far East, as well as at two sites in boreal Canada. We examined the abundance and species richness of all birds, and specific migratory classes, against four gradients (climate, primary productivity, latitude, and longitude). We tested for spatial autocorrelation in both dependent and independent variables using Moran's I to develop spatial correlograms. For each migratory class we used maximum likelihood to fit models, first assuming uncorrelated residuals and then assuming spatially autocorrelated residuals. For models assuming unstructured residuals we again generated correlograms on model residuals to determine whether model fitting removed spatial autocorrelation. Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion, adjusted for small sample size. Results: Overall abundance was highest at the eastern and western extremes of the survey region and lowest at the continent centre, whereas the abundance of tropical and short-distance migrants displayed an east-west gradient, with tropical migrants increasing in abundance in the east (and south), and short-distance migrants in the west. Although overall species richness showed no geographic pattern, richness within migratory classes showed patterns weaker than, but similar to, their abundance patterns described above. Overall abundance was correlated with climate variables that relate to continentality. The abundances of birds within different migration strategies were correlated with a second climatic gradient - increasing precipitation from west to east. Models using descriptors of location generally had greater explanatory value for the abundance and species-richness response variables than did those based on climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Main conclusions: The distribution patterns for migrant types were related to both climatic and locational variables, and thus the patterns could be explained by either climatic regime or the accessibility of winter habitats, both historically and currently. Non-boreal wintering habitat is more accessible from both the western and eastern ends than from the centre of the boreal forest belt, but the tropics are most accessible from the eastern end of the Palaearctic boreal zone, in terms of distance and the absence of geographical barriers. Based on comparisons with Canadian sites, we recommend that future comparative studies between Palaearctic and Nearctic faunas be focused more on Siberia and the Russian Far East, as well as on central and western Canada.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01954.x,2-s2.0-53949112445,15,0.598347449209879,0,pattern of dens divers and the distribut of migr strategies in the russ bor forest avifaun aim comparison of the biota in the palaearct and nearct hav focus on limit port of the two reg the purpos of thi study was to assess the geograph pattern in the abund specy rich and import of diff migr pattern of the bor forest avifaun of euras from europ to east as as wel as their rel to clim and forest produc we furth examin dat from two wid sep sit in the new world to see how thes conform to the pattern found in the euras system loc bor forest sit in russ and canad method point count wer conduc in two to four bor forest habit at each of sit in the russ bor forest from near to the fin bord to the far east as wel as at two sit in bor canad we examin the abund and specy rich of al bird and spec migr class against four grady clim prim produc latitud and longitud we test for spat autocorrel in both depend and independ vary us mor s i to develop spat correlogram for each migr class we us maxim lik to fit model first assum uncorrel resid and then assum spat autocorrel resid for model assum unstruct resid we again gen correlogram on model resid to determin wheth model fit remov spat autocorrel model wer comp us akaik s inform crit adjust for smal sampl siz result overal abund was highest at the eastern and western extrem of the survey reg and lowest at the contin cent wherea the abund of trop and short dist migr display an east west grady with trop migr increas in abund in the east and sou and short dist migr in the west although overal specy rich show no geograph pattern rich within migr class show pattern weak than but simil to their abund pattern describ abov overal abund was correl with clim vary that rel to contin the abund of bird within diff migr strategies wer correl with a second clim grady increas precipit from west to east model us describ of loc gen had gre expl valu for the abund and specy rich respons vary than did thos bas on clim dat and the norm diff veget index ndvi main conclud the distribut pattern for migr typ wer rel to both clim and loc vary and thu the pattern could be explain by eith clim regim or the access of wint habit both hist and cur non bor wint habit is mor access from both the western and eastern end than from the cent of the bor forest belt but the trop ar most access from the eastern end of the palaearct bor zon in term of dist and the abs of geograph barry bas on comparison with canad sit we recommend that fut comp study between palaearct and nearct fauna be focus mor on siber and the russ far east as wel as on cent and western canad,new,0.7037557943866087,0.614316710960102,0.5480787918103232,0.4988026235157738,0.4611757653310825,0.4317395952841587,0.4083114391692196,0.38950968186842116,0.37446955730160103,0.362727526490978,0.3542183274876048
176,bird_palearctic,"Elevational range and timing of breeding in the birds of Ladakh: The effects of body mass, status and diet","We studied the effects of body mass, status (resident or migratory) and diet on the breeding elevation range and timing of reproduction of the birds in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh, northwestern India. Most of breeding birds of Ladakh are Palearctic or breed at high elevations in the mountains. There is a small proportion of Oriental species, and no bird is endemic to this region. We found that heavier birds tended to start their egg-laying earlier than lighter ones. Since body mass is related to the length of incubation and nesting periods, it would appear that one result of this phenomenon is that the time of peak demand for food for most birds coincides with peak food abundance in summer. Status affected the elevation of the breeding range, with resident birds tending to breed at higher elevations than summer visitors. Residents and summer breeders also differed significantly in their diet composition, with the former feeding mainly on plants and seeds, and the latter feeding on molluscs, insects and worms. ¬© Dt.

186,bird_palearctic,Independent colonization of multiple urban centres by a formerly forest specialist bird species,"Urban areas are expanding rapidly, but a few native species have successfully colonized them. The processes underlying such colonization events are poorly understood. Using the blackbird Turdus merula, a former forest specialist that is now one of the most common urban birds in its range, we provide the first assessment of two contrasting urban colonization models. First, that urbanization occurred independently. Second, that following initial urbanization, urban-adapted individuals colonized other urban areas in a leapfrog manner. Previous analyses of spatial patterns in the timing of blackbird urbanization, and experimental introductions of urban and rural blackbirds to uncolonized cities, suggest that the leapfrog model is likely to apply. We found that, across the western Palaearctic, urban blackbird populations contain less genetic diversity than rural ones, urban populations are more strongly differentiated from each other than from rural populations and assignment tests support a rural source population for most urban individuals. In combination, these results provide much stronger support for the independent urbanization model than the leapfrog one. If the former model predominates, colonization of multiple urban centres will be particularly difficult when urbanization requires genetic adaptations, having implications for urban species diversity. ¬© 2009 The Royal Society.",10.1098/rspb.2008.1712,2-s2.0-66749116754,12,0.39009999203315204,0,independ colon of multipl urb cent by a form forest spec bird specy urb area ar expand rapid but a few nat specy hav success colon them the process und such colon ev ar poor understood us the blackbird turd merul a form forest spec that is now on of the most common urb bird in it rang we provid the first assess of two contrast urb colon model first that urb occur independ second that follow init urb urb adapt individ colon oth urb area in a leapfrog man prevy analys of spat pattern in the tim of blackbird urb and expery introduc of urb and rur blackbird to uncolon city suggest that the leapfrog model is lik to apply we found that across the western palaearct urb blackbird pop contain less genet divers than rur on urb pop ar mor strongly differenty from each oth than from rur pop and assign test support a rur sourc pop for most urb individ in combin thes result provid much stronger support for the independ urb model than the leapfrog on if the form model predomin colon of multipl urb cent wil be particul difficult when urb requir genet adapt hav imply for urb specy divers,new,0.37276951135840547,0.34317151449201405,0.32746094536786163,0.32012399611243747,0.3186880004783302,0.32223049145563143,0.3307966994848341,0.34535654450839337,0.3682749314410371,0.4048434808780805,0.46767124641410335
196,bird_palearctic,"Marsh management, reserve creation, hunting periods and carrying capacity for wintering ducks and coots","Many wild species, like waterbirds, are exploited for their economic interests. At present, the annual western Palearctic duck bag is at least 17 million birds. From a sustainable management perspective, wetland users and managers request predictions of spatial distribution and abundance variations of these bird populations. The objective of this study was to analyze local factors potentially influencing the diurnal distribution and population size of wintering ducks and coots, the main game species, in Camargue (southern France). First, we showed that marshland surface area, salinity and hunting disturbance were the principal variables explaining the duck and coot distribution. Secondly, we tested the hypothesis that hunting disturbance would reduce the carrying capacity of the Camargue with two analyses: the effect of creating a protected area and the change of the hunting closing date. This hypothesis was not validated. Our study therefore led us to reconsider the research orientations on the carrying capacity in this wetland. The surface of protected day roosts seems presently sufficient in the Rhone delta. Consequently, to increase the population size with the same level of hunting disturbance at the scale of the Camargue, alternative strategies should be envisaged, such as the creation of nature reserves on nocturnal feeding ground or the creation of large management units with limited disturbance. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10531-008-9562-6,2-s2.0-67649333129,21,0.668614755809502,0,marsh man reserv cre hunt period and carry capac for wint duck and coot many wild specy lik waterbird ar exploit for their econom interest at pres the an western palearct duck bag is at least mil bird from a sustain man perspect wetland us and man request predict of spat distribut and abund vary of thes bird pop the object of thi study was to analys loc fact pot influ the diurn distribut and pop siz of wint duck and coot the main gam specy in camargu southern frant first we show that marshland surfac are salin and hunt disturb wer the princip vary explain the duck and coot distribut second we test the hypothes that hunt disturb would reduc the carry capac of the camargu with two analys the effect of cre a protect are and the chang of the hunt clos dat thi hypothes was not valid our study theref led us to reconsid the research ory on the carry capac in thi wetland the surfac of protect day roost seem pres sufficy in the rhon delt consequ to increas the pop siz with the sam level of hunt disturb at the scal of the camargu altern strategies should be env such as the cre of nat reserv on nocturn fee ground or the cre of larg man unit with limit disturb,new,0.7088036685333069,0.6557909316036874,0.6176261828453505,0.5898819452008714,0.5694981400451733,0.554662477321852,0.5443957217368744,0.5383338272525449,0.5367347757202355,0.5408323802916944,0.5540607937917243

Using GIS and Distance Sampling methodologies, the population on Fuerteventura in 2008 was estimated at 1, 035 birds (832-1, 287) with the species more abundant on hillsides than in gullies. Within the island's three main massifs (i.e. north, west and south) the highest encounter rate was recorded in the northern massif. This study supports the category of 'Endangered' for this species, which does face the obvious threat from development, particularly in the south of the island. The species is also on the endangered list nationally (Spain) and in Europe but has not as yet been evaluated by the Canarian Government. I suggest, based on results of this study, that serious effort should be put in to improving knowledge of the distribution range of this endemic (either by modelling or by systematic visits to sites). An official monitoring programme should be developed and implemented with special attention paid to the three main mountain ranges of this island and particularly to the southern massif which is suffering the highest rate of habitat loss. ¬© 2009 BirdLife International.",10.1017/S0959270908008289,2-s2.0-67749094912,16,0.7832061517843321,0,the stat of the fuerteventur stonech saxicol dacotia a new evalu us dist sampl and gis the stat of the endang fuerteventur stonech saxicol dacotia a western palearct singl island endem was assess year aft the first pop estim of individ was mad by bibby and hil us gis and dist sampl methodolog the pop on fuerteventur in was estim at bird with the specy mor abund on hillsid than in gul within the island s three main mass i e nor west and sou the highest encount rat was record in the northern mass thi study support the categ of endang for thi specy which doe fac the obvy threat from develop particul in the sou of the island the specy is also on the endang list nat spain and in europ but has not as yet been evalu by the can govern i suggest bas on result of thi study that sery effort should be put in to improv knowledg of the distribut rang of thi endem eith by model or by system visit to sit an off monit program should be develop and impl with spec at paid to the three main mountain rang of thi island and particul to the southern mass which is suff the highest rat of habit loss,new,0.8031597528932415,0.7467462353735792,0.7031349131749305,0.6695570833907626,0.6432389724543984,0.6223063976453225,0.6056077198767998,0.5925185562932843,0.5828911120308854,0.577204629534624,0.5772974412910896
2110,bird_palearctic,"Temporal changes to spatially stratified waterbird communities of the Coorong, South Australia: Implications for the management of heterogenous wetlands","The Coorong, South Australia, is a globally significant wetland system, listed in the Ramsar Convention under a number of different criteria, including its importance to waterbird populations. Based on annual waterbird censuses conducted between 2000 and 2007, spatiotemporal analyses revealed that significant differences in waterbird community structure exist along the length of the Coorong. This spatial diversity in community structure was also found to be temporally consistent over this 8-year period. The abundance of the most numerically dominant bird species, such as red-necked stint Calidris ruficollis and grey teal Anas gracilis, explained much of this spatial variation. However, comparisons between data collected for the Coorong south lagoon in 1985 and 2000-2007 show that dramatic changes in these waterbird communities have occurred over longer periods of time, with 23 of the 27 most common species having declined in this period by at least 30%. The Coorong still regularly supports globally important populations (>1% of global population) of nine waterbird taxa, including three Palearctic shorebirds, confirming its Ramsar status. The functional links between the overutilized Murray-Darling basin river system and the Coorong are discussed. ¬© 2009 The Authors.

236,bird_palearctic,Changes in Sahelian bird biodiversity and tree density over a five-year period in northern Nigeria,"Capsule Two widespread censuses of already degraded woodland in the Sahel in Northern Nigeria separated by five years (2002 and 2007) showed relatively small further changes in tree and bird density. Aims To determine how change in tree density affects African and Palearctic migrant bird density in already degraded Sahelian woodland. Methods We compared differences in the number of bird species and their abundance with differences in the size and number of woody plants between two seasons separated by five years at 16 degraded woodland sites across 250 km east-west in northern Nigeria. Results Densities of large trees (>5 m) decreased, but densities of smaller trees and shrubs increased, partly as a consequence of growth and because larger trees have been preferentially removed or partly cut down; tree densities were, however, initially low. Of 37 common bird species, 16% had higher densities and 22% had lower densities, in the second study period. The density of Common Whitethroats, Northern Wheatears and Yellow Wagtails was correlated with the number and size of trees, but not that of Lesser Whitethroat and Subalpine Warbler. Overall there was relatively little turnover in species between the two surveys and if (the initially low) tree density was halved, only approximately 2.1% of the average total for number of bird species per 0.2 ha point would be lost. Conclusion Few large changes in bird species' density were found, possibly because: (1) all habitats sampled were already at relatively low tree density - initial reductions from high tree density or near removal of all trees may cause larger changes in local bird densities; (2) reduction in the number of large trees was partially compensated by a more lush development of the vegetation as a whole in the second study period; and (3) the bird species remaining in degraded Sahelian woodland in northern Nigeria are already well adapted to habitat change and low tree density. ¬© 2010 British Trust for Ornithology.",10.1080/00063650903469514,2-s2.0-77953986692,30,0.7704859775499331,1,chang in sahel bird biodivers and tre dens ov a fiv year period in northern niger caps two widespread census of already degrad woodland in the sahel in northern niger sep by fiv year and show rel smal furth chang in tre and bird dens aim to determin how chang in tre dens affect afr and palearct migr bird dens in already degrad sahel woodland method we comp diff in the numb of bird specy and their abund with diff in the siz and numb of woody plant between two season sep by fiv year at degrad woodland sit across km east west in northern niger result dens of larg tre m decreas but dens of smal tre and shrubs increas part as a consequ of grow and becaus larg tre hav been pref remov or part cut down tre dens wer howev init low of common bird specy had high dens and had low dens in the second study period the dens of common whitethro northern wheatear and yellow wagtail was correl with the numb and siz of tre but not that of less whitethro and subalpin warbl overal ther was rel littl turnov in specy between the two survey and if the init low tre dens was halv on approxim of the av tot for numb of bird specy per ha point would be lost conclud few larg chang in bird specy dens wer found poss becaus al habit sampl wer already at rel low tre dens init reduc from high tre dens or near remov of al tre may caus larg chang in loc bird dens reduc in the numb of larg tre was part compens by a mor lush develop of the veget as a whol in the second study period and the bird specy remain in degrad sahel woodland in northern niger ar already wel adapt to habit chang and low tre dens,new,0.8114010171337662,0.7543509810222364,0.7096398462586458,0.6746187199368868,0.6466662238450774,0.6239817332832075,0.6054166153712237,0.5902921518567846,0.5783184113434149,0.569666545929466,0.5653044269416264
246,bird_palearctic,Spatial heterogeneity in distribution and ecology of Western Palearctic birds,"Species vary in abundance and heterogeneity of spatial distribution, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such variability are poorly known. Evolutionary adaptation to heterogeneously distributed resources may arise from local adaptation with individuals of such locally adapted populations rarely dispersing long distances and hence having small populations and small overall ranges. We quantified mean population density and spatial heterogeneity in population density of 197 bird species across 12 similarly sized regions in the Western Palearctic. Variance in population density among regions differed significantly from a Poisson distribution, suggesting that random processes cannot explain the observed patterns. National estimates of means and variances in population density were positively correlated with continental estimates, suggesting that means and variances were maintained across spatial scales. We used Morisita's index of population abundance as an estimate of heterogeneity in distribution among regions to test a number of predictions. Heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species as reflected, by Morisita's index had small populations, low population densities, and small breeding ranges. Their breeding populations had been consistently maintained at low levels for considerable periods of time, because the degree of genetic variation in a subsample of non-passerines and passerines was significantly negatively related to heterogeneity in distribution. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species were not more often habitat specialists than homogeneously distributed species. Furthermore, heterogeneously distributed passerine species had high annual adult survival rates but did not differ in annual fecundity from homogeneously distributed species. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species rarely colonized urban habitats. Finally, homogeneously distributed bird species were hosts to a greater diversity of blood parasite species than heterogeneously distributed species. In conclusion, small breeding ranges, population sizes, and population densities of heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species, combined with their low degree of genetic variability, and their inability to colonize urban areas may render such species particularly susceptible to human-influenced global climatic changes. ¬© 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/09-1300.1,2-s2.0-77956587575,6,0.700926082866016,0,spat heterog in distribut and ecolog of western palearct bird specy vary in abund and heterog of spat distribut and the ecolog and evolv consequ of such vary ar poor known evolv adapt to heterog distribut resourc may ar from loc adapt with individ of such loc adapt pop rar dispers long dist and hent hav smal pop and smal overal rang we quant mean pop dens and spat heterog in pop dens of bird specy across simil siz reg in the western palearct vary in pop dens among reg diff sign from a poisson distribut suggest that random process cannot explain the observ pattern nat estim of mean and vary in pop dens wer posit correl with contin estim suggest that mean and vary wer maintain across spat scal we us morisit s index of pop abund as an estim of heterog in distribut among reg to test a numb of predict heterog distribut passerin bird specy as reflect by morisit s index had smal pop low pop dens and smal bree rang their bree pop had been consist maintain at low level for consid period of tim becaus the degr of genet vary in a subsampl of non passerin and passerin was sign neg rel to heterog in distribut heterog distribut passerin specy wer not mor oft habit spec than homog distribut specy furtherm heterog distribut passerin specy had high an adult surv rat but did not diff in an fecund from homog distribut specy heterog distribut passerin specy rar colon urb habit fin homog distribut bird specy wer host to a gre divers of blood parasit specy than heterog distribut specy in conclud smal bree rang pop siz and pop dens of heterog distribut passerin bird specy combin with their low degr of genet vary and their in to colon urb area may rend such specy particul suscept to hum influ glob clim chang,new,0.7550266253954583,0.6794120223715565,0.6210308786181447,0.5759057027316076,0.5401849272375598,0.5112077418556343,0.4872064201629369,0.4669815482516375,0.4496763875333018,0.4346252791564115,0.421261815431065
265,bird_palearctic,Rapid recovery of a depleted population of Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax following provision of alfalfa through an agri-environment scheme,"The Little Bustard has undergone a steep reduction of its Western Palaearctic range over the last century. In the west of France, breeding populations declined by 96% from 1978 to 2008 in cultivated areas where grasslands have been converted into intensively managed annual crops. Little Bustard abundance and nest productivity have been monitored since 1995 in a 450-km2 site in western France. We assessed the proximate causes of the decline of Little Bustards in French farming landscapes and quantified the effectiveness of conservation measures that aimed to reverse the decline. The decline of Little Bustard, from about 65 males in 1995 to just six males in 2003, could be related to a near absence of recruitment over this period. Since 2004, the establishment of more than 1300 ha of specifically targeted agri-environment schemes (AES) in the study site has led to a sharp increase in female productivity, mainly associated with nesting in AES fields. By imposing constraints on mowing dates, AES have prevented nest destruction and female mortality during mowing and, by increasing plant species diversity, provided chicks with a higher abundance of grasshoppers.

275,bird_palearctic,Comparing spatial rarity between long distance migrant and sedentary bird species using atlas data and diversity/dominance diagrams,"Analyses using the spatial frequency of species occurrences, as obtained by faunal atlases, allows us to obtain information on assembly rules of local bird assemblages. Here, diversity/dominance diagrams have been used to relate the structural differences in two phenology-based assemblages (i.e. sedentary species and long distance migrants) obtained by an occurrence data set throughout a local breeding bird atlas in an Apennine nature reserve of Central Italy. Among the 58 breeding bird species sampled, 28 % were long distance migrants. On the average, long distance migrants were spatially rarer when compared to sedentary species. In diversity/dominance diagrams, sedentary species show a trend similar to that obtained by the entire community (broken-stick pattern), while long distance migrants have a curve with slope tending to fit geometrically. Geometric species models show steep plots and are typical of assemblages with high relative dominance, low evenness and few species (in our case, the long distance migrants). Moving from geometric series towards a broken-stick model, the assemblages tend to be even more species rich (in our case, the sedentary species). In a Palearctic bird community, long distance migrants are generally rarer in abundance and spatial distribution when compared to sedentary species. A different phenology may imply differences in species evolution, history and ecology with consequences for abundance, distribution and rarity patterns. In our study area, patterns of spatial occurrences evidenced by diversity/dominance curves may be due to the influence of long-term history, short-term competition and local disturbances that differentiated the two phenologic sub-assemblages.",,2-s2.0-79958122750,13,0.491379688363043,0,comp spat rar between long dist migr and sed bird specy us atla dat and divers domin diagram analys us the spat frequ of specy occur as obtain by faun atlas allow us to obtain inform on assembl rul of loc bird assembl her divers domin diagram hav been us to rel the structural diff in two phenolog bas assembl i e sed specy and long dist migr obtain by an occur dat set throughout a loc bree bird atla in an apennin nat reserv of cent ita among the bree bird specy sampl wer long dist migr on the av long dist migr wer spat rar when comp to sed specy in divers domin diagram sed specy show a trend simil to that obtain by the entir commun brok stick pattern whil long dist migr hav a curv with slop tend to fit geomet geomet specy model show steep plot and ar typ of assembl with high rel domin low ev and few specy in our cas the long dist migr mov from geomet sery toward a brok stick model the assembl tend to be ev mor specy rich in our cas the sed specy in a palearct bird commun long dist migr ar gen rar in abund and spat distribut when comp to sed specy a diff phenolog may imply diff in specy evolv hist and ecolog with consequ for abund distribut and rar pattern in our study are pattern of spat occur evid by divers domin curv may be due to the influ of long term hist short term competit and loc disturb that differenty the two phenolog sub assembl,new,0.5894324695546063,0.5323717505280187,0.4959229529997718,0.4721871381350993,0.4567532243964105,0.4473505007372643,0.44291843360695754,0.44322525461200096,0.4488806269074689,0.4618822137380485,0.48744794267631436

306,bird_palearctic,Density and behaviour of Whinchats Saxicola rubetra on African farmland suggest that winter habitat conditions do not limit European breeding populations,"The Whinchat Saxicola rubetra is an Afro-Palaearctic migrant undergoing widespread population decline. Whinchats winter in West Africa but there are almost no data on their habitat use and behaviour there that may help to explain the cause of this decline. We measured the density of Whinchats, the habitat characteristics associated with their occurrence on farmland, and the relationships between behavioural and habitat variation on farmland around Jos, central Nigeria, over three winters. Whinchats occurred in many fields harvested in the dry season, the density at three sites varying from 0.03 to 0.43 birds/ha, but they were absent at a fourth site. Whinchats were less likely to be found in farmland without particular crops (e.g. structural stem crops such as maize and millet), with more trees, lower amounts of short vegetation (grass, weeds, crops and crop stubble less than 10 cm in height), and higher amounts of medium vegetation (coverage of vegetation 10-100 cm in height) and litter (dead, unburned, vegetation on the ground). Whinchat abundance in areas of farmland where they were present was independent of most variables considered, but density was higher where there was more short vegetation cover. Foraging behaviour did not vary significantly between farmland habitats. All predictors were consistent between season, years and across sites. The presence/absence model was very poor at predicting presence and there were no strong predictors of abundance or foraging variation. This is consistent with a species well below carrying capacity within its environment so that many suitable areas do not have birds present and there is little aggregation at better sites. Overall, Whinchats were abundant and appeared to have plentiful habitat; densities have probably increased alongside the intensification of agriculture (presence of fallow farmland, short vegetation and structural crops). The results suggest that West African farmland in the dry season can support large numbers of Whinchats and that recent population declines in Europe are unlikely to be caused primarily by lack of suitable wintering habitat. ¬© 2012 The Authors Ibis ¬© 2012 British Ornithologists' Union.",10.1111/j.1474-919X.2012.01258.x,2-s2.0-84866437055,14,0.7745887378199549,1,dens and behavio of whinch saxicol rubetr on afr farmland suggest that wint habit condit do not limit europ bree pop the whinch saxicol rubetr is an afro palaearct migr undergo widespread pop declin whinch wint in west afric but ther ar almost no dat on their habit us and behavio ther that may help to explain the caus of thi declin we meas the dens of whinch the habit charact assocy with their occur on farmland and the rel between behavio and habit vary on farmland around jos cent niger ov three wint whinch occur in many field harvest in the dry season the dens at three sit vary from to bird ha but they wer abs at a four sit whinch wer less lik to be found in farmland without particul crop e g structural stem crop such as maiz and millet with mor tre low amount of short veget grass wee crop and crop stubbl less than cm in height and high amount of med veget cov of veget cm in height and lit dead unburn veget on the ground whinch abund in area of farmland wher they wer pres was independ of most vary consid but dens was high wher ther was mor short veget cov for behavio did not vary sign between farmland habit al predict wer consist between season year and across sit the pres abs model was very poor at predict pres and ther wer no strong predict of abund or for vary thi is consist with a specy wel below carry capac within it environ so that many suit area do not hav bird pres and ther is littl aggreg at bet sit overal whinch wer abund and appear to hav plenty habit dens hav prob increas alongsid the intens of agricult pres of fallow farmland short veget and structural crop the result suggest that west afr farmland in the dry season can support larg numb of whinch and that rec pop declin in europ ar unlik to be caus prim by lack of suit wint habit,new,0.8153281820446918,0.7609693899452685,0.7177159425033309,0.68304671322087,0.6545819754441222,0.6306614944721769,0.6101626158424421,0.592308666566582,0.5765340991933336,0.5623872402212254,0.5494339933907744
3110,bird_palearctic,"Breeding waders on Kolguev Island, Barents Sea, N Russia, 2006-2008","Kolguev Island in the Barents Sea, N Russia, has no rodents; as a consequence it has a relatively small predator population, which is most beneficial to the breeding success of birds. As a consequence it is an area of outstanding importance for waders, not only in the Western Palearctic but also across the entire Arctic region. Until recently, knowledge of the breeding birds of Kolguev was limited to the results of a small number of ornithological expeditions that took place mostly in the early 1900s. During the three summers 2006-2008, a Russian-German team undertook a series of expeditions to investigate the bird populations of the entire island. Here we present the results of these expeditions in respect the breeding status, abundance, distribution and population trends of waders, and report on some aspects of their breeding biology. We found 15 breeding wader species of which Dunlin Calidris alpina, Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres showed a decline between 1994-1995 and 2006-2008 while numbers of Grey Plovers Pluvialis squatarola appeared to be stable. In contrast Eurasian Golden Plovers P. apricaria which were rare in 1994 are now breeding regularly. Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Jack Snipe Lymnocryptes minimus and Eurasian Dotterel Eudromias morinellus were confirmed as breeding species, but these might have been overlooked in earlier years.

353,bird_palearctic,Recent population declines in Afro-Palaearctic migratory birds: The influence of breeding and non-breeding seasons,"Aim: Recent, rapid population declines in many Afro-Palaearctic migratory bird species have focussed attention on changing conditions within Africa. However, processes influencing population change can operate throughout the annual cycle and throughout migratory ranges. Here, we explore the evidence for impacts of breeding and non-breeding conditions on population trends of British breeding birds of varying migratory status and wintering ecology. Location: Great Britain (England & Scotland). Methods: Within- and between-species variation in population trends is quantified for 46 bird species with differing migration strategies. Results: Between 1994 and 2007, rates of population change in Scotland and England differed significantly for 19 resident and 15 long-distance migrant species, but were similar for 12 short-distance migrant species. Of the six long-distance migrant species that winter in the arid zone of Africa, five are increasing in abundance throughout Britain. In contrast, the seven species wintering in the humid zone of Africa are all declining in England, but five of these are increasing in Scotland. Consequently, populations of both arid and humid zone species are increasing significantly faster in Scotland than England, and only the English breeding populations of species wintering in the humid zone are declining. Main conclusions: Population declines in long-distance migrants, especially those wintering in the humid zone, but not residents or short-distance migrants suggest an influence of non-breeding season conditions on population trends. However, the consistently less favourable population trends in England than Scotland of long-distance migrant and resident species strongly suggest that variation in the quality of breeding grounds is influencing recent population changes. The declines in humid zone species in England, but not Scotland, may result from poorer breeding conditions in England exacerbating the impacts of non-breeding conditions or the costs associated with a longer migration, while better conditions in Scotland may be buffering these impacts. ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/ddi.12084,2-s2.0-84880132206,17,0.81808939910071,1,rec pop declin in afro palaearct migr bird the influ of bree and non bree season aim rec rapid pop declin in many afro palaearct migr bird specy hav focuss at on chang condit within afric howev process influ pop chang can op throughout the an cyc and throughout migr rang her we expl the evid for impact of bree and non bree condit on pop trend of brit bree bird of vary migr stat and wint ecolog loc gre britain england scotland method within and between specy vary in pop trend is quant for bird specy with diff migr strategies result between and rat of pop chang in scotland and england diff sign for resid and long dist migr specy but wer simil for short dist migr specy of the six long dist migr specy that wint in the arid zon of afric fiv ar increas in abund throughout britain in contrast the sev specy wint in the humid zon of afric ar al declin in england but fiv of thes ar increas in scotland consequ pop of both arid and humid zon specy ar increas sign fast in scotland than england and on the engl bree pop of specy wint in the humid zon ar declin main conclud pop declin in long dist migr espec thos wint in the humid zon but not resid or short dist migr suggest an influ of non bree season condit on pop trend howev the consist less favo pop trend in england than scotland of long dist migr and resid specy strongly suggest that vary in the qual of bree ground is influ rec pop chang the declin in humid zon specy in england but not scotland may result from poor bree condit in england exacerb the impact of non bree condit or the cost assocy with a long migr whil bet condit in scotland may be buff thes impact,new,0.8823922967401553,0.8569043847052779,0.8370192368081502,0.8212018793465086,0.8082364527700455,0.7972954593308209,0.7878067923972453,0.7793393583307381,0.7715079587441933,0.763843120986229,0.7555485883381096
371,bird_palearctic,Inferring the migratory status of woodland birds using ringing data: The case of a constant-effort site located in the iberian highlands,"Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of birds is crucial for effective manage-ment and conservation of their populations. However, we still have only limited knowledge not only of the wintering destinations of many Iberian breeding migrants but also of aspects as general as the mi-gratory behaviour of the populations of many common avian species that breed in the Iberian highlands. We used bird-ringing data to shed light on the migratory status (migratory, partially-migratory or seden-tary) of the breeding populations of 13 common species occurring year-round in a woodland located on an Iberian plateau (Garaio,Araba, Spain; 574 m.a.s.l.), where ringing activities have been carried out over the last 20 years. To assess the extent to which birds breeding on this site remain in the area during winter and/or are replaced by conspecifics coming from other areas, we analysed: (1) changes in relative abundance of birds between summer and winter, (2) the frequency of sedentary individuals (birds captured both in summer and winter period in the study area) in relation to the number of indi-viduals captured only in summer (summer visitors) or in winter (wintering birds), and (3) variation in wing length among summer, wintering and sedentary birds. Our results revealed great variation among species in the intensity of migratory behaviour, and a general arrival of foreign conspecifics during the winter for most of the species studied. Likewise, our study represents an illustrative example of how long-term ringing can be used to shed light on the migratory status of bird populations.",10.13157/aria.61.1.2014.77,2-s2.0-84904707854,40,0.829280786801434,1,infer the migr stat of woodland bird us ring dat the cas of a const effort sit loc in the ib highland understand the spatiotemp distribut of bird is cruc for effect man ment and conserv of their pop howev we stil hav on limit knowledg not on of the wint destin of many ib bree migr but also of aspect as gen as the mi grat behavio of the pop of many common av specy that bree in the ib highland we us bird ring dat to shed light on the migr stat migr part migr or sed tary of the bree pop of common specy occur year round in a woodland loc on an ib plateau garaio arab spain m a s l wher ring act hav been carry out ov the last year to assess the ext to which bird bree on thi sit remain in the are dur wint and or ar replac by conspec com from oth area we analys chang in rel abund of bird between sum and wint the frequ of sed individ bird capt both in sum and wint period in the study are in rel to the numb of ind vid capt on in sum sum visit or in wint wint bird and vary in wing leng among sum wint and sed bird our result rev gre vary among specy in the intens of migr behavio and a gen ar of foreign conspec dur the wint for most of the specy study likew our study repres an illust exampl of how long term ring can be us to shed light on the migr stat of bird pop,new,0.8785583344217478,0.8344497796049462,0.7964440430419799,0.7640751455331151,0.7361070281512752,0.7114309122581537,0.6891540717532548,0.6685203097997992,0.6487833271302312,0.6289747747397147,0.6073851196538858
384,bird_palearctic,New species records and changes in abundance of waterfowl in northwest Greenland,"Breeding populations of Nearctic and Palearctic waterfowl have undergone significant changes in abundance and distribution over the past 50 years. The Avanersuaq District in northwest Greenland is home to an assemblage of waterfowl from both geographic areas; however, minimal historic or current information is available on species abundance. In 2008 and 2009, we conducted field surveys in Greenland from 76.00¬∞ to 77.35¬∞N for breeding and non-breeding waterfowl and have collected anecdotal field notes of avian observations over a 20-year period (1993-2012). During these periods, we documented the first observation of a Ross's goose (Chen rossii) and the first confirmed breeding by lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in Greenland. Northern pintails (Anas acuta) were observed for the first time in northwest Greenland, and a previously unknown breeding location for brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) was also identified. Local populations of greater snow (C. c.) and Canada geese (B. canadensis) have increased in size. The Booth Sound and Drown Bay wetland areas and many islands throughout the Avanersuaq District were identified as critical habitat for both breeding and non-breeding waterfowl. Further increases in waterfowl abundance, including more frequent rare and new visitors, are likely in the study area as breeding populations further south continue to increase and an ameliorating climate allows for a longer breeding season. These results will prove useful as a baseline for comparisons with future surveys. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-014-1520-z,2-s2.0-84905243565,7,0.8192919836174101,1,new specy record and chang in abund of waterfowl in northwest greenland bree pop of nearct and palearct waterfowl hav undergon sign chang in abund and distribut ov the past year the avanersuaq district in northwest greenland is hom to an assembl of waterfowl from both geograph area howev minim hist or cur inform is avail on specy abund in and we conduc field survey in greenland from ¬∞ to ¬∞n for bree and non bree waterfowl and hav collect anecdot field not of av observ ov a year period dur thes period we docu the first observ of a ross s goos chen rossi and the first confirm bree by less snow gees chen caerulesc caerulesc in greenland northern pintail ana acut wer observ for the first tim in northwest greenland and a prevy unknown bree loc for brent gees brant bernicl hrot was also ident loc pop of gre snow c c and canad gees b canadens hav increas in siz the boo sound and drown bay wetland area and many island throughout the avanersuaq district wer ident as crit habit for both bree and non bree waterfowl furth increas in waterfowl abund includ mor frequ rar and new visit ar lik in the study are as bree pop furth sou continu to increas and an am clim allow for a long bree season thes result wil prov us as a baselin for comparison with fut survey,new,0.8596960521111525,0.8175793149888558,0.7830735230146502,0.7549768470175089,0.7317466187013745,0.712217722114507,0.6955944956536296,0.6813630707144991,0.6692507080256856,0.659256085302885,0.6519376314034723
403,bird_palearctic,"Reproductive success and productivity of the Cyprus Wheatear Oenanthe cypriaca, a migratory, island endemic","Population dynamics of annually breeding bird species depend crucially on productivity, and so this variation can help us understand the causes of declines in migrant birds. We investigated variation in annual productivity 2010‚Äì2012 in the Cyprus Wheatear Oenanthe cypriaca, a small endemic migrant passerine at the National Forest Park (NFP) of Troodos. Clutch size for first nests was usually five, although 0.40 eggs lower in 2011. Nest survival did not vary with year, nesting attempt, or clutch initiation date, but was significantly higher in the chick (0.96; 0.88‚Äì0.98, 95¬†% CI) versus the egg stage (0.74; 0.62‚Äì0.83, 95¬†% CI). The number of chicks fledged from a successful nest varied with nest type‚Äîwith first nests and second nests after failure being similar producing ~3‚Äì4.5 chicks dependent on year, and with second nests after success producing ~2 chicks, independent of year. There were only weak positive or negative effects of clutch initiation date dependent on year, controlling for nest type, and no effects of male age on productivity. After fledging, chicks had a >95¬†% chance of surviving the first month, but with a greater probability of one or rarely two chicks per brood dying if fledged later in the season. Renesting rate was significantly different in all years (26, 48, and 78¬†% renesting): 2010 had a much lower renesting rate after success with very few second broods (29 versus 76¬†% and 73¬†% in 2011 and 2012, respectively). Overall productivity per territory did not vary with year with 3.96¬†¬±¬†0.09 SE chicks alive 1¬†month after fledging. Cyprus Wheatears showed several unusual breeding parameters including a highly variable renesting probability, high nestling, and very high fledgling survival, resulting in exceptionally high productivity. This may be because renesting is constrained by high mid-summer temperatures and low abundance of chick predators. ¬© 2016, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10336-015-1322-2,2-s2.0-84976311625,22,0.8038952826504929,0,reproduc success and produc of the cypr wheatear oenanth cypriac a migr island endem pop dynam of an bree bird specy depend cruc on produc and so thi vary can help us understand the caus of declin in migr bird we investig vary in an produc ‚äì in the cypr wheatear oenanth cypriac a smal endem migr passerin at the nat forest park nfp of troodo clutch siz for first nest was us fiv although eg low in nest surv did not vary with year nest attempt or clutch in dat but was sign high in the chick ‚äì ¬† ci vers the eg stag ‚äì ¬† ci the numb of chick fledg from a success nest vary with nest type‚äîwith first nest and second nest aft fail being simil produc ‚äì chick depend on year and with second nest aft success produc chick independ of year ther wer on weak posit or neg effect of clutch in dat depend on year control for nest typ and no effect of mal ag on produc aft fledg chick had a ¬† chant of surv the first mon but with a gre prob of on or rar two chick per brood dying if fledg lat in the season renest rat was sign diff in al year and ¬† renest had a much low renest rat aft success with very few second brood vers ¬† and ¬† in and respect overal produc per territ did not vary with year with ¬†¬±¬† se chick al ¬†month aft fledg cypr wheatear show sev unus bree paramet includ a high vary renest prob high nestl and very high fledgl surv result in exceiv high produc thi may be becaus renest is constrain by high mid sum temp and low abund of chick pred,new,0.841735001246392,0.8048419718878456,0.7755665598835045,0.7523055671448037,0.7335514588645455,0.7182601638913824,0.7057655014713007,0.6956925127262156,0.6879473607290671,0.6828085145550326,0.6813836896821039

471,bird_palearctic,Habitat suitability-density relationship in an endangered woodland species: The case of the Blue Chaffinch (Fringilla polatzeki),"Background. Understanding constraints to the distribution of threatened species may help to ascertain whether there are other suitable sectors for reducing the risks associated with species that are recorded in only one protected locality, and to inform about the suitability of other areas for reintroduction or translocation programs. Methods. We studied the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (Fringilla polatzeki), a habitat specialist endemic of the Canary Islands restricted to the pine forest of Inagua, the only area where the species has been naturally present as a regular breeder in the last 25 years. A suitability distribution model using occurrences with demographic relevance (i.e., nest locations of successful breeding attempts analysed using boosted classification trees) was built considering orographic, climatic and habitat structure predictors. By means of a standardized survey program we monitored the yearly abundance of the species in 100 sectors since the declaration of Inagua as a Strict Nature Reserve in 1994. Results. The variables with the highest relative importance in blue chaffinch habitat preferences were pine height, tree cover, altitude, and rainfall during the driest trimester (July-September). The observed local abundance of the blue chaffinch in Inagua (survey data) was significantly correlated with habitat suitability derived from modelling the location of successful nesting attempts (using linear and quantile regressions). The outcomes of the habitat suitability model were used to quantify the suitability of other natural, historic, pine forests of Gran Canaria. Tamadaba is the forest with most suitable woodland patches for the species. We estimated a population size of 195-430 blue chaffinches in Inagua since 2011 (95% CI), the smallest population size of a woodland passerine in the Western Palearctic. Discussion. Habitat suitability obtained from modelling the location of successful breeding attempts is a good surrogate of the observed local abundance during the reproductive season. The outcomes of these models can be used for the identification of potential areas for the reintroduction of the species in other suitable pine forests and to inform forest management practices. ¬© 2017 Carrascal et al.",10.7717/peerj.3771,2-s2.0-85029231940,37,0.7476241513088541,1,habit suit dens rel in an endang woodland specy the cas of the blu chaffinch fringill polatzek background understand constraint to the distribut of threatened specy may help to ascertain wheth ther ar oth suit sect for reduc the risk assocy with specy that ar record in on on protect loc and to inform about the suit of oth area for reintroduc or transloc program method we study the gran canar blu chaffinch fringill polatzek a habit spec endem of the can island restrict to the pin forest of inagu the on are wher the specy has been nat pres as a regul bree in the last year a suit distribut model us occur with demograph relev i e nest loc of success bree attempt analys us boost class tre was built consid orograph clim and habit structure predict by mean of a standard survey program we monit the year abund of the specy in sect sint the decl of inagu as a strict nat reserv in result the vary with the highest rel import in blu chaffinch habit pref wer pin height tre cov altitud and rainfal dur the driest trimest july septemb the observ loc abund of the blu chaffinch in inagu survey dat was sign correl with habit suit der from model the loc of success nest attempt us linear and quantil regress the outcom of the habit suit model wer us to quant the suit of oth nat hist pin forest of gran canar tamadab is the forest with most suit woodland patch for the specy we estim a pop siz of blu chaffinch in inagu sint ci the smallest pop siz of a woodland passerin in the western palearct discuss habit suit obtain from model the loc of success bree attempt is a good surrog of the observ loc abund dur the reproduc season the outcom of thes model can be us for the id of pot area for the reintroduc of the specy in oth suit pin forest and to inform forest man pract,new,0.7660486730215194,0.7031745746036275,0.6555767082010936,0.6193312285738282,0.5911034651269161,0.5687265042845827,0.5508585976026448,0.5367107092985922,0.5259209353417169,0.5186069090732179,0.5157727175635914

Evidence regarding population trends of endangered species in special protection areas and their recovery ability from catastrophic disturbances is scarce. We assessed the population trend of the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (Fringilla polatzeki), a habitat specialist endemic to the pine forest of Inagua in the Canary Islands, following a devastating wildfire in July 2007. Using a standardized census program that accounts for detectability, we have monitored the population trend of the species since Inagua was declared a Strict Nature Reserve in 1994. The breeding population density of the blue chaffinch remained stable in Inagua from the beginning of the monitoring program in 1994 until the year before the wildfire. However, in spring 2008, the population density decreased by half with respect to density in the preceding years. Since 2008, the population has gradually increased, reaching its highest recorded density in 2016 (15.8 birds/km2).This represents an average annual increase of 23.7%, indicating impressive resilience to catastrophic events. The creation of Inagua as a strict nature reserve did not therefore increase the global population or protect the blue chaffinch against a demographic crisis but probably prevented a deepening of the demographic crisis or further declines. Except for the two years immediately after the severe wildfire of 2007, the population density of the blue chaffinch in Inagua has remained relatively stable at around 9‚Äì16 birds/km2, the lowest recorded abundance for a small woodland passerine in the Western Palearctic. ¬©.2018 Museu de Ci√®ncies Naturals de Barcelona.",,2-s2.0-85032886264,8,0.8688706491394019,1,striking resy of an island endem bird to a sev perturb the cas of the gran canar blu chaffinch marcad resilienc de un especy de av insul end√©mica despu√©s de un perturbaci√≥n intens el caso del pinz√≥n az de gran canar striking resy of an island‚äìendemic bird to a sev perturb the cas of the gran canar blu chaffinch evid regard pop trend of endang specy in spec protect area and their recovery abl from catastroph disturb is scarc we assess the pop trend of the gran canar blu chaffinch fringill polatzek a habit spec endem to the pin forest of inagu in the can island follow a devast wildfir in july us a standard cens program that account for detect we hav monit the pop trend of the specy sint inagu was decl a strict nat reserv in the bree pop dens of the blu chaffinch remain stabl in inagu from the begin of the monit program in until the year bef the wildfir howev in spring the pop dens decreas by half with respect to dens in the prec year sint the pop has grad increas reach it highest record dens in bird km thi repres an av an increas of ind impress resy to catastroph ev the cre of inagu as a strict nat reserv did not theref increas the glob pop or protect the blu chaffinch against a demograph cris but prob prev a deep of the demograph cris or furth declin exceiv for the two year immedy aft the sev wildfir of the pop dens of the blu chaffinch in inagu has remain rel stabl at around ‚äì bird km the lowest record abund for a smal woodland passerin in the western palearct,new,0.8484411487574333,0.8182064129366978,0.7951903700894988,0.7772578328982792,0.7628997460298306,0.7511852311674716,0.741561669065606,0.7337398077640327,0.7276714109313414,0.7236503752788249,0.7227384226921645

However, the importance of the lakes as a temporary site for migrant bird populations has not been adequately studied. The point count method was used to study waterbird species diversity and abundance in Lake Ashenge, in the semi-arid region of northern Ethiopia, with the main aim to underscore the lake's importance as a stop-over site for Palaearctic and other migratory birds. A total of 36 species belonging to 14 waterbird families were encountered. Fifteen of the species were resident birds, including the endemic Wattled Ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), and 14 of the species were Palaearctic migrants, including the globally Near-Threatened Ferruginous Duck (Ayithya nyroca) and Maccoa Duck (Oxyura maccoa). Significant temporal variation in diversity and abundance was observed during the study period; diversity was highest (Shannon-Wiener H‚Ä≤ = 1.98) in the dry season (December/January) and lowest (H‚Ä≤ = 1.11) in the rainy season (August/September), whereas mean abundance was highest (c. 4219 individuals) in the post-rainy season (October/November) and lowest (c. 2631 individuals) in the dry season. Increased abundance of Palaearctic species towards the dry season increased species diversity,but may have caused displacement of resident birds resulting in lower overall abundance in this season.

511,bird_palearctic,Seasonal changes in the diversity and numbers of waterbirds in a tropical river in Southern Africa,"Although freshwater habitats play a crucial role in most ecosystems in the world, little is known on their functioning in tropical regions even in regard to the most often studied avian communities. In this study, counts on waterbirds were conducted in dry and wet season (in years 2001-2008) in a riverine habitat in southern Africa (Shamvura stretch of the Okavango River). In total, 84 waterfowl species were recorded. The birds were assigned to different guilds according to their migration activity, diet and nesting site selection. In overall, the species number was almost the same (74 vs. 73) in the wet and dry season. The abundance of all resident species recorded was lower in wet (N = 5992) than in dry seasons (N = 6965)(œá2 = 73.1, P &lt; 0.01). In both seasons Palearctic migrants were represented by seven species, which comprised 1-2% of all waterbirds. Six species were classified as dominants: African reed cormorant Phalacrocorax africanus, African openbill stork Anastomus lamelligerus, cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, wattled lapwing Vanellus senegallus, African darter Anhinga rufa and white-faced duck Dendrocygna viduata. In the wet season the dominant species comprised 68%, while in dry season-52.5% of all birds recorded. Significant seasonal differences in the numbers of individuals were shown for the following species: African reed cormorant, great egret, squacco heron, wattled lapwing and pied kingfisher. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more abundant in wet season, while piscivorous, carnivorous and plant eating birds in dry season. These differences can be related mainly to seasonal variation in the availability of food as well as to the timing of breeding. ¬© 2018 E-flow BioOne.

128,fish_antarctic,Albatross populations in peril: A population trajectory for Black-browed Albatrosses at South Georgia,"Simulation modeling was used to reconstruct Black-browed Albatross (Diomedea melanophris) population trends. Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from ""Vulnerable"" to ""Endangered."" Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years. For this population to recover to a status under which it could be ""delisted,"" a 10% increase in survival of all age classes would be needed. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/03-5340,2-s2.0-33645099456,47,0.886828932,1,albatross pop in peril a pop traject for black brow albatross at sou georg sim model was us to reconstruct black brow albatross diomede melanophr pop trend clos approxim to observ dat wer accompl by an vary surv rat reproduc success and prob of return to bree giv success in prevy year the temp shift in an valu coincid with the start of longlin fish at sou georg and pot chang in kril abund we us year of demograph dat from long term study of a bree colony of thi specy at bird island sou georg to valid our model when we us an paramet estim for surv reproduc success and prob of return to bree giv success in prevy year our model traject clos follow the observ chang in bree pop siz ov tim pop grow rat was below replac lambd in most year and was most sensit to chang in adult surv thi support the rec iucn upl of thi specy from vuln to endang comparison of pre and post demograph bef and aft the inceiv of a longlin fishery in the bree are rev a decreas in lambd from to a lif tabl respons expery ltre show that thi declin in lambd was caus most by declin in surv of adult if demograph rat ar maintain the model predict a chant of a pop of few than pair within year for thi pop to recov to a stat und which it could be del a increas in surv of al ag class would be nee,new,0.9153463963718725,0.8994870903289681,0.8863334881267946,0.8752629388581543,0.8657310063261846,0.8573218681748063,0.8497078497033841,0.8425978173845091,0.8356748695487846,0.8284699856287094,0.8200701178431482
220,fish_antarctic,The population dynamics of Notothenia rossii from South Georgia (Antarctica),"The population dynamics of nearshore juvenile Notothenia rossii were studied at South Georgia during 1978 and 1979. Mortality of the population was calculated from length-class abundance of fish sampled by trammel nets, and the population size estimated using a mark and recapture technique. Instantaneous natural mortality in the nearshore population was high (M=0.78) although other author's estimate for the mortality in the offshore population was only 0.35. Therefore it is likely that no single estimate of mortality will apply to fish of all ages. The population density of juvenile N. rossii was about 11 g m-2 nearshore. The size of the offshore population was estimated by calculating survival from the nearshore age classes. The data suggest that the population around South Georgia has been reduced by overfishing to about one tenth of its previous unexploited level. Yield could have been increased by fishing less intensively, and the population maintained at or near its initial level if recruitment remained constant. ¬© 1984 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/BF00265565,2-s2.0-34250141159,117,0.8839556609999999,1,the pop dynam of notothen rossi from sou georg antarctic the pop dynam of nearsh juvenil notothen rossi wer study at sou georg dur and mort of the pop was calc from leng class abund of fish sampl by trammel net and the pop siz estim us a mark and recapt techn inst nat mort in the nearsh pop was high m although oth auth s estim for the mort in the offsh pop was on theref it is lik that no singl estim of mort wil apply to fish of al ag the pop dens of juvenil n rossi was about g m nearsh the siz of the offsh pop was estim by calc surv from the nearsh ag class the dat suggest that the pop around sou georg has been reduc by overf to about on ten of it prevy unexploit level yield could hav been increas by fish less intend and the pop maintain at or near it init level if recruit remain const,new,0.892241267160429,0.8645149609196516,0.8408949593319552,0.8205337086434689,0.8025928073749743,0.7864226184756569,0.7715144103837753,0.7574281738498735,0.7437096407270102,0.729736208959012,0.7143531319849378
320,fish_antarctic,Distribution and abundance of the Southern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialoides,"We reviewed published and unpublished literature to establish the status of the breeding distribution and abundance of Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides. The species breeds widely throughout the Antarctic and on peri-Antarctic islands. From breeding population data collated from 73 of these localities, we estimated the minimum global population to be about 400,000 breeding pairs. After adjusting for seasonal variation in numbers of breeding pairs based on studies at Ardery Island, East Antarctica, the total global population is estimated to be at least one million breeding pairs. Of this, 72% nest on islands of the Scotia Sea arc and the South Atlantic Ocean. The precision of the estimate on the total number of breeding pairs is low, as several colony estimates were only available as orders of magnitude.

The breeding aggregation on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia is believed to be larger than all others combined. We estimated the size of this population by calculating the area of suitable habitat and the density of occupied burrows within it. Some 670,000 occupied nests were estimated for the island at mid-incubation, representing 0.9 million pairs of breeding-age birds associated with South Georgia in the survey seasons (2005/06 and 06/07). This is 40-45% of the previous estimate, but still represents well over half of the global population. If the population is declining due to fishery bycatch, as is likely, the scale of annual mortality in this population alone is at least in the high tens of thousands, and plausibly hundreds of thousands. ¬© 2009 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00300-008-0570-5,2-s2.0-62949087869,29,0.868969016,1,the whit chin petrel procellar aequinoct on sou georg pop siz distribut and glob sign mor whit chin petrel procellar aequinoct ar accid kil in fishery than prob any oth seabird in the world but the pop impact of thi mort is poor understood part becaus ther hav been no rec estim of the specy abund the bree aggreg on the sub antarct island of sou georg is believ to be larg than al oth combin we estim the siz of thi pop by calc the are of suit habit and the dens of occupy burrow within it som occupy nest wer estim for the island at mid incub repres mil pair of bree ag bird assocy with sou georg in the survey season and thi is of the prevy estim but stil repres wel ov half of the glob pop if the pop is declin due to fishery bycatch as is lik the scal of an mort in thi pop alon is at least in the high ten of thousand and plaus hundr of thousand,new,0.8813186333487864,0.8327102076514618,0.7895855185152324,0.7522440499693761,0.7196667554777468,0.6907750162050047,0.6646486749544253,0.6404864846209666,0.6174908601479812,0.5946320164926012,0.5700919891144041
512,fish_antarctic,An assessment of Greenland walrus populations,"Recent abundance estimates were combined with historical catches and an age- and sex-structured population dynamic model to perform Bayesian assessments of the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) populations in West Greenland, the North Water in northern Baffin Bay, and East Greenland. The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

610,fish_antarctic,"Abundance and population status of Ross Sea killer whales (Orcinus orca, type C) in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica: evidence for impact by commercial fishing?","For over a century, the Ross Sea killer whale (RSKW; Orcinus orca, Antarctic type C), a fish-eating ecotype, has been commonly reported in McMurdo Sound (McM), Ross Sea, Antarctica. However, a significant population decline reported at Ross Island after 2006 has been linked to a commercial fishery that began in the Ross Sea in 1996‚Äì1997 and targets large Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni)‚Äîthe presumed primary prey of RSKW. We assessed RSKW population abundance and trends using photo-identification data collected in McM during seven summers from 2001‚Äì2002 to 2014‚Äì2015. We identified 352 individual RSKWs and estimated an average annual population of 470 distinctly marked whales. Using a Bayesian mark‚Äìrecapture model, we identified two population clusters: ‚Äòregulars‚Äô showed strong inter- and intra-annual site fidelity and an average annual abundance of 73 distinctive individuals (95% probability: 57‚Äì88); ‚Äòirregulars‚Äô were less frequently encountered but comprised a larger population with an annual estimate of 397 distinctive individuals (287‚Äì609). The number of seasonally resident regulars appeared to be stable over the period of purported RSKW decline, with the estimated annual number of deaths (6; 95% probability: 1‚Äì22) offset by the number of recruits (6; 2‚Äì19). As an alternative to the decline-due-to-fishery hypothesis, we suggest that the presence of mega-iceberg B-15 at Ross Island during the ‚Äúiceberg years‚Äù (2000‚Äì2001 to 2005‚Äì2006) could have temporarily disrupted normal RSKW movement patterns, resulting in an apparent decline. Continued population monitoring of toothfish and their predators will be important for assessing ecosystem impacts of commercial fishing in the Ross Sea. ¬© 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",10.1007/s00300-017-2239-4,2-s2.0-85040006560,25,0.853061625,1,abund and pop stat of ross sea kil whal orcin orc typ c in mcmurdo sound antarctic evid for impact by commerc fish for ov a century the ross sea kil whal rskw orcin orc antarct typ c a fish eat ecotyp has been common report in mcmurdo sound mcm ross sea antarctic howev a sign pop declin report at ross island aft has been link to a commerc fishery that beg in the ross sea in ‚äì and target larg antarct toothf dissostich mawson ‚äîthe presum prim prey of rskw we assess rskw pop abund and trend us photo id dat collect in mcm dur sev sum from ‚äì to ‚äì we ident individ rskws and estim an av an pop of distinct mark whal us a bayes mark‚äìrecapture model we ident two pop clust ‚äòregulars‚äô show strong int and intr an sit fidel and an av an abund of distinct individ prob ‚äì ‚äòirregulars‚äô wer less frequ encount but compr a larg pop with an an estim of distinct individ ‚äì the numb of season resid regul appear to be stabl ov the period of purport rskw declin with the estim an numb of death prob ‚äì offset by the numb of recruit ‚äì as an altern to the declin due to fishery hypothes we suggest that the pres of meg iceberg b at ross island dur the ‚äúiceberg years‚äù ‚äì to ‚äì could hav temp disrupt norm rskw mov pattern result in an app declin continu pop monit of toothf and their pred wil be import for assess ecosystem impact of commerc fish in the ross sea,new,0.8665396894857829,0.8216020922181136,0.7839097296177446,0.7524355865651287,0.7256196064243199,0.7022307718614438,0.6813625327519914,0.6623126516564569,0.6444630502344645,0.6271166737095395,0.6091811117459242

It addresses correspondence between long-term population trends of inshore demersal fish and inshore-feeding Antarctic shags of this area, where an intensive commercial fishery for shag prey once operated. The analysis also includes comparable information on diet (by examination of regurgitated pellets), foraging patterns, and breeding output of shags from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, an area where no commercial finfish fishery has ever existed. Integral study of these parameters there showed that, in Antarctic shags, low breeding success and high foraging effort might imply low recruitment and high adult mortality, respectively, with both factors adversely affecting the population trends of this bird. In line with these premises, the declining trend observed in shag colonies on the South Shetland Islands appears to have been influenced by the concomitant decrease in abundance of two of their main prey, the nototheniids Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons, due to intensive industrial fishing in the area in the late 1970s.

Still evident is the decline in trammel-net catches of fjord-dwelling Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons in relation to the non-commercially fished Notothenia coriiceps, which was previously reported for the period 1983-1990. A trend of increasing N. rossii catches was observed, but the levels of relative abundance of this species and G. gibberifrons are well below those found in the early 1980s. These results are supported by our knowledge about the diet of the piscivorous Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis) in the South Shetland-Antarctic Peninsula area in this decade. The decrease in recruitment to the inshore sub-populations of N. rossii and G. gibberifrons over the last 16 years was most probably caused by the offshore commercial fishery in the area in the late 1970s.

96,fish_antarctic,Assessing consistency of fish survey data: uncertainties in the estimation of mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) abundance at South Georgia,"Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) is a semi-pelagic finfish species inhabiting shelf areas in the Southern Ocean. The population at South Georgia is currently exploited by pelagic trawlers fishing close to the seabed. Annual catches peaked at 150,000 t in 1983 and have declined since the mid-to-late 1980s. Bottom-trawl surveys have been conducted since 1987, providing a time series of abundance and size distribution for use in assessing the status of the stock and setting quotas. Food web models suggest that estimates of the biomass from survey data are substantially lower than the amount of icefish required by the local ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the uncertainty around current estimates of density and variance, using alternative nonparametric stratified bootstrapping methods. The stratified rescaling bootstrap estimator was identified as the most appropriate method of those tested: in comparison with the existing method, confidence intervals and the inter-annual variability of the estimates were reduced. Numbers-at-age were estimated from mixture distribution models fitted to length-disaggregated density data in order to determine whether individual cohorts were consistently detected by the surveys. Estimates of numbers-at-age could not consistently delineate cohorts in successive years indicating that survey-based estimates of density were biased. These biases may have arisen because the trawl gear did not select individuals of all sizes equally, or because sampling was restricted to the demersal component of the stock. Estimates of abundance of the pelagic component of the stock should be derived from acoustic data to improve the assessment. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-015-1810-0,2-s2.0-84944937974,38,0.83601677,1,assess consist of fish survey dat uncertainty in the estim of mackerel icef champsocephal gunnar abund at sou georg mackerel icef champsocephal gunnar is a sem pel finf specy inhabit shelf area in the southern oc the pop at sou georg is cur exploit by pel trawl fish clos to the seab an catch peak at t in and hav declin sint the mid to lat s bottom trawl survey hav been conduc sint provid a tim sery of abund and siz distribut for us in assess the stat of the stock and set quota food web model suggest that estim of the biomass from survey dat ar subst low than the amount of icef requir by the loc ecosystem the aim of thi study was to assess the uncertainty around cur estim of dens and vary us altern nonparamet stratified bootstrap method the stratified resc bootstrap estim was ident as the most appropry method of thos test in comparison with the ex method confid interv and the int an vary of the estim wer reduc numb at ag wer estim from mixt distribut model fit to leng disaggreg dens dat in ord to determin wheth individ cohort wer consist detect by the survey estim of numb at ag could not consist delin cohort in success year ind that survey bas estim of dens wer bias thes bias may hav ar becaus the trawl gear did not select individ of al siz eq or becaus sampl was restrict to the demers compon of the stock estim of abund of the pel compon of the stock should be der from acoust dat to improv the assess,new,0.8602789855486291,0.8032253723641706,0.7537419277217677,0.711704141709618,0.6755881951975723,0.6439667722531931,0.6157009852559513,0.5898616366582825,0.5655972272810106,0.5419171586078744,0.5172534579100465

We present an assessment of recent annual variation and trends in abundance and growth rates of these colonies, adding to the published record not updated for more than two decades. High angle oblique aerial photographic surveys of colonies were acquired and penguins counted for the breeding seasons 1981-2012. In the last four years the numbers of Ad√©lie penguins in the Ross and Beaufort Island colonies (southern Ross Sea metapopulation) reached their highest levels since aerial counts began in 1981. Results indicated that 855,625 pairs of Ad√©lie penguins established breeding territories in the western Ross Sea, with just over a quarter (28%) of those in the southern portion, constituting a semi-isolated metapopulation (three colonies on Ross Island, one on nearby Beaufort Island). The southern population had a negative per capita growth rate of -0.019 during 1981-2000, followed by a positive per capita growth rate of 0.067 for 2001-2012. Colony growth rates for this metapopulation showed striking synchrony through time, indicating that large-scale factors influenced their annual growth. In contrast to the increased colony sizes in the southern population, the patterns of change among colonies of the northern Ross Sea were difficult to characterize. Trends were similar to southern colonies until the mid-1990s, after which the signal was lost owing to significantly reduced frequency of surveys. Both climate factors and recovery of whale populations likely played roles in the trends among southern colonies until 2000, after which depletion of another trophic competitor, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni), may explain the sharp increasing trend evident since then. ¬© 2014 Lyver et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0091188,2-s2.0-84895832094,30,0.835592282,1,trend in the bree pop of ad√©lie penguin in the ross sea a coincid of clim and resourc extract effect meas of the siz of ad√©lie penguin pygoscel adelia colony of the southern ross sea ar among the longest biolog tim sery in the antarct we pres an assess of rec an vary and trend in abund and grow rat of thes colony ad to the publ record not upd for mor than two decad high angl obl aer photograph survey of colony wer acquir and penguin count for the bree season in the last four year the numb of ad√©lie penguin in the ross and beaufort island colony southern ross sea metapop reach their highest level sint aer count beg in result ind that pair of ad√©lie penguin est bree territ in the western ross sea with just ov a quart of thos in the southern port constitut a sem isol metapop three colony on ross island on on nearby beaufort island the southern pop had a neg per capit grow rat of dur follow by a posit per capit grow rat of for colony grow rat for thi metapop show striking synchrony through tim ind that larg scal fact influ their an grow in contrast to the increas colony siz in the southern pop the pattern of chang among colony of the northern ross sea wer difficult to charact trend wer simil to southern colony until the mid s aft which the sign was lost ow to sign reduc frequ of survey both clim fact and recovery of whal pop lik play rol in the trend among southern colony until aft which deplet of anoth troph competit the antarct toothf dissostich mawson may explain the sharp increas trend evid sint then,new,0.8768652820954715,0.8488678141687154,0.8272514589560483,0.810409561833246,0.7969270824024175,0.7858642009246125,0.77661947820984,0.7688054897645831,0.7621806554228554,0.7566269156168816,0.7522300139628036
1111,fish_antarctic,"A 9000-year record of Ad√©lie penguin occupation and diet in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica","We investigated 17 abandoned Ad√©lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica, in summer 2002/03. Forty radiocarbon dates on penguin bones and eggshells from 13 of these sites indicate a near continuous occupation by breeding penguins in this region for over 9000 years. These dates refine the recent geological record in this region and indicate that deglaciation of the northern islands occurred much earlier than previously suggested. Dietary remains from these sites include at least 23 taxa of cephalopods and teleost fish. Quantification of these remains indicates significant fluctuations in the relative abundance of two of the more common major prey taxa. The Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum Boulenger) was the most common teleost prey during all time periods represented by the ages of the sites, but preservational factors may explain a gradual decrease in the remains of this species in increasingly older sites. The most common cephalopod in the sediments was the squid, Psychroteuthis glacialis Thiele, which occurred in low numbers in most sites except one (Site 75). An unusually high number of squid beaks preserved in Site 75, dating to approximately 5700-6100 cal. yr BP, does not correlate with a decrease in fish prey at that time. The high number of abandoned penguin colonies (> 200) in the Windmill Islands may be due to population cycles in the past in association with low nest-site fidelity and movement by breeding penguins to new sites within this region. ¬© Antarctic Science Ltd.",10.1017/S0954102005002427,2-s2.0-15244342534,156,0.834685344,0,a year record of ad√©lie penguin occup and diet in the windmil island east antarctic we investig abandon ad√©lie penguin pygoscel adelia colony in the windmil island east antarctic in sum forty radiocarbon dat on penguin bon and eggshel from of thes sit ind a near continu occup by bree penguin in thi reg for ov year thes dat refin the rec geolog record in thi reg and ind that degl of the northern island occur much ear than prevy suggest diet remain from thes sit includ at least tax of cephalopod and teleost fish quant of thes remain ind sign fluctu in the rel abund of two of the mor common maj prey tax the antarct silverf pleuragramm antarctic bouleng was the most common teleost prey dur al tim period repres by the ag of the sit but preserv fact may explain a grad decreas in the remain of thi specy in increas old sit the most common cephalopod in the sedy was the squid psychroteuth glac thiel which occur in low numb in most sit exceiv on sit an unus high numb of squid beak preserv in sit dat to approxim cal yr bp doe not correl with a decreas in fish prey at that tim the high numb of abandon penguin colony in the windmil island may be due to pop cyc in the past in assocy with low nest sit fidel and mov by bree penguin to new sit within thi reg,new,0.8718743878655609,0.8263312615226854,0.7873655161693011,0.7542679589743381,0.7256341255327067,0.7002806839469841,0.6772801137329786,0.6558422259983326,0.6351554947452136,0.6140975747045468,0.5905416838883557

After correcting for count bias, Marion Island has an estimated 29,900 nests (95 % CI 27,700-32,400). Burrow occupancy rates at the start of the incubation period were 65 % during one-off surveys, but repeat surveys found that at least 73 % of burrows were occupied and 87 % of burrows showed signs of occupancy. This suggests that there were roughly 24,000 occupied nests on Marion Island (95 % CI 20,000-28,000). A more cursory survey on Prince Edward Island yielded 14,700 burrows, suggesting that there are 9,000-15,000 occupied nests. The nominate subspecies of white-chinned petrel occupies approximately 974,200 nests (95 % CI 678,000-1,286,000), with the Prince Edward Islands, the third most important breeding site, after South Georgia and Kerguelen. Assuming that populations breeding at islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans winter in different regions, the impact of fishery bycatch is likely to have had a greater impact on the Indian Ocean population. The Marion Island survey provides a baseline against which future population changes can be assessed. ¬© 2012 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00300-012-1227-y,2-s2.0-84869160594,15,0.825721253,0,the distribut and abund of whit chin petrel procellar aequinoct bree at the sub antarct print edward island the whit chin petrel procellar aequinoct is the seabird most oft kil on longlin in the southern oc and is list as vuln to extinct we estim the pop bree at the print edward island the last bree sit for the nomin subspecy that lack a rec pop estim whit chin petrel burrow ar larg confin to deep muddy soil us on slop below m but loc up to m aft correct for count bia mar island has an estim nest ci burrow occup rat at the start of the incub period wer dur on off survey but rep survey found that at least of burrow wer occupy and of burrow show sign of occup thi suggest that ther wer rough occupy nest on mar island ci a mor curs survey on print edward island yield burrow suggest that ther ar occupy nest the nomin subspecy of whit chin petrel occupy approxim nest ci with the print edward island the third most import bree sit aft sou georg and kerguel assum that pop bree at island in the atl and ind oc wint in diff reg the impact of fishery bycatch is lik to hav had a gre impact on the ind oc pop the mar island survey provid a baselin against which fut pop chang can be assess,new,0.8369010756589174,0.7773538688042071,0.7275338705519372,0.6867270294530677,0.6529622567485217,0.6245726792896141,0.6003552149887817,0.5794807421694295,0.5614183724556736,0.5459281526642492,0.5332228779079167
137,fish_antarctic,"Spatially extensive standardized surveys reveal widespread, multi-decadal increase in East Antarctic Ad√©lie penguin populations","Seabirds are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because they integrate across changes in the lower trophic levels and the physical environment. Signals from this key group of species can indicate broad scale impacts or response to environmental change. Recent studies of penguin populations, the most commonly abundant Antarctic seabirds in the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea, have demonstrated that physical changes in Antarctic marine environments have profound effects on biota at high trophic levels. Large populations of the circumpolar-breeding Ad√©lie penguin occur in East Antarctica, but direct, standardized population data across much of this vast coastline have been more limited than in other Antarctic regions. We combine extensive new population survey data, new population estimation methods, and re-interpreted historical survey data to assess decadal-scale change in East Antarctic Ad√©lie penguin breeding populations. We show that, in contrast to the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea where breeding populations have decreased or shown variable trends over the last 30 years, East Antarctic regional populations have almost doubled in abundance since the 1980's and have been increasing since the earliest counts in the 1960's. The population changes are associated with five-year lagged changes in the physical environment, suggesting that the changing environment impacts primarily on the pre-breeding age classes. East Antarctic marine ecosystems have been subject to a number of changes over the last 50 years which may have influenced Ad√©lie penguin population growth, including decadal-scale climate variation, an inferred mid-20th century sea-ice contraction, and early-to-mid 20th century exploitation of fish and whale populations. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",10.1371/journal.pone.0139877,2-s2.0-84947510058,100,0.822641497,1,spat extend standard survey rev widespread mult decad increas in east antarct ad√©lie penguin pop seabird ar consid to be us and pract ind of the stat of marin ecosystem becaus they integr across chang in the low troph level and the phys environ sign from thi key group of specy can ind broad scal impact or respons to environ chang rec study of penguin pop the most common abund antarct seabird in the west antarct peninsul and western ross sea hav demonst that phys chang in antarct marin environ hav profound effect on biot at high troph level larg pop of the circumpol bree ad√©lie penguin occ in east antarctic but direct standard pop dat across much of thi vast coastlin hav been mor limit than in oth antarct reg we combin extend new pop survey dat new pop estim method and re interpret hist survey dat to assess decad scal chang in east antarct ad√©lie penguin bree pop we show that in contrast to the west antarct peninsul and western ross sea wher bree pop hav decreas or shown vary trend ov the last year east antarct reg pop hav almost doubl in abund sint the s and hav been increas sint the earliest count in the s the pop chang ar assocy with fiv year lag chang in the phys environ suggest that the chang environ impact prim on the pre bree ag class east antarct marin ecosystem hav been subject to a numb of chang ov the last year which may hav influ ad√©lie penguin pop grow includ decad scal clim vary an infer mid th century sea ic contract and ear to mid th century exploit of fish and whal pop,new,0.8794284919177038,0.8451355562998472,0.8166622342664834,0.7927901931832997,0.772255029156488,0.7541164802631002,0.7376780481062328,0.7223669763870024,0.7076118696225543,0.6926450480451861,0.6760774391825574
146,fish_antarctic,Large-scale population assessment informs conservation management for seabirds in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean: A case study of Ad√©lie penguins,"Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are increasingly affected by fisheries, climate change and human presence. Antarctic seabirds are vulnerable to all these threats because they depend on terrestrial and marine environments to breed and forage. We assess the current distribution and total abundance of Ad√©lie penguins in East Antarctica and find there are 3.5 (95% CI 2.9‚Äì4.2) million individuals of breeding age along the East Antarctic coastline and 5.9 (4.2‚Äì7.7) million individuals foraging in the adjacent ocean after the breeding season. One third of the breeding population numbering over 1 million individuals breed within 10 km of research stations, highlighting the potential for human activities to impact Ad√©lie penguin populations despite their current high abundance. The 16 Antarctic Specially Protected Areas currently designated in East Antarctica offer protection to breeding populations close to stations in four of six regional populations. The East Antarctic breeding population consumes an average of 193 500 tonnes of krill and 18 800 tonnes of fish during a breeding season, with consumption peaking at the end of the breeding season. These findings can inform future conservation management decisions in the terrestrial environment under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to develop a systematic network of protected areas, and in the marine environment under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to allow the consumption needs of Ad√©lie penguins to be taken into account when setting fishery catch limits. Extending this work to other penguin, flying seabird, seal and whale species is a priority for conservation management in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. ¬© 2016 The Authors",10.1016/j.gecco.2016.12.004,2-s2.0-85009154309,50,0.818720065,0,larg scal pop assess inform conserv man for seabird in antarctic and the southern oc a cas study of ad√©lie penguin antarctic and the southern oc ar increas affect by fishery clim chang and hum pres antarct seabird ar vuln to al thes threats becaus they depend on terrest and marin environ to bree and for we assess the cur distribut and tot abund of ad√©lie penguin in east antarctic and find ther ar ci ‚äì mil individ of bree ag along the east antarct coastlin and ‚äì mil individ for in the adjac oc aft the bree season on third of the bree pop numb ov mil individ bree within km of research stat highlight the pot for hum act to impact ad√©lie penguin pop despit their cur high abund the antarct spec protect area cur design in east antarctic off protect to bree pop clos to stat in four of six reg pop the east antarct bree pop consum an av of ton of kril and ton of fish dur a bree season with consum peak at the end of the bree season thes find can inform fut conserv man decid in the terrest environ und the protocol on environ protect to develop a system network of protect area and in the marin environ und the conv for the conserv of antarct marin liv resourc to allow the consum nee of ad√©lie penguin to be tak into account when set fishery catch limit extend thi work to oth penguin fly seabird seal and whal specy is a pri for conserv man in antarctic and the southern oc,new,0.8805375732729007,0.8271691277414173,0.7792712192488276,0.7375673736413911,0.7010170552827392,0.6684205537061013,0.6387217471799176,0.6109687456299091,0.5841666452290319,0.5569685123457621,0.5269386911783436
1510,fish_antarctic,Mid-summer abundance estimates of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus around the South Orkney Islands and Elephant Island,"A line-transect distance sampling survey for fin whales Balaenoptera physalus was conducted around Elephant Island and the South Orkney Islands on board a CCAMLR fishing survey for fin fish in January and February 2016. Collected data were used for model-based abundance estimates of fin whales in 2 strata. The minimum average (¬± SE) density of fin whales was estimated at 0.0268 ¬± 0.0183 ind. km-2 in a 19 750 km2 area around Elephant Island, resulting in a minimum abundance estimate of 528 ¬± 362 fin whales. In a 13 550 km2 area around the South Orkney Islands, we estimated a minimum density of 0.0588 ¬± 0.0381 ind. km-2 and a minimum abundance of 796 ¬± 516 ind. The results of this study confirm a westerly extension of a recently described high-density area for fin whales in the West Antarctic Peninsula region. In the light of increasing krill fisheries in the local region, we suggest this area for further studies to assess the potential for conflict between recovering whale populations and emerging industrial interests. ¬© The authors 2017.",10.3354/ESR00832,2-s2.0-85050961041,12,0.8184931940000001,0,mid sum abund estim of fin whal balaenopter physal around the sou orkney island and eleph island a lin transect dist sampl survey for fin whal balaenopter physal was conduc around eleph island and the sou orkney island on board a ccamlr fish survey for fin fish in janu and febru collect dat wer us for model bas abund estim of fin whal in strata the minim av ¬± se dens of fin whal was estim at ¬± ind km in a km are around eleph island result in a minim abund estim of ¬± fin whal in a km are around the sou orkney island we estim a minim dens of ¬± ind km and a minim abund of ¬± ind the result of thi study confirm a west extend of a rec describ high dens are for fin whal in the west antarct peninsul reg in the light of increas kril fishery in the loc reg we suggest thi are for furth study to assess the pot for conflict between recov whal pop and emerg indust interest,new,0.8535220417286109,0.7965145519380853,0.747996134874443,0.707527885825114,0.6733711935323287,0.643999830924389,0.6182653438743335,0.5953084255982197,0.5744535127336505,0.5550948656831718,0.5365232192987522
168,fish_antarctic,"Abundance, distribution and status of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri","The abundance of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, was estimated using a model that incorporated estimated pup production. Pups are born at only five sites, four of which are at the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, which lie to the south of New Zealand. The remaining breeding site is at Campbell Island in the same region. Pup production was estimated during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons from mark-recapture studies at the two largest sea lion rookeries, at the Auckland Islands (Sandy Bay and Dundas Island), which account for almost 90% of total pup production for the species. Pup production for the other sites was estimated from direct counts or, in the case of Campbell Island, from recent tagging data. Total pup production estimates for all sites during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons are 2640 and 2807 respectively. During the four-week pupping season, pup mortality at most sites was estimated to be about 10%. The estimates of absolute abundance based on pup production for the two breeding seasons were 11 700 (95% confidence interval (CI): 10500-13100) and 12500 (95% CI: 11100-14000) respectively. This population abundance is among the smallest reported for a species within the Otariidae.

177,fish_antarctic,Variability in krill biomass links harvesting and climate warming to penguin population changes in Antarctica,"The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and adjacent Scotia Sea support abundant wildlife populations, many of which were nearly extirpated by humans. This region is also among the fastestwarming areas on the planet, with 5-6 ¬∞C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the ""sea-ice hypothesis,"" proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in ""ice-loving"" species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of ""ice-avoiding"" species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Ad√©lie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.",10.1073/pnas.1016560108,2-s2.0-79956298592,98,0.808668603,1,vary in kril biomass link harvest and clim warm to penguin pop chang in antarctic the west antarct peninsul wap and adjac scot sea support abund wildl pop many of which wer near extirp by hum thi reg is also among the fastestwarm area on the planet with ¬∞c increas in mean wint air temp and assocy decreas in wint sea ic cov thes biolog and phys perturb hav affect the ecosystem profound on hypothes guid ecolog interpret of chang in top pred pop in thi reg the sea ic hypothes propos that reduc in wint sea ic hav led direct to declin in ic lov specy by decreas their wint habit whil pop of ic avoid specy hav increas howev y of field study and rec survey of penguin throughout the wap and scot sea demonst thi mech is not control penguin pop pop of both ic lov ad√©lie and ic avoid chinstrap penguin hav declin sign we argu in fav of an altern mor robust hypothes that attribut both increas and decreas in penguin pop to chang in the abund of their main prey antarct kril unlik many oth pred in thi reg ad√©lie and chinstrap penguin wer nev direct harvest by man thu their pop traject track the impact of biolog and environ chang in thi ecosystem link trend in penguin abund with trend in kril biomass explain why pop of ad√©lie and chinstrap penguin increas aft competit fur seal baleen whal and som fish wer near extirp in the th to mid th century and cur ar decreas in respons to clim chang,new,0.8651661332499855,0.8246431360312504,0.7913016321079565,0.7636072804759741,0.7399753762004774,0.7192538657504752,0.7006067951834801,0.6833606539100783,0.6668562958517112,0.6502207021699675,0.6318545543426534
187,fish_antarctic,Modelling the impact of fishery by-catches on albatross populations,"1. Several albatross species, including the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, have shown marked declines in abundance throughout their range. These seabirds are frequently taken as by-catch in longline fisheries and this mortality has been implicated in the population declines. 2. We developed a deterministic, density-dependent, age-structured model for assessing the effects of longlining on wandering albatross populations. We used demographic data from field studies at South Georgia and the Crozet Islands, data on albatross abundance from 1960 to 1995, and reported effort data from the tuna longline fisheries south of 30¬∞S, to model estimated by-catch levels and other population parameters in the model. 3. The model used two alternative assumptions about patterns of at-sea distribution of wandering albatross (uniform between 30¬∞S-60¬∞S; proportional to the distribution of longline fishing effort between these latitudes). 4. Our model was able to predict reasonably closely the observed data from the Crozet Islands wandering albatross population, but the fit to the South Georgia population was substantially poorer. This probably reflects: (i) greater overlap in the Indian Ocean than in the Atlantic Ocean between the main areas of tuna longline fishing and the foraging ranges of wandering albatrosses from the Crozet Islands and South Georgia, respectively; and (ii) greater impact of poorly documented longline fisheries, especially the tuna fisheries in the south Atlantic and the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fishery, within the foraging range of wandering albatrosses from South Georgia. 5. The model results suggest that the marked decline in both populations, and subsequent recovery of the Crozet Islands population (but not the continued decline of the South Georgia population), can be explained by the tuna longline by-catch. They further indicate that populations may be able to sustain some level of incidental take. However, the likely under-reporting of fishing effort (especially in non-tuna longline fisheries) and the delicate balance between a sustainable and unsustainable level of by-catch for these long-lived populations suggest great caution in any application of such findings.",10.1046/j.0021-8901.2001.00661.x,2-s2.0-0035674492,28,0.807519707,1,model the impact of fishery by catch on albatross pop sev albatross specy includ the wand albatross diomede ex hav shown mark declin in abund throughout their rang thes seabird ar frequ tak as by catch in longlin fishery and thi mort has been imply in the pop declin we develop a determin dens depend ag structured model for assess the effect of longlin on wand albatross pop we us demograph dat from field study at sou georg and the crozet island dat on albatross abund from to and report effort dat from the tun longlin fishery sou of ¬∞s to model estim by catch level and oth pop paramet in the model the model us two altern assum about pattern of at sea distribut of wand albatross uniform between ¬∞s ¬∞s proport to the distribut of longlin fish effort between thes latitud our model was abl to predict reason clos the observ dat from the crozet island wand albatross pop but the fit to the sou georg pop was subst poor thi prob reflect i gre overlap in the ind oc than in the atl oc between the main area of tun longlin fish and the for rang of wand albatross from the crozet island and sou georg respect and ii gre impact of poor docu longlin fishery espec the tun fishery in the sou atl and the patagon toothf dissostich eleginoid fishery within the for rang of wand albatross from sou georg the model result suggest that the mark declin in both pop and subsequ recovery of the crozet island pop but not the continu declin of the sou georg pop can be explain by the tun longlin by catch they furth ind that pop may be abl to sustain som level of incid tak howev the lik und report of fish effort espec in non tun longlin fishery and the del bal between a sustain and unsustain level of by catch for thes long liv pop suggest gre caut in any apply of such find,new,0.8448957180681236,0.8012019436601114,0.7650246972897167,0.7349690337257524,0.7094955767215172,0.6874503022893143,0.6680076897080933,0.6505587138732751,0.6346196119557006,0.619738845933765,0.6053881289196524

Notothenia rossii in the Atlantic Ocean sector - Revisited,"Notothenia rossii was the first target species in Southern Ocean fisheries. The species was already heavily fished at the beginning of the 1970s. The closure of the fishery for this species in 1985 was one of the first conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR. Fish biomass within a CCAMLR subarea or part of a subarea is commonly estimated from surveys that target a number of species, including N. rossii, at the same time. These surveys are conducted under the assumption that the target fish species are more or less evenly distributed over the area at the time of the survey. This assumption is violated in the case of N. rossii, which is non-randomly distributed such that a large proportion of the population tends to aggregate in small areas, leaving most of the survey area only thinly populated. In order to provide more accurate estimates of the abundance of the species, it is suggested that an acoustic survey combined with a number of identification hauls might be the most promising approach to estimating the biomass of N. rossii.",,2-s2.0-9644284518,161,0.806992681,0,is the attempt to estim the biomass of antarct fish from a mult specy survey appropry for al target specy notothen rossi in the atl oc sect revisit notothen rossi was the first target specy in southern oc fishery the specy was already heavy fish at the begin of the s the clos of the fishery for thi specy in was on of the first conserv meas adopt by ccamlr fish biomass within a ccamlr subare or part of a subare is common estim from survey that target a numb of specy includ n rossi at the sam tim thes survey ar conduc und the assum that the target fish specy ar mor or less ev distribut ov the are at the tim of the survey thi assum is viol in the cas of n rossi which is non random distribut such that a larg proport of the pop tend to aggreg in smal area leav most of the survey are on thin pop in ord to provid mor acc estim of the abund of the specy it is suggest that an acoust survey combin with a numb of id haul might be the most prom approach to estim the biomass of n rossi,new,0.8161028886380549,0.7477992487330497,0.6911093884154749,0.6447215280083566,0.6061840574725522,0.5734964322468351,0.5451865574500001,0.5201514615437668,0.4974933780624542,0.47632834857192113,0.4554837117579033
207,fish_antarctic,Factors influencing population trends of some abundant vertebrates in sardine-rich coastal ecosystems,"Many abundant populations of vertebrates in sardine-rich coastal ecosystems have experienced large changes in population sizes. This has led to wide fluctuations of some fish harvests and concern over the conservation status of some top predators. Research over the past 20 years into the causes of population changes of some abundant fish species, some southern pinnipeds and the most important guano-producing seabirds is briefly reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to populations off south-western Africa. Fish populations have been influenced in a complex manner by a variety of factors, including fishing, biological interactions and environmental change. Climate, operating at a basin scale, is probably an important cause of large and long-term changes in the abundance of some sardine populations. The impact of anticipated climate change on sardine-rich ecosystems is expected to receive emphasis in the future. The populations of some pinnipeds and seabirds were drastically reduced by former excessive harvests. Whereas pinnipeds have tended to recover under regimes of controlled exploitation, the numbers of some seabirds have continued to decrease even in the absence of exploitation. Various factors have contributed to the ongoing decreases, including competition with fisheries for prey resources and competition with pinnipeds for breeding space. The 1980s saw the introduction of legislation specifying conservation of marine ecosystems as a management objective in Antarctica and South Africa. Means of achieving this objective, given the biological interactions at the upper end of the trophic pathway, are expected to provide another focus for future research. ¬© 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.2989/02577619109504645,2-s2.0-0008275236,119,0.8023529779999999,1,fact influ pop trend of som abund vertebr in sardin rich coast ecosystem many abund pop of vertebr in sardin rich coast ecosystem hav expery larg chang in pop siz thi has led to wid fluctu of som fish harvest and concern ov the conserv stat of som top pred research ov the past year into the caus of pop chang of som abund fish specy som southern pinnip and the most import guano produc seabird is brief review particul emphas is giv to pop off sou western afric fish pop hav been influ in a complex man by a vary of fact includ fish biolog interact and environ chang clim op at a basin scal is prob an import caus of larg and long term chang in the abund of som sardin pop the impact of anticip clim chang on sardin rich ecosystem is expect to receiv emphas in the fut the pop of som pinnip and seabird wer drast reduc by form excess harvest wherea pinnip hav tend to recov und regim of control exploit the numb of som seabird hav continu to decreas ev in the abs of exploit vary fact hav contribut to the ongo decreas includ competit with fishery for prey resourc and competit with pinnip for bree spac the s saw the introduc of legisl spec conserv of marin ecosystem as a man object in antarctic and sou afric mean of achiev thi object giv the biolog interact at the up end of the troph pathway ar expect to provid anoth foc for fut research,new,0.8564616251103851,0.824276887883563,0.7984046699677405,0.7770257291755222,0.7587731018167643,0.7427305998579509,0.7282549418832799,0.714841408832148,0.7020136777561583,0.6891716868652273,0.6753092462832995
2111,fish_antarctic,The importance of the Patagonian Shelf for top predator species breeding at South Georgia,"1. The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals. These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf. 2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the east to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle. 3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species. 4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered. 5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators. ¬© 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/aqc.480,2-s2.0-0036117415,174,0.801142872,0,the import of the patagon shelf for top pred specy bree at sou georg the rich zooplankton fish and squid resourc on the patagon shelf sustain subst pop of larg resid seabird and marin mam thes habit ar also visit season by simil specy from elsewh but few dat ex on their stat and origin rec study us satellit track to determin for rang and fee area of seabird and marin mam bree at sou georg hav shown that sev specy mak subst us of the wat of the patagon shelf wand albatross us shelf edg area year round with direct observ of both sex of almost al ag class includ bree pre bree and non bree individ whit chin petrel and fem northern and southern giant petrel main visit dur incub and post bree particul to the falkland cur whit chin petrel and to upwel area around the southern shelf break from the burdwood bank in the east to stat island and diego ramirez in the west giant petrel northern giant petrel mal dur incub and antarct fur seal in wint reach in shelf habit in the northern sect in contrast sou georg pop of black brow and grey head albatross do not appear to us the patagon shelf at any stag of their bree cyc although the us of the patagon shelf by visit specy is now best docu for sou georg specy rec observ dat confirm that seabird from diego ramirez trist da cunh and gough visit the southern and northern sect dur both bree and non bree season respect sev antarct specy not antarct fulm and cap petrel wint in the reg as do at least two albatross specy from new zealand oth specy espec wilson s storm petrel us it as a stag ground on migr as do sev specy of baleen whal and poss oth cetac specy three of the seabird specy which bree on the patagon shelf ar glob threatened sev of the visit specy and four baleen whal specy also hav thi stat the patagon shelf is theref not on of glob import for the divers and abund of it resid top pred but is just as crit for the surv of many visit specy som of which ar ev mor endang combin dat from satellit track with conv map from direct observ off the prospect of defin the for rang and the main fee area within thes of a rang of key top pred specy such dat should be us in conjunct with simil inform of the distribut of fish squid and zooplankton resourc and of fish effort to ident crit marin habit whos precaut multipl us sustain man wil be vit to protect the interest of both commerc fish and top pred,new,0.8859425082326023,0.8270044553532596,0.7726169861938424,0.7243167536346171,0.6813011371406281,0.6423657796156519,0.6063313466162484,0.5720254863661567,0.5380834314275701,0.5024597294234249,0.4611978216875778
226,fish_antarctic,Biological characteristics of Antarctic fish stocks in the southern Scotia Arc region,"Commercial exploitation of finfish in the southern Scotia Arc took place from 1977/78 to 1989/90, and was in its heyday from 1977/78 to 1981/82. Except for Elephant Island, the state of fish stocks of the southern Scotia Arc region has been accorded little attention until 1998, despite substantial catches in the first four years of the fishery and ample opportunity to sample these catches. The only scientific surveys of these stocks during these years were conducted by Germany in 1985, and by Spain in 1987 and 1991. More recently, the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (US AMLR) Program carried out two extensive surveys around Elephant Island and the lower South Shetland Islands in March 1998 and around the South Orkney Islands in March 1999. In this paper, the authors present new data on species composition, species groups, length compositions, length-weight relationships, length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning, gonadosomatic indices and oocyte diameter. Lesser Antarctic or peri-Antarctic species predominated in the fish fauna. Species groups differed by up to 55-60% from one shelf area to the other, mostly due to differences in the abundance of the predominant species on each shelf area and the increase in the number of high-Antarctic species in the South Orkney Islands. Length compositions and the proportion of large (= old) specimens in the populations provided no evidence of illegal fishing since the closure of the region some 10 years ago. Differences in length-weight relationships between areas were primarily due to differences in length compositions of the fish caught, but did not suggest geographical differences in length-to-weight growth. Differences in estimates of length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning indicate that in some species final maturation of the gonads takes one year or more, whereas in others gonad maturation was completed within one season. Length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning in Champsocephalus gunnari was one year later on the southerly grounds than at South Georgia. The distribution of gonadosomatic indices in March suggested that Lepidonotothen squamifrons was spawning while Trematomus hansoni was already coming to the end of its reproductive season. Chionodraco rastrospinosus and Trematomus eulepidotus were close to spawning. Other species, such as Notothenia rossii and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, spawn at least one to two months later than at South Georgia. Channichthyids (except C. gunnari), Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps have egg diameters of 4.3-5.2 mm at spawning. The Trematomus species investigated have egg diameters of 2.8-3.2 mm while in species of the genera Gobionotothen and Lepidonotothen, egg diameters rarely exceeded 2.0 mm. Measurements of oocyte diameters confirmed the findings on spawning time estimated from gonadosomatic indices.",,2-s2.0-0001927928,163,0.798233295,0,biolog charact of antarct fish stock in the southern scot arc reg commerc exploit of finf in the southern scot arc took plac from to and was in it heyday from to exceiv for eleph island the stat of fish stock of the southern scot arc reg has been accord littl at until despit subst catch in the first four year of the fishery and ampl opportun to sampl thes catch the on sci survey of thes stock dur thes year wer conduc by germany in and by spain in and mor rec the us antarct marin liv resourc us amlr program carry out two extend survey around eleph island and the low sou shetland island in march and around the sou orkney island in march in thi pap the auth pres new dat on specy composit specy group leng composit leng weight rel leng at sex mat and leng at first spawn gonadosom ind and oocyt diamet less antarct or per antarct specy predomin in the fish faun specy group diff by up to from on shelf are to the oth most due to diff in the abund of the predomin specy on each shelf are and the increas in the numb of high antarct specy in the sou orkney island leng composit and the proport of larg old specim in the pop provid no evid of illeg fish sint the clos of the reg som year ago diff in leng weight rel between area wer prim due to diff in leng composit of the fish caught but did not suggest geograph diff in leng to weight grow diff in estim of leng at sex mat and leng at first spawn ind that in som specy fin mat of the gonad tak on year or mor wherea in oth gonad mat was complet within on season leng at sex mat and leng at first spawn in champsocephal gunnar was on year lat on the south ground than at sou georg the distribut of gonadosom ind in march suggest that lepidonototh squamifron was spawn whil trematom hanson was already com to the end of it reproduc season chionodraco rastrospinos and trematom eulepidot wer clos to spawn oth specy such as notothen rossi and pseudochaenichthy georgian spawn at least on to two month lat than at sou georg channichthyid exceiv c gunnar notothen rossi and notothen coriicep hav eg diamet of mm at spawn the trematom specy investig hav eg diamet of mm whil in specy of the gener gobionototh and lepidonototh eg diamet rar excess mm meas of oocyt diamet confirm the find on spawn tim estim from gonadosom ind,new,0.847048461243416,0.7918802577790958,0.7451368150896149,0.7061119895694697,0.6731028392773718,0.6446484387131571,0.6196379790883542,0.5972119323159694,0.5766398433177528,0.5571466436455933,0.5375811521769999
237,fish_antarctic,"Krill (Euphausia superba) abundance and Ad√©lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding performance in the waters off the B√©chervaise Island colony, East Antarctica in 2 years with contrasting ecological conditions","In 2001 and 2003 small-scale acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) distribution and abundance were conducted offshore from an East Antarctic colony of Adelie penguins on Bechervaise Island (67¬∞35‚Ä≤S, 62¬∞49‚Ä≤E) that has been monitored for 15 years. Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early cr√®che stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years. Oceanographically, the two summers differed; in 2003 the mixed layer was fresher and shallower, indicating a delayed melting of sea-ice in the study area when compared to 2001. Satellite observations indicated that the pack-ice directly offshore from the Mawson coast broke out earlier in 2001 and the perennial fast-ice along the coast persisted later in 2003.

247,fish_antarctic,Assemblages of micronektonic fishes and invertebrates in a gradient of regional warming along the Western Antarctic Peninsula,"Micronektonic fishes and invertebrates were sampled with 32 midwater trawls at nine sites along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the austral fall (March-April) of 2010. Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site.Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii.Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system. ¬© 2015.",10.1016/j.jmarsys.2015.07.005,2-s2.0-84939506886,112,0.7910138959999999,0,assembl of micronekton fish and invertebr in a grady of reg warm along the western antarct peninsul micronekton fish and invertebr wer sampl with midw trawl at nin sit along the western antarct peninsul wap in the aust fal march april of study sit wer loc within four hypothes hydrograph reg near joinvil island in reg i at crok pass near anv island and near renaud island in reg ii within marguerit bay and the marguerit trough in reg ii and near charcot island in reg iv a tot of tax repres taxonom group of pel invertebr and famy of fish wer capt but assembl wer domin by on a few specy the most num abund tax wer the euphausiid thysanoess macrur euphaus superb and e crystallorophia combin to contribut near of the tot catch biomass domin includ e superb which contribut mor than of the tot catch the notothenioid pleuragramm antarctic and the salp salp thompson a comparison of tot catch among sit rev that the largest volumet abund and biomass wer capt at the marguerit bay sit clust analys of abund dat ident distinct multispecy assembl at joinvil island in reg i crok pass in reg ii marguerit bay in reg ii and charcot island in reg iv a fif distinct assembl includ sampl from sit near anv and renaud island in reg ii and from the marguerit trough in reg ii assembl at joinvil island and crok pass wer both domin by e superb and s thompson but hydrograph condit at joinvil island fav a nerit assembl undersc by subst numb of p antarctic the assembl at crok pass was mor oc in nat with maj input from the myctophid electron antarctic and the hyperiid amphipod themisto gaudichaudi marguerit bay and charcot island wer wel mix assembl with strong repres by both nerit and oc faun the mid peninsul assembl was oc in charact being overwhelm domin by thysanoess macrur and t gaudichaudi pleuragramm antarctic wer capt at fiv sit joinvil island crok pass marguerit bay and the two sit near charcot island they wer complet abs at the two sit near anv island at renaud island and in the marguerit trough on fish was capt in crok pass the maj of fish capt in marguerit bay wer larg than mm standard leng sl with very few fish of smal siz pres if resid pop of pleuragramm reproduc and recruit loc rath than being sustain by larv advect thos pop wil be high suscept to loc disappear thi may be the caus fact behind the abs of pleuragramm from the mid peninsul reg continu warm and subsequ sea ic reduc may not on caus pleuragramm pop collaps in the marguerit bay and charcot island reg but may also chang the charact of the faun assembl along the wap to thos of an oc system,new,0.8028615155453713,0.7259539490388629,0.6627217539835604,0.6117134309438464,0.5699809682071771,0.5351408352796858,0.5054852154074067,0.4797987071120072,0.45719626995870133,0.4370008557370885,0.4186553760909616

The size of the breeding population on the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, New Zealand, is unknown. Disappointment Island is thought to be the main white-chinned petrel breeding site in the Auckland Islands, and maybe also in the New Zealand region, and has never had introduced mammalian predators. We estimated the white-chinned petrel breeding population size taking into account the detection probability of burrows via distance sampling and the burrow occupancy rate. Eighty line transects were distributed over the island, with a total line length of 1600¬†m. Burrows were patchily distributed and most abundant in dense megaherb communities. White-chinned petrel burrow density D^ was 654 burrows/ha (95¬†% CI 528‚Äì809 burrows/ha), with burrow detection probability p^ varying among vegetation communities from 0.28¬†¬±¬†0.02 to 0.43¬†¬±¬†0.02 (¬±SE).

266,fish_antarctic,"An analysis of temporal variability in abundance, diversity and growth rates within the coastal ichthyoplankton assemblage of South Georgia (sub-Antarctic)","The study of spatial and temporal distribution and diversity of ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae) can provide fisheries-independent information on the population dynamics and recruitment processes of marine fish species. Ichthyoplankton studies in the Southern Ocean have to date been largely constrained to the summer months. We analysed ichthyoplankton data collected from a year round, long term (2002-2008), plankton trawl sampling programme in a large fjord system (Cumberland Bay) at South Georgia, sub-Antarctic (54.25¬∞S, 36.5¬∞W) to assess temporal changes in larval fish diversity and abundance. Larvae of 22 species, representing nine families, were identified although three, Krefftichthys anderssoni (Myctophidae), Lepidonotothen nudifrons/Trematomus hansoni (Nototheniidae) and Champsocephalus gunnari (Channichthyidae), dominated abundance in all years. Significant seasonal and interannual differences in the larval fish assemblage were revealed by multivariate analyses. Estimates of larval growth are provided for five abundant species. Considerable inter-specific differences in relative larval growth rate were recorded but interannual variability within species was small. However, in the commercially important C. gunnari, multiple larval cohorts, representing a protracted spawning season, were observed to grow at different rates, and this may be related to temperature and/or food availability.

Juvenile N. rossii dominated the nearshore catches both in abundance (77%) and biomass (61%). Together, the 4 fish species comprise 95% of all fish sampled and 97% of the total biomass caught by trammel net. There were large seasonal variations in the numbers of N. neglecta, P. georgianus and C. aceratus in coastal habitats. Numbers of N. rossii remained consistently high throughout the year.

285,fish_antarctic,Do large whales have an impact on commercial fishing in the South Pacific Ocean?,"Although there is evidence that some populations of large whales in the Southern Hemisphere have increased in recent years, differences in feeding behaviour and migration patterns largely precludes direct competition between these and coastal and pelagic fisheries in the South Pacific Ocean. In particular, many of the whales that spend at least part of their year in the South Pacific make feeding migrations in summer to Antarctic waters where some estimates put their food intake at 90% of annual consumption. Others, such as female sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), which do not migrate from tropical/subtropical South Pacific waters, feed at depths greater than that usually occupied by species that are the targets of commercial fisheries, such as the tunas (Thunnus spp.). Thus, even though consumption by whales is high, dietary overlap with commercially fished species is relatively low as much of their feeding is in waters that are not exploited by fisheries. However, there are a number of anecdotal reports that some smaller cetacean species, in particular killer and pilot whales, take fish from longlines set in the region, although more are lost to sharks. However, it should be noted that any assessment of interactions between whales and fisheries is limited by a lack of qualitative and quantitative data. Abundance estimates, particularly for some of the smaller species in the South Pacific region, are only order of magnitude estimates. Furthermore, knowledge of food chains (and their interactions) for many cetaceans in the South Pacific is sketchy making assessment of their impact on local fisheries difficult.",10.1023/A:1015451624024,2-s2.0-0034444754,157,0.758274585,0,do larg whal hav an impact on commerc fish in the sou pac oc although ther is evid that som pop of larg whal in the southern hemisph hav increas in rec year diff in fee behavio and migr pattern larg preclud direct competit between thes and coast and pel fishery in the sou pac oc in particul many of the whal that spend at least part of their year in the sou pac mak fee migr in sum to antarct wat wher som estim put their food intak at of an consum oth such as fem sperm whal physet macrocephal which do not migr from trop subtrop sou pac wat fee at depth gre than that us occupy by specy that ar the target of commerc fishery such as the tuna thunn spp thu ev though consum by whal is high diet overlap with commerc fish specy is rel low as much of their fee is in wat that ar not exploit by fishery howev ther ar a numb of anecdot report that som smal cetac specy in particul kil and pilot whal tak fish from longlin set in the reg although mor ar lost to shark howev it should be not that any assess of interact between whal and fishery is limit by a lack of qualit and quantit dat abund estim particul for som of the smal specy in the sou pac reg ar on ord of magnitud estim furtherm knowledg of food chain and their interact for many cetac in the sou pac is sketchy mak assess of their impact on loc fishery difficult,new,0.8310734505836893,0.7728092328059143,0.723808178670081,0.6829905838547162,0.6484697723387388,0.6186869989379883,0.5924729610817937,0.5689320279508386,0.5473183378187857,0.5268904109785352,0.5067062965884993
404,fish_antarctic,"Diversity, relative abundance, new locality records and population structure of Antarctic demersal fishes from the northern Scotia Arc islands and Bouvet√∏ya","A primary objective of the ICEFISH 2004 cruise was to collect and study notothenioid fishes from remote localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Nearly 1 month was devoted to bottom trawling for fishes on the shelf and upper slope (to 1,000 m) areas around Shag Rocks, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet√∏ya. The focus was on the latter two locations, because their faunas are more poorly known. Eight species were collected at Shag Rocks with Patagonotothen guntheri most abundant; 17 at South Georgia with Lepidonotothen nudifrons, L. larseni and Gobionotothen gibberifrons most abundant; 13 at the South Sandwich Islands with L. larseni, L. nudifrons and G. gibberifrons most abundant; and 11 at Bouvet√∏ya with L. larseni, Macrourus holotrachys and L. squamifrons most abundant. Ten new locality records were established: Shag Rocks (1), South Georgia (1), South Sandwich Islands (5), South Sandwich Trench at 5,350 m (1) and Bouvet√∏ya (2). Total known demersal fish diversity on the shelf and upper slope at Shag Rocks/South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet√∏ya is 42, 31 and 17 species, respectively. To examine population structure in the four most abundant notothenioids at Bouvet√∏ya (L. larseni, L. squamifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and Chaenocephalus aceratus), we examined the ND2 portion of mitochondrial DNA. Chaenocephalus aceratus, N. coriiceps and L. larseni exhibited no significant genetic differentiation in comparison with samples from localities in the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, L. squamifrons showed significant genetic differentiation between the South Shetlands and Bouvet√∏ya populations (F ST = 0.189, P = 0.015). Thus, these data combined with previous studies of two other notothenioids suggest that five of the six notothenioid species at Bouvet√∏ya are not genetically differentiated from other localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The location of Bouvet√∏ya within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the long (1-2 years) pelagic stages of the notothenioids at Bouvet√∏ya may be at least partly responsible for this genetic homogeneity. ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00300-008-0489-x,2-s2.0-53949110972,1,0.7285921609999999,0,divers rel abund new loc record and pop structure of antarct demers fish from the northern scot arc island and bouvet√∏ya a prim object of the icef cru was to collect and study notothenioid fish from remot loc in the atl sect of the southern oc near mon was devot to bottom trawl for fish on the shelf and up slop to m area around shag rock sou georg sou sandwich island and bouvet√∏ya the foc was on the lat two loc becaus their fauna ar mor poor known eight specy wer collect at shag rock with patagonototh gunther most abund at sou georg with lepidonototh nudifron l larsen and gobionototh gibberifron most abund at the sou sandwich island with l larsen l nudifron and g gibberifron most abund and at bouvet√∏ya with l larsen macrour holotrachy and l squamifron most abund ten new loc record wer est shag rock sou georg sou sandwich island sou sandwich trench at m and bouvet√∏ya tot known demers fish divers on the shelf and up slop at shag rock sou georg sou sandwich island and bouvet√∏ya is and specy respect to examin pop structure in the four most abund notothenioid at bouvet√∏ya l larsen l squamifron notothen coriicep and chaenocephal acerat we examin the nd port of mitochondr dna chaenocephal acerat n coriicep and l larsen exhibit no sign genet differenty in comparison with sampl from loc in the scot sea and the antarct peninsul howev l squamifron show sign genet differenty between the sou shetland and bouvet√∏ya pop f st p thu thes dat combin with prevy study of two oth notothenioid suggest that fiv of the six notothenioid specy at bouvet√∏ya ar not genet differenty from oth loc in the atl sect of the southern oc the loc of bouvet√∏ya within the antarct circumpol cur and the long year pel stag of the notothenioid at bouvet√∏ya may be at least part respons for thi genet homog,new,0.7364630158856865,0.6436389300948114,0.5722380404307622,0.5181762281438409,0.4765533056941589,0.44389582180149695,0.4179680075835986,0.3974070438818646,0.38153554920043764,0.37042980270971176,0.36552597711317314
433,fish_antarctic,Distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) along the Antarctic Peninsula,"Net-based data on the abundance, distribution, and demographic patterns of Antarctic krill are quantified from a contemporaneous two ship survey of the Antarctic Peninsula during austral summer 2011. Two survey areas were sampled focussed on Marguerite Bay in the south, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the north. Data from 177 stations showed that the highest concentrations of krill were found in the southern sampling area. Differences between areas were associated with a few large catches of one year old krill found in anomalously warm and productive waters in Marguerite Bay, and small krill catches in the less-productive, offshore waters in the north. Estimated krill density across the survey area was 3.4krillm-2, and was low compared to the long-term average of 45krillm-2 for the Elephant Island area. Overall recruitment between the two survey regions was similar, but per capita recruitment was about 60% lower than historical mean recruitment levels measured at Elephant Island since the late 1970s. Demographic patterns showed small krill concentrated near the coast, and large krill concentrated offshore on the shelf and slope all along the survey area. The offshore distribution of adult krill was delineated by the warm (~1¬∞C), low salinity (33.8) water at 30m, suggesting that most krill were present shoreward of the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Distributions of larvae indicated that three hotspot areas were important for the production of krill: slope areas outside Marguerite Bay and north of the South Shetland Islands, and near the coast around Antarctic Sound. Successful spawning, as inferred from larval abundance, was roughly coincident with the shelf break and not with inshore waters. Given the rapid changes in climate along the Antarctic Peninsula and the lower per capita recruitment observed in recent years, studies comparing and contrasting production, growth, and recruitment across the Peninsula will be critical to better understand how climate change will impact krill populations and their dependent predators in the Scotia Sea. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.dsr.2013.02.005,2-s2.0-84878417362,3,0.7269929709999999,0,distribut and abund of antarct kril euphaus superb along the antarct peninsul net bas dat on the abund distribut and demograph pattern of antarct kril ar quant from a contemp two ship survey of the antarct peninsul dur aust sum two survey area wer sampl focuss on marguerit bay in the sou and the tip of the antarct peninsul in the nor dat from stat show that the highest cont of kril wer found in the southern sampl are diff between area wer assocy with a few larg catch of on year old kril found in anom warm and produc wat in marguerit bay and smal kril catch in the less produc offsh wat in the nor estim kril dens across the survey are was krillm and was low comp to the long term av of krillm for the eleph island are overal recruit between the two survey reg was simil but per capit recruit was about low than hist mean recruit level meas at eleph island sint the lat s demograph pattern show smal kril cont near the coast and larg kril cont offsh on the shelf and slop al along the survey are the offsh distribut of adult kril was delin by the warm ¬∞c low salin wat at m suggest that most kril wer pres shoreward of the southern bound of antarct circumpol cur front distribut of larva ind that three hotspot area wer import for the produc of kril slop area outsid marguerit bay and nor of the sou shetland island and near the coast around antarct sound success spawn as infer from larv abund was rough coincid with the shelf break and not with insh wat giv the rapid chang in clim along the antarct peninsul and the low per capit recruit observ in rec year study comp and contrast produc grow and recruit across the peninsul wil be crit to bet understand how clim chang wil impact kril pop and their depend pred in the scot sea,new,0.8140509138304288,0.726842375188892,0.6524854817787793,0.5919100662421197,0.5424636090013972,0.5014690258824551,0.4668349971129203,0.4369729653279016,0.4106001781634375,0.38647173441499794,0.36288721176893207
451,fish_antarctic,Krill population dynamics at South Georgia: Implications for ecosystem-based fisheries management,"The South Georgia region supports a large biomass of krill that is subject to high interannual variability. The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change. ¬© 2010 Inter-Research.",10.3354/meps08356,2-s2.0-76249085454,32,0.724651653,0,kril pop dynam at sou georg imply for ecosystem bas fishery man the sou georg reg support a larg biomass of kril that is subject to high interan vary the app lack of a loc self maintain kril pop at sou georg mean that understand the mech und thes observ pop charact is ess to success ecosystem bas man of kril fishery in the reg kril acoust dens dat from survey conduc in the ear middl and lat period of the sum of to togeth with kril pop siz structure ov the sam period from pred diet dat wer us with a kril pop dynam model to evalu pot mech behind the observ chang in kril biomass kril abund was highest dur the middl of the sum in year and in the lat period in year in the lat ther was evid that kril recruit was delay by sev month a model scenario that includ empir der estim of both the magnitud and tim of recruit in each year show the greatest correl with the acoust sery the result ar consist with a kril pop with allochthon recruit ent a retain adult pop i e oc transport of adult kril doe not appear to be the maj fact determin the dynam of the adult pop the result highlight the import of the tim of recruit espec wher thi could introduc a mismatch between the peak of kril abund and the peak demand from pred which may exacerb the effect of chang in kril pop ar from commerc harvest and or clim chang,new,0.786955999729121,0.7397027905143267,0.7032199863004056,0.675115254763182,0.6532417705047839,0.6361735345071136,0.623061624214602,0.6135106960378783,0.6075861117814995,0.6060515885681034,0.6112183071868176
483,fish_antarctic,"Fish populations of Port Foster, Deception Island, Antarctica and vicinity","The fish populations of Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were investigated as part of the Erupt Antarctic ecosystem study. Surveys were conducted on five cruises between March 1999 and November 2000. Samples also were collected off Livingston Island and King George Island of the South Shetland Islands. Specimens were collected or observed using a multiple opening and closing net and environmental sampling system, otter trawls, benthic line-transect photography, and remotely operated vehicle video. Species composition, length, weight, reproductive condition, diet, habitat, and parasitic infestation were examined for the dominant fish species. Eleven species were collected, all in the suborder Notothenioidei. The fishes found in the survey are known to occur in the region and had diets similar to those found in other studies. Abundances of demersal fishes in Port Foster ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 individuals m-2 over the study period. Inshore shallow-water (&lt;30 m) and inshore deep-water (&gt; 30 m) habitats are identified in Port Foster and described. Port Foster may be a refuge for juvenile fishes such as Champsocephalus gunnari. Limited exchange with the surrounding waters also may limit the influence of recruitment and prey abundance fluctuations outside Port Foster. Trematomus scotti had heavy body cavity parasite infestation from Port Foster, possibly due in part to decreased benthic scour from large icebergs, allowing benthic parasites to persist. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

492,fish_antarctic,Interdecadal changes in at-sea distribution and abundance of subantarctic seabirds along a latitudinal gradient in the Southern Indian Ocean,"Long-term demographic studies have recently shown that global climate change together with increasing direct impacts of human activities, such as fisheries, are affecting the population dynamics of marine top predators. However, the effects of these factors on species distribution and abundance at sea are still poorly understood, particularly in marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Using a unique long-term data set of at-sea observations, we tested for interdecadal (1980s vs. 2000s) changes in summer abundance and distribution of 12 species of Albatrosses and Petrels along a 30¬∞ latitudinal gradient between tropical and Antarctic waters of the southern Indian Ocean. There were contrasting effects of climate change on subantarctic seabird distribution and abundance at sea. While subtropical waters showed the highest rate of warming, the species that visited this water mass showed the greatest changes in distribution and abundance. The abundance of Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) and Giant Petrels (Macronectes sp.) declined markedly, whereas the other species showed contrasting trends or did not change. With the exception of the White-chinned Petrel, these decreases were at least partly related to regional increase in sea surface temperature. The southward shift of Wandering Albatross and Prions (Pachyptila spp.) distributions could be ascribed to species redistribution or decrease in abundance due to warming of the subtropical waters. Surprisingly, White-chinned Petrel distribution shifted northward, suggesting more complex mechanisms. This study is the first to document a shift in species range in the Southern Ocean related to climate change and contrasting abundance changes. It suggests that some species might experience more severe impacts from climate change depending on the water masses they visit. As climate changes are predicted to continue in the next decades, understanding species responses to climate change is crucial for conservation management, especially when their conservation status is critical or unknown. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02169.x,2-s2.0-77954160232,11,0.7163170440000001,1,interdecad chang in at sea distribut and abund of subantarct seabird along a latitudin grady in the southern ind oc long term demograph study hav rec shown that glob clim chang togeth with increas direct impact of hum act such as fishery ar affect the pop dynam of marin top pred howev the effect of thes fact on specy distribut and abund at sea ar stil poor understood particul in marin ecosystem of the southern hemisph us a un long term dat set of at sea observ we test for interdecad s vs s chang in sum abund and distribut of specy of albatross and petrel along a ¬∞ latitudin grady between trop and antarct wat of the southern ind oc ther wer contrast effect of clim chang on subantarct seabird distribut and abund at sea whil subtrop wat show the highest rat of warm the specy that visit thi wat mass show the greatest chang in distribut and abund the abund of wand albatross diomede ex whit chin petrel procellar aequinoct and giant petrel macronect sp declin mark wherea the oth specy show contrast trend or did not chang with the exceiv of the whit chin petrel thes decreas wer at least part rel to reg increas in sea surfac temp the southward shift of wand albatross and prion pachyptil spp distribut could be ascrib to specy redistribut or decreas in abund due to warm of the subtrop wat surpr whit chin petrel distribut shift northward suggest mor complex mech thi study is the first to docu a shift in specy rang in the southern oc rel to clim chang and contrast abund chang it suggest that som specy might expery mor sev impact from clim chang depend on the wat mass they visit as clim chang ar predict to continu in the next decad understand specy respons to clim chang is cruc for conserv man espec when their conserv stat is crit or unknown,new,0.8007177937262221,0.7423768235659006,0.6967047349457841,0.6607599985437136,0.631818723665084,0.6080030762322047,0.5880533042719935,0.5710932451319727,0.5564590341045471,0.5435221228606231,0.5314067796648613
651,fish_antarctic,Distribution and abundance of crustaceans of commercial importance in Tanzania mainland coastal waters,"Crustacean species of commercial importance were identified and their abundance and distribution along the Tanzanian coastline (820 km) were determined. A total of eight lobster species, eight prawn species, and two crab species were identified. Among the spiny lobster species (Palinuridae), Panulirus ornatus was the most widely distributed and the most abundant species with 42% of the total individuals sampled and P. homarus and P. penicillatus were the least abundant. The non-spiny lobster Thanus orientalis and two other scyllarid (Scyllaridae) species, Parribacus antarcticus and Scyllarides squamosus were also found in Tanzania, though in very small numbers and of least or no commercial value in the area. Among the prawn species, Metapenaeus monoceros was the most widely distributed, and the most abundant species comprising of about 45% of the total individuals sampled.

671,fish_antarctic,Distribution and abundance of Larvaceans in the Southern Ocean between 30 and 80¬∞E,"Larvaceans are gelatinous zooplankton that inhabit most oceans, coastal waters and estuaries, and are thought to be important grazers of the ocean's primary production. To date there is little known about larvaceans in the Southern Ocean and their ecological role. This paper details a Larvacean survey conducted during the BROKE-West voyage (Jan-Mar 2006) to the southwest Indian Ocean sector of the East Antarctic margin between 30 and 80¬∞E and 60 and 70¬∞S. Larvacean abundances were quantified from three sampling devices: a ring net with 150-Œºm mesh and cross-sectional area of 0.8 m2; a Rectangular Mid-Water Trawl (RMT1) with 300-Œºm mesh and a nominal cross-sectional area of 1 m2; and a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) with a 270-Œºm mesh and a 1.6-cm2 cross-sectional area. The samples collected from the ring net were identified to the species level using stereo dissecting microscopes and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The survey revealed two species: Oikopleura gaussica and Fritillaria drygalski. The abundance of both species increased from &lt;1 ind. m-3 to 5.8 ind. m-3 as the survey progressed from west to east and decreased from 5.8 ind. m-3 in the north to 2 ind. m-3 in the south until the shelf region and marginal sea-ice zone where abundances increased to 4 ind. m-3. Statistically significant relationships were identified between abundance and latitude in samples from the RMT1 and Ring net. There was also a relationship between the larvacean abundance from the RMT1 and longitude. Although larvacean distribution and abundance patterns appeared to agree with the large-scale oceanographic boundaries of the survey area, there were no statistically significant relationships between larvacean abundance and any physical oceanography parameters. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

68,fish_antarctic,Estimating relative abundance of whales from historical Antarctic whaling records,"Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is often the only data available from historical fisheries for inferring distribution and abundance of exploited populations. CPUE underestimates variations in relative abundance when gross effort data are only measured in total operating days. Gross effort includes both searching time and handling time, but only searching time is useful for an index of abundance. A method is developed for estimating searching time by subtracting a maximum likelihood estimate of handling time from the gross effort. An expectation maximization (E-M) algorithm is used to combine maximum likelihood estimates of the handling time with the expected additional operating time due to handling the last catch of each day. Simulation tests show that the estimates of catch per unit of searching time (C/CSW) are much closer to proportionally related to local density than gross CPUE. Estimates of handling time are not unbiased, and some nonlinearity between local density and C/CSW may persist. The methods may be useful for other fisheries where historic gross catch and effort data involve both searching and handling.",10.1139/cjfas-2013-0016,2-s2.0-84891697927,26,0.686566498,1,estim rel abund of whal from hist antarct whal record catch per unit effort cpu is oft the on dat avail from hist fishery for infer distribut and abund of exploit pop cpu underestim vary in rel abund when gross effort dat ar on meas in tot op day gross effort includ both search tim and handl tim but on search tim is us for an index of abund a method is develop for estim search tim by subtract a maxim lik estim of handl tim from the gross effort an expect maxim e m algorithm is us to combin maxim lik estim of the handl tim with the expect addit op tim due to handl the last catch of each day sim test show that the estim of catch per unit of search tim c csw ar much clos to proport rel to loc dens than gross cpu estim of handl tim ar not unbias and som nonlinear between loc dens and c csw may persist the method may be us for oth fishery wher hist gross catch and effort dat involv both search and handl,new,0.6926282653791583,0.628525380497414,0.5820072648517377,0.5480554543328303,0.5229603202465893,0.5044761677998899,0.4913699769829668,0.48316465282323934,0.480155478050523,0.4838630826133037,0.4985949360690022
811,fish_antarctic,"Distribution, abundance and acoustic properties of Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the Ross Sea","Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) is a key link between plankton and the community of top predators in the shelf waters of the Ross Sea. In spite of their abundance and important role in Antarctic food chains, very little is known of many ecological and biological aspects of this species. A combined trawl and acoustic survey of silverfish was carried out on the western Ross Sea shelf during the New Zealand International Polar Year Census of Antarctic Marine Life research voyage on R.V. Tangaroa in February-March 2008. Multi-frequency acoustic data (12, 38, 70, and 120. kHz) allowed discrimination of silverfish marks from those of krill and other associated species. Mark identification was achieved using targeted midwater trawls. Additional midwater and demersal trawls were carried out at randomly selected locations over the shelf as part of the core biodiversity survey. Silverfish were widely distributed over the Ross Sea shelf. Adult silverfish tended to form layers at 100-400. m depth and were sometimes present close to the bottom, where they were frequently caught in demersal trawls shallower than 500. m. A weak layer at about 80. m depth was associated with juvenile silverfish of 50-80. mm standard length. Acoustic backscatter strength from both silverfish and krill marks increased with increasing frequency (i.e., was highest at 120. kHz), which is characteristic of species without an air-filled swimbladder. Acoustic target strengths (TS) for silverfish at 12, 18, 38, 70, and 120. kHz were estimated from anatomically detailed scattering models based on computed tomography (CT) scans of frozen specimens. The relationship between TS and fish length at 38. kHz was sensitive to estimates of density and sound speed contrast within the fish, especially for small specimens (less than 110. mm SL). Our best estimate of the acoustic biomass of silverfish in the study area was 592. 000. t (95% confidence interval 326. 000-866. 000. t). However, the biomass of juvenile silverfish was highly uncertain due to large differences between TS model results. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.05.018,2-s2.0-79851504877,22,0.656260345,0,distribut abund and acoust property of antarct silverf pleuragramm antarctic in the ross sea antarct silverf pleuragramm antarctic is a key link between plankton and the commun of top pred in the shelf wat of the ross sea in spit of their abund and import rol in antarct food chain very littl is known of many ecolog and biolog aspect of thi specy a combin trawl and acoust survey of silverf was carry out on the western ross sea shelf dur the new zealand intern pol year cens of antarct marin lif research voy on r v tangaro in febru march mult frequ acoust dat and khz allow discrimin of silverf mark from thos of kril and oth assocy specy mark id was achiev us target midw trawl addit midw and demers trawl wer carry out at random select loc ov the shelf as part of the cor biodivers survey silverf wer wid distribut ov the ross sea shelf adult silverf tend to form lay at m dep and wer sometim pres clos to the bottom wher they wer frequ caught in demers trawl shallow than m a weak lay at about m dep was assocy with juvenil silverf of mm standard leng acoust backscat strength from both silverf and kril mark increas with increas frequ i e was highest at khz which is charact of specy without an air fil swimblad acoust target strengths ts for silverf at and khz wer estim from anatom detail scat model bas on comput tomograph ct scan of froz specim the rel between ts and fish leng at khz was sensit to estim of dens and sound spee contrast within the fish espec for smal specim less than mm sl our best estim of the acoust biomass of silverf in the study are was t confid interv t howev the biomass of juvenil silverf was high uncertain due to larg diff between ts model result,new,0.7236419626698516,0.6439983207771328,0.584656977412941,0.5405039140482678,0.5069688494151494,0.4810877796658005,0.4610658895332823,0.4459080021799671,0.4352797797362924,0.4296611101876432,0.43113642868123325
821,fish_antarctic,"An Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) hotspot: population characteristics, abundance and vertical structure explored from a krill fishing vessel","Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) aggregate in various ways depending on a range of biological and physical factors. In some areas, typically associated with bathymetric features such as shelf edges and canyons, they may aggregate densely to form hotspots. Despite the importance of such hotspots, their development over time in demographic composition and spatial distribution is not well understood. A fishing vessel during regular operation was used for collection of krill demographic and acoustic data on the shelf northwest of South Orkney Islands. Results show a decrease in the proportion of subadult males, partly reflected in an increase in mature adult males. Concurrently, there was a change in the proportion of males in the sampled population from 0.8 to 0.3, indicating immigration or emigration of krill through the hotspot. A clear trend was observed in the diurnal vertical distribution with deeper and more vertically compact swarms during the day. However, some days displayed very small differences between the day and night distribution and considerable variability in the daytime depth distribution. It was noted that although fishing was carried out during the entire period of the study, there was no obvious trend in the acoustic backscatter, suggesting that the overall krill density was not changing during this period. Using a fishing vessel as a research platform has advantages for understanding the dynamics of the fishery and in quantifying biological and physical processes during actual exploitation of these resources. ¬© 2015, The Author(s).",10.1007/s00300-015-1735-7,2-s2.0-84940963204,8,0.65556384,0,an antarct kril euphaus superb hotspot pop charact abund and vert structure expl from a kril fish vessel antarct kril euphaus superb aggreg in vary way depend on a rang of biolog and phys fact in som area typ assocy with bathymet feat such as shelf edg and canyon they may aggreg dens to form hotspot despit the import of such hotspot their develop ov tim in demograph composit and spat distribut is not wel understood a fish vessel dur regul op was us for collect of kril demograph and acoust dat on the shelf northwest of sou orkney island result show a decreas in the proport of subadult mal part reflect in an increas in mat adult mal concur ther was a chang in the proport of mal in the sampl pop from to ind immigr or emigr of kril through the hotspot a clear trend was observ in the diurn vert distribut with deep and mor vert compact swarm dur the day howev som day display very smal diff between the day and night distribut and consid vary in the daytim dep distribut it was not that although fish was carry out dur the entir period of the study ther was no obvy trend in the acoust backscat suggest that the overal kril dens was not chang dur thi period us a fish vessel as a research platform has adv for understand the dynam of the fishery and in quant biolog and phys process dur act exploit of thes resourc,new,0.7195302377520382,0.6595778523838655,0.6152501065206947,0.5823121667688546,0.5575157204842706,0.5388285185602304,0.5250752250442693,0.5157062041234637,0.5107660989941307,0.5111496967149565,0.5195471748249294
90,fish_antarctic,A nursery area for the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea): First estimate of distribution and abundance of eggs and larvae under the seasonal sea-ice,"Pleuragramma antarcticum is the dominant pelagic fish in the waters of the continental shelf in high Antarctic regions, where it plays a key role in the food web. A nursery ground for eggs of this species was first identified in 2002 in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), where eggs were found trapped in ice platelets under the sea-ice during the spring. As part of a monitoring program aimed at understanding the geographic and temporal characteristics of this nursery ground, the present study reports on surveys carried out in the austral springs of 2005 and 2006 using a simple and effective method for sampling from the sea-ice. These surveys enabled the evaluation of the spatial range of the nursery area of the Antarctic silverfish in the sea-ice of the coastal area of Victoria Land between the Coulman Island and the Drygalski Glacier Tongue. P. antarcticum eggs were concentrated in an area of Terra Nova Bay of about 270 km 2, encompassing two adjacent sites, Gerlache Inlet and Silverfish Bay. The present results add information on life cycle and hatching period of the Antarctic silverfish and confirm the importance of the Terra Nova Bay as a nursery area for this important species. Moreover, the survey points to the sea-ice cover and platelet ice as important environmental features of the nursery area. ¬© 2012 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00300-012-1199-y,2-s2.0-84866035538,24,0.642374078,0,a nursery are for the antarct silverf pleuragramm antarctic at terr nov bay ross sea first estim of distribut and abund of eg and larva und the season sea ic pleuragramm antarctic is the domin pel fish in the wat of the contin shelf in high antarct reg wher it play a key rol in the food web a nursery ground for eg of thi specy was first ident in in terr nov bay ross sea wher eg wer found trap in ic platelet und the sea ic dur the spring as part of a monit program aim at understand the geograph and temp charact of thi nursery ground the pres study report on survey carry out in the aust springs of and us a simpl and effect method for sampl from the sea ic thes survey en the evalu of the spat rang of the nursery are of the antarct silverf in the sea ic of the coast are of victor land between the coulm island and the drygalsk glacy tongu p antarctic eg wer cont in an are of terr nov bay of about km encompass two adjac sit gerlach inlet and silverf bay the pres result ad inform on lif cyc and hatch period of the antarct silverf and confirm the import of the terr nov bay as a nursery are for thi import specy moreov the survey point to the sea ic cov and platelet ic as import environ feat of the nursery are,new,0.6901151806605328,0.6180838425506481,0.567446361115548,0.5314508934578888,0.5053001506589477,0.4861842540917362,0.4725521241510197,0.4636949051622917,0.459654990391458,0.46154557020255865,0.4727921345607954
99,fish_antarctic,Winter distribution and size structure of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba populations in-shore along the West Antarctic Peninsula,"Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are a key component of food webs in the maritime West Antarctic Peninsula, and their life history is tied to the seasonal cycles of sea ice and primary production in the region. Previous work has shown a general in-shore migration of krill in winter in this region; however, the very near-shore has not often been sampled as part of these surveys. We investigated distribution, abundance, and size structure of krill in 3 fjordic bays along the peninsula, and in the adjacent Gerlache Strait area using vertically stratified MOCNESS net tows and ADCP acoustic biomass estimates. Krill abundance was high within bays, with net estimated densities exceeding 60 krill m-3, while acoustic estimates were an order of magnitude higher. Krill within bays were larger than krill in the Gerlache Strait. Within bays, krill aggregations were observed near the seafloor during the day with aggregations extending to the sediment interface, and exhibited diel vertical migration higher into the water column at night. We suggest these high winter krill abundances within fjords are indicative of an active seasonal migration by krill in the peninsula region. Potential drivers for such a migration include reduced advective losses and costs, and availability of sediment food resources within fjords. Seasonally near-shore krill may also affect stock and recruitment assessments and may have implications for managing the krill fishery in this area. ¬© 2016 Inter-Research.",10.3354/meps11772,2-s2.0-84976400534,34,0.6270418729999999,0,wint distribut and siz structure of antarct kril euphaus superb pop in shor along the west antarct peninsul antarct kril euphaus superb ar a key compon of food web in the maritim west antarct peninsul and their lif hist is tied to the season cyc of sea ic and prim produc in the reg prevy work has shown a gen in shor migr of kril in wint in thi reg howev the very near shor has not oft been sampl as part of thes survey we investig distribut abund and siz structure of kril in fjord bay along the peninsul and in the adjac gerlach strait are us vert stratified moc net tow and adcp acoust biomass estim kril abund was high within bay with net estim dens excess kril m whil acoust estim wer an ord of magnitud high kril within bay wer larg than kril in the gerlach strait within bay kril aggreg wer observ near the seaflo dur the day with aggreg extend to the sedy interfac and exhibit diel vert migr high into the wat column at night we suggest thes high wint kril abund within fjord ar ind of an act season migr by kril in the peninsul reg pot driv for such a migr includ reduc advect loss and cost and avail of sedy food resourc within fjord season near shor kril may also affect stock and recruit assess and may hav imply for man the kril fishery in thi are,new,0.7140064569038601,0.6160464849285567,0.5417358091599486,0.48632759808582154,0.4443206572208891,0.4118698013855842,0.38653748067344657,0.366868323422251,0.35217271462277505,0.3426087544753646,0.3398703727667498
1031,fish_antarctic,Latitudinal and bathymetric patterns in the distribution and abundance of mesopelagic fish in the Scotia Sea,"Mesopelagic fish are a key component of the pelagic ecosystem throughout the world's oceans. Opening and closing nets were used to investigate patterns in the distribution and abundance of mesopelagic fish from the surface to 1000. m on a series of transects across the Scotia Sea from the ice-edge to the Antarctic Polar Front. A total of 141 non-target net hauls were undertaken during three cruises (Nov 2006, Jan 2008 and Mar 2009), with 7852 teleost fish captured, representing 43 species in 17 families. A further 1517 fish were caught in targeted net hauls. The dominant families were the Myctophidae (6961 specimens; 21 species) and Bathylagidae (1467 specimens; 4 species). Few fish were caught in the upper 400. m during daylight, which was attributed to a combination of net avoidance and diurnal vertical migration. Species composition was linked to depth and location and was closely associated with oceanographic features. Diversity was lowest in cold water at the most southerly stations, which were dominated by Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Bathylagus antarcticus. Further north, diversity increased with the addition of species such as Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum bolini and Electrona carlsbergi. The depth integrated biomass of myctophids was similar across the latitudinal transect and produced an estimate of 4.5 million tonnes in the Scotia Sea. Bathylagids were patchily distributed, but were abundant in the lower mesopelagic zone (>400. m) and are potentially significant zooplankton consumers. Given the biomass of the myctophids and bathylagids coupled with the vertical migrations of many species, these fish are likely to play a significant role in carbon export from the surface waters to the deep ocean. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2011.07.003,2-s2.0-84855966526,21,0.623902672,1,latitudin and bathymet pattern in the distribut and abund of mesopel fish in the scot sea mesopel fish ar a key compon of the pel ecosystem throughout the world s oc op and clos net wer us to investig pattern in the distribut and abund of mesopel fish from the surfac to m on a sery of transect across the scot sea from the ic edg to the antarct pol front a tot of non target net haul wer undertak dur three cru nov jan and mar with teleost fish capt repres specy in famy a furth fish wer caught in target net haul the domin famy wer the myctophida specim specy and bathylagida specim specy few fish wer caught in the up m dur daylight which was attribut to a combin of net avoid and diurn vert migr specy composit was link to dep and loc and was clos assocy with oceanograph feat divers was lowest in cold wat at the most south stat which wer domin by electron antarctic gymnoscopel brauer and bathylag antarctic furth nor divers increas with the addit of specy such as krefftichthy andersson protomyctoph bolin and electron carlsberg the dep integr biomass of myctophid was simil across the latitudin transect and produc an estim of mil ton in the scot sea bathylagid wer patchy distribut but wer abund in the low mesopel zon m and ar pot sign zooplankton consum giv the biomass of the myctophid and bathylagid coupl with the vert migr of many specy thes fish ar lik to play a sign rol in carbon export from the surfac wat to the deep oc,new,0.6956823669109953,0.6065371471371763,0.541301699470013,0.49317697233550434,0.45666072633704474,0.42828053792527226,0.40591798952988056,0.3883123387779933,0.3748233903716813,0.3654307533742112,0.36113105159463255
1041,fish_antarctic,"Distribution, abundance and ecological relevance of pelagic fishes in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean","The distribution and abundance of larval and postlarval fishes was investigated in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean, in March and April 2004. The upper 200 m of the water column were sampled with an 8 m2 rectangular midwater trawl at 93 stations. The larval species community clustered in a diverse coastal community with high densities of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum larvae and a less diverse offshore community dominated by Antarctic jonasfish Notolepis coatsi and the lanternfish Electrona antarctica. No postlarval fish were caught in coastal areas. The offshore community of postlarval fishes consisted of the deep-sea smelt Bathylagus antarcticus, and the lanternfishes Gymnoscopelus braueri, C. nicholsi and E. antarctica. The latter species clearly dominated, occurring at mean individual and wet mass densities of 0.17 individuals nr2 and 0.26 g m-2, respectively. A generalized additive model significantly related the density of postlarval E. antarctica to the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, ocean depth and sea surface temperature. The diet of E. antarctica was dominated by copepods and euphausiid larvae. Mean energy density of E. antarctica in the upper 200 m was 2.8 kJ m-2, which is equivalent to 36% of the energy stored in Antarctic krill stocks and probably would be considerably higher if a greater depth range were considered. This suggests that E. antarctica is a major energy transmitter in the food web of the Lazarev Sea, challenging the classical krill-dominated food web paradigm of the Southern Ocean. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.",10.3354/meps07530,2-s2.0-53949084457,4,0.617769187,0,distribut abund and ecolog relev of pel fish in the lazarev sea southern oc the distribut and abund of larv and postlarv fish was investig in the lazarev sea southern oc in march and april the up m of the wat column wer sampl with an m rectangul midw trawl at stat the larv specy commun clust in a divers coast commun with high dens of antarct silverf pleuragramm antarctic larva and a less divers offsh commun domin by antarct jonasf notolep coats and the lanternf electron antarctic no postlarv fish wer caught in coast area the offsh commun of postlarv fish consist of the deep sea smelt bathylag antarctic and the lanternf gymnoscopel brauer c nichols and e antarctic the lat specy clear domin occur at mean individ and wet mass dens of individ nr and g m respect a gen addit model sign rel the dens of postlarv e antarctic to the abund of antarct kril euphaus superb oc dep and sea surfac temp the diet of e antarctic was domin by copepod and euphausiid larva mean energy dens of e antarctic in the up m was kj m which is equ to of the energy stor in antarct kril stock and prob would be consid high if a gre dep rang wer consid thi suggest that e antarctic is a maj energy transmit in the food web of the lazarev sea challeng the class kril domin food web paradigm of the southern oc,new,0.6823277305357258,0.5785319117143003,0.5021822408103119,0.44622145526006746,0.4041282326806931,0.3716220819068664,0.34602933394483665,0.32569115108666985,0.30963062926651586,0.29744517977335494,0.2894993293529414
1061,fish_antarctic,Relative changes in krill abundance inferred from antarctic fur seal,"Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a predominant species in the Southern Ocean, it is very sensitive to climate change, and it supports large stocks of fishes, seabirds, seals and whales in Antarctic marine ecosystems. Modern krill stocks have been estimated directly by net hauls and acoustic surveys; the historical krill density especially the long-term one in the Southern Ocean, however, is unknown. Here we inferred the relative krill population changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) over the 20th century from the trophic level change of Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella using stable carbon (Œ¥ 13C) and nitrogen (Œ¥ 15N) isotopes of archival seal hairs. Since Antarctic fur seals feed preferentially on krill, the variation of Œ¥ 15N in seal hair indicates a change in the proportion of krill in the seal's diets and thus the krill availability in local seawater. For the past century, enriching fur seal Œ¥ 15N values indicated decreasing krill availability. This is agreement with direct observation for the past ~30 years and suggests that the recently documented decline in krill populations began in the early parts of the 20th century. This novel method makes it possible to infer past krill population changes from ancient tissues of krill predators. ¬© 2011 Huang et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0027331,2-s2.0-80455158338,16,0.610512212,0,rel chang in kril abund infer from antarct fur seal antarct kril euphaus superb is a predomin specy in the southern oc it is very sensit to clim chang and it support larg stock of fish seabird seal and whal in antarct marin ecosystem modern kril stock hav been estim direct by net haul and acoust survey the hist kril dens espec the long term on in the southern oc howev is unknown her we infer the rel kril pop chang along the west antarct peninsul wap ov the th century from the troph level chang of antarct fur seal arctocephal gazell us stabl carbon œ¥ c and nitrog œ¥ n isotop of arch seal hair sint antarct fur seal fee pref on kril the vary of œ¥ n in seal hair ind a chang in the proport of kril in the seal s diet and thu the kril avail in loc seaw for the past century enrich fur seal œ¥ n valu ind decreas kril avail thi is agr with direct observ for the past year and suggest that the rec docu declin in kril pop beg in the ear part of the th century thi novel method mak it poss to inf past kril pop chang from ant tissu of kril pred,new,0.7171259243248388,0.6259662768098216,0.5586998444955613,0.5100640517761473,0.474346368011844,0.4477804199056494,0.42813797179950935,0.41425110127323467,0.4058359418749562,0.4037376563913751,0.4111037892107849
1112,fish_antarctic,Absolute abundance estimates from shallow water baited underwater camera surveys; a stochastic modelling approach tested against field data,"Baited underwater cameras are becoming a popular tool to monitor fish and invertebrate populations within protected and inshore environments where trawl surveys are unsuitable. Modelling the arrival times of deep-sea grenadiers using an inverse square relationship has enabled abundance estimates, comparable to those from bottom trawl surveys, to be gathered from deep-sea baited camera surveys. Baited underwater camera systems in the shallow water environments are however, currently limited to relative comparisons of assemblages based on simple metrics such as Max<inf>N</inf> (maximum number of fish seen at any one time). This study describes a stochastic simulation approach used to model the behaviour of fish and invertebrates around a BUC system to enable absolute abundance estimates to be generated from arrival patterns. Species-specific models were developed for the tropical reef fishes the black tip grouper (Epinephelus fasciatus) and moray eel (Gymnothorax spp.) and the Antarctic scavengers; the asteroid (Odontaster validus) and the nemertean worm (Parbolasia corrugatus). A sensitivity analysis explored the impact of input parameters on the arrival patterns (Max<inf>N</inf>, time to the arrival of the first individual and the time to reach Max<inf>N</inf>) for each species generated by the model. Sensitivity analysis showed a particularly strong link between Max<inf>N</inf> and abundance indicating that this model could be used to generate absolute abundances from existing or future Max<inf>N</inf> data. It in effect allows the slope of the Max<inf>N</inf> vs. abundance relationship to be estimated. Arrival patterns generated by each model were used to estimate population abundance for the focal species and these estimates were compared to data from underwater visual census transects. Using a Bland-Altman analysis, baited underwater camera data processed using this model were shown to generate absolute abundance estimates that were comparable to underwater visual census data. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jembe.2015.07.010,2-s2.0-84938151856,9,0.601670927,0,absolv abund estim from shallow wat bait underw camer survey a stochast model approach test against field dat bait underw camera ar becom a popul tool to monit fish and invertebr pop within protect and insh environ wher trawl survey ar unsuit model the ar tim of deep sea grenady us an invers squ rel has en abund estim comp to thos from bottom trawl survey to be gath from deep sea bait camer survey bait underw camer system in the shallow wat environ ar howev cur limit to rel comparison of assembl bas on simpl met such as maxn maxim numb of fish seen at any on tim thi study describ a stochast sim approach us to model the behavio of fish and invertebr around a buc system to en absolv abund estim to be gen from ar pattern specy spec model wer develop for the trop reef fish the black tip group epinephel fasciat and moray eel gymnothorax spp and the antarct scaveng the asteroid odontast valid and the nemert worm parbolas corrugat a sensit analys expl the impact of input paramet on the ar pattern maxn tim to the ar of the first individ and the tim to reach maxn for each specy gen by the model sensit analys show a particul strong link between maxn and abund ind that thi model could be us to gen absolv abund from ex or fut maxn dat it in effect allow the slop of the maxn vs abund rel to be estim ar pattern gen by each model wer us to estim pop abund for the foc specy and thes estim wer comp to dat from underw vis cens transect us a bland altm analys bait underw camer dat process us thi model wer shown to gen absolv abund estim that wer comp to underw vis cens dat,new,0.6401115920273198,0.554838398636028,0.494484697571542,0.451418685766196,0.42005080692394736,0.3970131063182705,0.3804015865714083,0.36932094917180225,0.3638003822886867,0.36522710280710957,0.3780753991120665
1431,fish_antarctic,"Distribution, abundance and seasonal flux of pteropods in the Sub-Antarctic Zone","Pteropods were identified from epipelagic net and trawl samples in the Sub-Antarctic Zone during the 2007 mid-summer (January 17-February 20) Sub-Antarctic Zone Sensitivity to Environmental Change (SAZ-Sense) voyage, as well as in a moored sediment trap in the same region. Overall pteropod densities during SAZ-Sense were lower than those reported for higher-latitude Southern Ocean waters. The four major contributors to the Sub-Antarctic Zone pteropod community during the SAZ-Sense voyage, Clio pyramidata forma antarctica, Clio recurva, Limacina helicina antarctica and Limacina retroversa australis, accounted for 93% of all pteropods observed. The distribution of the two dominant pteropods collected in the Sub-Antarctic Zone, L. retroversa australis and C. pyramidata forma antarctica, is strongly related to latitude and depth. L. retroversa australis is typical of cold southern (50-54¬∞S) polar waters and C. pyramidata forma antarctica is typical of shallow (top 20. m) Sub-Antarctic Zone waters. A moored sediment trap deployed to 2100. m at 47¬∞S, 141¬∞E in 2003/04 showed the pteropod flux in the Sub-Antarctic Zone had late-Spring and mid-summer peaks. The diversity, abundance and distribution of pteropods collected during SAZ-Sense provide a timely benchmark against which to monitor future changes in SAZ ocean pteropod communities, particularly in light of predictions of declining aragonite saturation in the Southern Ocean by the end of the century. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2011.05.031,2-s2.0-80052718409,23,0.518593382,0,distribut abund and season flux of pteropod in the sub antarct zon pteropod wer ident from epipel net and trawl sampl in the sub antarct zon dur the mid sum janu febru sub antarct zon sensit to environ chang saz sens voy as wel as in a moor sedy trap in the sam reg overal pteropod dens dur saz sens wer low than thos report for high latitud southern oc wat the four maj contribut to the sub antarct zon pteropod commun dur the saz sens voy clio pyramidat form antarctic clio recurv limacin helicin antarctic and limacin retrovers aust account for of al pteropod observ the distribut of the two domin pteropod collect in the sub antarct zon l retrovers aust and c pyramidat form antarctic is strongly rel to latitud and dep l retrovers aust is typ of cold southern ¬∞s pol wat and c pyramidat form antarctic is typ of shallow top m sub antarct zon wat a moor sedy trap deploy to m at ¬∞s ¬∞e in show the pteropod flux in the sub antarct zon had lat spring and mid sum peak the divers abund and distribut of pteropod collect dur saz sens provid a tim benchmark against which to monit fut chang in saz oc pteropod commun particul in light of predict of declin aragonit sat in the southern oc by the end of the century,new,0.5506921121422561,0.47882275258160284,0.4319280084288495,0.40079433666177017,0.37997282699458,0.3665836894260119,0.35926590772499084,0.3577357061932749,0.3628531740138658,0.3774441252787582,0.4090435676485189
1451,fish_antarctic,"Structure, abundance and biomass size spectra of copepods and other zooplankton communities in upper waters of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean during summer","Little attention has been paid to small copepods and other zooplankton inhabiting pelagic ecosystems of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean under the influence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current circulation, despite their important role in the trophic chain and fisheries. This study gives a synoptic view (January 2001) of the micro and mesoplankton size fractions and normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) in upper waters of five different ecological domains (shelf and oceanic Subantarctic and Antarctic waters) including the Brazil-Malvinas confluence (BMC). Copepods were always the main component of the zooplankton; the <300-Œºm fraction represented between 70 and 99% in terms of numbers and from 20 to 88% in terms of biomass. Other zooplankton contributed with <40% to total zooplankton densities, though showing some biomass peaks (>50%). Chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature and salinity were the environmental variables that best explained the distribution trend of zooplankton, mainly that of the <300-Œºm fraction. For all the domains, NBSS revealed flat slopes (-0.6 to-1), suggesting a higher proportion of large organisms than expected at equilibrium. A dome-shape feature was detected in the BMC. Total biomass and trophic levels of the system were related to the composition of the community and the hydrological conditions of the domains covered. ¬© 2013 The Author.",10.1093/plankt/fbt014,2-s2.0-84877343894,17,0.507724883,0,structure abund and biomass siz spectr of copepod and oth zooplankton commun in up wat of the southwestern atl oc dur sum littl at has been paid to smal copepod and oth zooplankton inhabit pel ecosystem of the southwestern atl oc und the influ of the antarct circumpol cur circ despit their import rol in the troph chain and fishery thi study giv a synopt view janu of the micro and mesoplankton siz fract and norm biomass siz spectr nbss in up wat of fiv diff ecolog domain shelf and oc subantarct and antarct wat includ the brazil malvina conflu bmc copepod wer alway the main compon of the zooplankton the œºm fract repres between and in term of numb and from to in term of biomass oth zooplankton contribut with to tot zooplankton dens though show som biomass peak chlorophyll a sea surfac temp and salin wer the environ vary that best explain the distribut trend of zooplankton main that of the œºm fract for al the domain nbss rev flat slop to suggest a high proport of larg org than expect at equilibr a dom shap feat was detect in the bmc tot biomass and troph level of the system wer rel to the composit of the commun and the hydrolog condit of the domain cov,new,0.5424572919333692,0.48472015372973815,0.4476984998845615,0.4235803634869742,0.4080524067223055,0.3989386010442998,0.3953242234828987,0.3972464897419525,0.40585203355380656,0.424310041082251,0.4606825872497734

159,fish_antarctic,"Through a glass less darkly-New approaches for studying the distribution, abundance and biology of Euphausiids","Euphausiids are vital components of many oceanic foodwebs. Due to their large size, they are key prey species for many vertebrates, and several species are subject to commercial fisheries. The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises-usually in summer-to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species.

1721,fish_antarctic,Abundance and single-cell activity of bacterial groups in Antarctic coastal waters,"We estimated the abundance and single-cell activity of bacterial groups in waters off the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) using a combination of microautoradiography and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The abundance of the Ant4D3 subgroup, detected by a new FISH probe, was 10% of the total community and half of the gammaproteobacterial population. The Ant4D3, Polaribacter, and SAR11 subgroups accounted for the majority of the Gammaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteria-Flavobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria, respectively. Approximately 40% of the total microbial community actively incorporated leucine (added at 20 nmol L-1), while a smaller fraction (12-22%) used protein and an amino acid mixture (added at tracer concentrations). The fractions of SAR11, Polaribacter, and Ant4D3 that were active differed from each other and varied among substrates. SAR11 had the largest fraction of active cells incorporating leucine, while Polaribacter dominated the community using protein. The fraction of Ant4D3 using different compounds did not vary, but this group dominated the incorporation of amino acids, and was an abundant and active component of the bacterial community. Bacteria in the WAP region were as active as bacteria in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, even though total bacterial production was lower in the WAP.

130,fish_australasia,Abundance and population trends of mollymawks on Campbell Island,"Counts of nests in photographs taken since the 1940s and ground counts conducted during the 1990s are used to establish population trends over a 55-year period for Campbell (Thalassarche impavida) and grey-headed (T. chrysostoma) mollymawks (albatrosses) on northern Campbell Island (subantarctic islands, New Zealand). Repeat counts of photographs had coefficients of variation (CVs) of 6.6% and the main ground count methods had CVs of 3%-5%. Between the 1940s and 1990s there was an apparently continuous 82%-88% decrease (at 1.5%-2.7% p.a.) in nest numbers at three photographed grey-headed mollymawk colonies. Ground counts in 1995-97 recorded 7800 grey-headed mollymawk nests/yr (6200 with eggs during mid-October), representing a population of about 11800 (biennially breeding) pairs. Extrapolating back from these data, there may have been 43 000 grey-headed mollymawk nests/yr in the 1940s. Environmental changes affecting the food supply are the most likely explanation for the long-term decline. One Campbell mollymawk colony showed an increase of 11% in nest numbers between the 1940s and 1966, a decrease of 47% by the 1980s, then a gradual recovery of 3.2% p.a. Extrapolation suggests there were about 31 300 Campbell mollymawk nests in the 1940s. There were 24 600 nests in 1995-97 (21 000 with eggs during mid-October). The large decrease in the late 1960s to early 1980s coincided with the peak in long-line fishing for southern bluefin tuna. Regular monitoring of mollymawk populations (preferably with a suite of species) is recommended; three consecutive years every decade is a minimum requirement. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to test links between environmental change and mollymawk population trends. ¬© July 2004, Department of Conservation.",,2-s2.0-4344683258,2,0.885292778,1,abund and pop trend of mollymawk on campbel island count of nest in photograph tak sint the s and ground count conduc dur the s ar us to est pop trend ov a year period for campbel thalassarch impavid and grey head t chrysostoma mollymawk albatross on northern campbel island subantarct island new zealand rep count of photograph had coefficy of vary cvs of and the main ground count method had cvs of between the s and s ther was an app continu decreas at p a in nest numb at three photograph grey head mollymawk colony ground count in record grey head mollymawk nest yr with eg dur mid octob repres a pop of about bien bree pair extrapol back from thes dat ther may hav been grey head mollymawk nest yr in the s environ chang affect the food supply ar the most lik expl for the long term declin on campbel mollymawk colony show an increas of in nest numb between the s and a decreas of by the s then a grad recovery of p a extrapol suggest ther wer about campbel mollymawk nest in the s ther wer nest in with eg dur mid octob the larg decreas in the lat s to ear s coincid with the peak in long lin fish for southern bluefin tun regul monit of mollymawk pop pref with a suit of specy is recommend three consecut year every decad is a minim requir a multidisciplin approach is nee to test link between environ chang and mollymawk pop trend,new,0.8986004366421554,0.8796818792963308,0.8649825574730766,0.8532396427752776,0.8435368741386406,0.8352781944288984,0.8280698145639483,0.8216395186541569,0.8157885435500163,0.8103569612727592,0.8052412233066437
227,fish_australasia,Estimating the rate of quasi-extinction of the Australian grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus) population using deterministic age- and stage-classified models,"Grey nurse sharks off the east coast of Australia are listed nationally as ""critically endangered"" under Schedule 1 of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) and may number no more than 300 in New South Wales and southern Queensland waters. They are an inshore, coastal dwelling species and were severely depleted by spearfishing in the 1960s. The population has continued to decline despite protection since 1984. Their life history (long-lived to 25+ years), late maturation (6-8 years), low fecundity (maximum 2 live young biennially), specific habitat requirements, limited inshore distribution, and small population size render them particularly vulnerable to extinction. We estimated the time to quasi-extinction (years elapsed for the population to consist of ‚â§50 females) for the grey nurse shark population off the east coast of Australia based on current estimates of abundance and known anthropogenic rates of mortality. Estimated minimum population size was 300 as of 2002, and minimum anthropogenic mortality assessed from recovered carcasses was 12/year of which 75% were females. We modelled time to quasi-extinction using deterministic age- and stage-classified models for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios. Population size was estimated at 300 (worst), 1000 (likely) and 3000 (best). Anthropogenic mortality was added to the model assuming either all carcasses are being recovered (best), or conservatively, that only 50% are reported (realistic). Depending on model structure, if all carcasses are being reported, quasi-extinction times for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios range from 13 to 16 years, 84-98 years and 289-324 years, respectively. If under-reporting is occurring, time to quasi-extinction ranges from 6 to 8 years, 45-53 years and 173-200 years, respectively. In all scenarios modelled the grey nurse shark population will decline if no further steps are taken to remove anthropogenic sources of mortality. Because estimates of quasi-extinction rate depend on initial population size, and sensitivity analysis revealed that population rate of change was most sensitive to changes in the survival probability of the smallest length classes, obtaining precise estimates of abundance and annual survival of young females is critical. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

322,fish_australasia,"Population abundance estimates of the New Zealand geoduck clam, Panopea zelandica, using north american methodology: Is the technology transferable?","This study investigates the applicability of methods used to describe patterns of distribution, and estimates of density and biomass of the Pacific geoduck clam, Panopea abrupta, from western North America for populations of the New Zealand geoduck, Panopea zelandica in Kennedy Bay, on the Coromandel Peninsula, and in Wellington Harbour. Central to this is the use of line transect surveys and estimations of the detection rate of geoduck (show-factor) using counts of siphon holes. Studies were restricted to less than 17 m water depth. Geoduck in Kennedy Bay were found from 4-8 m water depth, whereas geoduck in Wellington Harbour occurred in several separate beds from 4-16 m. In Wellington Harbour, there was a pattern of increasing numbers with depth up to ‚àº15 m. Numbers seemed to decrease thereafter. Analysis of sediment samples indicated that P. zelandica was more prevalent in fine sand to fine silty sand substrates. P. abrupta is found in similar habitats. There was no significant difference in the show-factor (the proportion of geoduck detectable by sight or touch vs. the actual number of geoduck present) of geoduck with respect to season (summer and winter), region (Wellington Harbour and Kennedy Bay), or tidal height (low, mid, and high tide). Hence, a mean show-factor of 0.914 was used to adjust density estimates from all surveyed populations. Estimates of the mean population density (¬±SE) of P. zelandica were much lower than those reported for P. abrupta ranging from 0.058 (¬±0.01) geoduck/m2 in Kennedy Bay to 0.489 (¬±0.08) geoduck/m2 in Shelly Bay, Wellington Harbour. Survey densities, abundance, and biomass estimates were reasonably well determined with coefficients of variation (CVs) generally less than 20%. The results suggest that the methods used to provide population estimates for P. abrupta are readily transferable to P. zelandica. However, further research needs to be conducted on the diver variability on counts of geoduck, the role that geoduck occurring in water depths &gt;17 m play in the population dynamics of local populations, and the density dependence of fertilization success of P. zelandica. Given the low estimates of density in this study, fisheries managers will have to carefully consider the feasibility of sustainably harvesting this species.",,2-s2.0-13544250627,4,0.84991163,0,pop abund estim of the new zealand geoduck clam panope zelandic us nor am methodolog is the technolog transf thi study investig the appl of method us to describ pattern of distribut and estim of dens and biomass of the pac geoduck clam panope abrupt from western nor americ for pop of the new zealand geoduck panope zelandic in kennedy bay on the coromandel peninsul and in wellington harbo cent to thi is the us of lin transect survey and estim of the detect rat of geoduck show fact us count of siphon hol study wer restrict to less than m wat dep geoduck in kennedy bay wer found from m wat dep wherea geoduck in wellington harbo occur in sev sep bed from m in wellington harbo ther was a pattern of increas numb with dep up to ‚àº m numb seem to decreas thereaft analys of sedy sampl ind that p zelandic was mor prev in fin sand to fin sil sand subst p abrupt is found in simil habit ther was no sign diff in the show fact the proport of geoduck detect by sight or touch vs the act numb of geoduck pres of geoduck with respect to season sum and wint reg wellington harbo and kennedy bay or tid height low mid and high tid hent a mean show fact of was us to adjust dens estim from al survey pop estim of the mean pop dens ¬±se of p zelandic wer much low than thos report for p abrupt rang from ¬± geoduck m in kennedy bay to ¬± geoduck m in shel bay wellington harbo survey dens abund and biomass estim wer reason wel determin with coefficy of vary cvs gen less than the result suggest that the method us to provid pop estim for p abrupt ar ready transf to p zelandic howev furth research nee to be conduc on the div vary on count of geoduck the rol that geoduck occur in wat depth gt m play in the pop dynam of loc pop and the dens depend of fertil success of p zelandic giv the low estim of dens in thi study fishery man wil hav to car consid the feas of sustain harvest thi specy,new,0.8749745243540344,0.8255578823082074,0.7829569627592772,0.7465842608338987,0.7149697603442232,0.6868413860646947,0.6611809178384928,0.6371082754065155,0.6137152721907314,0.5897311094299378,0.5627933676022193
414,fish_australasia,Green and Golden Bell Frogs in New South Wales: Current status and future prospects,"Surveys carried out between 1990 and 1995 of almost all known historic locations within New South Wales (including the ACT) for the Green and Golden Bell Frog Litoria aurea revealed that the species had suffered a dramatic decline in distribution and abundance in this region, with over 80% of all historic populations having gone extinct, and many of the extant populations being reduced to low numbers. The present study involved surveys of the Green and Golden Bell Frog locations that were known in 1995, surveys of new locations or potential areas for new locations of this species, and review of management plans and other documented information concerning particular populations. Over the last 12 years extinctions have continued with the loss of almost 50% of those sub-populations and 23% of populations known in 1995. Obviously the species cannot sustain this rate of loss for much longer and continue to exist within New South Wales. Protection for remaining extant populations is very limited and most are under continuing threat. Management plans have been prepared in relation to a number of sub-populations/populations, but these plans have not focused on populations under current threat, and associated management actions designed to benefit this frog have occurred in only a few cases. Hence, decline of this species within NSW is likely to continue. Habitat change, mostly through destruction and disturbance, has been the major factor in population loss with the likelihood of extinction increasing with increases in the extent of habitat loss as measured by the number of habitat variables that have declined. Invasion by exotic predatory fish Gambusia holbrooki, previously linked with declines in this frog species, shows no apparent association with extinction of populations over the last 12 years and poses no apparent current threat to any population, apparently because any impact of this species has been ameliorated through the presence of submerged/floating aquatic vegetation which may provide some protection against predation for eggs and tadpoles. The steps most likely to improve the conservation status of the Green and Golden Bell Frog within the state are habitat enhancement/development and restoration of movement links between nearby populations.",10.7882/AZ.2008.010,2-s2.0-58149333702,28,0.8484590959999999,1,green and gold bel frog in new sou wal cur stat and fut prospect survey carry out between and of almost al known hist loc within new sou wal includ the act for the green and gold bel frog litor aure rev that the specy had suff a dram declin in distribut and abund in thi reg with ov of al hist pop hav gon extinct and many of the ext pop being reduc to low numb the pres study involv survey of the green and gold bel frog loc that wer known in survey of new loc or pot area for new loc of thi specy and review of man plan and oth docu inform concern particul pop ov the last year extinct hav continu with the loss of almost of thos sub pop and of pop known in obvy the specy cannot sustain thi rat of loss for much long and continu to ex within new sou wal protect for remain ext pop is very limit and most ar und continu threat man plan hav been prep in rel to a numb of sub pop pop but thes plan hav not focus on pop und cur threat and assocy man act design to benefit thi frog hav occur in on a few cas hent declin of thi specy within nsw is lik to continu habit chang most through destruct and disturb has been the maj fact in pop loss with the lik of extinct increas with increas in the ext of habit loss as meas by the numb of habit vary that hav declin invas by exot pred fish gambus holbrook prevy link with declin in thi frog specy show no app assocy with extinct of pop ov the last year and pos no app cur threat to any pop app becaus any impact of thi specy has been am through the pres of submerg flo aqu veget which may provid som protect against pred for eg and tadpol the step most lik to improv the conserv stat of the green and gold bel frog within the stat ar habit enh develop and rest of mov link between nearby pop,new,0.8861426060654147,0.8589433468727845,0.8366489845646545,0.817777344239087,0.801228699930176,0.786244176227017,0.7722504567099738,0.7587348594992732,0.7451120951531053,0.7304858345623358,0.7130711641217995
513,fish_australasia,Decline in whale shark size and abundance at Ningaloo Reef over the past decade: The world's largest fish is getting smaller,"Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways.

611,fish_australasia,"Aspects of the breeding and feeding ecology of the australasian gannet morns senator in port phillip bay, victoria, 1988-92","Breeding periodicity and success of Australasian Gannets Morus senator were studied between 1988 and 1992 at two small colonies (Pope‚Äôs Eye and Wedge Light), on artificial sites in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria. Samples of foods taken by adults (were collected for identification of major prey species. Banding of chicks and observations of adults previously banded as chicks (particularly at Wedge Light) provided information on the source of breeding adults and age of return to colonies. Wedge Light colony, estab¬≠lished in 1966, has reached some 50 pairs: breeding there is now limited by available space. At Pope‚Äôs Eye, where breeding began before 1985, space also limited breeding but the provision of an additional platform in 1989 led to a dou¬≠bling of adults nesting (to c. 120 in 1991-92). Nest building at the study sites began in August-September, and eggs were laid mainly in September; second, or replacement, eggs from November-December. Most hatching took place October-November, with chicks fledging January-Febru- ary; there was some variation in timing between years. Numbers of clutches laid, as a proportion of nest attempts, were consistently higher at Wedge Light; at Pope‚Äôs Eye some nests were lost presumably as a result of bad weather. Hatching success was similar at both sites (64%), some 89% of chicks hatched left the platforms; mean breeding success (chicks fledged/eggs laid) was 57%. Although relatively few chicks died or were lost (9-14%), about 36% of eggs failed to hatch (mainly through loss). Nest success was influenced, to some extent, by exposure, particularly at Pope‚Äôs Eye where seas may wash over breeding sites and drainage is poor. The extended breeding period may reflect local weath¬≠er conditions and less reliable food availability. In this study, individual prey items were mainly Pilchards Sarclinops sagax (58.4%); other taxa (20 fish, four cephalopods and a shrimp species) were generally represented by a few indi¬≠viduals. On average, prey species weighed 45 g, were 141 mm long, 15 mm wide and 26 mm deep; Pilchards were mostly (72%) < 140 mm long. Most regurgitations collected (mean mass 146 g) contained only one fish species (82%). As in other dietary studies of gannets, prey species were pri¬≠marily inshore, schooling and pelagic. Little is known of factors influencing the distribution or abundance of the prey species; food deliveries at breeding colonies were lighter than those reported elsewhere, which may indicate local for¬≠aging. At both sites, colonies have grown as a consequence, in part at least, of the recruitment of chicks fledged at Wedge Light. Expansion at Wedge Light is now impossible, and at Pope‚Äôs Eye there is little additional area for breeding. The provision of more artificial platforms might further in¬≠crease the local population. ¬© 1995 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.",10.1071/MU9950023,2-s2.0-0028979809,121,0.828257178,1,aspect of the bree and fee ecolog of the australas gannet morn sen in port phillip bay victor bree period and success of australas gannet mor sen wer study between and at two smal colony pope‚äôs ey and wedg light on art sit in port phillip bay victor sampl of food tak by adult wer collect for id of maj prey specy band of chick and observ of adult prevy band as chick particul at wedg light provid inform on the sourc of bree adult and ag of return to colony wedg light colony estab¬≠lished in has reach som pair bree ther is now limit by avail spac at pope‚äôs ey wher bree beg bef spac also limit bree but the provid of an addit platform in led to a dou¬≠bling of adult nest to c in nest build at the study sit beg in august septemb and eg wer laid main in septemb second or replac eg from novemb decemb most hatch took plac octob novemb with chick fledg janu febru ary ther was som vary in tim between year numb of clutch laid as a proport of nest attempt wer consist high at wedg light at pope‚äôs ey som nest wer lost presum as a result of bad weath hatch success was simil at both sit som of chick hatch left the platform mean bree success chick fledg eg laid was although rel few chick died or wer lost about of eg fail to hatch main through loss nest success was influ to som ext by expos particul at pope‚äôs ey wher sea may wash ov bree sit and drain is poor the extend bree period may reflect loc weath¬≠er condit and less rely food avail in thi study individ prey item wer main pilchard sarclinop sagax oth tax fish four cephalopod and a shrimp specy wer gen repres by a few indi¬≠viduals on av prey specy weigh g wer mm long mm wid and mm deep pilchard wer most mm long most regurgit collect mean mass g contain on on fish specy as in oth diet study of gannet prey specy wer pri¬≠marily insh schooling and pel littl is known of fact influ the distribut or abund of the prey specy food delivery at bree colony wer light than thos report elsewh which may ind loc for¬≠aging at both sit colony hav grown as a consequ in part at least of the recruit of chick fledg at wedg light expand at wedg light is now imposs and at pope‚äôs ey ther is littl addit are for bree the provid of mor art platform might furth in¬≠crease the loc pop,new,0.8430183063089428,0.7946557074457606,0.7553778095704589,0.7235838130086153,0.6973895508041441,0.6753964134141531,0.6566404292838977,0.640466939889754,0.6264495631598518,0.6143556310325325,0.604247923344496
714,fish_australasia,Cyclonic and anthropogenic influences on tern populations,"Organisms can be strongly affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic stressors in conjunction, making comprehensive assessments of multiple potential drivers of population dynamics essential. An 18-year dataset obtained for Michaelmas Cay in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, was used to assess population trends for three tern species relative to two potential threatening processes, namely human impacts (as either commercial fishing or tourism) and cyclone activity. We found a positive, 2-year lagged relationship between long-line catch per unit effort in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery in the vicinity of Michaelmas Cay and breeding participation in the two pelagic foraging terns, but not in the inshore foraging tern. The abundance of large pelagic fish may influence recruitment into the breeding populations of the two pelagic terns in the following years through impacts on prey availability.

810,fish_australasia,A new abundance estimate for Maui's dolphin: What does it mean for managing this critically endangered species?,"Hector's dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori is found only in New Zealand waters. We carried out a population survey of the North Island subspecies Cephalorhychus hectori maui, also known as Maui's dolphin. The total population size estimate is 111 individuals (95% confidence interval = 48-252). The small population size confirms its critically endangered IUCN status. A sustainable level of human-caused mortality for this population would be 0.16 (one dolphin every 6.4 years). This essentially means that fisheries bycatch, and where possible other human impacts, need to be eliminated to allow population recovery. A protected area has been created to reduce the threat from entanglement in fishing gear. Gillnet fishing is prohibited along a 210 nautical mile stretch of coastline. The main concerns are that gillnet fishing is still allowed inside harbours and trawling continues inside the protected area. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Commercial catch and effort data were used to indicate spatial and temporal abundance. Catch sampling provided fish measurements and estimates of age, sex and reproductive maturity. Catches were from throughout South Australia's gulf region, but three areas separated by hundreds of kilometres produced the highest catches. These relatively protected areas support extensive beds of intertidal and subtidal seagrasses. Statewide commercial fishery catches demonstrated considerable inter-annual variation of 240-320 t year-1. Catches were dominated by 1+ and 2+ fish, with few individuals from the 3+ to 5+ age classes. Females dominated the sex ratios, were the largest individuals, and the largest from each age class. No running ripe fish were sampled. Seasonal variation in the catch and in the lack of spawning fish suggested that adults might move from fishing areas during the spawning season. Length/weight and length/age relationships did not differ between areas separated by hundreds of kilometres, suggesting large-scale movement. Possible population truncation related to fishery exploitation has prompted a stock rebuilding program for the South Australian stock. ¬© CSIRO 2008.",10.1071/MF07230,2-s2.0-44949092635,34,0.805085446,1,pop charact of southern sea garf hyporhamph melanochir hemiramphida in sou austral pop dynam demograph and spat distribut of an import specy of halfbeak the southern sea garf hyporhamph melanochir wer study in sou austral which account for most of the nat catch commerc catch and effort dat wer us to ind spat and temp abund catch sampl provid fish meas and estim of ag sex and reproduc mat catch wer from throughout sou austral s gulf reg but three area sep by hundr of kilomet produc the highest catch thes rel protect area support extend bed of intertid and subtid seagrass statewid commerc fishery catch demonst consid int an vary of t year catch wer domin by and fish with few individ from the to ag class fem domin the sex ratio wer the largest individ and the largest from each ag class no run rip fish wer sampl season vary in the catch and in the lack of spawn fish suggest that adult might mov from fish area dur the spawn season leng weight and leng ag rel did not diff between area sep by hundr of kilomet suggest larg scal mov poss pop trunt rel to fishery exploit has prompt a stock rebuild program for the sou aust stock,new,0.8375954510852699,0.7868098618041174,0.7457723162501191,0.7125282349580568,0.6849522962356692,0.6615055837227977,0.641106708523906,0.6229473814722246,0.6063375908499794,0.5904610792233463,0.5739921935246225

Fishing substantially influenced the population characteristics of many species, including altering the mean size and abundance of rock lobsters and the abundance of prey species such as urchins and abalone. Strong declines in abundances of purple urchins and abalone within the largest MPA at Maria Island indicate likely indirect effects related to protection of predators from fishing. The two smallest MPAs (ca. 1¬†km coastal span) generated few detectable changes. Our results affirm the importance of long-term monitoring and the value of MPAs, when sufficiently large, as reference areas for determining and understanding ecosystem effects of fishing in the absence of historical baseline data. ¬© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1113,fish_australasia,"Spatial and temporal variation in population trends of Kelp Gulls in northern Patagonia, Argentina","Many populations of seabird species with opportunistic or generalist feeding habits have expanded worldwide, possibly because they are using additional food resources provided by human activities. The Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) is a generalist feeder that often feeds on urban and fish waste and its populations have been expanding in several regions of the southern hemisphere. In Patagonia, Argentina, it is the most abundant species of gull. However, population trends have been reported for only a few colonies and there has been no evaluation of population changes at a regional scale. In this study we provide an update on the distribution and size of Kelp Gull colonies along 1800km of coastline of northern Patagonia, and assess population trends over a period of 15 years (1994-2008) at different spatial scales (colony, coastal sector, region). In northern Patagonia, Kelp Gulls currently breed in 68 colonies, which range in size from a few to 11000 breeding pairs. Ten new sites were colonised in the study period. Most colonies (74%) are increasing and the overall population increased by 37% (from 52784 to 72616 pairs), at an annual growth rate of 2.7%. Two of the four coastal sectors showed significant annual increases (5%), whereas the other two remained stable. Our results confirm the expansion of populations of Kelp Gulls along a long section of the coast of northern Patagonia, although the observed trends varied with the spatial scale considered. ¬© 2011 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.",10.1071/MU11001,2-s2.0-80052227870,18,0.787532369,1,spat and temp vary in pop trend of kelp gul in northern patagon argentin many pop of seabird specy with opportun or gen fee habit hav expand worldwid poss becaus they ar us addit food resourc provid by hum act the kelp gul lar dominican is a gen fee that oft fee on urb and fish wast and it pop hav been expand in sev reg of the southern hemisph in patagon argentin it is the most abund specy of gul howev pop trend hav been report for on a few colony and ther has been no evalu of pop chang at a reg scal in thi study we provid an upd on the distribut and siz of kelp gul colony along km of coastlin of northern patagon and assess pop trend ov a period of year at diff spat scal colony coast sect reg in northern patagon kelp gul cur bree in colony which rang in siz from a few to bree pair ten new sit wer colon in the study period most colony ar increas and the overal pop increas by from to pair at an an grow rat of two of the four coast sect show sign an increas wherea the oth two remain stabl our result confirm the expand of pop of kelp gul along a long sect of the coast of northern patagon although the observ trend vary with the spat scal consid,new,0.8278586632346406,0.802078487967919,0.784225756984726,0.7714595862751625,0.7621009414720236,0.7552132624732459,0.7502836797909862,0.7470704500541092,0.7455658848931218,0.7460803126845486,0.749642035185375
1210,fish_australasia,Tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) abundance and growth in a subtropical embayment: Evidence from 7 years of standardized fishing effort,"The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and Lesueur 1822) is a widely distributed predator with a broad diet and the potential to affect marine community structure, yet information on local patterns of abundance for this species is lacking. Tiger shark catch data were gathered over 7 years of tag and release research fishing (1991-2000, 2002-2004) in Shark Bay, Western Australia (25¬∞45‚Ä≤S, 113¬∞44‚Ä≤E). Sharks were caught using drumlines deployed in six permanent zones (‚àº3 km2 in area). Fishing effort was standardized across days and months, and catch rates on hooks were expressed as the number of sharks caught h-1. A total of 449 individual tiger sharks was captured; 29 were recaptured. Tiger shark catch rate showed seasonal periodicity, being higher during the warm season (Sep-May) than during the cold season (Jun-Aug), and was marked by inter-annual variability. The most striking feature of the catch data was a consistent pattern of slow, continuous variation within each year from a peak during the height of the warm season (February) to a trough in the cold season (July). Annual growth rates of recaptured individuals were generally consistent with estimates from other regions, but exceeded those for populations elsewhere for sharks &gt;275 cm fork length (FL), perhaps because mature sharks in the study area rely heavily on large prey. The data suggest that (1) the threat of predation faced by animals consumed by tiger sharks fluctuates dramatically within and between years, and (2) efforts to monitor large shark abundance should be extensive enough to detect inter-annual variation and sufficiently intensive to account for intra-annual trends. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.",10.1007/s00227-006-0278-4,2-s2.0-33745591140,23,0.7854987840000001,1,tig shark galeocerdo cuvy abund and grow in a subtrop embay evid from year of standard fish effort the tig shark galeocerdo cuvy peron and lesu is a wid distribut pred with a broad diet and the pot to affect marin commun structure yet inform on loc pattern of abund for thi specy is lack tig shark catch dat wer gath ov year of tag and releas research fish in shark bay western austral ¬∞‚ä≤s ¬∞‚ä≤e shark wer caught us drumlin deploy in six perm zon ‚àº km in are fish effort was standard across day and month and catch rat on hook wer express as the numb of shark caught h a tot of individ tig shark was capt wer recapt tig shark catch rat show season period being high dur the warm season sep may than dur the cold season jun aug and was mark by int an vary the most striking feat of the catch dat was a consist pattern of slow continu vary within each year from a peak dur the height of the warm season febru to a trough in the cold season july an grow rat of recapt individ wer gen consist with estim from oth reg but excess thos for pop elsewh for shark gt cm fork leng fl perhap becaus mat shark in the study are rely heavy on larg prey the dat suggest that the threat of pred fac by anim consum by tig shark fluctu dram within and between year and effort to monit larg shark abund should be extend enough to detect int an vary and sufficy intend to account for intr an trend,new,0.832659327042562,0.804715933117357,0.7838434787650264,0.7678427148035143,0.7552656708461312,0.7452614040544918,0.7373555343633716,0.7313440648990632,0.7272970441934874,0.7257004884479936,0.7280369475443874

The entrance channel to the Lakes was an important feeding site. Numbers feeding there increased on the flood tide and decreased on the ebb tide. Their dive rates followed the same pattern, suggesting they depended on shoals of juvenile fish entering the estuary during high tide. The number feeding varied from day to day, and dive rates were positively correlated with numbers, suggesting that the abundance of juvenile fish entering the channel also varied from day to day. There was no evidence that breeding success or number of breeding pairs were adversely affected by the 1995 mass mortalities of pilchard in the area. However, breeding success was reduced significantly in 1999 and 2000 following the 1998/1999 pilchard mortality. The 1995 mortality affected mainly larger size classes of pilchard, whereas the 1998/1999 mortality also affected younger age classes.

148,fish_australasia,"Demographic patterns of southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, as inferred from direct age data","Otolith-based age estimates were obtained for 2769 southern bluefin tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii) caught on feeding grounds in the southern oceans and their spawning ground in the north-east Indian Ocean between 1985 and 1998. Ages ranged from 0 to 41 years, and males were on average larger at age than females after age 6 for fish sampled in the southern oceans. This sexual dimorphism in growth contributed to the sex ratio being biased toward males for length classes ‚â•170 cm FL. The estimated age composition of catches, derived from age-length keys applied to length frequency data, showed clear differences between fisheries and fishing grounds that are consistent with seasonal and ontogenetic changes in migration patterns. Specific information that can be gained on the distribution and migration of juveniles from their relative abundance in catches is limited because of unknown targeting or discarding practices on some fishing grounds. However, the occurrence of 2-4-year-old SBT on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean during the austral summer confirms that juveniles are not restricted to the southern coastal waters of Australia, and that a divergent migration path must exist possibly near the southern west coast of Australia. During the winter months, SBT aged 2-4 years were caught on all fishing grounds south of the spawning ground, confirming that they are capable of extensive migrations. By age 5, SBT were rarely caught north of about 35¬∞S, except in waters adjacent to Australia's west coast where adults were caught migrating to/from the spawning ground. The commercial catch of SBT in the southern oceans was dominated by juveniles and sub-adults on most fishing grounds examined. Off north-east New Zealand, however, the majority of fish caught were of spawning age (61% were >10-year old) suggesting that the Tasman Sea may form the eastern boundary for juvenile migration. SBT caught on the spawning ground ranged in age from 8 to 34 years with the majority being between 15- and 25-years old.

1511,fish_australasia,Long-term trends in the Australasian gannet (Morus serrator) population in Australia: The effect of climate change and commercial fisheries,"The Australasian gannet (Morus serrator) population has increased considerably over the past century, both in New Zealand and Australia. Since 1980, the population in Australian waters has increased threefold, from 6,600 breeding pairs to approximately 20,000 pairs in 1999-2000, a rate of 6% per year. Reasons for the increase in the Australasian gannet population are poorly understood; here we consider the possible effects of recent fluctuations in climatic and oceanographic conditions, and changes in major local commercial fisheries. A significant trend towards more frequent, and stronger, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation events, warmer summer sea surface temperatures in Bass Strait, increased annual catches and catch per unit effort in the Victorian pilchard (Sardinops sagax) fishery and potential increased discarding of fisheries by catch may account for at least some of the observed increase in the Australasian gannet population.

169,fish_australasia,"A substantial recruitment year for the western yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus latus, Sparidae) sustains years of high catch rates in the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, Western Australia","A large increase in the annual commercial catch and catch per unit effort of western yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus latus) in the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, Western Australia, from 2002 to 2005 prompted an examination of the age structure of the 2005 catch. Sectioned otoliths from 108 fish were assessed to determine whether the cause was related to an increased abundance following a substantial recruitment. The 1999 age class was exceptionally strong, contributing 48.1% of the sample, and according to published growth rate estimates, this cohort would have recruited to the fishery at the same time catch rates began to increase.

178,fish_australasia,"Diel, seasonal, regional and annual variations in the characteristics of the ichthyofauna of the upper reaches of a large Australian microtidal estuary","Nearshore, shallow waters in three regions along ca. 14.5 km of the upper Swan River Estuary in south-western Australia, which undergo marked cyclical annual changes in freshwater discharge, and thus also in salinity, were sampled for 24 consecutive months. The atherinid Leptatherina wallacei and the gobiids Pseudogobius olorum and Afurcagobius suppositus dominated the ichthyofauna, ranking, in terms of abundance, first, second and third, respectively, in each of the upstream, middle and downstream regions. These three species and 11 others, which also complete their life cycles within estuaries, constituted 46.4% of the number of species recorded and contributed 93.5% to the total catch of fish. The characteristics of the ichthyofauna in the upper reaches of this microtidal estuary underwent annual cyclical changes and differed between day and night, regions and years. The number of species and density of fish peaked during summer and typically declined to their minima in winter and then rose markedly in spring. The annual cyclical change undergone by the species composition of each region during both the day and night was due to the densities of certain species peaking at different times of the year. The cyclical changes in composition were less conspicuous in the year when, in the summer, highly atypical heavy rainfall led to a sharp rise in freshwater discharge and thus a pronounced decline in salinity. The number of species and density of fish were far greater at night than during the day and the species composition underwent diel changes. These differences were due, in particular, to relatively greater abundances and frequencies of occurrence at night of the estuarine species A. suppositus, P. olorum, L. wallacei and Acanthopagrus butcheri and of the introduced freshwater species Gambusia holbrooki. Overall, marine species were relatively more abundant in the downstream region, whereas the reverse was true for the freshwater and semi-anadromous species. The freshwater species G. holbrooki, the estuarine A. suppositus, the semi-anadromous Nematalosa vlaminghi and the marine species Mugil cephalus were relatively more abundant in the upstream and middle regions, while the opposite was true for the marine species Aldrichetta forsteri and the estuarine species P. olorum, A. butcheri and Amoya bifrenatus, the last of which is also represented by discrete marine populations. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

188,fish_australasia,Does breathing apparatus affect fish counts and observations? A comparison at three New Zealand fished and protected areas,"Across three areas, open-circuit scuba (OC) and rebreather (RB) surveys produced similar results for the density and size distribution of fish species inside and outside marine reserves. At Tonga Island, more Notolabrus celidotus were counted with OC than with RB, independently of reserve status [log-scale response ratio of OC/RB (RR) = 0.7]. At Long Island, differences in abundance of Parapercis colias between sampling methods were small at reserve sites (RR = -0.1), but more were counted with scuba than with RBs at fished sites (RR = 0.5). RRs for Pagrus auratus were -1.0 in fished areas and 0.3 in the reserve at Leigh. We also sampled each site using a baited video system (BUV) to establish whether diver-transects sampled the full size range of target species. Most fish in BUV views were Parapercis colias at Long Island (97%), and Pagrus auratus at Leigh (77%). Size structures of Parapercis colias were similar among all three sampling methods within reserve and fished areas at Long Island (max. chi-squared distance = 0.11). BUV samples for Pagrus auratus at Leigh did not detect a prominent juvenile size class observed by divers, but size-frequency distributions of OC, RB, and BUV corresponded at sizes beyond 15 cm TL (max. chi-squared distance = 0.08). To investigate the effects of diver sound on fish behaviour at Long Island, we also compared fish activity when divers with RBs or scuba were present, when the sound of each breathing apparatus was replayed underwater, when no divers were present and no sound was replayed, and when bait was provided, within the reserve only. The lowest number of fish visits to the focal area (mean of 3.0 per 10 min) for Parapercis colias occurred with RB divers present. Maximum abundances of Parapercis colias in all speaker treatments averaged 4.1 per 10 min, whereas with scuba divers present maximum abundances were 5.7, and with baits the average was 38.0 per 10 min. ¬© 2006 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00227-006-0420-3,2-s2.0-33847284409,90,0.760047567,0,doe breath apparat affect fish count and observ a comparison at three new zealand fish and protect area across three area op circuit scub oc and rebreath rb survey produc simil result for the dens and siz distribut of fish specy insid and outsid marin reserv at tong island mor notolabr celidot wer count with oc than with rb independ of reserv stat log scal respons ratio of oc rb rr at long island diff in abund of paraperc colia between sampl method wer smal at reserv sit rr but mor wer count with scub than with rbs at fish sit rr rrs for pagr aurat wer in fish area and in the reserv at leigh we also sampl each sit us a bait video system buv to est wheth div transect sampl the ful siz rang of target specy most fish in buv view wer paraperc colia at long island and pagr aurat at leigh siz structures of paraperc colia wer simil among al three sampl method within reserv and fish area at long island max chi squ dist buv sampl for pagr aurat at leigh did not detect a promin juvenil siz class observ by div but siz frequ distribut of oc rb and buv correspond at siz beyond cm tl max chi squ dist to investig the effect of div sound on fish behavio at long island we also comp fish act when div with rbs or scub wer pres when the sound of each breath apparat was replay underw when no div wer pres and no sound was replay and when bait was provid within the reserv on the lowest numb of fish visit to the foc are mean of per min for paraperc colia occur with rb div pres maxim abund of paraperc colia in al speak tre av per min wherea with scub div pres maxim abund wer and with bait the av was per min,new,0.7850044255465487,0.7115839069852642,0.6533846993917267,0.6075913915406931,0.5708643827543146,0.540787265114163,0.5157459657272967,0.4946858311071313,0.4769740395831427,0.46234624771910465,0.4511146178564582
198,fish_australasia,Changes in community structure in temperate marine reserves,"'No-take' marine reserves provide a valuable tool for managing marine resources as well as for providing relatively undisturbed habitat with which to assess modifications to ecosystems. We studied 2 marine reserves in northeastern New Zealand, the Leigh Marine Reserve (established 1975) and Tawharanui Marine Park (established 1982) in order to assess whether changes in protected predator populations had resulted in other indirect changes to grazers and consequently to algal abundance. Estimates of abundance of the most common demersal predatory fish Pagrus auratus indicated that adults of this species (i.e. large enough to prey upon urchins) were at least 5.75 and 8.70 times more abundant inside reserves than in adjacent unprotected areas. Overall, P. auratus were also much larger inside reserves with mean total lengths of 316 mm compared with 186 mm in fished areas. The spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii displayed similar trends, and was approximately 1.6 to 3.7 times more abundant inside the reserves than outside. Lobsters within the reserves had a mean carapace length of 109.9 mm, compared with 93.5 mm outside the reserves. In one of the reserves, densities of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus had declined from 4.9 to 1.4 m-2 since 1978 in areas formerly dominated by it. Consequently, kelp forests were more extensive in 1998 than they were at the time of reserve creation. Urchin-dominated barrens occupied only 14% of available reef substratum in reserves as opposed to 40% in unprotected areas. These changes in community structure, which have persisted since at least 1994, demonstrate not only higher trophic complexity than anticipated in Australasian ecosystems but also increased primary and secondary productivity in marine reserves as a consequence of protection. Trends inside reserves indicate large-scale reduction of benthic primary production as an indirect result of fishing activity in unprotected areas.",10.3354/meps189125,2-s2.0-0033607767,75,0.757427891,0,chang in commun structure in temp marin reserv no tak marin reserv provid a valu tool for man marin resourc as wel as for provid rel undisturb habit with which to assess mod to ecosystem we study marin reserv in northeastern new zealand the leigh marin reserv est and tawharanu marin park est in ord to assess wheth chang in protect pred pop had result in oth indirect chang to graz and consequ to alg abund estim of abund of the most common demers pred fish pagr aurat ind that adult of thi specy i e larg enough to prey upon urchin wer at least and tim mor abund insid reserv than in adjac unprotect area overal p aurat wer also much larg insid reserv with mean tot length of mm comp with mm in fish area the spiny lobst jas edwardsi display simil trend and was approxim to tim mor abund insid the reserv than outsid lobst within the reserv had a mean carapac leng of mm comp with mm outsid the reserv in on of the reserv dens of the sea urchin evechin chloroticus had declin from to m sint in area form domin by it consequ kelp forest wer mor extend in than they wer at the tim of reserv cre urchin domin bar occupy on of avail reef substrat in reserv as oppos to in unprotect area thes chang in commun structure which hav persist sint at least demonst not on high troph complex than anticip in australas ecosystem but also increas prim and second produc in marin reserv as a consequ of protect trend insid reserv ind larg scal reduc of benth prim produc as an indirect result of fish act in unprotect area,new,0.7802303738441747,0.7331035837076166,0.6982773354458912,0.6719773608038228,0.6515889522720051,0.6355494981998732,0.6229643642460381,0.613394247942683,0.6068122757412887,0.6037654002402373,0.6060513096425413
208,fish_australasia,Estimating abundance of pelagic fishes using gillnet catch data in data-limited fisheries: A Bayesian approach,"We describe a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate abundance and biomass of pelagic fishes from gillnet catches in data-limited situations. By making a number of simple assumptions, we use fish sustained swimming speed to calculate the effective area fished by a gillnet in a specified soak time to estimate abundance (fish¬∑km-2) from the number of fish caught. We used catch data from various sampling methods in northern Australia and elicited anecdotal information from experts to build a size distribution of the true population to compensate for size classes that were unlikely to be represented in the catch because of size selectivity of the gear. Our final abundance estimates for various-sized scombrids (0.04-4.17 fish¬∑km-2) and istiophorids (0.004-0.005 fish¬∑km-2) were similar to what has been estimated for similar species in more data-rich situations in tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean. The model is particularly useful in data-limited situations in which abundance or biomass estimates are required for pelagic fish species of low economic importance. These data are often required for ecosystem models (e.g., Ecopath) that are increasingly being considered as potential tools for ecosystem-based fisheries management. ¬© 2007 NRC.",10.1139/F07-073,2-s2.0-35349004762,19,0.7570085409999999,1,estim abund of pel fish us gillnet catch dat in dat limit fishery a bayes approach we describ a bayes model approach to estim abund and biomass of pel fish from gillnet catch in dat limit situ by mak a numb of simpl assum we us fish sustain swim spee to calc the effect are fish by a gillnet in a spec soak tim to estim abund fish¬∑km from the numb of fish caught we us catch dat from vary sampl method in northern austral and elicit anecdot inform from expert to build a siz distribut of the tru pop to compens for siz class that wer unlik to be repres in the catch becaus of siz select of the gear our fin abund estim for vary siz scombrid fish¬∑km and istiophorid fish¬∑km wer simil to what has been estim for simil specy in mor dat rich situ in trop reg of the pac oc the model is particul us in dat limit situ in which abund or biomass estim ar requir for pel fish specy of low econom import thes dat ar oft requir for ecosystem model e g ecopa that ar increas being consid as pot tool for ecosystem bas fishery man,new,0.7856448646355079,0.7151014065556398,0.6585814313582748,0.613446384208365,0.5766750635143949,0.5460499818923295,0.5200344830541188,0.49754714860692323,0.4778028961512315,0.46015305329257095,0.44403105713056523
2112,fish_australasia,Is climate change affecting the population dynamics of the endangered Pacific loggerhead sea turtle?,"The loggerhead sea turtle is an endangered species exposed to many anthropogenic hazards in the Pacific. It is widely held that pelagic longline fisheries pose the major risk for Pacific loggerheads but the effects of other risk factors such as human-induced global climate change have rarely been considered. So we used generalised additive regression modelling and autoregressive-prewhitened cross-correlation analysis to explore whether regional ocean temperatures affect the long-term nesting population dynamics for the 2 Pacific loggerhead genetic stocks (Japan, Australia). We found that both Pacific stocks have been exposed to slowly increasing trends in mean annual sea surface temperature in their respective core regional foraging habitats over the past 50¬†years. We show that irrespective of whether a population was decreasing or increasing that there was an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature in the core foraging region during the year prior to the summer nesting season. Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperatures are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity. So warming regional ocean temperatures could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment unless Pacific loggerheads adapt by shifting their foraging habitat to cooler regions. So the gradual warming of the Pacific Ocean over the past 50¬†years is a major risk factor that must be considered in any meaningful diagnosis of the long-term declines apparent for some Pacific loggerhead nesting populations. ¬© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

228,fish_australasia,"Estimating the abundance and size structure of an estuarine population of the sparid Pagrus auratus, using a towed camera during nocturnal periods of inactivity, and comparisons with conventional sampling techniques","An estimate of the absolute abundance of a population of the sparid Pagrus auratus ('snapper') was obtained by towing a dropped underwater video (DUV) camera close to the sea bed during darkness when this species is inactive (asleep), counting the number of fish present and estimating their sizes. This method was used in an estuary and compared with active (beam trawl, Danish seine, SCUBA visual counts) and passive (multi-panel gillnets, pots, Sabiki jigs, baited underwater video) fish sampling methods. The DUV detected a wide snapper size range (2-70 cm), which from around 5 cm and up appear to represent absolute abundance estimates. For snapper 5 cm and below, density estimates were less than those obtained by fine-mesh beam trawl, which sampled snapper down to 17 mm fork length (recent settlers from the plankton). Total DUV estimates of 0+ snapper abundance (3-9 cm) within this estuarine system were 64,000 ¬± 20,000 (standard error), compared to 105,000 ¬± 17,000 by beam trawl. For snapper 10 cm and larger (1+ and older), the DUV population estimate for the harbour was 166,000 ¬± 28,000. These larger snapper were not vulnerable to the beam trawl, while Danish seine sampling returned estimates of 20,000-80,000 (5000-20,000) fish, depending on the swept area assumptions used. None of the passive methods were able to provide relative or absolute estimates of the overall snapper population size, and each returned strongly skewed snapper length frequencies. The DUV was also able to collect detailed imagery of seafloor habitat features, at the spatial scales of both sampling transects, and individual sleeping fish. This combination of new technologies and specific fish behaviour (sleeping inert on the seafloor) offers a significant new sampling tool for assessing absolute fish abundance and associated population size structures. There is now a strong and ongoing focus by the marine science and management community, on seafloor habitat mapping, and associated Geographic Information System (GIS) resource inventorying. The addition of night deployed DUV sampling into such field deployments offers significant additional fish-habitat information gains to be made within these frameworks, at little additional cost. ¬© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

238,fish_australasia,Effect of predator-prey and competitive interactions on size at emergence in the black-lip abalone Haliotis rubra in a Tasmanian MPA,"Following more than a decade of protection from fishing activity, the direct and indirect effects of fishing on benthic community structure are becoming apparent inside no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) on Tasmania's east coast. Gradual increases in the abundance and average size of putative abalone predators inside the no-take Maria Island Marine Reserve (MIMR) have coincided with increases in the minimum size of the emergent abalone Haliotis rubra. This suggests that the threat of predation may influence the structuring of abalone populations. The abundance of emergent abalone was negatively associated with predator abundance, especially the rock lobster Jasus edwardsii, inside the MPA and in adjacent fished areas. Abalone leave cryptic habitat at smaller sizes in fished areas compared to abalone inside the MPA. Although the patterns in abalone size at emergence (SAE) were strongly correlated with rock lobster abundance and average size, the abundance of other predators (demersal predatory fish and crabs) or competitors (sea urchins) did not influence the patterns in abalone SAE. However, predation mortality in isolation could not account for the differences we observed in abalone size frequency distributions between MPA and adjacent fished locations. We suggest that a combination of factors including predation, intra and interspecific competitive interactions are responsible for patterns in abalone SAE. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.",10.3354/meps07521,2-s2.0-53549126882,46,0.753599365,1,effect of pred prey and competit interact on siz at emerg in the black lip abalon haliot rubr in a tasm mpa follow mor than a decad of protect from fish act the direct and indirect effect of fish on benth commun structure ar becom app insid no tak marin protect area mpa on tasman s east coast grad increas in the abund and av siz of put abalon pred insid the no tak mar island marin reserv mimr hav coincid with increas in the minim siz of the emerg abalon haliot rubr thi suggest that the threat of pred may influ the structuring of abalon pop the abund of emerg abalon was neg assocy with pred abund espec the rock lobst jas edwardsi insid the mpa and in adjac fish area abalon leav crypt habit at smal siz in fish area comp to abalon insid the mpa although the pattern in abalon siz at emerg sae wer strongly correl with rock lobst abund and av siz the abund of oth pred demers pred fish and crab or competit sea urchin did not influ the pattern in abalon sae howev pred mort in isol could not account for the diff we observ in abalon siz frequ distribut between mpa and adjac fish loc we suggest that a combin of fact includ pred intr and interspec competit interact ar respons for pattern in abalon sae,new,0.7910141229413178,0.7225663804424867,0.6676587634686743,0.6236061413614514,0.5874470170918982,0.557033674772014,0.5308734279841045,0.507888347461702,0.4872283006640641,0.46808402217310163,0.44945916887336085
248,fish_australasia,"Fish and the Barmah-Millewa Forest: History, status and management challenges","The Barmah-Millewa Forest is a large river red gum forest on the Murray River floodplain, well known for its ecological significance, particularly for waterbird breeding. Historically, a wide variety of native fish were abundant in the region, and they were an important component of the diet of the local Aboriginals. The region also quickly became the focus of a large commercial fishing enterprise after European settlement. Media records of the day suggest that the weekly catch varied from one to six tonnes of fish, mainly Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii). Catches of native fish soon began to decline, and combined with the later effects of other factors such as river regulation, native fish populations declined rapidly to present day levels. Today, whilst the Forest's fish fauna has been reduced in abundance and diversity and introduced species are common, the Forest remains an important area for native fish.

256,fish_australasia,"Distribution, abundance and biology of the smalltooth sandtiger shark Odontaspis ferox (Risso, 1810) (Lamniformes: Odontaspididae)","The smalltooth sandtiger shark, Odontaspis ferox, has a cosmopolitan distribution across warm temperate and tropical waters, and although essentially demersal, it has also been captured pelagically in mid-ocean. The species often occurs inshore at steeply shelving coastal and insular locations, and has now been identified by divers at eight widely separated shallow water sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, most O. ferox were caught by trawl on the continental slope, where its bathic range was extended to at least 880 m. Large specimens (>200 cm TL) were found across the whole depth range, but almost all juveniles were caught between 200 and 600 m. The largest recorded male was 344 cm TL, and female 450 cm TL. The few biological data suggest that size at maturity for males is around 200-250 cm TL, and for females 300-350 cm. No pregnant females were recorded but size at birth is probably about 100 cm TL. Nowhere has the species been found in large numbers. Survey and commercial catch data from south-east Australian trawl grounds suggest that numbers of O. ferox there have declined since the advent of deepwater commercial trawling in the 1970s. In areas of steep untrawlable terrain, increased gill-netting and longlining are likely to impact on local populations, with mature individuals being particularly vulnerable. Although O. ferox is not specifically targeted by commercial fishing activities, its likely very low fecundity make it susceptible to local extirpation, even at seemingly small capture rates. This species is protected off New South Wales and is considered "" vulnerable"" globally, by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",10.1007/s10641-007-9193-x,2-s2.0-36849057037,7,0.752444772,1,distribut abund and biolog of the smalltoo sandtig shark odontasp ferox risso lamniform odontaspidida the smalltoo sandtig shark odontasp ferox has a cosmopolit distribut across warm temp and trop wat and although ess demers it has also been capt pel in mid oc the specy oft occ insh at steeply shelv coast and insul loc and has now been ident by div at eight wid sep shallow wat sit in the southern hemisph most o ferox wer caught by trawl on the contin slop wher it bath rang was extend to at least m larg specim cm tl wer found across the whol dep rang but almost al juvenil wer caught between and m the largest record mal was cm tl and fem cm tl the few biolog dat suggest that siz at mat for mal is around cm tl and for fem cm no pregn fem wer record but siz at bir is prob about cm tl nowh has the specy been found in larg numb survey and commerc catch dat from sou east aust trawl ground suggest that numb of o ferox ther hav declin sint the adv of deepw commerc trawl in the s in area of steep untrawl terrain increas gil net and longlin ar lik to impact on loc pop with mat individ being particul vuln although o ferox is not spec target by commerc fish act it lik very low fecund mak it suscept to loc extirp ev at seem smal capt rat thi specy is protect off new sou wal and is consid vuln glob by the world conserv un iucn,new,0.8025474912209221,0.7475073776590985,0.7043021884906546,0.6701502658524804,0.6425600103896325,0.6198589325080719,0.600983026916026,0.5852974456657536,0.5725338861497112,0.5628606055315175,0.557352878075277

Streams with high benthic invertebrate abundance and drift of aquatic origin had high fish abundance. However, terrestrial drift was the dominant food for adult banded kokopu over all seasons and streams, on average comprising 75% of their diet by number and 89% by weight. Annual growth rates of tagged individuals ranged from 3 mm to 16.5 mm, with smaller fish growing faster than large fish. Low growth rates of large fish were consistent with the recapture of a fish that had only grown from 195 mm to 215 mm in 7 years. Our observations confirmed the strong association between banded kokopu, pool habitat, and cover, and also indicated that high fish abundance restricted growth rates and movement and increased interaction. ¬© 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/00288330.2005.9517362,2-s2.0-22944477698,20,0.7519238970000001,0,grow diet mov and abund of adult band kokopu galaxia fasciat in fiv coromandel new zealand streams band kokopu pop wer survey season ov year in fiv coromandel streams to determin the influ of food supply on diet grow abund and mov streams with high benth invertebr abund and drift of aqu origin had high fish abund howev terrest drift was the domin food for adult band kokopu ov al season and streams on av compr of their diet by numb and by weight an grow rat of tag individ rang from mm to mm with smal fish grow fast than larg fish low grow rat of larg fish wer consist with the recapt of a fish that had on grown from mm to mm in year our observ confirm the strong assocy between band kokopu pool habit and cov and also ind that high fish abund restrict grow rat and mov and increas interact,new,0.7731696328447643,0.6996915368188418,0.6412286060201643,0.594642796705361,0.5567395302273801,0.5252444306784273,0.49860328592355524,0.47574096909383257,0.4559050051025428,0.43854254341948284,0.4232586240590699
277,fish_australasia,"Population structure and relative abundance of blue cod (Parapercis colias) off Banks Peninsula and in Dusky Sound, New Zealand","Estimates of blue cod (Parapercis colias) relative abundance and population structure were made from potting surveys of Banks Peninsula and Dusky Sound, New Zealand in 2002. Five inshore and two offshore strata around Banks Peninsula, and five strata between the inner fiord and the open coast of Dusky Sound were surveyed. In Banks Peninsula the overall mean catch rate (all fish) was 2.13 kg/pot per h (range 0.04‚Äì4.74) and coefficient of variation (CV) was 10.8%. Blue cod from inshore strata were significantly smaller than those from offshore strata, catch rates were lower, and the sex ratio was skewed towards males (inshore 2.2:1, offshore 0.74:1). In Dusky Sound the overall mean catch rate was 2.69 kg/pot per h (range 1.28‚Äì8.42), CV was 6.3%, highest catch rates were on the open coast, and overall sex ratio was 0.78:1 (male:female). Blue cod in the 1940s from throughout New Zealand were on average larger than blue cod in Banks Peninsula and Dusky Sound during this survey. Low relative abundance and small size of blue cod from the more accessible inshore areas, is consistent with fishing pressure causing a reduction in size and probably abundance, particularly in Banks Peninsula inshore strata. In Banks Peninsula, sex ratios in inshore areas are skewed towards males, possibly a result of fishing pressure. The results support other studies on protogynous fish species in which the removal of the larger final sex fish (males), promotes sex inversion. The plasticity of the sex inversion means that blue cod may be capable of restoring optimal sex ratios in the natural state, but may over-compensate with size specific anthropogenic removal of large numbers of individuals that would otherwise inhibit the sex inversion process. ¬© 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/00288330.2005.9517293,2-s2.0-18844437038,3,0.749331842,0,pop structure and rel abund of blu cod paraperc colia off bank peninsul and in dusky sound new zealand estim of blu cod paraperc colia rel abund and pop structure wer mad from pot survey of bank peninsul and dusky sound new zealand in fiv insh and two offsh strata around bank peninsul and fiv strata between the in fiord and the op coast of dusky sound wer survey in bank peninsul the overal mean catch rat al fish was kg pot per h rang ‚äì and coefficy of vary cv was blu cod from insh strata wer sign smal than thos from offsh strata catch rat wer low and the sex ratio was skew toward mal insh offsh in dusky sound the overal mean catch rat was kg pot per h rang ‚äì cv was highest catch rat wer on the op coast and overal sex ratio was mal fem blu cod in the s from throughout new zealand wer on av larg than blu cod in bank peninsul and dusky sound dur thi survey low rel abund and smal siz of blu cod from the mor access insh area is consist with fish press caus a reduc in siz and prob abund particul in bank peninsul insh strata in bank peninsul sex ratio in insh area ar skew toward mal poss a result of fish press the result support oth study on protogyn fish specy in which the remov of the larg fin sex fish mal promot sex invert the plast of the sex invert mean that blu cod may be cap of rest optim sex ratio in the nat stat but may ov compens with siz spec anthropog remov of larg numb of individ that would otherw inhibit the sex invert process,new,0.7803002337857303,0.7385303222592605,0.7086491842148672,0.6869391453661261,0.6708966141865337,0.6591137033836788,0.6508869765787665,0.6460413186062944,0.6449835735109674,0.6490822498933296,0.6619418980101385
307,fish_australasia,"Changes in the distribution and abundance of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in the upstream, freshwater reaches of rivers in the Northern Territory, Australia","Since they were declared a protected species in 1971, populations of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) have increased in the tidal rivers, freshwater swamps and marine waters of the Northern Territory. The recovery of the C. porosus population has been accompanied by an increase in the incidence of 'problem crocodiles' that represent a threat to people in freshwater and marine habitats. Despite the implications for human safety, little is known about C. porosus populations in the freshwater reaches of rivers, well upstream of tidal influence. In this study, we examined the density and body-size structure of C. porosus populations in three freshwater rivers using a combination of data from spotlight and helicopter surveys conducted between the 1980s and 2005, and the inland extent of C. porosus using distribution records in the Northern Territory. Since the 1980s, the density of C. porosus in upstream, freshwater reaches of the Daly and Roper rivers has increased, as has the inland extent of C. porosus on the Daly River. Although C. porosus was not detected in spotlight surveys of the Victoria River, helicopter survey and anecdotal records indicate that C. porosus was present after 1989. In all, 52.1% of the crocodiles sighted in spotlight surveys were 2.1-3.4 m long. Distribution records show that C. porosus occurs up to 235 km inland and at elevations of up to 126 m above sea level. The potential distribution of C. porosus is likely to be similar to that of barramundi (Lates calcarifer), a readily identifiable diadromous fish that must spawn in estuarine waters and occurs at elevations of up to 178 m above sea level. Because the density and inland extent of C. porosus in freshwater rivers is likely to increase, it is recommended that: (1) programs communicating crocodile awareness use the linkage between the presence of barramundi and the potential presence of C. porosus; (2) that crocodile warning signs be erected in upstream areas within the potential range of C. porosus; (3) that research be conducted on developing techniques to detect and exclude C. porosus from swimming areas; and (4) that widespread systematic surveys be undertaken to document the inland extent of C. porosus. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",10.1071/WR05090,2-s2.0-33751051692,25,0.7396823840000001,1,chang in the distribut and abund of saltw crocodil crocodyl poros in the upstream freshw reach of riv in the northern territ austral sint they wer decl a protect specy in pop of saltw crocodil crocodyl poros hav increas in the tid riv freshw swamp and marin wat of the northern territ the recovery of the c poros pop has been accompany by an increas in the incid of problem crocodil that repres a threat to peopl in freshw and marin habit despit the imply for hum saf littl is known about c poros pop in the freshw reach of riv wel upstream of tid influ in thi study we examin the dens and body siz structure of c poros pop in three freshw riv us a combin of dat from spotlight and helicopt survey conduc between the s and and the inland ext of c poros us distribut record in the northern territ sint the s the dens of c poros in upstream freshw reach of the daly and rop riv has increas as has the inland ext of c poros on the daly riv although c poros was not detect in spotlight survey of the victor riv helicopt survey and anecdot record ind that c poros was pres aft in al of the crocodil sight in spotlight survey wer m long distribut record show that c poros occ up to km inland and at elev of up to m abov sea level the pot distribut of c poros is lik to be simil to that of barramund lat calc a ready ident diadrom fish that must spawn in estuarin wat and occ at elev of up to m abov sea level becaus the dens and inland ext of c poros in freshw riv is lik to increas it is recommend that program commun crocodil aw us the link between the pres of barramund and the pot pres of c poros that crocodil warn sign be erect in upstream area within the pot rang of c poros that research be conduc on develop techn to detect and exclud c poros from swim area and that widespread system survey be undertak to docu the inland ext of c poros,new,0.7546417412016493,0.7094340371724701,0.6769971001043801,0.6530923094775009,0.6350342265009065,0.6212935063253011,0.6110411624219603,0.6039289224730494,0.6000684661248998,0.6002554657661475,0.6068577542289952
415,fish_australasia,"An index-removal abundance estimator that allows for seasonal change in catchability, with application to southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii","The index-removal method provides estimates of abundance, exploitation rate, and catchability coefficient. Estimates from the original method suffer from poor precision. Recent work has improved the precision of model estimates; however, the method still includes the strong assumption of constant survey catchability over years and seasons. This assumption is not tenable in many fisheries. This work introduces a new multiyear model, 2qIR, that allows catchability to differ between surveys of the same year. Simulations were performed to examine the effects of variability in (1) the exploitation rate among years, (2) survey catchability, and (3) the number of years of data on model performance. The 2qIR model estimates were always more accurate and precise than those of the other models examined and other model scenarios in which there was moderate contrast in exploitation among years, regardless of the seasonal difference between survey catchability coefficients. The ratios of survey catchability tested ranged from 0.1 to 10, but the model worked best at catchability ratios greater than 0.3. The 2qIR model performance improved slightly when a third year was added to the data set, but performance was similar with 3 or 5 years of data. In all types of simulations, the 2qIR model estimates were usable (i.e., not negative, infinite, or made with a convergence error) a greater proportion of the time than were annual model estimates. The 2qIR model produced reasonable results when applied to data from a population of southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii in Tasmania, whereas the models that assume constant catchability among surveys sometimes predicted exploitation rates exceeding 100%. The results from both the simulations and the lobster data suggest that the 2qIR model can be reliably applied in more situations than models that assume constant survey catchability. ¬© Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.",10.1577/T06-272.1,2-s2.0-45249120195,24,0.706065543,0,an index remov abund estim that allow for season chang in catch with apply to southern rock lobst jas edwardsi the index remov method provid estim of abund exploit rat and catch coefficy estim from the origin method suff from poor precid rec work has improv the precid of model estim howev the method stil includ the strong assum of const survey catch ov year and season thi assum is not ten in many fishery thi work introduc a new multiyear model qir that allow catch to diff between survey of the sam year sim wer perform to examin the effect of vary in the exploit rat among year survey catch and the numb of year of dat on model perform the qir model estim wer alway mor acc and prec than thos of the oth model examin and oth model scenario in which ther was mod contrast in exploit among year regardless of the season diff between survey catch coefficy the ratio of survey catch test rang from to but the model work best at catch ratio gre than the qir model perform improv slight when a third year was ad to the dat set but perform was simil with or year of dat in al typ of sim the qir model estim wer us i e not neg infinit or mad with a converg er a gre proport of the tim than wer an model estim the qir model produc reason result when apply to dat from a pop of southern rock lobst jas edwardsi in tasman wherea the model that assum const catch among survey sometim predict exploit rat excess the result from both the sim and the lobst dat suggest that the qir model can be rely apply in mor situ than model that assum const survey catch,new,0.7151174416561052,0.6785180534651556,0.6539393976207142,0.6376858046659932,0.627405190837066,0.6218401792755941,0.6204671666438634,0.6233675470575779,0.6313566764641371,0.6465230510041671,0.6738810447801877
472,fish_australasia,"Assessing the distribution and relative abundance of wobbegong sharks (Orectolobidae) in New South Wales, Australia, using recreational scuba-divers","Wobbegongs are benthic sharks that are commercially targeted in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Given a dramatic reduction of more than 50% in landed catch in a decade, there is a clear need to ensure that basic ecological data such as distribution and abundance are available for management use. Opportunistic sightings of wobbegongs collected by recreational scuba-divers were used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of wobbegongs in NSW. From July 2003 until January 2005, 304 dives were undertaken by recreational divers and 454 wobbegongs were reported. Larger numbers of wobbegongs were sighted in northern compared to southern NSW. Spotted and ornate wobbegongs were sighted in similar numbers, but species composition was highly variable across locations. Only a few juvenile and newborn spotted wobbegongs were sighted, whereas small ornate wobbegongs were mostly sighted north of central NSW. The latter were possibly the third, cryptic species, the dwarf ornate wobbegong. The paucity of sightings of small wobbegongs suggests that juveniles and newborns are inconspicuous to divers or that small wobbegongs are found in areas not visited by divers. Potential species and size segregation suggest that closing areas to fishing may enable populations to sustain current levels of commercial exploitation. The cost-effectiveness of using recreational scuba-divers to opportunistically collect distribution and relative abundance data was apparent from this study. However, the lack of spatial and temporal homogeneity in diving effort suggests that future studies should consider incorporating organized surveys and a facilitator, rather than using opportunistic records of sightings. ¬© 2009 EDP Sciences.",10.1051/alr/2009046,2-s2.0-70350349139,8,0.6998377290000001,0,assess the distribut and rel abund of wobbegong shark orectolobida in new sou wal austral us recr scub div wobbegong ar benth shark that ar commerc target in new sou wal nsw austral giv a dram reduc of mor than in land catch in a decad ther is a clear nee to ens that bas ecolog dat such as distribut and abund ar avail for man us opportun sight of wobbegong collect by recr scub div wer us to assess the distribut and rel abund of wobbegong in nsw from july until janu div wer undertak by recr div and wobbegong wer report larg numb of wobbegong wer sight in northern comp to southern nsw spot and orn wobbegong wer sight in simil numb but specy composit was high vary across loc on a few juvenil and newborn spot wobbegong wer sight wherea smal orn wobbegong wer most sight nor of cent nsw the lat wer poss the third crypt specy the dwarf orn wobbegong the pauc of sight of smal wobbegong suggest that juvenil and newborn ar inconspicu to div or that smal wobbegong ar found in area not visit by div pot specy and siz segreg suggest that clos area to fish may en pop to sustain cur level of commerc exploit the cost effect of us recr scub div to opportun collect distribut and rel abund dat was app from thi study howev the lack of spat and temp homog in div effort suggest that fut study should consid incorp org survey and a facilit rath than us opportun record of sight,new,0.7436009961152359,0.6690255368917963,0.6118952805567229,0.5680696477571519,0.5337886196852051,0.5065357092020603,0.4847325842229616,0.4674656464936566,0.45439178120379864,0.4458794260434486,0.4437630686481431
521,fish_australasia,"Hierarchical models improve abundance estimates: Spawning biomass of hoki in Cook Strait, New Zealand","It is often difficult to estimate abundance for a dynamic population, i.e., one that is moving through the survey area or in which birth or mortality rates are high. One approach is to estimate the proportion of animals present during each survey, using a model that estimates the dynamics of the survey proportion of the population. However, this can increase the uncertainty of the estimates if the dynamics parameters are not well estimated. Here we approached this problem by developing methods using hierarchical model structures, which allow us to share information on the dynamics parameters across years. We applied this modeling approach to the estimation of residence time and spawning biomass for New Zealand hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) in Cook Strait spawning grounds. By sharing parameters across years, we obtained better parameter estimates than by the traditional assumption that the dynamics in one year are independent of those of other years. By integrating the estimation of residence time into a dynamic model using simulated maximum likelihood methods, we also were able to calibrate acoustic estimates of spawning biomass for the fact that not all individuals are on the grounds at the time of the acoustic survey.

591,fish_australasia,Spatial synchrony in coral reef fish populations and the influence of climate,"We investigated spatial patterns of synchrony among coral reef fish populations and environmental variables over an eight-year period on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species (genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by ‚â§100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100-300 km to 500-800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate (the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: (1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances ‚â§100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, (2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales (>800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance (‚â§800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and (3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[158:SSICRF]2.0.CO;2,2-s2.0-34247170276,15,0.661185062,1,spat synchrony in cor reef fish pop and the influ of clim we investig spat pattern of synchrony among cor reef fish pop and environ vary ov an eight year period on the gre barry reef austral our aim wer to determin the spat scal of intr and interspec synchrony of fluctu in abund of nin damself specy gen pomacentr and assess wheth environ fact could hav influ pop synchrony al specy show intraspec synchrony among pop on reef sep by ‚â§ km and interspec synchrony was also common at thi scal at gre spat scal on four specy show intraspec synchrony ov dist rang from km to km and no cas of interspec synchrony wer record the two mech most lik to caus pop synchrony ar dispers and environ forc through reg correl clim the mor effect dispers may hav influ pop synchrony ov dist up to km as thi is the expect spat rang for ecolog sign reef fish dispers environ fact ar also lik to hav synchron pop fluctu via the mor effect for three reason dispers could not hav caus interspec synchrony that was common ov dist ‚â§ km becaus dispers cannot link pop of diff specy vary in both sea surfac temp and wind spee wer synchron ov gre spat scal km than fluctu in damself abund ‚â§ km and wer correl with an index of glob clim vary the el ni√±o southern oscil enso and synchron pop fluctu of most damself specy wer correl with enso larg pop increas oft follow enso ev we record reg vary in the strength of pop synchrony that we suspect ar due to spat diff in geophys oceanograph and pop charact which act to dilut or enh the effect of synchron mech we conclud that synchrony is common among pomacentr pop sep by ten of kilomet but less prev at gre spat scal and that environ vary link to glob clim is lik to be a driv forc behind damself pop synchrony at al spat scal on the gre barry reef,new,0.6769405524164392,0.6498286170684926,0.6327475965327384,0.6220098281102349,0.6157279352095948,0.6129817425712393,0.6134234217303599,0.6171593877653,0.6248441169338212,0.6381213386700825,0.6609614194516753
60,fish_australasia,Estimating prawn abundance and catchability from catch-effort data: Comparison of fixed and random effects models using maximum likelihood and hierarchical Bayesian methods,"Abundance and catchability are crucial quantities in fisheries management, yet they are very difficult to estimate, particularly for short-lived invertebrates. Using two distinct approaches - a standard non-hierarchical model (NH) and a hierarchical Bayesian model (HB) - abundance and catchability coefficients from a fishery depletion process for banana prawns (Penaeus merguiensis) in northern Australia were estimated. Non-hierarchical models treated each stock and year separately and individually, whereas the hierarchical models assumed some form of common underlying population from which the parameters for the individual cases generated by the combination of stock and year were drawn. Two HBs were considered. In HB1 it was assumed that annual abundance and catchability parameters came from separate populations, or distributions, for each stock. In HB2 it was assumed that these stock region distributions were not separate, but had their parameters drawn from a common distribution. Thus in HB2 all stocks shared information at the regional level. The results for both NH and HB methods were similar in most cases, indicating a fair degree of stability irrespective of the particular form of model chosen. However, the NH method suffered because the data were analysed in generally small sections and in many cases these sections were too small to allow precise estimation of both parameters and confidence intervals. The deviations of point estimates between the HB1, HB2 and NH models were more marked in catchability coefficient estimates than in abundance estimates, and large relative deviations typically occurred in stock regions and years with low fishing efforts, low catch or poor depletion trends over time. We conclude that the combined analysis using HB was superior because it could handle limited data, yielded credible interval estimates for all parameters and was computationally more efficient. ¬© CSIRO 2008.",10.1071/MF07090,2-s2.0-38649110506,22,0.656915177,0,estim prawn abund and catch from catch effort dat comparison of fix and random effect model us maxim lik and hierarch bayes method abund and catch ar cruc quant in fishery man yet they ar very difficult to estim particul for short liv invertebr us two distinct approach a standard non hierarch model nh and a hierarch bayes model hb abund and catch coefficy from a fishery deplet process for banan prawn penae merguiens in northern austral wer estim non hierarch model tre each stock and year sep and individ wherea the hierarch model assum som form of common und pop from which the paramet for the individ cas gen by the combin of stock and year wer drawn two hbs wer consid in hb it was assum that an abund and catch paramet cam from sep pop or distribut for each stock in hb it was assum that thes stock reg distribut wer not sep but had their paramet drawn from a common distribut thu in hb al stock shar inform at the reg level the result for both nh and hb method wer simil in most cas ind a fair degr of stabl irrespect of the particul form of model chos howev the nh method suff becaus the dat wer analys in gen smal sect and in many cas thes sect wer too smal to allow prec estim of both paramet and confid interv the devy of point estim between the hb hb and nh model wer mor mark in catch coefficy estim than in abund estim and larg rel devy typ occur in stock reg and year with low fish effort low catch or poor deplet trend ov tim we conclud that the combin analys us hb was supery becaus it could handl limit dat yield cred interv estim for al paramet and was comput mor efficy,new,0.6784484838282646,0.6332563859350971,0.6034354276481715,0.5837121693810103,0.5709469470249582,0.5635047775341459,0.5606817269805557,0.5624908144733989,0.5697783902487923,0.5848256149872093,0.6132393023608245
652,fish_australasia,"Fish assemblages of an Australian dryland river: Abundance, assemblage structure and recruitment patterns in the Warrego River, Murray-Darling Basin","Fish in dryland rivers must cope with extreme variability in hydrology, temperature and other environmental factors that ultimately have a major influence on their patterns of distribution and abundance at the landscape scale. Given that fish persist in these systems under conditions of high environmental variability, dryland rivers represent ideal systems to investigate the processes contributing to and sustaining fish biodiversity and recruitment in variable environments. Hence, spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure was examined in 15 waterholes of the Warrego River between October 2001 and May 2003. Fish assemblages in isolated waterholes were differentiated at the end of the dry 2001 winter but were relatively similar following high summer flows in January 2002 as a consequence of high hydrological connectivity among waterholes. Small, shallow waterholes supported more species and higher abundances than large-deep waterholes. Large, deep waterholes provided important refuge for large-bodied fish species such as adult yellowbelly, Macquaria ambigua, and the eel-tailed catfish, Tandanus tandanus. Recruitment patterns of bony bream (Nematalosa erebi), Hyrtl's tandan (Neosilurus hyrtlii) and yellowbelly were associated with high flow events and backwater inundation; however recruitment of yellowbelly and bony bream was also evident following a zero-flow period. Departures from typical flood-induced seasonal spawning patterns may reflect opportunistic spawning behaviours appropriate to the erratic patterns of flooding and dry spells in dryland rivers. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",10.1071/MF06025,2-s2.0-33748515239,11,0.647716999,1,fish assembl of an aust dryland riv abund assembl structure and recruit pattern in the warrego riv murray darl basin fish in dryland riv must cop with extrem vary in hydrolog temp and oth environ fact that ultim hav a maj influ on their pattern of distribut and abund at the landscap scal giv that fish persist in thes system und condit of high environ vary dryland riv repres id system to investig the process contribut to and sustain fish biodivers and recruit in vary environ hent spat and temp vary in fish assembl structure was examin in waterhol of the warrego riv between octob and may fish assembl in isol waterhol wer differenty at the end of the dry wint but wer rel simil follow high sum flow in janu as a consequ of high hydrolog connect among waterhol smal shallow waterhol support mor specy and high abund than larg deep waterhol larg deep waterhol provid import refug for larg body fish specy such as adult yellowbel macquar ambigu and the eel tail catf tandan tandan recruit pattern of bony bream nematalos ereb hyrtl s tand neosilur hyrtli and yellowbel wer assocy with high flow ev and backw inund howev recruit of yellowbel and bony bream was also evid follow a zero flow period depart from typ flood induc season spawn pattern may reflect opportun spawn behavio appropry to the er pattern of flood and dry spel in dryland riv,new,0.6925319237238905,0.6246016544802242,0.5749450765889561,0.5378298390481052,0.5093014733474438,0.48697239234861256,0.46943089414829253,0.45590176666277393,0.4461398875550357,0.44055119640384527,0.44090806446301084
661,fish_australasia,"Comparison of day and night fyke netting, electrofishing and snorkelling for monitoring a population of the threatened golden galaxias (Galaxias auratus)","The littoral zone of small off-stream water storage containing a translocated population of Galaxias auratus was sampled fortnightly at day and night with fyke nets, electrofishing and snorkelling over 3 months. Variation in population data provided by each method, including relative abundance indices, size structure, and habitat preferences, were examined. Aspects of behaviour and activity patterns were also investigated. Night sampling using all methods consistently yielded larger catches than day sampling. The size structure of catches varied, with electrofishing at night and fyke netting during the day having higher proportions of juveniles, whilst snorkelling at night and electrofishing during the day had higher proportions of adults. Fyke netting at night yielded by far the largest catches (~3-fold more than other methods) and also captured balanced proportions of juveniles and adults. Galaxias auratus had a strong diel activity pattern and were most active at night. The majority of the population migrated into the littoral zone during the night and back into deeper water during the day. A small number of juveniles remained in the littoral zone and some adults sheltered in the dense cover of species-rich littoral vegetation during the day. Shores with shallow depth profiles appeared to be preferred due to higher catches in these areas using all methods. Based on the results of this study, fyke netting at night in littoral habitats is recommended for monitoring populations of G. auratus. Fyke netting is likely to be an effective method for monitoring other lacustrine galaxiid species; however, further work is required to investigate the effects of habitat variables and fish community structure on activity patterns of galaxiids, and hence their catchability with various methods, in more extensive lentic environments. ¬© Springer 2006.",10.1007/s10750-005-9509-9,2-s2.0-33645078102,14,0.647142143,0,comparison of day and night fyk net electrof and snorkel for monit a pop of the threatened gold galaxia galaxia aurat the lit zon of smal off stream wat stor contain a transloc pop of galaxia aurat was sampl fortnight at day and night with fyk net electrof and snorkel ov month vary in pop dat provid by each method includ rel abund ind siz structure and habit pref wer examin aspect of behavio and act pattern wer also investig night sampl us al method consist yield larg catch than day sampl the siz structure of catch vary with electrof at night and fyk net dur the day hav high proport of juvenil whilst snorkel at night and electrof dur the day had high proport of adult fyk net at night yield by far the largest catch fold mor than oth method and also capt bal proport of juvenil and adult galaxia aurat had a strong diel act pattern and wer most act at night the maj of the pop migr into the lit zon dur the night and back into deep wat dur the day a smal numb of juvenil remain in the lit zon and som adult shelt in the dens cov of specy rich lit veget dur the day shor with shallow dep profil appear to be prefer due to high catch in thes area us al method bas on the result of thi study fyk net at night in lit habit is recommend for monit pop of g aurat fyk net is lik to be an effect method for monit oth lacustrin galaxiid specy howev furth work is requir to investig the effect of habit vary and fish commun structure on act pattern of galaxiid and hent their catch with vary method in mor extend lent environ,new,0.6802118346641532,0.6322309610503578,0.5997325706425902,0.5770912204535082,0.5611237418049346,0.5501547897929516,0.5433777066651305,0.5406054743430317,0.5423087955121914,0.5500423171931751,0.5678732720998655

Functional forms for processes that fitted Hauraki Gulf?Bay of Plenty (New Zealand) snapper (Pagrus auratus) population data were developed. The model was fitted to: commercial and research samples of proportions at age and length, commercial samples of proportions at age, tag?recapture estimates of numbers at length, a catch per unit effort abundance index, and sea surface temperature data. For each age?length element of the state matrix, the model determines a transition vector that gives a distribution of non-negative growth increments. Mean growth is both length- and age?length-dependent, but also varies between years. Annual mean growth and annual year-class strength were both found to be positively related to sea surface temperature, but during different seasons. It was also found that variations in growth between years resulted in moderate and sustained fluctuations in population biomass.

781,fish_australasia,"Population structure of turbinid gastropods on wave-exposed subtidal reefs: Effects of density, body size and algae on grazing behaviour","Knowledge of the population structure and feeding capabilities of herbivores is critical to evaluate their influence on energy flow and community structure in their habitats. We tested for patterns in abundance (24 reefs) and size (12 reefs) of turbinid gastropods across 4 locations spanning &gt;6¬∞ latitude (‚àº1000 km) in Western Australia, and we tested the effect of density (1 to 5 individuals) and size (38.8 to 747.1 g wet wt) of Turbo torquatus on consumption of macroalgae with different thal-lus structure (Functional Groups 3 to 5). Turbinid gastropods were found at all locations (up to 2.4 ind. m-2); 82.4% of all individuals were T. torquatus. One location (Marmion, Perth) had considerably higher abundances than all other locations. Populations of T. torquatus at the 2 southern locations had a broad range of sizes (9 to 119 mm total shell length [TSL]), although 1 location was dominated by small, and the other, by large, individuals. In contrast, both northern locations were strongly dominated by 1 size class (40 to 60 mm TSL). T. torquatus consumed Ulva lactuca, Hypnea valentiae, Hennedya crispa and juvenile Ecklonia radiata at rates of 150 to 450 mg blotted fresh weight d-1, depending on density of gastropods and species of algae. There was a positive relationship between the rate of consumption and size of T. torquatus when fed U. lactuca and H. valentiae. The present study has produced 3 main insights: (1) densities of turbinids on offshore, wave-exposed, subtidal reefs are similar to those in other coastal habitats; (2) patterns of abundances and sizes are consistent with broad-scale processes, such as ocean climate, fishing pressure and eutrophication; and (3) T. torquatus can consume a variety of macroalgae at rates that suggest it has the potential to exert top-down control of macroalgae, although low densities of gastropods preclude strong effects. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.",10.3354/meps07416,2-s2.0-47949116192,27,0.618478529,0,pop structure of turbinid gastropod on wav expos subtid reef effect of dens body siz and alga on graz behavio knowledg of the pop structure and fee cap of herb is crit to evalu their influ on energy flow and commun structure in their habit we test for pattern in abund reef and siz reef of turbinid gastropod across loc span gt ¬∞ latitud ‚àº km in western austral and we test the effect of dens to individ and siz to g wet wt of turbo torquat on consum of macroalga with diff thal lus structure funct group to turbinid gastropod wer found at al loc up to ind m of al individ wer t torquat on loc marm per had consid high abund than al oth loc pop of t torquat at the southern loc had a broad rang of siz to mm tot shel leng tsl although loc was domin by smal and the oth by larg individ in contrast both northern loc wer strongly domin by siz class to mm tsl t torquat consum ulv lactuc hypne valentia hennedy crisp and juvenil ecklon radiat at rat of to mg blot fresh weight d depend on dens of gastropod and specy of alga ther was a posit rel between the rat of consum and siz of t torquat when fed u lactuc and h valentia the pres study has produc main insight dens of turbinid on offsh wav expos subtid reef ar simil to thos in oth coast habit pattern of abund and siz ar consist with broad scal process such as oc clim fish press and eutroph and t torquat can consum a vary of macroalga at rat that suggest it has the pot to exert top down control of macroalga although low dens of gastropod preclud strong effect,new,0.6322269042147404,0.550521137864111,0.4938466216102903,0.45378036208602646,0.4246948233124199,0.403345832787075,0.3879336385739383,0.3776049931780947,0.37233525751632235,0.37326067663981066,0.3841129159619063
791,fish_australasia,Temporal changes in fish abundance in response to hydrological variability in a dryland floodplain river,"Riverine fish living in unpredictable flow environments tend to be ecological generalists with traits that allow them to persist under highly variable and often harsh conditions associated with hydrological variation. Cooper Creek, an Australian dryland river, is characterised by extreme flow variability, especially in the magnitude, timing and duration of channel flows and floods, which, if they occur, do so mainly in summer. The present study examined the influence of hydrological variability on fish assemblages and abundance in four waterholes in the Windorah reach of Cooper Creek over eight occasions between 2001 and 2004. Antecedent flows had marked influences on fish species richness and assemblage structure. Following high summer flows, all waterholes supported a rich and abundant fish fauna, whereas fewer species and lower numbers were recorded following periods of zero channel flow. Recruitment of three of the four most common and abundant species was enhanced when intermittent flows inundated backwater and floodplain habitats that provide a food-rich environment. Opportunistic responses to rising channel flows and occasional large floods in Cooper Creek help to explain the prominent 'boom' patterns of fish production in this arid-zone river, whereas low-level recruitment during periods of low or no flow maintains populations of some species through the 'bust'. ¬© CSIRO 2009.",10.1071/MF08118,2-s2.0-60749136080,10,0.612289588,1,temp chang in fish abund in respons to hydrolog vary in a dryland floodplain riv riverin fish liv in unpredict flow environ tend to be ecolog gen with trait that allow them to persist und high vary and oft harsh condit assocy with hydrolog vary coop creek an aust dryland riv is charact by extrem flow vary espec in the magnitud tim and dur of channel flow and flood which if they occ do so main in sum the pres study examin the influ of hydrolog vary on fish assembl and abund in four waterhol in the windorah reach of coop creek ov eight occas between and antec flow had mark influ on fish specy rich and assembl structure follow high sum flow al waterhol support a rich and abund fish faun wherea few specy and low numb wer record follow period of zero channel flow recruit of three of the four most common and abund specy was enh when intermit flow inund backw and floodplain habit that provid a food rich environ opportun respons to ris channel flow and occas larg flood in coop creek help to explain the promin boom pattern of fish produc in thi arid zon riv wherea low level recruit dur period of low or no flow maintain pop of som specy through the bust,new,0.668401515215168,0.6038677176882192,0.558662330623109,0.5260365018540808,0.5018473651294094,0.4837696147952444,0.47054835405976647,0.4616463077088406,0.45719967904074155,0.4583418845569937,0.468427922674733
951,fish_australasia,Evaluating the potential of night spotlighting as a method for assessing species composition and brown trout abundance: A comparison with electrofishing in small streams,"Direct counts of fish obtained by night spotlighting were compared with species composition and population estimates obtained from three-pass electrofishing obtained across 29 sites along small clear streams in the Otago region of New Zealand. The influence of habitat variables on the relative efficiency of each method was also examined. The same seven species of fishes were identified by both methods. Juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta were the only species present in sufficient numbers to allow comparison of abundance estimates using the two methods. A total of 777 brown trout were counted by spotlight and 803 brown trout were caught using electrofishing. Estimates of abundance obtained by spotlighting reflected population estimates obtained by three-pass electrofishing across most habitats. Electrofishing produced higher population estimates relative to spotlighting in fast-flowing turbulent riffle habitats, whereas counts obtained by spotlighting tended to be higher relative to electrofishing in slow-flowing pool habitats. The results suggest that spotlighting is an effective method for assessing fish composition and brown trout abundance in small clear water streams, although the extremes of water velocity may influence efficiency of both spotlighting and electrofishing. ¬© 2006 The Authors.",10.1111/j.1095-8649.2006.01215.x,2-s2.0-33750580089,21,0.574576985,0,evalu the pot of night spotlight as a method for assess specy composit and brown trout abund a comparison with electrof in smal streams direct count of fish obtain by night spotlight wer comp with specy composit and pop estim obtain from three pass electrof obtain across sit along smal clear streams in the otago reg of new zealand the influ of habit vary on the rel efficy of each method was also examin the sam sev specy of fish wer ident by both method juvenil brown trout salmo trutt wer the on specy pres in sufficy numb to allow comparison of abund estim us the two method a tot of brown trout wer count by spotlight and brown trout wer caught us electrof estim of abund obtain by spotlight reflect pop estim obtain by three pass electrof across most habit electrof produc high pop estim rel to spotlight in fast flow turb riffl habit wherea count obtain by spotlight tend to be high rel to electrof in slow flow pool habit the result suggest that spotlight is an effect method for assess fish composit and brown trout abund in smal clear wat streams although the extrem of wat veloc may influ efficy of both spotlight and electrof,new,0.6039635079010786,0.5348663789420145,0.48835835565643926,0.4563546075640353,0.43399830276563367,0.41866008249105147,0.40903685832553127,0.4047639073995005,0.406457060096647,0.4163577740250599,0.44053585508876825

At each site, the population parameters, relative abundance, age structure, and individual indices, such as condition factor, organ (gonad, liver, and spleen) to somatic weight ratios, and number and size of follicles per female, were assessed. Physiological (blood), biochemical (hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase [EROD] and plasma steroids), and other indicators (bile chemistry and liver metals) of exposure or response also were measured. No impacts on brown bullhead health were obvious at individual geothermal, municipal sewage, or thermal discharge sites or cumulatively along the river. Brown bullhead from the bleached kraft mill effluent site showed elevated levels of EROD, decreased numbers of red blood cells, increased numbers of white blood cells, and depressed levels of sex steroids. However, growth rates, condition factor, age structure, and gonadosomatic index suggest that discharges with significant heat or nutrients benefit catfish despite physiological impairment at one site. Consideration of brown bullhead population-level responses to discharges in a monitoring framework revealed three different population-level response patterns resulting from the point-source discharges. ¬© 2006 SETAC.",10.1897/05-315R.1,2-s2.0-33750543604,17,0.558974807,0,cum impact assess along a larg riv us brown bullhead catf ameiur nebulos pop the effect of point sourc and diffus discharg on resid pop of brown bullhead catf ameiur nebulos lesu in the waikato riv new zealand wer assess at sit both upstream and downstream of point sourc discharg at each sit the pop paramet rel abund ag structure and individ ind such as condit fact org gonad liv and spleen to som weight ratio and numb and siz of follic per fem wer assess physiolog blood biochem hep ethoxyresorufin o deethylas erod and plasm steroid and oth ind bil chem and liv met of expos or respons also wer meas no impact on brown bullhead heal wer obvy at individ geotherm municip sew or therm discharg sit or cum along the riv brown bullhead from the bleach kraft mil efflu sit show elev level of erod decreas numb of red blood cel increas numb of whit blood cel and depress level of sex steroid howev grow rat condit fact ag structure and gonadosom index suggest that discharg with sign heat or nutry benefit catf despit physiolog impair at on sit consid of brown bullhead pop level respons to discharg in a monit framework rev three diff pop level respons pattern result from the point sourc discharg,new,0.532616733374139,0.5054040429829391,0.490033360273901,0.48251738326636473,0.4808700493336601,0.48428977779120186,0.49278849331094055,0.5071749815769215,0.5294246531819828,0.563772060073783,0.6194629997548159
1141,fish_australasia,"The hyperbenthic plankton community: Composition, distribution, and abundance in a coral reef lagoon","Seasonal and diel variations in community structure and abundance of the lagoon hyperbenthic community were examined at Davies Reef, Great Barrier Reef. The lagoon floor community differed from that in the overlying water, it was faunistically more uniform, and it was assembled into statistically distinct seasonal and diel groupings. The lagoon floor community was characterized by reef-associated mysids, gammarids, calanoids, ostracods, harpacticoids, cyclopoids, nematodes, caprellids, and cumaceans. The community was most distinctive in October. The water column community had greater diel than seasonal variability. The nocturnal water column community was characterized by decapod larvae, zoea, larvaceans, fish larvae, gastropod larvae, and nauplii, but was dominated numerically by calanoid copepods (&gt;60%). Catches on the lagoon floor ranged from 750 to 3330 ind. m-3, with peak abundance in October, while water column catches were lower (25 to 2500 ind. m -3), with peak nocturnal abundance in February. Most species in the hyperbenthic community do not migrate into the water column at night, but instead remain concentrated near the lagoon floor. Only the mysid Anisomysis laticauda, the copepod Acartia australis, and the ostracod Cypridina sp. A were consistently captured on the lagoon floor by day and in surface waters at night. The lagoon hyperbenthic community probably contributes to coral reef ecosystems through the remineralization of organic detritus. Given the high abundance of relatively large individuals, the contribution of the resident, lagoon floor community to coral reef ecosystems must be substantial. ¬© Inter-Research 2007.",10.3354/meps336077,2-s2.0-34249929831,12,0.530038417,0,the hyperbenth plankton commun composit distribut and abund in a cor reef lagoon season and diel vary in commun structure and abund of the lagoon hyperbenth commun wer examin at davy reef gre barry reef the lagoon flo commun diff from that in the ov wat it was faun mor uniform and it was assembl into stat distinct season and diel group the lagoon flo commun was charact by reef assocy mysid gammarid calanoid ostracod harpacticoid cyclopoid nematod caprellid and cumac the commun was most distinct in octob the wat column commun had gre diel than season vary the nocturn wat column commun was charact by decapod larva zoe larvac fish larva gastropod larva and naupli but was domin num by calanoid copepod gt catch on the lagoon flo rang from to ind m with peak abund in octob whil wat column catch wer low to ind m with peak nocturn abund in febru most specy in the hyperbenth commun do not migr into the wat column at night but instead remain cont near the lagoon flo on the mysid anisomys laticaud the copepod acart aust and the ostracod cypridin sp a wer consist capt on the lagoon flo by day and in surfac wat at night the lagoon hyperbenth commun prob contribut to cor reef ecosystem through the remin of org detrit giv the high abund of rel larg individ the contribut of the resid lagoon flo commun to cor reef ecosystem must be subst,new,0.5713628339803544,0.5080748603846174,0.46693518817202223,0.4393621092259786,0.4206044150828488,0.4082159729072985,0.4010412653761049,0.39881288222852446,0.40218870845228877,0.4133850308712139,0.43836967651742026

715,fish_neotropic,Ecological monitoring of fish assemblages downstream of a hydroelectric dam in French Guiana (South America),"Dam impacts on the downstream section of dammed rivers are known to be important for fish because of changes in the physical and chemical river characteristics. However, the available data seem to be insufficient to draw general conclusions regarding the transformation of fish communities. A hydroelectric dam was built on the Sinnamary River in French Guiana and closed in January 1994. From December 1991 to December 1996 fish collections were made from the downstream section. The results show a rapid decrease in fish abundance in the middle downstream course immediately after dam closure. This low abundance was observed until the end of the filling phase, when the flow was maintained at a minimum level. Afterwards, abundance returned to a level comparable with that prior to dam closure. Fish collection in different zones showed that the decrease in abundance was probably due to the escape of fish to shelter areas. Another marked effect was the reduction of sample diversity due to a decrease in species richness, as well as in the regularity of the distribution of species' relative abundance. Examination of biological traits of species suggests that under these conditions feeding strategies could have been the most important factor affecting the abundance of populations.",10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199907/08)15:4<339::AID-RRR546>3.0.CO;2-0,2-s2.0-0032733085,30,0.686967694642252,1,ecolog monit of fish assembl downstream of a hydroelect dam in french guian sou americ dam impact on the downstream sect of dam riv ar known to be import for fish becaus of chang in the phys and chem riv charact howev the avail dat seem to be insufficy to draw gen conclud regard the transform of fish commun a hydroelect dam was built on the sinnam riv in french guian and clos in janu from decemb to decemb fish collect wer mad from the downstream sect the result show a rapid decreas in fish abund in the middl downstream cours immedy aft dam clos thi low abund was observ until the end of the fil phas when the flow was maintain at a minim level afterward abund return to a level comp with that pri to dam clos fish collect in diff zon show that the decreas in abund was prob due to the escap of fish to shelt area anoth mark effect was the reduc of sampl divers due to a decreas in specy rich as wel as in the regul of the distribut of specy rel abund examin of biolog trait of specy suggest that und thes condit fee strategies could hav been the most import fact affect the abund of pop,new,0.7112736044448564,0.662429634531864,0.6290548594376796,0.6057102304783537,0.5891496900720852,0.5776385757736151,0.570343652368756,0.5670771779353615,0.5683419707738835,0.5758019611628957,0.5938037695085973

Aim to evaluate the impacts of different levels of hydrological control on the regional fish diversity, nutritional condition, trophic categories proportion, reproduction and young abundance monthly sampling were carried, between 1986 and 1993, during three annual periods with different flood duration and intensity. Lagoons, secondary channels and river channel was sampled with gillnet of different mesh size and standardized effort. Diversity, evenness indexes and number of species increased with the occurence of floods. The trophic category proportions varied among the periods considered, with a decrease in piscivores participation and an increase of iliophages, herbivores and insectivores (terrestrial) participation in big flood years. The tendencies for piscivores guild were not uniform to every species. The variations on the nutritional condition reveal that the absence of flooding has a negative effect on greater migratory species and positive on sedentary ones. The young abundance shows, however, that fail in the flooding has a strong negative impact on de recruitment of all the reproductive strategies. It's stressed the operational procedures in the upstream dams and the maintenance of the floodplain integrity is essential to preserve the regional biodiversity, fisheries and particularly the greater migratory fishes population.",,2-s2.0-0035161456,48,0.672986022663821,1,the import of floodplain for the dynam of fish commun of the up riv paran√° the last fre stretch of the riv paran√° insid of brazil territ about km of the form km run in a wid floodplain which flood regim is control in part by upstream dam aim to evalu the impact of diff level of hydrolog control on the reg fish divers nutrit condit troph categ proport reproduc and young abund month sampl wer carry between and dur three an period with diff flood dur and intens lagoon second channel and riv channel was sampl with gillnet of diff mesh siz and standard effort divers ev index and numb of specy increas with the occ of flood the troph categ proport vary among the period consid with a decreas in pisc particip and an increas of ilioph herb and insect terrest particip in big flood year the tend for pisc guild wer not uniform to every specy the vary on the nutrit condit rev that the abs of flood has a neg effect on gre migr specy and posit on sed on the young abund show howev that fail in the flood has a strong neg impact on de recruit of al the reproduc strategies it s stressed the op proc in the upstream dam and the maint of the floodplain integr is ess to preserv the reg biodivers fishery and particul the gre migr fish pop,new,0.7240292167719314,0.6910746869786057,0.6694500609178373,0.6551413205285946,0.6459009954394858,0.640592756346642,0.6387506235810599,0.640427408769019,0.6462915320667975,0.6581166408526632,0.6802791398079502
149,fish_neotropic,Factors affecting the distribution and abundance of the commensal Temnocephala iheringi (Platyhelminthes: Temnocephalidae) among the southernmost populations of the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata (Mollusca: Ampullariidae),"Temnocephala iheringi is the most common temnocephalan inhabiting the mantle cavity of the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, a freshwater neotropical gastropod that has become a serious rice pest in Southeastern Asia. T. iheringi has been recorded from Mato Grosso (Brazil) to water bodies associated with the R√≠o de la Plata river (Argentina). During an extensive survey in the southern limit of the native area of P. canaliculata the presence of T. iheringi eggs was recorded in several apple snail populations, extending the known distribution of the commensal more than 400 km southwards. The aim of this study was to understand the factors affecting the distribution and abundance of T. iheringi among populations of P. canaliculata. Only 23% of the apple snail populations inhabiting streams harboured temnocephalans while the occurrence among lentic ones was 71%. T. iheringi was found mostly in populations of apple snails living in non-alkaline sites and where snails attaining sizes larger than 4 cm were very common. The prevalence of the temnocephalans in lentic populations was higher than 90%. The number of eggs on the shell (not including the umbilicus) ranged between 0 and 470 and was different among populations of P. canaliculata. The prevalence and number of eggs were lower in the lotic populations, except for a stream population immediately downstream of a lake with commensals. There was no difference between males and females of P. canaliculata neither in the prevalence nor in the number of eggs on the shell. The southernmost population of the world of P. canaliculata harbours commensals that tolerate cold winter water temperatures (4-5¬∞C) as well as its host. On the other hand, T. iheringi was found only in sites with bicarbonate concentrations lower than 6.6 meq l-1, suggesting that the tolerance of the commensal is very much lower than that of the apple snail (up to 9.95 meq l-1). The number of worms inside each snail or the life history variation of P. canaliculata could explain the influence of the size of the snails on the occurrence of T. iheringi. In the big-sized snails, where the number of commensals is higher, the probability of survival of at least one worm is also higher, specially during the hibernation period, when crawling and feeding are null and snails remain buried. On the other hand, P. canaliculata snails from lentic populations are generally bigger and mostly iteroparous, while those inhabiting streams are smaller and semelparous. In these populations the snails have access to mate only with snails of their same cohort, while in iteroparous populations they can copulate with individuals of other cohorts, allowing the inter-generation transmission of worms and the long term persistence of the population of commensals. ¬© Springer 2005.",10.1007/s10750-005-1825-6,2-s2.0-21644434032,3,0.709829377212196,0,fact affect the distribut and abund of the commens temnocephal ihering platyhelminth temnocephalida among the southernmost pop of the appl snail pomace canaliculat mollusc ampullariida temnocephal ihering is the most common temnoceph inhabit the mantl cav of the appl snail pomace canaliculat a freshw neotrop gastropod that has becom a sery ric pest in southeastern as t ihering has been record from mato grosso brazil to wat body assocy with the r√≠o de la plat riv argentin dur an extend survey in the southern limit of the nat are of p canaliculat the pres of t ihering eg was record in sev appl snail pop extend the known distribut of the commens mor than km southward the aim of thi study was to understand the fact affect the distribut and abund of t ihering among pop of p canaliculat on of the appl snail pop inhabit streams harbo temnoceph whil the occur among lent on was t ihering was found most in pop of appl snail liv in non alkalin sit and wher snail attain siz larg than cm wer very common the prev of the temnoceph in lent pop was high than the numb of eg on the shel not includ the umbilic rang between and and was diff among pop of p canaliculat the prev and numb of eg wer low in the lot pop exceiv for a stream pop immedy downstream of a lak with commens ther was no diff between mal and fem of p canaliculat neith in the prev nor in the numb of eg on the shel the southernmost pop of the world of p canaliculat harbo commens that tol cold wint wat temp ¬∞c as wel as it host on the oth hand t ihering was found on in sit with bicarbon cont low than meq l suggest that the tol of the commens is very much low than that of the appl snail up to meq l the numb of worm insid each snail or the lif hist vary of p canaliculat could explain the influ of the siz of the snail on the occur of t ihering in the big siz snail wher the numb of commens is high the prob of surv of at least on worm is also high spec dur the hibern period when crawl and fee ar nul and snail remain bury on the oth hand p canaliculat snail from lent pop ar gen big and most iterop whil thos inhabit streams ar smal and semelp in thes pop the snail hav access to mat on with snail of their sam cohort whil in iterop pop they can cop with individ of oth cohort allow the int gen transmit of worm and the long term persist of the pop of commens,new,0.7250972664181492,0.6862254929795286,0.6601763469225957,0.6425378688266629,0.6307304567913131,0.6234102262218448,0.6199942808853162,0.6204902556256596,0.625592826461067,0.637210050452863,0.6600561842462394
1512,fish_neotropic,Genetic conservation of Brazilian fishes - Present state and perspectives,"Natural environments have been worldwide affected by the growing impact of anthropogenic actions that promote the reduction or the extinction of several vertebrate species. Aquatic ecosystems represent one of the most affected environments and many fish species and/or populations have been increasingly fragmented distributed due to habitat degradation, predatory fishing, introduction of exotic species, river sedimentation, deforestation, pollution, reduction of food resource, and construction of hydroelectric dams. Actually, more than 150 Brazilian fish species, including freshwater, estuary and coastal species, can be considered threatened. Information on the diversity, conservation biology and population analysis on threatened species or populations, with several DNA markers, can be extremely useful for the success of fish species-recovery and maintenance programs. Although DNA analysis in Neotropical fish species are just beginning, they tend to increase with the widespread attention to the use of molecular approaches to minimize problems related to the risk of extinction. The accumulation of information on biology and pattern of genetic variation of fish species, associated with ecological and demographic data, and also education and respect to the nature, constitutes a crucial task to develop efficient conservation strategies in order to preserve the genetic diversity in aquatic environments.",10.5016/1806-8774.2004v6p79,2-s2.0-30344488133,10,0.5733250711127629,0,genet conserv of brazil fish pres stat and perspect nat environ hav been worldwid affect by the grow impact of anthropog act that promot the reduc or the extinct of sev vertebr specy aqu ecosystem repres on of the most affect environ and many fish specy and or pop hav been increas frag distribut due to habit degrad pred fish introduc of exot specy riv sedy deforest pollut reduc of food resourc and construct of hydroelect dam act mor than brazil fish specy includ freshw estu and coast specy can be consid threatened inform on the divers conserv biolog and pop analys on threatened specy or pop with sev dna mark can be extrem us for the success of fish specy recovery and maint program although dna analys in neotrop fish specy ar just begin they tend to increas with the widespread at to the us of molecul approach to minim problem rel to the risk of extinct the accum of inform on biolog and pattern of genet vary of fish specy assocy with ecolog and demograph dat and also educ and respect to the nat constitut a cruc task to develop efficy conserv strategies in ord to preserv the genet divers in aqu environ,new,0.5893026457798359,0.5514275020059125,0.527726531794185,0.5132294583621212,0.505241542651147,0.5024721111715001,0.5045231159348916,0.511757399045172,0.5255521701352633,0.5492480725377112,0.5909629446371452
179,fish_neotropic,"The freshwater habitats, fishes, and fisheries of the Orinoco River basin","The Orinoco River of Venezuela and Colombia is one of the great rivers of the world, ranking third by discharge after the Amazon and the Congo. In the Orinoco basin, riverine and floodplain habitats, including riparian forests, play key roles in the conservation of biodiversity and support commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries. The basin's three major floodplains regulate the amplitude and duration of floods, maintain fertile agricultural terrain, provide habitat for numerous terrestrial and aquatic species, and support the fishery. The fish fauna, which includes some 1,000 species, encompasses a great deal of ecological diversity in terms of geographic distributions, habitat affinities, functional morphology, and reproductive and feeding strategies. The Orinoco fishery is still multispecific, with around 80 different species found in the fish markets at different times of year. Current estimates indicate that annual sustainable yield is 40,000 - 45,000 metric tons. Fish culture in the region is underdeveloped despite decades of research and promotion. There is no serious commercial trade for ornamental fishes. Large regions of the Orinoco basin are still in a relatively pristine state, but aquatic resources are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction, overharvesting, pollution, and hydrological perturbation. Scientific understanding of diversity hotspots, critical habitats, and conservation status of fishes in the basin is currently insufficient to satisfy management needs. Compliance to fishery regulations is low and fishing is drastically modifying the relative abundance, population structure, and distribution of fish stocks. However, many sectors of the Orinoco basin are unexploited or only lightly exploited, and fish stocks can recover quickly if given the opportunity. Stricter enforcement of current fishery regulations would reduce the likelihood of stock collapses and other, possibly irreversible, changes in the fishery.

189,fish_neotropic,A stable isotope study of a neotropical stream food web prior to the extirpation of its large amphibian community,"Rapid and massive amphibian population declines have been reported throughout upland areas of the Neotropics. The abundance and species richness of Neotropical amphibian communities suggest that losses of this magnitude are likely to have strong effects at the ecosystem level. To improve understanding of the implications of their loss we used stable isotope analysis to examine trophic relationships in an ecosystem in which amphibians are dominant in a second-order forest stream at 750 m asl in Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama. We analysed Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and C:N ratios of major biotic components (basal resources, invertebrates, amphibians, fish and reptiles) in the stream and of the adjacent riparian food web. Tadpoles (mean Œ¥15N = 4.49‚Ä∞) and adult amphibians (mean Œ¥15N = 5.45‚Ä∞) were intermediate links in the aquatic and terrestrial food web respectively. High Œ¥15N signatures identified fish as top predators in the aquatic food web and snakes and the toad Bufo as top predators in the terrestrial food web. Isotopic signatures clearly distinguished between trophic groups of tadpoles: microbial feeders (Centrolenidae, Œ¥15N range = 0.91-3.05‚Ä∞), herbivores (Rana and Hyla, Œ¥15N range = 4.74-5.15‚Ä∞) and neuston feeders (Colostethus, Œ¥15N range = 5.31-6.40‚Ä∞). Dependence on autotrophic production was indicated by enriched signatures of carbon isotopes in pool dwellers versus those that reside in faster-flowing sections of the stream. High nitrogen concentrations in detrital matter (average 0.8%, C:N = 10.3) suggested that grazing tadpoles enhanced nitrogen fluxes and improved the quality of organic matter available to detritivores.

199,fish_neotropic,Diet of Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) in an estuarine environment,"The diet of the Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) was studied by analysing 289 regurgitated pellets collected from a roosting site at Lagoa dos Patos estuary, southern Brazil, between November 2001 and October 2002 (except April to June). In total, 5,584 remains of prey items from 20 food types were found. Fish composed the bulk of the diet representing 99.9% by mass and 99.7% by number. The main food items were White croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) (73.7% by frequency of occurrence, 48.9% by mass and 41.2% by number), followed by Catfish (Ariidae) and anchovies (Engraulididae). In Lagoa dos Patos estuary the generalist Neotropic cormorant fed mainly on the two most abundant demersal fishes (White croaker and Catfish), which accounted for the low niche breadth calculated. The total length of all fish preyed varied from 27.2 to 318.3 mm (113.5 ¬± 48.0 mm), and preyed White croakers' size differed between months. Neotropic cormorants seem to prey on most abundant class sizes of White croaker instead of selecting similar prey size throughout the time. However, temporary changes in diet in terms of food items, abundance and prey size were detected, revealing a high ecological plasticity of the species. Individual daily food intake of Neotropic cormorants estimated by pellets and metabolic equations corresponded to 23.7 and 27.1% of their body mass, falling in the range of other cormorant species. Annual food consumption of the population estimated by both methods was 73.4 and 81.9 tonnes, comprising mainly immature and subadult White croaker and Catfish which are commercially important. Temporal variations in diet composition and fish size preyed by Neotropics cormorants, a widespread and generalist species, suggest shifts according to fluctuations in the abundance of prey. The plasticity of this cormorant is also revealed by their ability to adjust feeding behaviour in response to temporal or local changes in the environment, from a generalist at the species level to a specialist at the individual or local population level. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00227-007-0824-8,2-s2.0-36849090075,18,0.690362254528709,0,diet of neotrop corm phalacrocorax brasilian in an estuarin environ the diet of the neotrop corm phalacrocorax brasilian was study by analys regurgit pellet collect from a roost sit at lago dos pato estu southern brazil between novemb and octob exceiv april to jun in tot remain of prey item from food typ wer found fish compos the bulk of the diet repres by mass and by numb the main food item wer whit croak micropogonia furnier by frequ of occur by mass and by numb follow by catf ariida and anchovy engraulidida in lago dos pato estu the gen neotrop corm fed main on the two most abund demers fish whit croak and catf which account for the low nich bread calc the tot leng of al fish prey vary from to mm ¬± mm and prey whit croak siz diff between month neotrop corm seem to prey on most abund class siz of whit croak instead of select simil prey siz throughout the tim howev temp chang in diet in term of food item abund and prey siz wer detect rev a high ecolog plast of the specy individ dai food intak of neotrop corm estim by pellet and metabol equ correspond to and of their body mass fal in the rang of oth corm specy an food consum of the pop estim by both method was and ton compr main im and subadult whit croak and catf which ar commerc import temp vary in diet composit and fish siz prey by neotrop corm a widespread and gen specy suggest shift accord to fluctu in the abund of prey the plast of thi corm is also rev by their abl to adjust fee behavio in respons to temp or loc chang in the environ from a gen at the specy level to a spec at the individ or loc pop level,new,0.7385267011372982,0.6716610907058989,0.622873148845384,0.5868048606881359,0.5594527651309567,0.5384072255856714,0.5222929688113378,0.5104336750453894,0.502778083484473,0.5001596254076941,0.5053538507980049

Differences were observed in population structure and reproduction along the longitudinal gradient and during the study period. Juvenile fishes occurred in high abundance, mainly in the downstream site after the rainy months. Adults occurred mainly in the intermediate and upstream sites. During their life cycle, adults optimise their reproductive strategy by concentrating the reproductive period with total spawn in a short time interval before summer rains dragged the juvenile, larval forms and/or eggs downstream.

2113,fish_neotropic,Longitudinal patterns of fish assemblages in a large tropical river in southeastern Brazil: Evaluating environmental influences and some concepts in river ecology,"This study aimed to evaluate environmental influences on fish distribution and to assess the extent to which concepts in river ecology accommodate levels of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of fish assemblages in a 1,080-km long tropical river. A total of 25 sites were sampled between November 2002 and March 2003 in two seasons (summer/wet versus winter/dry). A thermal gradient separating the upper reaches from the lower reaches was detected. The middle-upper reaches showed higher conductivity and lower dissolved oxygen and pH levels compared with the other reaches. Although some significant associations were found between some fish abundance and environmental variables, the most abundant species (Tilapia rendalli, Geophagus brasiliensis, and Oligosarcus hepsetus) occurred in most sites and under most environmental conditions. Fish community structure varied more in space (longitudinal) than through time (seasonal). The community in the lower reach species was more diverse in comparison with the other reaches. Differences in the fish assemblage structure among the longitudinal river sections appear to have been influenced by the effects of damming, and seem to be partially consistent with the Serial Discontinuity Concept, which views dams as discontinuities within the river continuum. Only the lower river reach showed seasonal differences in the fish community structure, attributable to the influence of flooding. Management plans and biodiversity conservation will benefit by considering the effects of dam disruption and flood increased connectivity to the lotic systems. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10750-008-9551-5,2-s2.0-57649205378,43,0.636442046820137,0,longitudin pattern of fish assembl in a larg trop riv in southeastern brazil evalu environ influ and som conceiv in riv ecolog thi study aim to evalu environ influ on fish distribut and to assess the ext to which conceiv in riv ecolog accommod level of spatio temp heterog of fish assembl in a km long trop riv a tot of sit wer sampl between novemb and march in two season sum wet vers wint dry a therm grady sep the up reach from the low reach was detect the middl up reach show high conduc and low dissolv oxyg and ph level comp with the oth reach although som sign assocy wer found between som fish abund and environ vary the most abund specy tilap rendall geophag brasiliens and oligosarc hepset occur in most sit and und most environ condit fish commun structure vary mor in spac longitudin than through tim season the commun in the low reach specy was mor divers in comparison with the oth reach diff in the fish assembl structure among the longitudin riv sect appear to hav been influ by the effect of dam and seem to be part consist with the ser discontinu conceiv which view dam as discontinu within the riv continu on the low riv reach show season diff in the fish commun structure attribut to the influ of flood man plan and biodivers conserv wil benefit by consid the effect of dam disrupt and flood increas connect to the lot system,new,0.6748650144839689,0.633960348941143,0.607157350781232,0.5893042698971617,0.5775156023231705,0.5703119995280184,0.5670439629099647,0.567671037509221,0.5728388121311132,0.5843950587564293,0.6070646934984584

This study was carried out in a stretch of the Para√≠ba do Sul River in bracketing a large urban-industrial complex. The aim was to assess eventual effects that the industrial complex could have on distribution of two closely related fish species of guppies, Phalloceros caudimaculatus and Poecilia reticulata. The area was divided into three zones: Z1, 40 km upriver of the major urban-industrial complex of Volta Redonda; Z2, just down river of the complex; and Z3, 30 km down river of the complex. Six sites (two in each zone) were sampled monthly between November 1998 and October 1999, using a standardized fishing effort with cast net throws, trays lifts and seine hauls, covering different microhabitats, that is, riffles, pools and the proximity of the river's margins. Poecilia reticulata was widely distributed, peaking at Z2, the most polluted area, while P. caudimaculatus showed the highest abundance at Z3, being almost absent in Z1. Both species occurred in high numbers throughout the year but they were scarce between April and June. Females outnumbered males for both species in most size classes and at all sites. Juveniles were more abundant than adults, with non-pregnant females outnumbering pregnant ones. Condition factor was always higher in males than females but only males P. reticulata showed significant difference among the three zones, with the highest values at Z2. The higher number of females confirms the expectation that these species can use very polluted areas and that availability of food provided by organic loads allowed their distribution all over the area.

Data exhibited the plummeting of waterfowl abundance in this lagoon in 1955, which had no equivalence in other estuarine systems in southern Mexico. The species involved did not exhibit range-wide population reductions either. Most likely, this reduction was caused by man deriving the greatest part of fresh water from the Ayuquila-Armer√≠a watershed for human use, mostly agriculture, causing the loss or deterioration of ecological processes in the lagoon. The role of freshwater supply to Laguna Cuyutl√°n has been neglected by researchers and managers alike, while, conversely, they supported the opening of the lagoon to the sea. The effects of freshwater flow into Laguna Cuyutl√°n, as well as the supposed benefit of artificial connections with the sea, should be examined much more thoroughly, to provide sounder management actions for the conservation or restoration of the lagoon's ecological characteristics.

249,fish_neotropic,"Analysis of fish communities along a rural-urban gradient in a neotropical stream (Piracicaba River Basin, S√£o Paulo, Brazil)","This study investigated the fish fauna of a stream in southeastern Brazil that runs through sugar cane-growing and urban areas that are subject to sewage discharge. It aimed to determine the importance of spatial and environmental factors on fish distributions and to assess the use of fish as indicators of the environmental conditions. A longitudinal pattern of chemical water quality was observed, with more disturbed conditions at the urban sites. Several opportunistic or tolerant and omnivorous species such as Astyanax altiparanae, Poecilia reticulata, and Astyanax fasciatus were numerically abundant at these urban sites, which resulted in a consistent increase in species density and biomass along the stream. Redundancy analysis extracted three axes, identifying a nutrient-productivity gradient associated with different species composition patterns, as also detected by the indicator species analysis. No species could be considered a potential indicator of the agricultural area in the dry season, whereas four different species were judged potential indicators of three urban sites. In order to explain species distribution, variation in species abundance was partitioned into spatial and environmental components. The latter was more important, explaining 25.4% of the variation. We concluded that the fish assemblage of the Guamium stream is undergoing the initial stages of disturbance, with pronounced effects at the urbanized area, but no detectable changes at the sugar cane sites. Therefore, fish assemblages might be used as ecological indicators to detect urban impacts in similar rivers. However, the potential use of fish to diagnose stressors in areas of sugar cane plantations should be complementary to more comprehensive studies aimed at understanding the influence of this crop on freshwater resources. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10750-009-0060-y,2-s2.0-76349088056,23,0.5213311199594061,0,analys of fish commun along a rur urb grady in a neotrop stream piracicab riv basin s√£o paulo brazil thi study investig the fish faun of a stream in southeastern brazil that run through sug can grow and urb area that ar subject to sew discharg it aim to determin the import of spat and environ fact on fish distribut and to assess the us of fish as ind of the environ condit a longitudin pattern of chem wat qual was observ with mor disturb condit at the urb sit sev opportun or tol and omn specy such as astyanax altiparana poecil reticulat and astyanax fasciat wer num abund at thes urb sit which result in a consist increas in specy dens and biomass along the stream redund analys extract three ax ident a nutry produc grady assocy with diff specy composit pattern as also detect by the ind specy analys no specy could be consid a pot ind of the agricult are in the dry season wherea four diff specy wer judg pot ind of three urb sit in ord to explain specy distribut vary in specy abund was partit into spat and environ compon the lat was mor import explain of the vary we conclud that the fish assembl of the guam stream is undergo the init stag of disturb with pronount effect at the urb are but no detect chang at the sug can sit theref fish assembl might be us as ecolog ind to detect urb impact in simil riv howev the pot us of fish to diagnos stressors in area of sug can plant should be compl to mor comprehend study aim at understand the influ of thi crop on freshw resourc,new,0.5361224714934696,0.4786381146331792,0.4427705268361272,0.4197755080080796,0.4050317497802254,0.3962472220703912,0.3924028678446892,0.3933442268119336,0.39982154003704556,0.4141193878798842,0.442175555250631
257,fish_neotropic,Responses of odonate communities to environmental factors in southern Brazil wetlands,"Odonate larvae play an important role in wetland systems, providing food for many fish species and birds. Besides, they are important predators in these ecosystems. However, studies of factors that determine odonate species richness and distribution in wetlands are scarce in the Neotropical region. The objectives of this study were to: 1) conduct a survey of the diversity of odonate larvae in southern Brazil wetlands, and 2) determine how much variation in odonate richness, abundance and composition is explained by wetland area, altitude, water conductivity and nitrate, hydroperiod, and dominant aquatic vegetation in 140 wetlands in an extensive area of the Neotropical region (‚àº280,000 km2, southern Brazil). A total of 4,039 individuals distributed among five families and 28 genera were collected. Libellulidae, Coenagrionidae and Aeshnidae were the families that showed the greatest richness. Erythrodiplax was observed in more than 70 of the sampled wetlands, and comprised 61 of individuals collected. Richness was negatively associated with wetland area and nitrate concentration. Odonate abundance was negatively associated with water conductivity and nitrate, and it was higher in aquatic beds than in emergent wetlands. Richness and abundance were higher in permanent than in intermittent wetlands. Variation in odonate composition was correlated with wetland altitude, area and water conductivity. Hydroperiod and dominant aquatic vegetation also influenced composition. Our results showed that southern Brazil wetlands are important habitats for 28 odonate genera, and that richness, abundance and composition are influenced mainly by hydroperiod, nitrate, and aquatic vegetation type. These results should be seen as important to determine the environmental factors that shape and maintain odonate diversity in southern Brazil wetlands. ¬© 2010 Kansas Entomological Society.",10.2317/JKES0910.13.1,2-s2.0-77957283700,22,0.488313137270403,0,respons of odon commun to environ fact in southern brazil wetland odon larva play an import rol in wetland system provid food for many fish specy and bird besid they ar import pred in thes ecosystem howev study of fact that determin odon specy rich and distribut in wetland ar scarc in the neotrop reg the object of thi study wer to conduc a survey of the divers of odon larva in southern brazil wetland and determin how much vary in odon rich abund and composit is explain by wetland are altitud wat conduc and nit hydroperiod and domin aqu veget in wetland in an extend are of the neotrop reg ‚àº km southern brazil a tot of individ distribut among fiv famy and gener wer collect libellulida coenagrionida and aeshnida wer the famy that show the greatest rich erythrodiplax was observ in mor than of the sampl wetland and compr of individ collect rich was neg assocy with wetland are and nit cont odon abund was neg assocy with wat conduc and nit and it was high in aqu bed than in emerg wetland rich and abund wer high in perm than in intermit wetland vary in odon composit was correl with wetland altitud are and wat conduc hydroperiod and domin aqu veget also influ composit our result show that southern brazil wetland ar import habit for odon gener and that rich abund and composit ar influ main by hydroperiod nit and aqu veget typ thes result should be seen as import to determin the environ fact that shap and maintain odon divers in southern brazil wetland,new,0.5450967759864448,0.4835574839477288,0.4457207441018938,0.4219733199438364,0.4072476712888194,0.3990713144020222,0.39639907240067357,0.3991813956584189,0.4084601527045537,0.4272012189103821,0.46295999501016066
268,fish_neotropic,"Habitat, abundance and diet of invasive suckermouth armored catfish (Loricariidae Pterygoplichthys) in the Nong Yai Canal, East Thailand","Invasive non-indigenous aquatic flora and fauna have become increasingly common in Thailand, threatening the country's ecosystems and biological resources. A species of Neotropical suckermouth armored catfish (family Loricariidae), tentatively identified as the Amazon sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys pardalis Castelnau 1855, is established in Thailand where it is becoming increasingly widespread and abundant. In March 2008, the local and national news reported that thousands of Pterygoplichthys were present in the Nong Yai Canal in eastern Thailand. Their report prompted us to investigate the abundance, diet, and habitat of this invasive species. Field sampling revealed that the average density Pterygoplichthys in the canal was 88 ¬± 93 individuals/100 m2. They were most abundant in the heavily urban downstream region of the canal. Over 70% of the total number of fishes taken in beach seine samples were Pterygoplichthys. The remaining 30% was a mix of native and non-native fish species. Linear regression of the abundance data indicates that native fishes will further decline and may eventually disappear in sites where Pterygoplichthys become established.

A case study of a biogeographic province in Venezuela [¬øLas √°reas protegidas conservan los peces continentales neotropicales? un caso de estudio para una provincia biogeogr√°fica en Venezuela],"The effectiveness of protected areas to conserve freshwater fishes is limited because these areas are not usually congruent with regional patterns of fish species richness and distribution. We compared the richness, distribution and abundance of coastal freshwater fishes in a biogeographic province of Venezuela to determine their conservation status. We also estimated the relevance of existing protected areas in conserving fishes in different physiographic units and tributaries by evaluating species richness and distribution. The ichthyofauna (72 spp., ~30% endemic, ~10% threatened) was distributed according to orography, drainage and physiographic units. Most protected areas had limited effectiveness for fish conservation, mainly because they were too small or included only fragments of tributaries or drainages, or because they were located only in highland drainages where species diversity was minimal. To adequately protect freshwater fishes in this province the existing protected areas should be modified and expanded. ¬© 2011 Museu de Ci√®ncies Naturals de Barcelona.",,2-s2.0-84856706627,40,0.644460526830668,0,do protect area conserv neotrop freshw fish a cas study of a biogeograph provint in venezuel ¬ølas √°reas protegida conserv los pec contin neotrop un caso de estudio par un provinc biogeogr√°fica en venezuel the effect of protect area to conserv freshw fish is limit becaus thes area ar not us congru with reg pattern of fish specy rich and distribut we comp the rich distribut and abund of coast freshw fish in a biogeograph provint of venezuel to determin their conserv stat we also estim the relev of ex protect area in conserv fish in diff physiograph unit and tribut by evalu specy rich and distribut the ichthyofaun spp endem threatened was distribut accord to orograph drain and physiograph unit most protect area had limit effect for fish conserv main becaus they wer too smal or includ on frag of tribut or drain or becaus they wer loc on in highland drain wher specy divers was minim to adequ protect freshw fish in thi provint the ex protect area should be mod and expand,new,0.6942316956053833,0.6143765839967462,0.5561847465637387,0.5135846735988326,0.48168636143924276,0.45743747077286556,0.4390481559406328,0.42558154275317994,0.4168355091829283,0.41359586236512463,0.4187989266675777

In this study, an increase of the Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) population in the Ecuadorian Andes was documented using census data from three high Andean lakes (Yahuarcocha, San Pablo and Yambo) for 2004-2010. In the 20th Century, only one record of the species existed for the study area. From 2005 onward, the species occurred regularly at all three lakes. At Yahuarcocha, the wintering population (OctoberFebruary) grew at an annual rate of 0.382 ¬± 0.05, reaching 307 in 2010.

308,fish_neotropic,Existing and future challenges: The concept of successful fish passage in South America,"Most of the large rivers of South America are impounded mainly for hydropower production. The construction of fish passes has been one of the strategies adopted by Brazilian authorities and the energy sector to diminish the effects of these barriers on migratory fish communities. Despite the high investments and efforts involved, most facilities have been considered ineffective for conservation purposes. Decades of poor monitoring and the lack of specific studies have limited our knowledge on the real role of fish passes. Efficiency has been frequently defined as the proportion of fish that ascend a fish passage facility, compared to the shoal size that reaches the dam. Inspired by the notion that fishes accumulated below the dam need to migrate upstream, the quantity of fish passed upstream historically indicated successful management, as generally inferred by the fish abundance inside the fish pass. We propose a new concept for estimating fish pass efficiency for South American rivers, based on the capability of the fish pass to maintain viable populations. This broader approach is necessary because knowledge of fish habitats below and above the pass, plus the feasibility of downstream movements of eggs, larvae and adults through the reservoir and past the dam, is needed for assessing whether a fish pass is working as a conservation tool. ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/rra.1557,2-s2.0-84860716859,54,0.6385450264858751,0,ex and fut challeng the conceiv of success fish pass in sou americ most of the larg riv of sou americ ar impound main for hydropow produc the construct of fish pass has been on of the strategies adopt by brazil auth and the energy sect to dimin the effect of thes barry on migr fish commun despit the high invest and effort involv most facil hav been consid ineffect for conserv purpos decad of poor monit and the lack of spec study hav limit our knowledg on the real rol of fish pass efficy has been frequ defin as the proport of fish that ascend a fish pass facil comp to the sho siz that reach the dam inspir by the not that fish accum below the dam nee to migr upstream the quant of fish pass upstream hist ind success man as gen infer by the fish abund insid the fish pass we propos a new conceiv for estim fish pass efficy for sou am riv bas on the cap of the fish pass to maintain viabl pop thi broad approach is necess becaus knowledg of fish habit below and abov the pass plu the feas of downstream mov of eg larva and adult through the reservoir and past the dam is nee for assess wheth a fish pass is work as a conserv tool,new,0.6482196502291636,0.6007440450936938,0.5689710051034677,0.5475283703402763,0.5332653267411162,0.5245304835056966,0.5206099640861273,0.5215290286674917,0.5281965647679636,0.5431125171380662,0.5725717526134007
3111,fish_neotropic,Fish abundance and species richness across an estuarine-freshwater ecosystem in the Neotropics,"We investigated the distributional patterns of shallow-water fish and their environmental correlates along a broad spatial scale encompassing estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. Marine-vagrant species were restricted to the sites under the influence of salinity intrusion, whereas estuarine-related and freshwater guilds were found along the entire estuarine-freshwater gradient. Primary- and secondary-freshwater fish guilds had the most widespread spatial distribution and comprised a major fraction of the total abundance and species richness. Abiotic factors correlated with fish abundance and composition along two main environmental axes, one related with variation in salinity, water transparency, and sediment granulometry and the other with the slope gradient. Species richness was significantly higher at the natural channel linking the estuarine- and freshwater-ecosystem, which probably was due to: (a) a steeper slope that favored the confluence of fish from the littoral (<2 m) and limnetic (>2 m) zones and (b) the sporadic inflow of saltwater that carried into this region several marine-related species. Although estuarine-freshwater ecotones are known to support few species, mainly salinity tolerant, our results suggest that habitat features and seasonal fish movement associated with salinity intrusion could lead to more diverse fish assemblages in this transitional zone. ¬© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10750-012-1187-9,2-s2.0-84865441659,2,0.5075547752266799,0,fish abund and specy rich across an estuarin freshw ecosystem in the neotrop we investig the distribut pattern of shallow wat fish and their environ correl along a broad spat scal encompass estuarin and freshw ecosystem marin vagr specy wer restrict to the sit und the influ of salin intrud wherea estuarin rel and freshw guild wer found along the entir estuarin freshw grady prim and second freshw fish guild had the most widespread spat distribut and compr a maj fract of the tot abund and specy rich abiot fact correl with fish abund and composit along two main environ ax on rel with vary in salin wat transp and sedy granulometry and the oth with the slop grady specy rich was sign high at the nat channel link the estuarin and freshw ecosystem which prob was due to a a steep slop that fav the conflu of fish from the lit m and limnet m zon and b the sporad inflow of saltw that carry into thi reg sev marin rel specy although estuarin freshw ecoton ar known to support few specy main salin tol our result suggest that habit feat and season fish mov assocy with salin intrud could lead to mor divers fish assembl in thi transit zon,new,0.5603674863286574,0.49417690898136196,0.4521222146038637,0.42463401574537823,0.40644243925102597,0.3948547845570142,0.3885933404559211,0.38731150982207263,0.3915835314335063,0.4034893539715293,0.4286991172666725

We examined variations in the abundance and feeding of A. osteomystax in two environments, one natural (Sinh√° Mariana floodplain lake) and one dammed (Manso Reservoir), during two periods: the first year after the filling phase and three years later. Our goal was to evaluate the occupation of the new habitat (Manso Reservoir), by this species, as well as to test the hypothesis that in the reservoir, unlike the natural environment, there are remarkable changes in diet between the periods. Fish were sampled monthly in the floodplain lake and in the reservoir during two annual periods using gillnets. To evaluate the differences in abundance of A. osteomystax we employed the Kruskal -Wallis test, and the diet analysis was carried out using frequency of occurrence and volumetric methods. Temporal differences in the diet were tested by Kruskal-Wallis test using the scores from a detrended correspondence analysis. A. osteomystax was significantly more abundant in the floodplain lake, where the captures were higher than in the reservoir in almost all months analyzed, and significant variations in abundance between the two periods were not recorded in either the reservoir or the floodplain lake. The diet variation between the two periods, which had a time lag of three years between them, was much less pronounced in the natural environment, where the resource availability is essentially regulated by seasonality. Thus, our hypothesis was accepted; that is, the interannual variations in the diet of A. osteomystax are more relevant in an artificial environment than in a natural one.",,2-s2.0-84866630086,14,0.5931328504916811,1,impound effect in the pop of auchenipter osteomystax siluriform auchenipterida a neotrop reservoir cas new impound provid opportun to check wheth specy that pres enough fee flex in nat condit may tak adv of thi situ and without reproduc restrict can occupy the most conspicu habit in a larg reservoir op area and pres high success in the colon of the new environ we examin vary in the abund and fee of a osteomystax in two environ on nat sinh√° marian floodplain lak and on dam manso reservoir dur two period the first year aft the fil phas and three year lat our goal was to evalu the occup of the new habit manso reservoir by thi specy as wel as to test the hypothes that in the reservoir unlik the nat environ ther ar remark chang in diet between the period fish wer sampl month in the floodplain lak and in the reservoir dur two an period us gillnet to evalu the diff in abund of a osteomystax we employ the krusk wal test and the diet analys was carry out us frequ of occur and volumet method temp diff in the diet wer test by krusk wal test us the scor from a detrend correspond analys a osteomystax was sign mor abund in the floodplain lak wher the capt wer high than in the reservoir in almost al month analys and sign vary in abund between the two period wer not record in eith the reservoir or the floodplain lak the diet vary between the two period which had a tim lag of three year between them was much less pronount in the nat environ wher the resourc avail is ess reg by season thu our hypothes was acceiv that is the interan vary in the diet of a osteomystax ar mor relev in an art environ than in a nat on,new,0.626624979863137,0.5766157320885621,0.5444589498177674,0.5237839453657364,0.5109076307188682,0.5039603100659948,0.5021678610577311,0.5055893973922865,0.5152517042251654,0.5339094260246883,0.5683890498610954

The genus Atlantirivulus includes 11 species distributed along coastal river basins and lagoons of eastern and southern Brazil. Most killifishes are threatened with extinction mostly due to their restricted distribution ranges, small population sizes, and habitat loss. Poor knowledge on ecological- and life history information further increases the threats. Atlantirivulus riograndensis (Costa et Lan√©s, 2009) is a non-annual, small-sized fish endemic in the Laguna dos Patos basin and adjacent coastal areas in southern Brazil. There is no information on the life history and ecology of the species. In this paper, we analyzed population traits of A. riograndensis to support conservation efforts. Materials and methods. The fish were captured with a D-shaped hand net in six sampling surveys carried out between 2008 (June, August, and October) and 2009 (March, August, and October) in the type locality of A. riograndensis. The variation of abundance, body size, and condition factor over time, sex ratio, and length-weight relations were analyzed. Results. The estimated abundance was 1.97 specimens per 1 m 2. The TL means increased along the year, and males were larger than females. Strong differences in proportions of sexes were detected, with high bias for females. The species showed allometric positive growth (b = 3.3), and the general condition factor (CF) was 0.258 ¬± 0.003. Conclusion. Atlantirivulus riograndensis inhabits small water bodies and apparently has a small population size. The population is female biased, and males are typically bigger than females. The species has an allometric positive growth. The body size variation is related to individual growth throughout each study year, and probably affected by high mortality of large individuals in dry season. This study presents new original data on basic traits of the natural history of A. riograndensis. The observed results may be used to assist the development of management strategies and conservation of the species and its habitat, mainly in a region where 90% of wetland systems were lost by agriculture, and the remaining areas are at high risk due to the expansion of exotic pine plantations.",10.3750/AIP2011.42.3.09,2-s2.0-84867607217,16,0.778692839507215,1,abund sex ratio leng weight rel and condit fact of non an kil atlantirivul riograndens actinopterygi cyprinodontiform rivulida in lago do peix nat park a rams sit of southern brazil background the gen atlantirivul includ specy distribut along coast riv basin and lagoon of eastern and southern brazil most kil ar threatened with extinct most due to their restrict distribut rang smal pop siz and habit loss poor knowledg on ecolog and lif hist inform furth increas the threats atlantirivul riograndens cost et lan√©s is a non an smal siz fish endem in the lagun dos pato basin and adjac coast area in southern brazil ther is no inform on the lif hist and ecolog of the specy in thi pap we analys pop trait of a riograndens to support conserv effort mat and method the fish wer capt with a d shap hand net in six sampl survey carry out between jun august and octob and march august and octob in the typ loc of a riograndens the vary of abund body siz and condit fact ov tim sex ratio and leng weight rel wer analys result the estim abund was specim per m the tl mean increas along the year and mal wer larg than fem strong diff in proport of sex wer detect with high bia for fem the specy show allomet posit grow b and the gen condit fact cf was ¬± conclud atlantirivul riograndens inhabit smal wat body and app has a smal pop siz the pop is fem bias and mal ar typ big than fem the specy has an allomet posit grow the body siz vary is rel to individ grow throughout each study year and prob affect by high mort of larg individ in dry season thi study pres new origin dat on bas trait of the nat hist of a riograndens the observ result may be us to assist the develop of man strategies and conserv of the specy and it habit main in a reg wher of wetland system wer lost by agricult and the remain area ar at high risk due to the expand of exot pin plant,new,0.8043370119378853,0.7519541789453176,0.7110630570236015,0.6789754575054274,0.6532580902905847,0.6322705473252785,0.6149586184137722,0.6006761040554277,0.5890971597253352,0.58025174193627,0.5749045791571574

Food availability depends on different factors such as discharge, channel morphology, physicochemical conditions and interactions with other species, as well as their food habits. On the other side, good food availability results in reproductive success. Because the study of those changes contributes to a better understanding of trophic interactions in fish populations, the present work describes and evaluates aspects of diet and reproduction of Farlowella vittata in Pringamosal Creek, G√ºejar River drainage, Orinoco River basin, Colombia. Five collecting expeditions were done during both high and low rain seasons of 2008 and 2009. Physical and chemical water parameters were measured, and fish were captured from several points along the total length of the 7km stream, to characterize their biometry and stomach contents. Our results showed that Pringamosal creek is a first order stream, about 3.5m wide and with an average depth of 1m in our study area. Dissolved oxygen values were 6.2mg/L during low water and 2.7mg/L during high water phase. The creek is classified as oligotrophic but with a tendency to eutrophication. A total of 130 fish samples were analyzed. Fishes were assigned to seven size range categories between 86.0 and 175.5mm standard length (SL). Stomach contents revealed that the diet of this species consisted mainly of algae (Bacillariophyceae) (84.6% Abundance Relative), but we observed a variation in the diet according to season; during low rainfall it feeds on phytoplankton (86.47% A.R.) and during high rainfall on zooplankton as well as plant material and organic material (0.685% A.R. and 18.83% A.R., respectively). A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA showed statistically significant differences in food items between sexes. The condition factor (K) indicated that the species was well fed. Size at sexual maturity was 154mm SL for males and 124mm SL for females.

At La Selva Biological Station in the Sarapiqu√≠ region of Costa Rica, shrimp population data were collected between 1988 and 1989, before massive land-use change occurred downstream that could potentially affect shrimp recruitment upstream. Using generalized linear models and a Bayesian inference framework, the relative abundance of Macrobrachium olfersi between recent (2008-2011) and historical time periods (1988-1989) was compared in three stream reaches. Shrimp relative abundance in two stream reaches within the protected area of La Selva was relatively constant yearly and between recent post-disturbance (2008-2011) and historical pre-disturbance (1988-89) time periods. In contrast, a stream reach bordered by pasture accessible to fishermen, showed an 87% decrease in relative abundance between recent and historical time periods suggesting site-level disturbance, possibly from fishing. The lack of change between historical and contemporary sampling periods within interior-forest stream reaches suggests that shrimp populations in protected forested reaches are resistant or resilient to certain land-use changes occurring downstream. ¬© 2012 Cambridge University Press.",10.1017/S0266467412000739,2-s2.0-84873929670,6,0.64761510881297,0,landscap scal disturb and protect area long term dynam of pop of the shrimp macrobrach olfers in lowland neotrop streams cost ric freshw migr shrimps an import compon of trop aqu ecosystem ar vuln to land us chang dur their upstream and downstream migr at la selv biolog stat in the sarapiqu√≠ reg of cost ric shrimp pop dat wer collect between and bef mass land us chang occur downstream that could pot affect shrimp recruit upstream us gen linear model and a bayes inf framework the rel abund of macrobrach olfers between rec and hist tim period was comp in three stream reach shrimp rel abund in two stream reach within the protect are of la selv was rel const year and between rec post disturb and hist pre disturb tim period in contrast a stream reach bord by past access to fisherm show an decreas in rel abund between rec and hist tim period suggest sit level disturb poss from fish the lack of chang between hist and contemp sampl period within intery forest stream reach suggest that shrimp pop in protect forest reach ar resist or resy to certain land us chang occur downstream,new,0.6866554917715252,0.6515927680901332,0.6294396616655725,0.6152849629680511,0.6065935353658306,0.6021371094721897,0.6014294172052633,0.604541857002745,0.6121911896203746,0.6262284555688498,0.6511054700038921
405,fish_neotropic,"Interference of cage fish farm on diet, condition factor and numeric abundance on wild fish in a Neotropical reservoir","Historically, the ichthyofauna of large Brazilian rivers has been subject to anthropogenic interference, such as impoundments. Currently, cage fish farming systems are a new source of impact on aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to characterise the impact of freshwater fish farms on the feeding of five species of Neotropical freshwater fish. Specimens of Astyanax altiparanae, Galeocharax knerii, Iheringicthys labrosus, Pimelodus maculatus and Plagioscion squamosissimus were sampled in areas around two systems of cage fish farming (CF), and two control areas (CT) that were not influenced by this activity. Results show that there were significant changes in the diet of trophic generalist species (A. altiparanae, P. maculatus and I. labrosus) accompanied by a related increase in the condition factor values of these species in cage areas. Trophic specialist species, such as the carnivorous fish species G. knerii and P. squamosissimus, presented small differences between the CF and CT areas with regard to diet and showed no differences in other analyses performed. In conclusion, cage fish farms can affect the natural diet of trophic generalist fish species, directly affecting the nutritional status (condition factor), where food wastes was found to be one of the principal items consumed by this trophic guild. Results indicate that these species are responsible for recycling a great quantity of organic matter transferred by this type of activity, which, along with local fishery activities, contribute to mitigation of associated processes of eutrophication. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.013,2-s2.0-84882523090,9,0.49516724656984595,0,interf of cag fish farm on diet condit fact and num abund on wild fish in a neotrop reservoir hist the ichthyofaun of larg brazil riv has been subject to anthropog interf such as impound cur cag fish farm system ar a new sourc of impact on aqu ecosystem the object of thi study was to charact the impact of freshw fish farm on the fee of fiv specy of neotrop freshw fish specim of astyanax altiparana galeocharax kneri iheringicthy labros pimelod maculat and plagiosc squamosissim wer sampl in area around two system of cag fish farm cf and two control area ct that wer not influ by thi act result show that ther wer sign chang in the diet of troph gen specy a altiparana p maculat and i labros accompany by a rel increas in the condit fact valu of thes specy in cag area troph spec specy such as the carn fish specy g kneri and p squamosissim pres smal diff between the cf and ct area with regard to diet and show no diff in oth analys perform in conclud cag fish farm can affect the nat diet of troph gen fish specy direct affect the nutrit stat condit fact wher food wast was found to be on of the princip item consum by thi troph guild result ind that thes specy ar respons for recyc a gre quant of org mat transfer by thi typ of act which along with loc fishery act contribut to mitig of assocy process of eutroph,new,0.5137884453344826,0.4738777879167013,0.4509421055602574,0.4383972872436021,0.4329254346420908,0.4330711935365091,0.43849080797170575,0.44976578468522826,0.46871655652059924,0.49956537167766274,0.5522293930562029

In this study we examined the differences in the attributes of the fish community in four stretches of an urban stream, two inside and two outside the CU, without vegetation cover, and tested the hypothesis that the presence of riparian vegetation is positively reflected in the attributes of fish fauna. Five species were caught, distributed into four orders and five families. Attributes like richness, abundance, dominance, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and evenness were estimated and significant differences were detected for continuous stretches considering stream flow direction. The first stretches (URBI and UCI) presented a lower diversity that increased gradually until the last stretch, and an inverse result was found for dominance. These changes occurred regardless the location of the stretch, in- or outside the CU. The importance of Conservation Units within urban areas is severely affected by the lack of continuity of forested areas, especially riparian vegetation.

424,fish_neotropic,The metabolic theory of ecology convincingly explains the latitudinal diversity gradient of Neotropical freshwater fish,"In the context of diversity gradients, the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) posits that the logarithm of species richness should decrease linearly with the inverse of temperature, resulting in a specific slope. However, the empirical validity of this model depends on whether the data do not violate certain assumptions. Here, we test the predictions of MTE evaluating all of its assumptions simultaneously. We used Neotropical freshwater fish and tested whether the logarithm of species richness varied negatively and linearly with temperature, resulting in the slope value specified by the MTE. As we observed that the assumption of the energetic equivalence of populations was not achieved, we also analyzed whether the energetic nonequivalence of populations could be responsible for the possible lack of fit to the MTE predictions. Our results showed that the relationship between richness and the inverse of temperature was linear, negative and significant and included the slope value predicted by the MTE. With respect to the assumptions, we observed that there was no spatial variation in the average energy flux of populations or in the body size and abundance of species. However, the energetic equivalence of populations was not achieved and the violation of this assumption did not affect the predictive power of the model. We conclude that the validity of the assumptions (spatial invariance in the average flux energy of populations and spatial invariance in the body size and abundance, especially) is required for the correct interpretation of richness patterns. Furthermore, we conclude that MTE is robust in its explanation of diversity gradients for freshwater fish, proving to be a valuable tool in describing ecological complexity from individuals to ecosystems. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/13-0483.1,2-s2.0-84897985274,13,0.3971062975757179,0,the metabol the of ecolog convint explain the latitudin divers grady of neotrop freshw fish in the context of divers grady the metabol the of ecolog mte posit that the logarithm of specy rich should decreas linear with the invers of temp result in a spec slop howev the empir valid of thi model depend on wheth the dat do not viol certain assum her we test the predict of mte evalu al of it assum simult we us neotrop freshw fish and test wheth the logarithm of specy rich vary neg and linear with temp result in the slop valu spec by the mte as we observ that the assum of the energet equ of pop was not achiev we also analys wheth the energet nonequ of pop could be respons for the poss lack of fit to the mte predict our result show that the rel between rich and the invers of temp was linear neg and sign and includ the slop valu predict by the mte with respect to the assum we observ that ther was no spat vary in the av energy flux of pop or in the body siz and abund of specy howev the energet equ of pop was not achiev and the viol of thi assum did not affect the predict pow of the model we conclud that the valid of the assum spat inv in the av flux energy of pop and spat inv in the body siz and abund espec is requir for the correct interpret of rich pattern furtherm we conclud that mte is robust in it expl of divers grady for freshw fish prov to be a valu tool in describ ecolog complex from individ to ecosystem,new,0.40431503655434514,0.37034746690254994,0.3528174765958728,0.3449964479890217,0.34381002142513256,0.3480728248826768,0.3577211245383861,0.37369395679753714,0.39837027164990874,0.4370537569738352,0.5021545501521468
434,fish_neotropic,The effect of white-tailed deer density on breeding songbirds in Delaware,"Most population goals for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are based solely on deer data, with little consideration for other parts of the ecosystem. A wider ecological approach is needed for more justifiable target deer densities. We investigated the use of birds as coarse-scale indicators to determine an ecological carrying capacity for deer management by studying the relationship between the forest bird community and deer density in Delaware, USA. Using Breeding Bird Survey data from 2005 to 2009, targeted point-count data from 2008 to 2009 and Division of Fish and Wildlife deer-density data from the same time periods, we compared avian species richness and relative abundance with deer density. We divided deer densities into low (‚â§10 deer/km 2), moderate (11-19 deer/km2), and high (‚â•20 deer/km2) categories. We placed birds into 6 deer-sensitive guilds: interior forest obligates, ground nesters, shrub nesters, ground gleaners, low-canopy foragers, and Neotropical migrants, as well as 1 ""guild"" that consisted of species found to be sensitive to deer density in past literature. The abundance or richness of most guilds and species did not differ by deer density. However, there were 1.08 more shrub nesters and 0.55 more species of shrub nesting birds in low-deer-density areas than in high-deer-density areas. Areas of moderate and low deer densities had ‚â•0.35 more species of low-canopy foragers than did areas of high deer densities. Low-deer-density areas had ‚â•0.59 more individual Neotropical migrants compared with moderate- or high-deer-density areas. Similarly, areas of low deer densities had ‚â•0.49 more migrant species than did areas of higher densities. Low-deerdensity areas had ‚â•0.17 more ovenbirds compared with high- and moderate-deer-density areas. Great crested flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) had 3 times greater odds of being found in low-deer-density areas than in high-deer-density areas. Chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), and red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus) all had 2 times greater odds of being found in low-deer-density areas than high-deer-density areas. Our results suggest that areas inDelaware with densities of &lt;20 deer/km2 have the greatest avian richness and abundance.

Data were collected quarterly at eight sampling locations on the reservoir between February 2010 and November 2011 using gillnets from 12-to 70-mm mesh that were left in the water for 12h00min during the night. We evaluated the composition, structure and assemblage descriptors (Shannon-Wiener diversity index and equitability, respectively) and catch per unit effort by the number (CPUEn) and biomass (CPUEb) of the ichthyofauna. The 6,047 individuals (399,211.6 g) captured represented three orders, ten families and 20 species, of which four belonged to introduced species. The family Characidae was the most abundant with a total of 2,772 (45.8%) individuals captured. The species-abundance curve fit the log-normal model. In the spatial analysis of diversity, there were significant differences between sampling sites in the lacustrine and fluvial regions, and the highest values were found in the lacustrine region. In the temporal analysis of diversity, significant differences were also observed between the rainy and dry seasons, and the higher values were found during the dry season. Equitability followed the same spatiotemporal pattern as diversity. The Spearman correlation was significantly negative between diversity and rainfall. A cluster analysis spatially separated the ichthyofauna into two groups: one group formed by sampling sites in the fluvial region and another group formed by the remainder of the points in the lacustrine region. Both the CPUEn and CPUEb values were higher at point 8 (fluvial region) and during the rainy season. A two-way ANOVA showed that the CPUEn and CPUEb values were spatially and temporally significant.

50,fish_neotropic,Alternative ways to measure impacts of dam closure to the structure of fish communities of a neotropical river,"Neotropical freshwaters host some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world and are among the most threatened by habitat alterations. The high number of species and lack of basic ecological knowledge provide a major obstacle to understanding the effects of environmental change. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the fish communities of a neotropical river by applying simple descriptions of community organizations: species abundance distribution and abundance biomass comparison curves. Fish data were collected using gillnets during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. A total of 69 343 individuals representing 260 species were recorded. Dam closure was associated with changes in the organization of fish communities at all sites. Species richness tended to increase immediately after dam closure while evenness decreased. Changes in taxonomic structure (richness and evenness) were accompanied by a change in the distribution of biomass with the proportionate contribution by smaller individuals significantly increased relative to larger individuals. Five years on, richness had fallen to below pre-closure levels at all sites, while the comparative stability of assemblages in the transformed habitats was reflected by biomass-abundance distribution patterns that approximated pre-disturbance ratios.

514,fish_neotropic,The rise and fall of fish diversity in a neotropical river after impoundment,"In contrast to the fast-paced dam construction and river ecosystem alteration which is taking place in the neotropics, ecological knowledge about the effects on fish fauna are still scarce. To contribute with knowledge on the effects of damming on fish fauna, we assessed the response of fish assemblages to the construction of a run-of-the-river dam in an Amazonian river by selecting eight sampling sites along a longitudinal gradient in the vicinity of a new hydroelectric dam. Sites were sampled monthly through a 1-year period before dam closure (2004‚Äì2005), 1¬†year after closure (2006‚Äì2007), and 5¬†years after closure (2011‚Äì2012). Following dam closure, there was an initial overall increase in fish abundance and richness across sites. However, despite the initial upsurge, after 5¬†years, populations were reduced and communities contracted to a level of diversity below that observed prior to dam closure. Respective sites demonstrated distinct ecological responses that were related to the environmental characteristics of their transformed habitats. Important changes in fish assemblages were visible in a short-term period of 5¬†years after dam closure. Therefore, monitoring fish species assemblages in a longer term is important to assess the consequences of a decrease in diversity. ¬© 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",10.1007/s10750-015-2377-z,2-s2.0-84948576152,31,0.6776331474213989,1,the ris and fal of fish divers in a neotrop riv aft impound in contrast to the fast pac dam construct and riv ecosystem alt which is tak plac in the neotrop ecolog knowledg about the effect on fish faun ar stil scarc to contribut with knowledg on the effect of dam on fish faun we assess the respons of fish assembl to the construct of a run of the riv dam in an amazon riv by select eight sampl sit along a longitudin grady in the vicin of a new hydroelect dam sit wer sampl month through a year period bef dam clos ‚äì ¬†year aft clos ‚äì and ¬†years aft clos ‚äì follow dam clos ther was an init overal increas in fish abund and rich across sit howev despit the init upsurg aft ¬†years pop wer reduc and commun contract to a level of divers below that observ pri to dam clos respect sit demonst distinct ecolog respons that wer rel to the environ charact of their transform habit import chang in fish assembl wer vis in a short term period of ¬†years aft dam clos theref monit fish specy assembl in a long term is import to assess the consequ of a decreas in divers,new,0.7204835423498513,0.6871625274298009,0.6646327213921575,0.6490795104111876,0.6384063718242874,0.6315390583979116,0.6280207849490527,0.6278751013270056,0.6317037528077333,0.6411504073904285,0.6603357205675254
522,fish_neotropic,"Persistence and instability typify the fish assemblage structure of Rio Ubatiba, a Neotropical stream of South-east Brazil","The objective was to explore levels of persistence and stability of a Neotropical fish assemblage in a typical Serra do Mar stream (Southeast Brazil) over 1994‚Äì2008 with 90 quantitative samples in total. All along the stream gradient, the fish assemblage was composed of small-sized, short living species including benthic and water column species. Only four species occurred at the uppermost site (i.e., S1) whereas these four species plus eight species occurred at all other sites. In regards to species presence-absence, all species were temporally persistent at all sites over the study years. Overall, all species were abundant across scales of space and time with only three out of 14 species showing consistently low densities along the stream across years. Nevertheless, as indicated by the temporal variations in the Coefficients of Variation (CV%), the fish assemblages were highly unstable at all sites over time. At all sites the CV% varied widely and increased significantly over the years. No consistent density-dependence was elucidated nor any significant correlation among environmental variables and assemblage attributes were detected. The only consistent relationship elucidated relates the CV% of assemblage variability over time and the CV% of the ratio between stream discharge in the two major seasons, May and November. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10641-015-0450-0,2-s2.0-84949624933,11,0.6623046736395439,1,persist and inst typ the fish assembl structure of rio ubatib a neotrop stream of sou east brazil the object was to expl level of persist and stabl of a neotrop fish assembl in a typ serr do mar stream southeast brazil ov ‚äì with quantit sampl in tot al along the stream grady the fish assembl was compos of smal siz short liv specy includ benth and wat column specy on four specy occur at the uppermost sit i e s wherea thes four specy plu eight specy occur at al oth sit in regard to specy pres abs al specy wer temp persist at al sit ov the study year overal al specy wer abund across scal of spac and tim with on three out of specy show consist low dens along the stream across year nevertheless as ind by the temp vary in the coefficy of vary cv the fish assembl wer high unst at al sit ov tim at al sit the cv vary wid and increas sign ov the year no consist dens depend was elucid nor any sign correl among environ vary and assembl attribut wer detect the on consist rel elucid rel the cv of assembl vary ov tim and the cv of the ratio between stream discharg in the two maj season may and novemb,new,0.7180209983126646,0.6570340762216752,0.6141522744424114,0.5833664911309981,0.5606892509863592,0.5438388633850697,0.5315642709644499,0.5232875788892909,0.519021960357868,0.5196015481420215,0.5276306879943361
551,fish_neotropic,Variation in Abundance and Efficacy of Tadpole Predators in a Neotropical Pond Community,"Variation in predation risk plays an important role in shaping prey behavior, morphology, life history, population dynamics, and community structure in freshwater systems. Anuran larvae are important prey in freshwater communities and spatiotemporal variation in risk can arise from changes in the number and identity of predators; however, our understanding of variation in abundance, identity, and foraging rates for natural predator assemblages in tropical pond communities is limited. We surveyed ponds near Gamboa, Panama in 2004 and 2010 to estimate variation in predator communities of tadpoles over space and time.We also conducted short-term predation trials with the 10 most common predators using hatchling tadpoles of two widespread Neotropical frog species, Red-Eyed Treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and Pantless Treefrogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Predator abundance varied nearly threefold across ponds within a single year and as much as 19-fold within a pond across years. Dominant taxa also varied, with backswimmers (Notonectidae), poeciliid fish, or libellulid dragonfly naiads being the most common depending upon pond and year. Predation trials revealed that prey-specific predation rates differed among predator taxa. Some presumed predators did not consume hatchlings, whereas others consumed >90% of prey. The smaller D. ebraccatus hatchlings generally experienced higher predation rates; however, large invertebrate predators like aeshnid dragonfly naiads, giant water bugs, and fishing spiders consumed more A. callidryas. These results suggest that strong but variable larval-stage risk may be an important selective factor shaping tadpole communities and phenotypes in Neotropical ponds. ¬© 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.",10.1670/14-111,2-s2.0-84959866101,15,0.540339601953569,1,vary in abund and eff of tadpol pred in a neotrop pond commun vary in pred risk play an import rol in shap prey behavy morpholog lif hist pop dynam and commun structure in freshw system an larva ar import prey in freshw commun and spatiotemp vary in risk can ar from chang in the numb and id of pred howev our understand of vary in abund id and for rat for nat pred assembl in trop pond commun is limit we survey pond near gambo panam in and to estim vary in pred commun of tadpol ov spac and tim we also conduc short term pred tri with the most common pred us hatchl tadpol of two widespread neotrop frog specy red ey treefrog agalychn callidrya and pantless treefrog dendropsoph ebraccat pred abund vary near threefold across pond within a singl year and as much as fold within a pond across year domin tax also vary with backswim notonectida poeciliid fish or libellulid dragonf naiad being the most common depend upon pond and year pred tri rev that prey spec pred rat diff among pred tax som presum pred did not consum hatchl wherea oth consum of prey the smal d ebraccat hatchl gen expery high pred rat howev larg invertebr pred lik aeshnid dragonf naiad giant wat bug and fish spid consum mor a callidrya thes result suggest that strong but vary larv stag risk may be an import select fact shap tadpol commun and phenotyp in neotrop pond,new,0.5876389070366665,0.5179172996974456,0.47129868206232395,0.43918320048129067,0.4165207934475965,0.4005887593185823,0.38998284083614004,0.3841714228869377,0.3834542187798423,0.3894379055495549,0.406845759199412
561,fish_neotropic,Fish population dynamic in the newly impounded Nam Theun 2 Reservoir (Lao PDR),"A fish population monitoring was carried out in the reservoir and tributaries of the hydropower project Nam Theun 2 (Lao PDR) at the end of the warm and dry seasons and at the end of the warm and wet seasons between 2008 and 2013. The study focused on three aquatic systems (river upstream, transition area, and reservoir) and different drowned habitats (dense/light forests and agricultural soils) associated or not with the presence of villages. The reservoir fish population was expected to follow three distinct phases, which should be respectively a rapid increase in biomass and abundance (trophic upsurge) followed by a decline and a stabilization of the population. This succession appeared to be different to the commonly observed scenario in terms of biomass, abundance and taxonomic richness compared to other temperate and tropical reservoirs. The indicator species (H. macrolepidota and P. carinatus) did not show changes in their size range since impoundment. The presence of structured habitats (e.g. inundated forest) favoured the fish population in terms of biomass and abundance. The fish population in the transition area and the river upstream improved quickly after the impoundment and presented higher taxonomic richness compared to the reservoir. Finally, the transition area appeared to be the most productive area within the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir especially if it remained outside of fishing activities. ¬© EDF, 2015.",10.1051/hydro/2015004,2-s2.0-84962459593,29,0.7392582053461372,1,fish pop dynam in the new impound nam theun reservoir lao pdr a fish pop monit was carry out in the reservoir and tribut of the hydropow project nam theun lao pdr at the end of the warm and dry season and at the end of the warm and wet season between and the study focus on three aqu system riv upstream transit are and reservoir and diff drown habit dens light forest and agricult soil assocy or not with the pres of vil the reservoir fish pop was expect to follow three distinct phas which should be respect a rapid increas in biomass and abund troph upsurg follow by a declin and a stabl of the pop thi success appear to be diff to the common observ scenario in term of biomass abund and taxonom rich comp to oth temp and trop reservoir the ind specy h macrolepidot and p carinat did not show chang in their siz rang sint impound the pres of structured habit e g inund forest favo the fish pop in term of biomass and abund the fish pop in the transit are and the riv upstream improv quick aft the impound and pres high taxonom rich comp to the reservoir fin the transit are appear to be the most produc are within the nam theun reservoir espec if it remain outsid of fish act,new,0.7641115507500221,0.7357215655930588,0.716967700960955,0.7044356893616743,0.6962011522902115,0.6912718965131588,0.6892085832538405,0.6899825189038289,0.6940225792516236,0.7025338470195552,0.7185081636823862

Data on the structure of the small fish fauna assemblage were obtained before and after the introduction of this carnivorous species. Samplings were carried out in February and September of 2004, previously to the register of Cichla kelberi in the reservoir, and after its introduction, November of 2004, January, March, May and August of 2005, February and June of 2006, February and July of 2007, February and October of 2008 and February of 2009. A total of 4,693 fish, belonging to 43 different species was sampled between 2004 and 2009. The order Characiformes was the most abundant, followed by Perciformes and Siluriformes. Comparative analyses, before and after the introduction, could not demonstrate significant changes in composition, richness, abundance, biomass, mean length and diversity of fish. Aquatic insects were the main feeding item of C. kelberi, followed by tetragonopterinae fish. Cannibalism was recorded during the whole study period. The results showed that Cichla cannot deeply affect the ichthyofauna assemblages of a large Neotropical reservoir, at least in a short or medium term period after its introduction. The results also allowed concluding that the introduction of C. kelberi in the reservoir is in the phase 3. In this phase, the specie can survive and reproduce in the new environment; however it is not totally established and disseminated. The reasons for the fact that Cichla is still not dominant in Rosana Reservoir could be related to feeding competition, high rate of cannibalism and the presence of large amount of aquatic macrophytes (refuge zones). In spite of the results, the continuous monitoring of the role of non-native species on the local fish fauna is absolutely necessary because the impacts caused by colonization of this undesirable species can be magnified by complex processes, usually correlated with other environmental disturb, especially the negative effects of damming.",10.1590/1519-6984.05814,2-s2.0-84982833711,44,0.596728913425858,1,impact assess of the introduc of cichl kelber in a larg neotrop reservoir and it lat lagoon up paran√° riv basin brazil thi study aim to understand how the introduc of cichl kelber in rosan reservoir paranapanem riv affect the nat ichthyofaun dat on the structure of the smal fish faun assembl wer obtain bef and aft the introduc of thi carn specy sampl wer carry out in febru and septemb of prevy to the reg of cichl kelber in the reservoir and aft it introduc novemb of janu march may and august of febru and jun of febru and july of febru and octob of and febru of a tot of fish belong to diff specy was sampl between and the ord characiform was the most abund follow by perciform and siluriform comp analys bef and aft the introduc could not demonst sign chang in composit rich abund biomass mean leng and divers of fish aqu insect wer the main fee item of c kelber follow by tetragonopterina fish cannib was record dur the whol study period the result show that cichl cannot deeply affect the ichthyofaun assembl of a larg neotrop reservoir at least in a short or med term period aft it introduc the result also allow conclud that the introduc of c kelber in the reservoir is in the phas in thi phas the specy can surv and reproduc in the new environ howev it is not tot est and dissemin the reason for the fact that cichl is stil not domin in rosan reservoir could be rel to fee competit high rat of cannib and the pres of larg amount of aqu macrophyt refug zon in spit of the result the continu monit of the rol of non nat specy on the loc fish faun is absolv necess becaus the impact caus by colon of thi undesir specy can be magn by complex process us correl with oth environ disturb espec the neg effect of dam,new,0.6310614079483078,0.5942113026272152,0.5711507726784817,0.5568708358037551,0.5486996354644295,0.5453516052927958,0.5463836462078834,0.5520314899445444,0.563382929598475,0.5830961913541687,0.6175037206250712
592,fish_neotropic,"Seasonal dynamics in community structure, abundance, body size and sex ratio in two species of Neotropical annual fishes","Seven ephemeral pools on the coastal plain of southern Brazil were found to be inhabited by three annual and 22 non-annual fish species. Two common annual species (Austrolebias minuano and Cynopoecilus fulgens) exhibited clear seasonal dynamics, with the appearance of young fishes in the austral autumn (May to June) and a decline in abundance over the seasonal cycle. The third annual species, Austrolebias wolterstorffii, was rare. No seasonal dynamics were observed in non-annual fishes. The relative abundance of non-annual fishes compared with annual fishes increased over the seasonal cycle, but they coexisted widely. The size structure of annual fishes suggested the presence of a single age cohort in most pools though a second age cohort was registered in one pool in August, coinciding with a large flooding. Strong sexual dimorphism in body size was found in C. fulgens throughout the seasonal cycle, while no sexual dimorphism in body size was found in A. minuano. Female-biased sex ratios were recorded in both common annual fish species in the last three sampling dates (in spring), but not during the first two sampling dates (in winter). The natural lifespan of annual fishes was <8 months. Annual fishes disappeared before habitat desiccation in half of the pools, while non-annual fishes were still present. ¬© 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles",10.1111/jfb.13122,2-s2.0-84987800304,8,0.7394026521475642,0,season dynam in commun structure abund body siz and sex ratio in two specy of neotrop an fish sev ephem pool on the coast plain of southern brazil wer found to be inhabit by three an and non an fish specy two common an specy austrolebia minuano and cynopoecil fulg exhibit clear season dynam with the appear of young fish in the aust autumn may to jun and a declin in abund ov the season cyc the third an specy austrolebia wolterstorffi was rar no season dynam wer observ in non an fish the rel abund of non an fish comp with an fish increas ov the season cyc but they coex wid the siz structure of an fish suggest the pres of a singl ag cohort in most pool though a second ag cohort was reg in on pool in august coincid with a larg flood strong sex dimorph in body siz was found in c fulg throughout the season cyc whil no sex dimorph in body siz was found in a minuano fem bias sex ratio wer record in both common an fish specy in the last three sampl dat in spring but not dur the first two sampl dat in wint the nat lifesp of an fish was month an fish disappear bef habit desicc in half of the pool whil non an fish wer stil pres,new,0.7670041119427364,0.7180678181087586,0.6820188836866294,0.6550869375127781,0.6345993329652734,0.6189565370709185,0.6072676766866139,0.5991577946693442,0.5947635301091341,0.5949983001271492,0.6025185460641813

The fishes were sampled quarterly-between August/2014 and July/2016-in the marginal ponds located in the Estrada Parque (MS 184). The feeding habits of T. nematurus was characterized as omnivorous and its opportunistic feeding behaviour, since its diet is composed of different resources along of the year. Insects and organic matter were the most important items during the drought period, plant material (leaves and roots) and Euglenophyceae algae were more expressive during the inundation period, insects and fruits were also abundant during the flood period. Through statistical analysis, it was possible to verify significant variation in the diet composition of the species. This variation in the components of the diet may be related to the availability of resources in the ponds throughout the year and reflect an already known pattern in Neotropical fish populations, which present high alimentary plasticity. ¬© 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

It is known that the Kelp Gull (Larus Dominicanus) is used to forage discards, and that in the area sampled these discards are abundant in trawling mode, with a large volume of demersal fish. The food habit of L. Dominicanus was analyzed in the State of Paran√°, Brazil. The food items of the pellets were identified in order to demonstrate the importance of demersal fish in the diet of this species. The pellets were sampled between August 2011 and July 2012 on the seaside of Barrancos. Based on the identification of the otoliths found in the pellets, length and mass of fishes were recalculated. In the 120 pellets collected, 228 fishes from 14 species and 3 families were identified, with emphasis on the Sciaenidae family with 11 species. Cathorops spixii, Larimus breviceps, Paralonchurus brasiliensis, and Stellifer rastrifer were most frequent. In the seasonal analyses, L. breviceps, Micropogonias furnieri, P. brasiliensis, and S. rastrifer were found in the diet of L. Dominicanus in all seasons. The canonical analysis showed significant seasonal differences in abundance, mass, and length of the teleosts identified in the diet of L. Dominicanus.

642,fish_neotropic,Water turbidity increases biotic resistance of native Neotropical piscivores to alien fish,"Large tropical rivers are increasingly affected by dam construction, which generally implies alteration of flow regimes, increased water transparency, decline of native species and proliferation of invasive alien species. The potential of native Neotropical piscivores to provide biotic resistance to alien fish invaders and its interaction with water turbidity was investigated through mesocosm experiments. Three invasive and two native fish species were offered as prey to three native piscivores of the Paran√° river in 1000 L tanks. After 48¬†h, prey survival was compared among trials with and without the piscivores and in turbid (~ more preserved systems) versus clear water (~ disturbed systems by damming) treatments. Prey survival, particularly of the invasive species, was significantly lower in turbid water in the presence of predators (~ 45.9% versus ~ 53.7% in clear water). Piscivores preyed more on smaller individuals in clear water and on larger preys in turbid water. Although vulnerability to predation was prey-specific, our results support the potential of native piscivores to provide biotic resistance against alien freshwater species. Water turbidity mediated the predator‚Äìprey interactions and our results confirm the hypothesis that decreased turbidity caused by dams‚Äô construction can affect predation efficiency of native piscivores and increase the abundance of alien fish. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10750-018-3548-5,2-s2.0-85047209599,17,0.496983021292914,0,wat turbid increas biot resist of nat neotrop pisc to aly fish larg trop riv ar increas affect by dam construct which gen imply alt of flow regim increas wat transp declin of nat specy and prol of invas aly specy the pot of nat neotrop pisc to provid biot resist to aly fish invad and it interact with wat turbid was investig through mesocosm expery three invas and two nat fish specy wer off as prey to three nat pisc of the paran√° riv in l tank aft ¬†h prey surv was comp among tri with and without the pisc and in turbid mor preserv system vers clear wat disturb system by dam tre prey surv particul of the invas specy was sign low in turbid wat in the pres of pred vers in clear wat pisc prey mor on smal individ in clear wat and on larg prey in turbid wat although vuln to pred was prey spec our result support the pot of nat pisc to provid biot resist against aly freshw specy wat turbid medy the predator‚äìprey interact and our result confirm the hypothes that decreas turbid caus by dams‚äô construct can affect pred efficy of nat pisc and increas the abund of aly fish,new,0.5045612779954938,0.47814894357166393,0.4643487793172939,0.45854542082423094,0.45848827068963477,0.46330685438612623,0.4730121093017319,0.4884311964497462,0.5115774015642658,0.546810758517231,0.603895350339801
653,fish_neotropic,Is spatial variation in population size structures of a stream-dwelling caddisfly due to the altered effects of a predator by a third-party species?,"Predators alter abundances and life history characteristics of prey, and effects of predator‚Äìprey interactions can be altered by third-party species. Here, we examine size structures of the caddisfly, Phylloicus hansoni, in Trinidadian streams with two distinct fish assemblages: upstream reaches where the predatory killifish, Anablepsoides hartii, is the only fish species (Killifish-Only reaches), and downstream reaches where killifish and the omnivorous guppy, Poecilia reticulata, coexist (Killifish‚ÄìGuppy reaches). We asked: Do P. hansoni larvae exhibit differences in size structure between reaches with differing fish assemblages? We found that size distributions of larvae differed between reaches in the majority of replicate streams, with smaller median body lengths in Killifish-Only reaches. Killifish‚ÄìGuppy reaches had higher proportions of the largest instar, but we did not find differences in body length within an instar. No evidence of size-selective predation was found through analysis of killifish stomach contents, and environmental variables were largely similar between upstream and downstream reaches of the five study streams, aside from higher killifish abundances in upstream reaches. Our results, coupled with previous evidence of guppies altering killifish populations, suggest that the mediating effects of a third-party species (guppies) on predator‚Äìprey (killifish‚Äìcaddisfly) interactions can affect the population size structure of prey populations. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10750-018-3674-0,2-s2.0-85047980822,12,0.5598897205026221,0,is spat vary in pop siz structures of a stream dwel caddisf due to the alt effect of a pred by a third party specy pred alt abund and lif hist charact of prey and effect of predator‚äìprey interact can be alt by third party specy her we examin siz structures of the caddisf phylloic hanson in trinidad streams with two distinct fish assembl upstream reach wher the pred kil anablepsoid harti is the on fish specy kil on reach and downstream reach wher kil and the omn guppy poecil reticulat coex killifish‚äìguppy reach we ask do p hanson larva exhibit diff in siz structure between reach with diff fish assembl we found that siz distribut of larva diff between reach in the maj of reply streams with smal med body length in kil on reach killifish‚äìguppy reach had high proport of the largest inst but we did not find diff in body leng within an inst no evid of siz select pred was found through analys of kil stomach cont and environ vary wer larg simil between upstream and downstream reach of the fiv study streams asid from high kil abund in upstream reach our result coupl with prevy evid of guppy alt kil pop suggest that the medy effect of a third party specy guppy on predator‚äìprey killifish‚äìcaddisfly interact can affect the pop siz structure of prey pop,new,0.5642477648363283,0.5000515257506806,0.458303579006175,0.430568546787174,0.41205859633552405,0.4002956732907747,0.39413949992520136,0.3934108101611028,0.39898534748648873,0.4135943369688626,0.444501523857349
673,fish_neotropic,"Comparing species richness, functional diversity and functional composition of waterbird communities along environmental gradients in the neotropics","Waterbirds have a major functional role in wetlands, and understanding how functional traits of waterbirds depend on environmental characteristics can facilitate management of ecosystems and their services. We investigate how the waterbird community in a Neotropical river-floodplain system responds to environmental gradients, identifying how they affect waterbird species richness, functional diversity (measured as functional dispersion) and functional composition (specific functional traits). We sampled 22 lakes in the Upper Paran√° floodplain system in southern Brazil, and modelled avian functional diversity and species richness as a function of environmental variables. Then we used a unified RLQ and fourthcorner analysis to evaluate environment-trait relationships. Waterbird species richness and functional diversity varied according to different environmental variables. Lake area and diversity of aquatic vegetation were associated with avian species richness, while relative abundance of grass and emergent macrophytes and mean and variation of depth were related to functional diversity. Furthermore, changes in functional diversity seemed to be mainly driven by presence of species that depend on perches for foraging (e.g. kingfishers, cormorants, and kites), whose presence was mainly associated with deep water and emergent macrophytes. Nevertheless, changes in functional diversity and functional composition did not depend on exactly the same set of environmental variables, suggesting that trait combinations (e.g. below surface feeders who feed on fish), not only specific traits, are important drivers of the variation in functional diversity between lakes. Given the observed differences in responses of species richness and functional diversity, both these diversity metrics should be used as complementary tools in ecosystem management. Furthermore, our results show that functional diversity and composition are partially coupled, suggesting that although functional diversity is influenced by the environmental filtering of particular traits, it also reflects other ecological mechanisms (e.g. competitive interactions among species). ¬© 2018 Arruda Almeida et al.

461,fish_oceanic,"Annual changes in the population size of the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Copepoda: Caligidae) on high-seas Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and relationship to host abundance","The population size of the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, was monitored annually in the summers of 1991-1997 by examining six species of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) caught by surface long-lines in oceanic offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. The annual copepod population size on all salmonids caught was estimated by combining the calculated number of copepods carrying on each salmonid species. The copepod population fluctuated markedly from year to year, which resulted largely from marked annual changes in abundance of pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). Since pink salmon were most frequently and heavily infected and since their abundance changed every year, the copepod population was high in the years when this salmonid species was abundant, but low when it was rare. On the contrary, chum salmon (O. keta) did not show high prevalence and intensity of infection, but the annual abundance of this host species was consistently high, i.e. chum salmon carried many copepods every year. Copepods on other salmonid species (sockeye salmon O. nerka, coho salmon O. kisutch, chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, and steelhead trout O. mykiss) constantly formed a small percentage of the total copepod population. Both chum and pink salmon are the most important hosts in terms of their substantial contribution to support the copepod population, but the importance as hosts of each species is definitely different between the species. Chum salmon is a stable important host supporting the copepod population at a relatively high level every year, while the number of copepods on pink salmon annually exhibits marked fluctuations, and this salmonid species is regarded as an unstable important host.",10.1023/A:1013154403992,2-s2.0-0035877887,8,0.68693188028115,1,an chang in the pop siz of the salmon lous lepeophtheir salmon copepod caligida on high sea pac salmon oncorhynch spp and rel to host abund the pop siz of the salmon lous lepeophtheir salmon was monit an in the sum of by examin six specy of pac salmon oncorhynch spp caught by surfac long lin in oc offsh wat of the nor pac oc and ber sea the an copepod pop siz on al salmonid caught was estim by combin the calc numb of copepod carry on each salmonid specy the copepod pop fluctu mark from year to year which result larg from mark an chang in abund of pink salmon o gorbusch sint pink salmon wer most frequ and heavy infect and sint their abund chang every year the copepod pop was high in the year when thi salmonid specy was abund but low when it was rar on the cont chum salmon o ket did not show high prev and intens of infect but the an abund of thi host specy was consist high i e chum salmon carry many copepod every year copepod on oth salmonid specy sockey salmon o nerk coho salmon o kisutch chinook salmon o tshawytscha and steelhead trout o mykiss const form a smal perc of the tot copepod pop both chum and pink salmon ar the most import host in term of their subst contribut to support the copepod pop but the import as host of each specy is definit diff between the specy chum salmon is a stabl import host support the copepod pop at a rel high level every year whil the numb of copepod on pink salmon an exhibit mark fluctu and thi salmonid specy is regard as an unst import host,new,0.7142515673840432,0.6769636442708554,0.6522012549217359,0.6355111816586723,0.624388117453382,0.6175653690247335,0.6145219871507657,0.6153146373850931,0.6206832326727055,0.6325889375788362,0.6558124565397218
473,fish_oceanic,"An analysis of a zooplankton sampling-gear change in the CalCOFI long-term monitoring program, with implications for copepod population abundance trends","The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program has been systematically sampling zooplankton off the west coast of North America since 1949. In 1978, the 1-m diameter ring net used by the program was replaced with a bongo net, which consists of two 0.71-m diameter nets on a single frame. This study compares paired zooplankton samples taken with a ring net and a 0.71-m or 0.6-m bongo net to determine the relative performances of the two net types for catching calanoid copepods. Thirty-one species and stages were enumerated, along with the category 'total female calanoids'. Twenty-one categories of calanoid copepods were abundant enough to test for effects of changes in net type. No significant differences between the nets were found after correcting for multiple testing. Statistical power was then estimated for a range of potential net effects equivalent to ratios of copepod densities between the nets of 1.1-3.0. The probability of detecting differences greater than a factor of 1.5-3.0 was high (‚â•80%) for total female calanoids, Metridia pacifica, Pleuromamma abdominalis edentata, P. borealis, Calanus pacificus, Eucalanus californicus and Rhincalanus nasutus. For these categories of copepods, any population changes greater than a factor of 1.5-3.0 that might be found from the CalCOFI data set can be assumed to be the result of factors other than the change in net type. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We used fishing day as the unit of effort, standardized through the principal components analysis. The first three components in the model were significant. The catch-per-unit-effort monthly average as an index of abundance was estimated for one-degree area quadrants for the total fleet operation area and classified into five levels of abundance for graphic presentation. The variation of seasonal relative abundance was meaningful, with its maximum during the second quarter. Variation of annual relative abundance was also significant with a minimum during 1984 and a maximum in 1986. This led us to believe the El Ni√±o (1986-1987) had no relevant effect on the abundance of the resource. The lowest relative abundance (12 t per fishing day) coincided with the greatest percentage of unsuccessful fishing, and it was found in northwest Mexico. The greatest abundance was found in the oceanic area (west of 120¬∞W; 18.5 t per day fishing) coinciding with the area of low-percentage unsuccessful fishing.

The catching efficiency of fishing gear is variable and depends on several aspects of the animal's behaviour and life history as well as on the type of the gear and the environmental characteristics of the area surveyed. A good alternative for studying the abundance of octopus is by visual census. The population density of O. vulgaris was measured by visual census with scuba diving. The survey was conducted in coastal areas of Greece and on soft sediment. O. vulgaris density ranged from 0 to 6.88 individuals/1000m2 and the mean density values of this study were much higher than those mentioned in other papers. Octopus density was significantly associated with season. Densities of octopuses lower than 500 g were higher in coarse sediments than in finer ones. The density of large octopuses (&gt; 500 g) increased with depth. Octopuses larger than 200 g tended to dwell deeper during the period of intense thermocline than during the nothermocline period.,10.3989/scimar.2004.68n4553,2-s2.0-13244275312,22,0.761732602401732,0,abund of octop vulg on soft sedy until now the distribut and abund of octop vulg had been investig in the main fish area of the specy on by fish survey the catch efficy of fish gear is vary and depend on sev aspect of the anim s behavio and lif hist as wel as on the typ of the gear and the environ charact of the are survey a good altern for study the abund of octop is by vis cens the pop dens of o vulg was meas by vis cens with scub div the survey was conduc in coast area of greec and on soft sedy o vulg dens rang from to individ m and the mean dens valu of thi study wer much high than thos ment in oth pap octop dens was sign assocy with season dens of octopus low than g wer high in coars sedy than in fin on the dens of larg octopus gt g increas with dep octopus larg than g tend to dwel deep dur the period of intens thermoclin than dur the nothermoclin period,new,0.7823611498629357,0.7080127584350451,0.649587353901161,0.6036679835374539,0.5667277101146369,0.5363094455671858,0.5107838530517993,0.4890680786960908,0.47044697649725353,0.4544784216346784,0.44098465269364984
80,fish_oceanic,An assessment of Greenland walrus populations,"Recent abundance estimates were combined with historical catches and an age- and sex-structured population dynamic model to perform Bayesian assessments of the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) populations in West Greenland, the North Water in northern Baffin Bay, and East Greenland. The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

822,fish_oceanic,Power of monitoring programmes to detect decline and recovery of rare and vulnerable fish,"1. Abundance trends provide key guidance when setting conservation priorities, whether indicating population decline, stability or recovery. Knowledge of the power of surveys to detect trends is essential, as the consequences of not detecting a real trend can be profound. 2. Unfortunately, some surveys have been established with no assessment of power, and others are used to study species that were not their original focus. The latter is common in the marine environment, where rare fish are monitored using catch data from surveys that target more abundant commercially fished species. 3. We calculated the power of a large-scale annual monitoring survey (the English North Sea bottom trawl survey) to detect decline and recovery of species that are vulnerable to fishing. As fisheries exploitation invariably precedes scientific investigation, the survey began after many vulnerable species had already been depleted. 4. The power of the survey to detect declines in the abundance of vulnerable species on time scales of < 10 years was low and the survey often failed to detect declines that would lead to listings under the IUCN A1 Red List criteria. Thus conservation prioritization based solely on survey data may fail to identify species at risk of regional extinction. 5. If conservation measures were effective, and vulnerable populations recovered at the maximum potential rate, 5-10 years of monitoring would often be required to detect recovery. 6. Power to detect trends in abundance was increased by developing a composite indicator that reflected trends in abundance of several vulnerable species. This indicator provided an overview of their conservation status. 7. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the precautionary principle, conservation prioritization and management action should not depend on the statistical significance of recent abundance trends when low power is a consequence of historical depletion. If the conservation prioritization and management of rare and/or vulnerable species have to be predicated on evidence of significant declines, then higher type 1 error rates (falsely detecting a decline) should be acceptable. This is because the costs of type 1 errors are lower than those of type 2 (failure to detect a real decline). ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01000.x,2-s2.0-14844300885,263,0.7932128157049342,1,pow of monit program to detect declin and recovery of rar and vuln fish abund trend provid key guid when set conserv pri wheth ind pop declin stabl or recovery knowledg of the pow of survey to detect trend is ess as the consequ of not detect a real trend can be profound unfortun som survey hav been est with no assess of pow and oth ar us to study specy that wer not their origin foc the lat is common in the marin environ wher rar fish ar monit us catch dat from survey that target mor abund commerc fish specy we calc the pow of a larg scal an monit survey the engl nor sea bottom trawl survey to detect declin and recovery of specy that ar vuln to fish as fishery exploit invary prec sci investig the survey beg aft many vuln specy had already been deplet the pow of the survey to detect declin in the abund of vuln specy on tim scal of year was low and the survey oft fail to detect declin that would lead to list und the iucn a red list criter thu conserv priorit bas sol on survey dat may fail to ident specy at risk of reg extinct if conserv meas wer effect and vuln pop recov at the maxim pot rat year of monit would oft be requir to detect recovery pow to detect trend in abund was increas by develop a composit ind that reflect trend in abund of sev vuln specy thi ind provid an overview of their conserv stat synthes and apply consist with the precaut principl conserv priorit and man act should not depend on the stat sign of rec abund trend when low pow is a consequ of hist deplet if the conserv priorit and man of rar and or vuln specy hav to be pred on evid of sign declin then high typ er rat fals detect a declin should be acceiv thi is becaus the cost of typ er ar low than thos of typ fail to detect a real declin,new,0.8402774345361126,0.8044818132041182,0.7770130541867948,0.7554395293459369,0.7379694928734106,0.7234703401248157,0.7112329857444385,0.7008172152247875,0.6919799912649787,0.6846702986403099,0.6792072101986251
981,fish_oceanic,Linkages between coastal and open-ocean habitats and dynamics of Japanese stocks of chum salmon and Japanese sardine,"Coastal-ocean-open-ocean migrations, prey-predator relations and long-term population dynamics of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) and Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus), associated with large-scale climate and oceanographic conditions, are reviewed. After early marine life in coastal waters in northern Japan, chum salmon of Japanese origin spend their first summer in the Okhotsk Sea, then move to the Western Subarctic Gyre for the first winter at sea. Thereafter, they migrate between summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea and wintering grounds in the Alaskan Gyre for a period of usually up to four years, and finally return to their natal rivers to spawn. Carrying capacity (K) for chum salmon at an unfished equilibrium level was estimated from a Ricker spawner-recruitment curve, and the residual carrying capacity (RCC=(K-abundance)K-1). was positively correlated with body size at age 4, and negatively correlated with age at maturity. Marine survival of Hokkaido chum populations was affected by body size at release, but neither by Aleutian low pressure activity nor sea-surface temperature (SST) around coastal Hokkaido in spring, although there is some correlation between survival rate and coastal SST. Juveniles of the Pacific stock of Japanese sardine become broadly distributed in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) as far east as 180¬∞ longitude during spring. Adults disperse as far as the central Pacific and the southern areas of the Okhotsk Sea and Western Subarctic Gyre in years of high abundance. Somatic growth and age at maturation of sardine are density-dependent. We used catch, biomass and residuals of observed recruitment numbers from a Ricker curve (LNRR) as a measure of sardine population dynamics. LNRR was highly correlated with SST of KE in winter, which shifted in 1970 and 1988. Recent biomass and catch remain at extremely low levels due to a combination of adverse environmental conditions and intensive fishing. We suggest that Japanese populations of chum salmon and Japanese sardine have a broader geographic range than North American populations, perhaps because of differences between western and eastern boundary current systems, and associated larval drift (sardine) or avoidance of intra-species competition (chum salmon). ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1032,fish_oceanic,The biology and fishery of shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) in Atlantic Canadian waters,"Shortfin mako sharks are a high-value bycatch of pelagic longline fisheries off the eastern coast of Canada. Tagging studies indicate that they are highly migratory, seasonal residents of Canadian waters, representing the northern extension of a North Atlantic-wide population centred at more southerly latitudes. Annual catches in Canadian waters average 60-80 mt per year, which represents but a small part of that estimated for the population as a whole. New ageing results indicate that the species grows more slowly than was reported previously, thus making the population less productive and more susceptible to overexploitation than has been reported. Two indices of population abundance did not provide a definitive view of mako shark population status. A standardized catch rate index from the commercial large pelagic fishery suggested stable abundance since 1988. However, the analysis did not have the statistical power to detect anything less than a severe decline. In contrast, the median size of mako sharks in the commercial catch has declined since 1998, suggesting a loss of larger sharks. These results are broadly consistent with a previous report of population decline, although it appears unlikely that current exploitation rates in Canada are having an appreciable impact on the population.

1043,fish_oceanic,Warming and exponential abundance increase of the subtropical fish Capros aper in the Bay of Biscay (1973-2002),"The exponential abundance increase of a sub-tropical species, boarfish (Capros aper), as well as the sea bottom temperature increase in the continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay (France) over the three last decades are reported. This species was rare in the seventies and is now a dominant one. This is a small bathy-demersal, probably short-lived species with few predators (probably because of the presence of strong spines) and not exploited by fisheries. In the same time, a significant temperature increase in the bottom waters is observed during the breeding season of this population. The boarfish abundance increase is related to the warming, its ability to invade and the absence of predators as well as the absence of fishing. ¬© 2005 Acad√©mie des sciences.

1062,fish_oceanic,"Measuring marine fish biodiversity: Temporal changes in abundance, life history and demography","Patterns in marine fish biodiversity can be assessed by quantifying temporal variation in rate of population change, abundance, life history and demography concomitant with long-term reductions in abundance. Based on data for 177 populations (62 species) from four north-temperate oceanic regions (Northeast Atlantic and Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, North mid-Atlantic), 81% of the populations in decline prior to 1992 experienced reductions in their rate of loss thereafter; species whose rate of population decline accelerated after 1992 were predominantly top predators such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), sole (Solea solea) and pelagic sharks. Combining population data across regions and species, marine fish have declined 35% since 1978 and are currently less than 70% of recorded maxima; demersal species are generally at historic lows, pelagic species are generally stable or increasing in abundance. Declines by demersal species have been associated with substantive increases in pelagic species, a pattern consistent with the hypothesis that increases in the latter may be attributable to reduced predation mortality. There is a need to determine the consequences to population growth effected by the reductions in age (21%) and size (13%) at maturity and in mean age (5%) and size (18%) of spawners, concomitant with population decline. We conclude that reductions in the rate of population decline, in the absence of targets for population increase, will be insufficient to effect a recovery of marine fish biodiversity, and that great care must be exercised when interpreting multi-species patterns in abundance. Of fundamental importance is the need to explain the geographical, species-specific and habitat biases that pervade patterns of marine fish recovery and biodiversity. ¬© 2005 The Royal Society.",10.1098/rstb.2004.1586,2-s2.0-18344378069,50,0.835125841956233,1,meas marin fish biodivers temp chang in abund lif hist and demograph pattern in marin fish biodivers can be assess by quant temp vary in rat of pop chang abund lif hist and demograph concomit with long term reduc in abund bas on dat for pop specy from four nor temp oc reg northeast atl and pac northwest atl nor mid atl of the pop in declin pri to expery reduc in their rat of loss thereaft specy whos rat of pop declin accel aft wer predomin top pred such as atl cod gad morhu sol sole sole and pel shark combin pop dat across reg and specy marin fish hav declin sint and ar cur less than of record maxim demers specy ar gen at hist low pel specy ar gen stabl or increas in abund declin by demers specy hav been assocy with subst increas in pel specy a pattern consist with the hypothes that increas in the lat may be attribut to reduc pred mort ther is a nee to determin the consequ to pop grow effect by the reduc in ag and siz at mat and in mean ag and siz of spawn concomit with pop declin we conclud that reduc in the rat of pop declin in the abs of target for pop increas wil be insufficy to effect a recovery of marin fish biodivers and that gre car must be exerc when interpret mult specy pattern in abund of funda import is the nee to explain the geograph specy spec and habit bias that pervad pattern of marin fish recovery and biodivers,new,0.8714845427961256,0.8466642793633928,0.8273428500617213,0.8117042766264068,0.7985441930336888,0.7870917176862147,0.7768079768626631,0.7672522869552275,0.7579658346747737,0.7482695442485554,0.7368317537993517
1091,fish_oceanic,Destruction of a Holothuria scabra population by overfishing at Abu Rhamada Island in the Red Sea,"Populations of Holothuria scabra at Abu Rhamada Island were investigated during 52 months, from July 1999 to October 2003. During the first 23 months (July, 1999-May, 2001) the Island had a robust population with a tri-modal size frequency distribution curve, very high densities (85.7-95.1 ind./100 m 2 at the sandy habitat), high abundance (3362-3110 individuals) and biomass (46.7-34.3 kg/100 m2). Also, during this period most individuals were at depths between 4 and 6 m and no individuals were recorded deeper than 15 m. The population declined after harvesting began (June, 2001) and by March, 2002 the size frequency distribution showed a bimodal pattern with an obvious decrease in abundance of large individuals. There was also a slight reduction in densities (73.2-60.1 ind./100 m2 at the sandy habitat), abundance (2292-1682 individuals) and biomass (21.6-11.3 kg/100 m2), and a marked shift towards deeper waters. Overfishing reached its maximum during the final 19 months of the study, and by October, 2003, density (30.7-0.4 ind./100 m2 at the sandy habitat), abundance (802-10 individuals) and biomass (6.9-0.1 kg/100 m2) were all greatly reduced. The size frequency distribution of the population became unimodal, large animals disappeared and no recruits were seen. During this period, individuals were found at very deep depths (30 to &gt;40 m). The study also showed that sandy substrate was the preferred habitat for H. scabra, accommodating the largest number of individuals. The population of H. scabra at Abu Rhamada Island was found to spawn biannually from 1999 to 2001, then only once during 2002 when high fishing pressure occurred, and ceased completely in 2003. The sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1 before fishing begun, but shifted to an increasing male bias reaching 93% males by January 2003. None of the small animals remaining after January, 2003 could be sexed. Size at sexual maturity decreased from prefishing (185 mm for females and 160 mm for males) to 155 mm for females and 125 mm for males in January 2003. There was a positive relationship between fecundity and size. And oocyte/female was highest in 1999 (0.73-1.7 million) and 2000 (0.75-1.72 million), decreased during 2001 (0.2-0.85 million) to reach its minimum at 2002 (0.28-0.29 million). ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1102,fish_oceanic,Non-recovery of two spotted and spinner dolphin populations in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean,"Populations of northeastern offshore spotted dolphins Stenella attenuata attenuata and eastern spinner dolphins S. longirostris orientalis have been reduced because the dolphins are bycatch in the purse-seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (the 'tuna-dolphin issue'). Abundance and trends of these dolphin stocks were assessed from 12 large-scale pelagic surveys carried out between 1979 and 2000. Estimates of abundance were based on a multivariate line-transect analysis, using covariates to model the detection process and group size. Current estimates of abundance are about 640 000 northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (CV = 0.17) and 450 000 eastern spinner dolphins (CV = 0.23). For the whole period from 1979 to 2000, annual estimates of abundance ranged from 494 000 to 954 000 for northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and from 271 000 to 734 000 for eastern spinner dolphins. Management actions by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock is showing clear signs of recovery. Possible reasons include underreporting of dolphin bycatch, effects of chase and encirclement on dolphin survival and reproduction, long-term changes in the ecosystem, and effects of other species on spotted and spinner dolphin population dynamics. ¬© Inter-Research 2005.",10.3354/meps291001,2-s2.0-19944421769,30,0.809441998946307,1,non recovery of two spot and spin dolphin pop in the eastern trop pac oc pop of northeastern offsh spot dolphin stenell attenuat attenuat and eastern spin dolphin s longirost ory hav been reduc becaus the dolphin ar bycatch in the purs sein fishery for yellowfin tun in the eastern trop pac oc the tun dolphin issu abund and trend of thes dolphin stock wer assess from larg scal pel survey carry out between and estim of abund wer bas on a mult lin transect analys us cov to model the detect process and group siz cur estim of abund ar about northeastern offsh spot dolphin cv and eastern spin dolphin cv for the whol period from to an estim of abund rang from to for northeastern offsh spot dolphin and from to for eastern spin dolphin man act by us and intern fish ag ov decad hav success reduc dolphin bycatch by ord of magnitud yet neith stock is show clear sign of recovery poss reason includ underreport of dolphin bycatch effect of chas and encirc on dolphin surv and reproduc long term chang in the ecosystem and effect of oth specy on spot and spin dolphin pop dynam,new,0.7875578612706069,0.7398464364731135,0.703982943845703,0.6765641311004617,0.6551270733667972,0.6381807405275398,0.6248815051034201,0.6148562209807551,0.6082013936528322,0.6057273354302671,0.609828921640422

In Los Roques Archipelago, C perezi and C falciformis were most common during the second half of the year; a similar trend was observed for the rest of the shark species caught by the fishery. A positive relationship was observed between CPUE and fishing depth in the case of C. perezi and C falciformis off Los Roques Archipelago: CPUE by weight increases with depth, while CPUE by number decreases with depth.

More ocean quahogs were encountered, on a per tow basis, in the vicinity of and north of Hudson Canyon. The proportion of recruits in the size-frequency distribution was higher in the south and the most recent recruitment events were concentrated there. Analysis of the 104 size-frequency distributions delineated regions of recent recruitment, areas that have not seen significant recruitment for many decades and areas that received heavy recruitment some decades previously but not recently. Overall, the survey suggests that three regionally distinctive processes determine the size-frequency distributions of ocean quahog assemblages and recruitment therein. The area northeast of Hudson Canyon is unique in the regionally extensive uniformity of size-frequency distributions among sampled assemblages, the near absence of recent recruitment and the presence of large numbers of older recruits, 65-80 mm in size. The inshore (by ocean quahog standards) area off New Jersey is unique in the dominant presence of the largest size classes of ocean quahogs and the remarkable absence of significant recruitment over an extraordinary time span. The area south of 39¬∞N is unique in the widespread presence of relatively young recruits, including some animals with ages within the time span of the present fishery. Recruitment events in ocean quahog populations, although rare in the sense of occurring only once in a score or two of years, are frequent in the context of the +200-year life span of this species, yet also rare in the context of stock survey timing and fishery dynamics. This study strongly supports the assumption that long-lived species recruit successfully only rarely when at carrying capacity. This study also suggests that the history of recruitment over the last perhaps two-score years, revealed by this survey, may be a poor measure of the recruitment dynamics to be anticipated over the next two-score years when the population abundance is reduced to what is anticipated to approximate the biomass at maximum sustainable yield. Given the long time span required for ocean quahogs to grow to fishable size, a substantive disequilibrium may exist between the recruitment anticipated from the relationship of adult biomass to carrying capacity and the contemporaneous number of recruits for minimally 20 y after adult abundance is reduced from circa-1980 carrying capacity to biomass, maximum sustainable yield.",10.2983/0730-8000(2005)24[517:EORRIT]2.0.CO;2,2-s2.0-23944506991,377,0.8078866688202231,0,evid of rec recruit in the oc quahog arctic islandic in the mid atl bight we report result of a survey explicit focus on oc quahog recruit in the mid atl bight the recruit survey resampl al nmfs survey sit sou of hudson canyon and a select of sit nor and east of hudson canyon off the long island coast ov the entir dep rang of thi specy with the exceiv of the most insh reach off long island mor oc quahog wer encount on a per tow bas in the vicin of and nor of hudson canyon the proport of recruit in the siz frequ distribut was high in the sou and the most rec recruit ev wer cont ther analys of the siz frequ distribut delin reg of rec recruit area that hav not seen sign recruit for many decad and area that receiv heavy recruit som decad prevy but not rec overal the survey suggest that three reg distinct process determin the siz frequ distribut of oc quahog assembl and recruit therein the are northeast of hudson canyon is un in the reg extend uniform of siz frequ distribut among sampl assembl the near abs of rec recruit and the pres of larg numb of old recruit mm in siz the insh by oc quahog standard are off new jersey is un in the domin pres of the largest siz class of oc quahog and the remark abs of sign recruit ov an extraordin tim span the are sou of ¬∞n is un in the widespread pres of rel young recruit includ som anim with ag within the tim span of the pres fishery recruit ev in oc quahog pop although rar in the sens of occur on ont in a scor or two of year ar frequ in the context of the year lif span of thi specy yet also rar in the context of stock survey tim and fishery dynam thi study strongly support the assum that long liv specy recruit success on rar when at carry capac thi study also suggest that the hist of recruit ov the last perhap two scor year rev by thi survey may be a poor meas of the recruit dynam to be anticip ov the next two scor year when the pop abund is reduc to what is anticip to approxim the biomass at maxim sustain yield giv the long tim span requir for oc quahog to grow to fish siz a subst disequilibr may ex between the recruit anticip from the rel of adult biomass to carry capac and the contemp numb of recruit for minim y aft adult abund is reduc from circ carry capac to biomass maxim sustain yield,new,0.840826642371844,0.794105963287799,0.7570442386441077,0.727433321437412,0.7031567248189059,0.6827689107476863,0.665314781207109,0.650150546599433,0.6368301908514833,0.625035099523296,0.614558571165305
1321,fish_oceanic,Distribution and biology of the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus in the Alboran Sea (Southwestern Mediterranean),"The distribution, population size structure and reproductive biology of blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus in the Alboran Sea were studied from 438 bottom trawls performed at depths of 40 to 796 m during twelve surveys carried out between 1994 and 2002. The species was only captured at the two deepest strata (below 200 m), reaching its maximum abundance and biomass between 501 and 800 m. Maximum indices, obtained in 1997 and 2002, indicate no specific trend in abundance, whereas the biomass showed a slightly decreasing trend from 1994. Similarly, seasonal variation of abundance and biomass during the last two years showed maximum values of biomass in autumn but with no trend in abundance. The size of the specimens ranged from 10 to 63 cm and all size groups were well represented in the length frequencies during all seasons. Juveniles and adults were restricted to depths below 500 m, while recruits were distributed throughout the whole bathymetric range in which the species was found. Both recruitment and spawning were continuous throughout the year and the total length at first maturity was calculated as 44.3 and 48.8 cm for males and females, respectively. Finally, the great abundance and biomass of the species as well as its wide population structure are compared and discussed with other Mediterranean areas.",,2-s2.0-24744435111,114,0.808972039754296,1,distribut and biolog of the blackmou catshark gale melastom in the alb sea southwestern mediter the distribut pop siz structure and reproduc biolog of blackmou catshark gale melastom in the alb sea wer study from bottom trawl perform at depth of to m dur twelv survey carry out between and the specy was on capt at the two deepest strata below m reach it maxim abund and biomass between and m maxim ind obtain in and ind no spec trend in abund wherea the biomass show a slight decreas trend from simil season vary of abund and biomass dur the last two year show maxim valu of biomass in autumn but with no trend in abund the siz of the specim rang from to cm and al siz group wer wel repres in the leng frequ dur al season juvenil and adult wer restrict to depth below m whil recruit wer distribut throughout the whol bathymet rang in which the specy was found both recruit and spawn wer continu throughout the year and the tot leng at first mat was calc as and cm for mal and fem respect fin the gre abund and biomass of the specy as wel as it wid pop structure ar comp and discuss with oth mediter area,new,0.8377679202297462,0.7918200007961054,0.7557437601389234,0.7270739953879006,0.7036766136536747,0.6841277081258622,0.6674987202049893,0.6531768222227073,0.6407581718465445,0.6299857246700497,0.6207377481643319
1381,fish_oceanic,Preliminary assessment of the Falklands Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) population: Use of recruitment indices and the estimation of unreported catches,"Longline fishing for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) has taken place in Falkland Island waters for over 10 years. This species was previously only caught as bycatch in the Loligo gahi and finfish trawl fishery. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the Falkland Islands population of Dissostichus eleginoides using an age-structured production model (ASPM). Two models were investigated; one using a Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship and another using trawler CPUE based estimates of toothfish abundance to estimate yearly recruitment. A stock recruitment relationship was not included within the model that used abundance estimates, as recruitment to the population was estimated directly from the index of relative recruit abundance calculated from trawler CPUE. The model was fitted to longline standardised CPUE and to the catch-at-length data. The models produced estimates that provided similar declines in the toothfish population although the start and end biomass estimates varied slightly. The models provided estimates of between 13,000 and 26,000 tonnes of current spawning stock biomass and showed current biomass to be between 38 and 46% of virgin biomass. The fit to CPUE was poor between 1994 and 1996, which we hypothesised could have been due to unreported catches or changes in q or M. This was a time when there was considerable IUU fishing in the southwest Atlantic. When the model was allowed to estimate a level of extra catch the fit was improved and 5000 tonnes of extra catch was estimated. Two further models were briefly examined to investigate the possibility of changes in M and q but both required large changes in those parameters in order to fit. Estimates of MSY varied widely, from 912 to almost 3000 tonnes. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

1391,fish_oceanic,"Abundance and spatial distribution of the Mediterranean scallop, Pecten jacobaeus, in a marine lake","Pecten jacobaeus is an exploitable bivalve, whose populations have greatly declined in the main Mediterranean fisheries since the mid-1980s. A substantial population of the species was studied in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). The population density and the spatial distribution of P. jacobaeus were estimated in the lake with line transect sampling by SCUBA diving, a method not previously used for scallop density estimations. Individuals of the first size class (small) were mainly restricted to shallow waters (4-8 m), while individuals of the second size class (large) were mainly restricted to deeper waters (>12 m). Possible reasons for this size-separation were: (1) the most appropriate settlement substrate for pediveligers was in shallow waters, (2) the strong summer thermocline in the lake may have induced the selection of the shallow and warm bottoms of the lake as settlement areas, (3) intraspecific competition between adults and pediveligers, and (4) the high fishing mortality of large individuals in shallow waters. On the hypothesis that successful recruitment of P. jacobaeus occurred mostly in the shallow areas of the lake, it was deduced that P. jacobaeus gradually migrated, as they grew, from the shallow settlement fields of the lake to the deeper areas. The density of large individuals was associated with depth and the degree of scatter (QDœÜ) of the granule size frequencies. Higher densities of large individuals were found deeper and in poorly sorted sediments (QDœÜ > 1.0). The size of large individuals was positively correlated with depth. The size of P. jacobaeus population in Lake Vouliagmeni was estimated. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

1441,fish_oceanic,Estimating movement and abundance of Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) with tag-release-recapture data,"A mark-recapture experiment was conducted in Seguam Pass, Alaska, to estimate local Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) abundance and to evaluate the efficacy of trawl exclusion zones around Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) rookeries. Atka mackerel were found in dense aggregations near the Aleutian Islands where they are a major prey item of endangered Steller sea lions. In 1999, 1375 tagged fish were released and a biomass of 76 679 metric tonnes (t) was estimated outside a trawl exclusion zone using a simple Petersen model. In 2000, 8773 tagged fish were released and the estimated biomasses were 117 900 t inside and 82 057 t outside the trawl exclusion zones using an integrated tagging model. Movement into the open zone was small after 107 days (0.6%), whereas movement from the open area was potentially large but highly uncertain after 107 days (81%). Our model suggests that trawl exclusion zones in Seguam Pass are effective in separating a large biomass of potential prey for Steller sea lions from the immediate effects of local fisheries. Atka mackerel do not appear to move substantially outside their local aggregations (<70 km), and they show strong habitat preferences within their local home ranges. In one instance, fish released in an area of low Atka mackerel abundance returned to their capture location about 2 miles away. Thus individual Atka mackerel may have an affinity for particular areas within their home range, perhaps resulting from adaptations to local oceanic conditions along the Aleutian Island archipelago. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-2419.2005.00380.x,2-s2.0-28344457564,4,0.674908547290304,1,estim mov and abund of atk mackerel pleurogramm monopterygi with tag releas recapt dat a mark recapt expery was conduc in seguam pass alask to estim loc atk mackerel pleurogramm monopterygi abund and to evalu the eff of trawl exclud zon around stel sea lion eumetopia jubat rookery atk mackerel wer found in dens aggreg near the aleut island wher they ar a maj prey item of endang stel sea lion in tag fish wer releas and a biomass of met ton t was estim outsid a trawl exclud zon us a simpl peters model in tag fish wer releas and the estim biomass wer t insid and t outsid the trawl exclud zon us an integr tag model mov into the op zon was smal aft day wherea mov from the op are was pot larg but high uncertain aft day our model suggest that trawl exclud zon in seguam pass ar effect in sep a larg biomass of pot prey for stel sea lion from the immedy effect of loc fishery atk mackerel do not appear to mov subst outsid their loc aggreg km and they show strong habit pref within their loc hom rang in on inst fish releas in an are of low atk mackerel abund return to their capt loc about mil away thu individ atk mackerel may hav an affin for particul area within their hom rang perhap result from adapt to loc oc condit along the aleut island archipelago,new,0.692391129230845,0.6301551126491195,0.5866595692302311,0.5557695716033271,0.5334207878958147,0.5173149238732976,0.5062520600430105,0.4998042694186139,0.49830797224795453,0.5033107036603182,0.5191372361005
160,fish_oceanic,Fishing elevates variability in the abundance of exploited species,"The separation of the effects of environmental variability from the impacts of fishing has been elusive, but is essential for sound fisheries management. We distinguish environmental effects from fishing effects by comparing the temporal variability of exploited versus unexploited fish stocks living in the same environments. Using the unique suite of 50-year-long larval fish surveys from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations we analyse fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Here we present evidence from the marine environment that exploited species exhibit higher temporal variability in abundance than unexploited species. This remains true after accounting for life-history effects, abundance, ecological traits and phylogeny. The increased variability of exploited populations is probably caused by fishery-induced truncation of the age structure, which reduces the capacity of populations to buffer environmental events. Therefore, to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain the total viable biomass but also to prevent the significant truncation of age structure. The double jeopardy of fishing to potentially deplete stock sizes and, more immediately, to amplify the peaks and valleys of population variability, calls for a precautionary management approach. ¬©2006 Nature Publishing Group.",10.1038/nature05232,2-s2.0-33750371465,7,0.6772004879588149,0,fish elev vary in the abund of exploit specy the sep of the effect of environ vary from the impact of fish has been elud but is ess for sound fishery man we distinct environ effect from fish effect by comp the temp vary of exploit vers unexploit fish stock liv in the sam environ us the un suit of year long larv fish survey from the californ coop oc fishery investig we analys fish as a tre effect in a long term ecolog expery her we pres evid from the marin environ that exploit specy exhibit high temp vary in abund than unexploit specy thi remain tru aft account for lif hist effect abund ecolog trait and phylogeny the increas vary of exploit pop is prob caus by fishery induc trunt of the ag structure which reduc the capac of pop to buff environ ev theref to avoid collaps fishery must be man not on to sustain the tot viabl biomass but also to prev the sign trunt of ag structure the doubl jeopardy of fish to pot deplet stock siz and mor immedy to ampl the peak and valley of pop vary cal for a precaut man approach,new,0.701881903832448,0.6554792172490677,0.6229223849794893,0.5996096453708385,0.5827091537642543,0.5706387404485338,0.5625895105720222,0.5583171226019561,0.5581672672943193,0.5634422146255813,0.577639307687252
1711,fish_oceanic,"High-frequency patterns in abundance of larval Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and rockfish, Sebastes spp., at a single fixed station off central California","Standard CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) ichthyoplankton bongo net sampling was conducted every 2 h over 11 days at a single fixed station off central California in February 1995. A conductivity, temperature, and depth cast was completed after each tow to record corresponding hydrographic information. Larval Pacific hake, shortbelly rockfish, and other rockfish were enumerated and length measurements were recorded. Time-depth contours of water density showed a clear boundary, defining the mixed layer along the œÉŒ∏ = 25.0 isopycnal, that appeared to fluctuate vertically on a 12-h cycle centered around 50 m depth. Temperature-salinity plots showed a distinctly different pattern in the mixed layer when compared with water below the pycnocline. Length-frequency distributions plotted by survey day indicated a relatively continuous input of small rockfish larvae into the survey area rather than a resident population growing progressively larger each day. Catches of rockfish larvae were much higher in nighttime tows and varied by survey day, but were unaffected by the depth of the 25.0 isopycnal. In contrast, catches of Pacific hake did not vary significantly on a diel basis, but were significantly variable by survey day and were influenced by the depth of the mixed layer. Catches of Pacific hake larvae were significantly higher during warm-saline periods (spicy water), while shortbelly rockfish were significantly less abundant under these conditions. Spectral analysis showed a clear 12-h cycle in the depth of the 25.0 isopycnal and a 24-h cycle in the catches of rockfish larvae, while Pacific hake catches and spiciness of the mixed layer appeared to have lower frequency cycles in excess of 48 h. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00440.x,2-s2.0-34250743723,25,0.6243448168433531,0,high frequ pattern in abund of larv pac hak merlucci product and rockf sebast spp at a singl fix stat off cent californ standard calcof californ coop oc fishery investig ichthyoplankton bongo net sampl was conduc every h ov day at a singl fix stat off cent californ in febru a conduc temp and dep cast was complet aft each tow to record correspond hydrograph inform larv pac hak shortbel rockf and oth rockf wer enum and leng meas wer record tim dep conto of wat dens show a clear bound defin the mix lay along the œéœ∏ isopycn that appear to fluctu vert on a h cyc cent around m dep temp salin plot show a distinct diff pattern in the mix lay when comp with wat below the pycnoclin leng frequ distribut plot by survey day ind a rel continu input of smal rockf larva into the survey are rath than a resid pop grow progress larg each day catch of rockf larva wer much high in nighttim tow and vary by survey day but wer unaffect by the dep of the isopycn in contrast catch of pac hak did not vary sign on a diel bas but wer sign vary by survey day and wer influ by the dep of the mix lay catch of pac hak larva wer sign high dur warm salin period spicy wat whil shortbel rockf wer sign less abund und thes condit spect analys show a clear h cyc in the dep of the isopycn and a h cyc in the catch of rockf larva whil pac hak catch and spicy of the mix lay appear to hav low frequ cyc in excess of h,new,0.624076254276331,0.5742725569165579,0.5420044796751884,0.5208640761409563,0.5072491342145277,0.49934228296287814,0.4963828550139079,0.4984050711248812,0.5063500751849547,0.5227593563259959,0.5538641531437485
1722,fish_oceanic,Ocean climate effects on the relative abundance of short-finned (Illex illecebrosus) and long-finned (Loligo ealeii) squid in the northwest Atlantic Ocean,"An unusually high abundance of long-finned squid (Loligo pealeii) was observed around southern Newfoundland in August-September 2000. The prevalence of maturing females and mature males, along with the collection of a single viable egg mop, provide the first evidence of spawning of this species at the northern limit of its geographic range of distribution. Northward expansion of the long-finned squid population may be related to a general warming trend in Newfoundland near-shore waters. However, trends in size and abundance of short-finned squid (Illex illecebrosus) suggest that this expansion may also be related to reduced competition. We hypothesize that these two squid species share, to a large extent, a common niche on the eastern USA shelf and that opposing responses to ecosystem variation affect their relative abundance. We address this hypothesis by applying time-series analysis of species-specific fishery- and survey-based abundance indices with biologic and environmental input variables. Our models indicate that direct competition is not important, but that variation in atmospheric forcing, as well as latitudinal position of the Shelf-Slope Front (SSF), are closely related to direct oceanographic processes that exert opposing effects on these two species. While the direct oceanographic mechanisms that regulate year-class strength remain unknown, we present a hypothesis to account for opposing population responses to oceanographic variation that operates early in the life history of both species. For the oceanic and highly migratory short-finned squid, variation in the latitudinal position of the SSF is related to efficiency of downstream dispersal by the Gulf Stream and survival of young stages. For the neritic long-finned squid, variation in local inshore temperature affects the time exposed to intense predation through its effect on rates of embryonic development and growth. The expansion of long-finned squid population abundance in 2000 was associated with both warm local water temperatures and an unusual eastward displacement of the atmospheric features associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). These conditions may have resulted in an unfavorable oceanic regime for short-finned squid but a favorable regime for long-finned squid on the continental shelf as far north as southern Newfoundland. ¬© 2007 The Authors.",10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00431.x,2-s2.0-34250773407,28,0.5700496107340209,0,oc clim effect on the rel abund of short fin illex illecebros and long fin loligo ealei squid in the northwest atl oc an unus high abund of long fin squid loligo pealei was observ around southern newfoundland in august septemb the prev of mat fem and mat mal along with the collect of a singl viabl eg mop provid the first evid of spawn of thi specy at the northern limit of it geograph rang of distribut northward expand of the long fin squid pop may be rel to a gen warm trend in newfoundland near shor wat howev trend in siz and abund of short fin squid illex illecebros suggest that thi expand may also be rel to reduc competit we hypothes that thes two squid specy shar to a larg ext a common nich on the eastern us shelf and that oppos respons to ecosystem vary affect their rel abund we address thi hypothes by apply tim sery analys of specy spec fishery and survey bas abund ind with biolog and environ input vary our model ind that direct competit is not import but that vary in atmosph forc as wel as latitudin posit of the shelf slop front ssf ar clos rel to direct oceanograph process that exert oppos effect on thes two specy whil the direct oceanograph mech that reg year class strength remain unknown we pres a hypothes to account for oppos pop respons to oceanograph vary that op ear in the lif hist of both specy for the oc and high migr short fin squid vary in the latitudin posit of the ssf is rel to efficy of downstream dispers by the gulf stream and surv of young stag for the nerit long fin squid vary in loc insh temp affect the tim expos to intens pred through it effect on rat of embryon develop and grow the expand of long fin squid pop abund in was assocy with both warm loc wat temp and an unus eastward displac of the atmosph feat assocy with the nor atl oscil nao thes condit may hav result in an unfav oc regim for short fin squid but a fav regim for long fin squid on the contin shelf as far nor as southern newfoundland,new,0.6110008865552746,0.5484501322214563,0.5071860994652747,0.4795364511192163,0.4609514217693925,0.44901998907780105,0.4426017266547352,0.441465558245836,0.4463422805717553,0.4595817300519369,0.487292786667517
1751,fish_oceanic,"Distribution, abundance and biology of the smalltooth sandtiger shark Odontaspis ferox (Risso, 1810) (Lamniformes: Odontaspididae)","The smalltooth sandtiger shark, Odontaspis ferox, has a cosmopolitan distribution across warm temperate and tropical waters, and although essentially demersal, it has also been captured pelagically in mid-ocean. The species often occurs inshore at steeply shelving coastal and insular locations, and has now been identified by divers at eight widely separated shallow water sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, most O. ferox were caught by trawl on the continental slope, where its bathic range was extended to at least 880 m. Large specimens (>200 cm TL) were found across the whole depth range, but almost all juveniles were caught between 200 and 600 m. The largest recorded male was 344 cm TL, and female 450 cm TL. The few biological data suggest that size at maturity for males is around 200-250 cm TL, and for females 300-350 cm. No pregnant females were recorded but size at birth is probably about 100 cm TL. Nowhere has the species been found in large numbers. Survey and commercial catch data from south-east Australian trawl grounds suggest that numbers of O. ferox there have declined since the advent of deepwater commercial trawling in the 1970s. In areas of steep untrawlable terrain, increased gill-netting and longlining are likely to impact on local populations, with mature individuals being particularly vulnerable. Although O. ferox is not specifically targeted by commercial fishing activities, its likely very low fecundity make it susceptible to local extirpation, even at seemingly small capture rates. This species is protected off New South Wales and is considered "" vulnerable"" globally, by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",10.1007/s10641-007-9193-x,2-s2.0-36849057037,15,0.752444771704538,1,distribut abund and biolog of the smalltoo sandtig shark odontasp ferox risso lamniform odontaspidida the smalltoo sandtig shark odontasp ferox has a cosmopolit distribut across warm temp and trop wat and although ess demers it has also been capt pel in mid oc the specy oft occ insh at steeply shelv coast and insul loc and has now been ident by div at eight wid sep shallow wat sit in the southern hemisph most o ferox wer caught by trawl on the contin slop wher it bath rang was extend to at least m larg specim cm tl wer found across the whol dep rang but almost al juvenil wer caught between and m the largest record mal was cm tl and fem cm tl the few biolog dat suggest that siz at mat for mal is around cm tl and for fem cm no pregn fem wer record but siz at bir is prob about cm tl nowh has the specy been found in larg numb survey and commerc catch dat from sou east aust trawl ground suggest that numb of o ferox ther hav declin sint the adv of deepw commerc trawl in the s in area of steep untrawl terrain increas gil net and longlin ar lik to impact on loc pop with mat individ being particul vuln although o ferox is not spec target by commerc fish act it lik very low fecund mak it suscept to loc extirp ev at seem smal capt rat thi specy is protect off new sou wal and is consid vuln glob by the world conserv un iucn,new,0.7773793166616634,0.7180145825512286,0.6723298536447573,0.6369331292197256,0.6089397192329742,0.5864675808524317,0.5683648646256174,0.5540059196504483,0.54324279302251,0.5365805987109697,0.5359029796771976
1791,fish_oceanic,Why fishing magnifies fluctuations in fish abundance,"It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels. ¬©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",10.1038/nature06851,2-s2.0-42249087307,1,0.7352403129409699,0,why fish magn fluctu in fish abund it is now clear that fish pop can fluctu mor than unharvest stock howev it is not clear why her we distinct among three maj compet mech for thi phenomenon by us the year californ coop oc fishery investig calcof larv fish record first vary fish press direct increas vary in exploit pop second commerc fish can decreas the av body siz and ag of a stock caus the trunt pop to track environ fluctu direct third ag trunt or juvenesc pop hav increas unst pop dynam becaus of chang demograph paramet such as intrins grow rat we find no evid for the first hypothes limit evid for the second and strong evid for the third theref in californ cur fishery increas temp vary in the pop doe not ar from vary exploit nor doe it reflect direct environ track mor funda it ar from increas inst in dynam thi find has imply for resourc man as an empir exampl of how select harvest can alt the bas dynam of exploit pop and lead to unst boom and bust that can prec system declin in stock level,new,0.7437821255210775,0.7205495989642692,0.7050267671438372,0.6946013891269747,0.6878802470084782,0.6841646302918967,0.6831920084063877,0.6850679933101713,0.690372766790057,0.7005469625792032,0.7190679635764139
1911,fish_oceanic,Year-to-year and inter-decadal fluctuations in abundance of Pelagic fish populations in relation to climate-induced oceanic conditions,"Ocean climate variables (1900-2005), time series of catches (1910-2005) and body size data were used to assess the year-to-year and decadal scale fluctuations in abundance of the fish populations (Japanese sardine, anchovy, jack mackerel, chub mackerel, Pacific saury and common squid) that have spawning grounds in the East China Sea and its adjacent regions. A negative correlation between the abundance of pelagic fishes (e.g. jack mackerel) in the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) region and the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) region was attributed to the climatic modulation of larval transport and recruitment, which depends on the winter monsoon-induced drift, current systems, and spawning season and site. The changes in abundance and alternation of dominant fish populations in the two regions in the 1930s, 1970s, and late 1980s mirrored changes in the climate indices (ALPI, AOI and MOI). Oscillations in the decadal climate shifts between the two regions led to zonal differences in larval transport and recruitment, and hence differences in the abundance of the pelagic fish populations. During deep Aleutian Lows, as in the 1980s, larval transport from the East China Sea to the KOC region increases in association with the strong winter Asian monsoon, cool regime and increased volume transport of the Kuroshio Current systems, whereas during a weak Aleutian Low (as in the 1990s), larval transport to the TWC region increased in association with a weak winter Asian monsoon, a warm regime, and increased volume transport of the Tsushima current system. We postulate that the increased chub mackerel abundance in the TWC region and the decreased abundance in the KOC region in the 1990s are partly attributed to changes in recruitment and availability to the fishing fleets under the warm regime in the spawning and nursery grounds in the East China Sea in association with the quasi-steady state of mild winter monsoon in the 1990s. The fluctuations in chub mackerel and jack mackerel abundance are under the environment-dependant growth form, although the tropicalization was identified in the TWC region. The density-dependant growth form was found in Japanese sardine populations, but no tropicalization by fishing was identified in the long (10-15 year) periods of abundance despite their short (3-4 year) generation time, suggesting that the environment-dependant growth form drove the changes in abundance. Year-to-year and decadal scale variations in abundance and population structure of the Pacific saury responded to climate regime shifts (1976/1977, 1988/1989), suggesting that the fish is a key bio-indicators for changes in the ecosystem.",,2-s2.0-52949097262,2,0.8175135488221871,1,year to year and int decad fluctu in abund of pel fish pop in rel to clim induc oc condit oc clim vary tim sery of catch and body siz dat wer us to assess the year to year and decad scal fluctu in abund of the fish pop japanes sardin anchovy jack mackerel chub mackerel pac saury and common squid that hav spawn ground in the east chin sea and it adjac reg a neg correl between the abund of pel fish e g jack mackerel in the tsushim warm cur twc reg and the kuroshio oyashio cur koc reg was attribut to the clim mod of larv transport and recruit which depend on the wint monsoon induc drift cur system and spawn season and sit the chang in abund and altern of domin fish pop in the two reg in the s s and lat s mir chang in the clim ind alp ao and moi oscil in the decad clim shift between the two reg led to zon diff in larv transport and recruit and hent diff in the abund of the pel fish pop dur deep aleut low as in the s larv transport from the east chin sea to the koc reg increas in assocy with the strong wint as monsoon cool regim and increas volum transport of the kuroshio cur system wherea dur a weak aleut low as in the s larv transport to the twc reg increas in assocy with a weak wint as monsoon a warm regim and increas volum transport of the tsushim cur system we post that the increas chub mackerel abund in the twc reg and the decreas abund in the koc reg in the s ar part attribut to chang in recruit and avail to the fish fleet und the warm regim in the spawn and nursery ground in the east chin sea in assocy with the quas steady stat of mild wint monsoon in the s the fluctu in chub mackerel and jack mackerel abund ar und the environ depend grow form although the trop was ident in the twc reg the dens depend grow form was found in japanes sardin pop but no trop by fish was ident in the long year period of abund despit their short year gen tim suggest that the environ depend grow form drov the chang in abund year to year and decad scal vary in abund and pop structure of the pac saury respond to clim regim shift suggest that the fish is a key bio ind for chang in the ecosystem,new,0.8639308507902516,0.827895521662952,0.7992964154520208,0.776191268872366,0.756959209323803,0.7405038348899255,0.7260705892231075,0.7130927276107257,0.7010624718840975,0.6893608225155694,0.6768827989758729
1921,fish_oceanic,The effects of environmental factors on daytime sandeel distribution and abundance on the Dogger Bank,"Spring distribution and abundance of lesser sandeels during the day were linked to zooplankton densities, seabed substrate and various hydrographic factors using small scale empirical data collected in two areas on the Dogger Bank in 2004, 2005 and 2006. The results of a two-step generalized additive model (GAM) suggested that suitable seabed substrate and temperature best explain sandeel distribution (presence/absence) and that sandeel abundance (given presence) was best described by a model that included bottom temperature, difference between surface and bottom temperature and surface salinity. The current study suggests that suitable seabed substrate explains sandeel distribution in the water column. Bottom temperature and surface salinity also played an important role in explaining distribution and abundance, and we speculate that sandeels favour hydrographically dynamic areas. Contrary to our hypothesis sandeels were not strongly associated with areas of high zooplankton density. We speculate that in early spring on the western Dogger Bank plankton is still patchily distributed and that sandeels only emerge from the seabed when feeding conditions near their night-time burrowing habitat are optimal. The results also suggested that when abundance is over a threshold level, the number of sandeel schools increased rather than the schools becoming bigger. This relationship between patchiness and abundance has implications for mortality rates and hence fisheries management.

1971,fish_oceanic,Patterns of jellyfish abundance in the North Atlantic,"A number of explanations have been advanced to account for the increased frequency and intensity at which jellyfish (pelagic cnidarians and ctenophores) blooms are being observed, most of which have been locally directed. Here, we investigate seasonal and inter-annual patterns in abundance and distribution of jellyfish in the North Atlantic Ocean to determine if there have been any system-wide changes over the period 1946-2005, by analysing records of the presence of coelenterates from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. Peaks in jellyfish abundance are strongly seasonal in both oceanic and shelf areas: oceanic populations have a mid-year peak that is more closely related to peaks in phyto- and zooplankton, whilst the later peak of shelf populations mirrors changes in SST and reflects processes of advection and aggregation. There have been large amplitude cycles in the abundance of oceanic and shelf jellyfish (although not synchronous) over the last 60 years, with a pronounced synchronous increase in abundance in both areas over the last 10 years. Inter-annual variations in jellyfish abundance in oceanic areas are related to zooplankton abundance and temperature changes, but not to the North Atlantic Oscillation or to a chlorophyll index. The long-term inter-annual abundance of jellyfish on the shelf could not be explained by any environmental variables investigated. As multi-decadal cycles and more recent increase in jellyfish were obvious in both oceanic and shelf areas, we conclude that these are likely to reflect an underlying climatic signal (and bottom-up control) rather than any change in fishing pressure (top-down control). Our results also highlight the role of the CPR data in investigating long-term changes in jellyfish, and suggest that the cnidarians sampled by the CPR are more likely to be holoplanktic hydrozoans and not the much larger meroplanktic scyphozoans as has been suggested previously. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s10750-008-9593-8,2-s2.0-57449119709,9,0.7690692304257291,0,pattern of jellyf abund in the nor atl a numb of expl hav been adv to account for the increas frequ and intens at which jellyf pel cnid and ctenoph bloom ar being observ most of which hav been loc direct her we investig season and int an pattern in abund and distribut of jellyf in the nor atl oc to determin if ther hav been any system wid chang ov the period by analys record of the pres of coel from the continu plankton record cpr survey peak in jellyf abund ar strongly season in both oc and shelf area oc pop hav a mid year peak that is mor clos rel to peak in phyto and zooplankton whilst the lat peak of shelf pop mir chang in sst and reflect process of advect and aggreg ther hav been larg amplitud cyc in the abund of oc and shelf jellyf although not synchron ov the last year with a pronount synchron increas in abund in both area ov the last year int an vary in jellyf abund in oc area ar rel to zooplankton abund and temp chang but not to the nor atl oscil or to a chlorophyll index the long term int an abund of jellyf on the shelf could not be explain by any environ vary investig as mult decad cyc and mor rec increas in jellyf wer obvy in both oc and shelf area we conclud that thes ar lik to reflect an und clim sign and bottom up control rath than any chang in fish press top down control our result also highlight the rol of the cpr dat in investig long term chang in jellyf and suggest that the cnid sampl by the cpr ar mor lik to be holoplankt hydrozo and not the much larg meroplankt scyphozo as has been suggest prevy,new,0.8209453616529816,0.7762504380419247,0.7427088798138252,0.7170723639335581,0.696896053472719,0.6806628150184445,0.6674549964342533,0.6567405109730136,0.6482733253218773,0.6421193651326351,0.6388903652955975
2011,fish_oceanic,"Habitat, distribution, and abundance of the commercial octopus (Octopus insularis) in a tropical oceanic island, Brazil: Information for management of an artisanal fishery inside a marine protected area","The spatial distribution, abundance and habitat of a population of a shallow-water octopus, Octopus insularis, subject to some fishery pressure, was studied in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, a marine protected area off northeastern Brazil. Three techniques were used: visual censuses in fixed quadrants and in roving-diver and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of the commercial fishery. We had two hypotheses, that the species had a nonrandom distribution, related to substrate and body size, and that relative abundance outside the national park would be lower than within, possibly due to fishery pressure. We found a patchy distribution over all, with octopuses almost confined to substrates with a large proportion of hard surfaces. There were seasonal and depth effects on distribution of the very small octopuses found mainly in shallow water (intertidal to 5 m depth) during the dry season. Abundance was similar inside and outside of the national park, which suggests that the octopus fishery is not a threat to the abundance of O. insularis at this present level. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

2021,fish_oceanic,Cascading top-down effects of changing oceanic predator abundances,"1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. ¬© 2009 British Ecological Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01531.x,2-s2.0-66749121926,21,0.534185877448544,1,cascad top down effect of chang oc pred abund top down control can be an import determin of ecosystem structure and funct but in oc ecosystem wher cascad effect of pred deplet recovery and invas could be sign such effect had rar been demonst until rec her we synthes the evid for oc top down control that has emerg ov the last decad focus on larg high troph level pred inhabit contin shelv sea and the op oc in thes ecosystem wher control manip ar larg infeas pseudo expery analys of pred prey interact that tre independ pred pop as reply and temp or spat contrast in pred pop and clim as tre ar increas employ to help disentangl pred effect from environ vary and nois subst reduc in marin mam shark and pisc fish hav led to mesopr and invertebr pred increas convers abund oc pred hav suppress prey abund pred has also inhibit recovery of deplet specy sometim through pred prey rol revers troph cascad hav been in by oc pred link to nerit food web but seem inconsist in the pel realm with effect oft attenu at plankton top down control is not uniform strong in the oc and appear cont on the intens and nat of perturb to pred abund pred divers may damp cascad effect exceiv wher nonselect fishery deplet entir pred funct group in oth cas simult exploit of pred and prey can inhibit prey respons explicit consid of anthropog mod to oc foodweb should help inform predict about troph control synthes and apply oc top down control can hav import socio econom conserv and man imply as mesopr and invertebr assum domin and recovery of overexploit pred is impair continu research aim at integr across troph level is nee to understand and forecast the ecosystem effect of chang oc pred abund the rel strength of top down and bottom up control and interact with intens anthropog stressors such as clim chang,new,0.5780842591784385,0.5239438197939627,0.4890277876243776,0.4659831335570262,0.450812804962819,0.44149272496443154,0.4371210371485653,0.4376060295737085,0.4437439644576165,0.4578944794498845,0.48616717559537387
2181,fish_oceanic,Krill population dynamics at South Georgia: Implications for ecosystem-based fisheries management,"The South Georgia region supports a large biomass of krill that is subject to high interannual variability. The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change. ¬© 2010 Inter-Research.",10.3354/meps08356,2-s2.0-76249085454,33,0.7246516529321619,0,kril pop dynam at sou georg imply for ecosystem bas fishery man the sou georg reg support a larg biomass of kril that is subject to high interan vary the app lack of a loc self maintain kril pop at sou georg mean that understand the mech und thes observ pop charact is ess to success ecosystem bas man of kril fishery in the reg kril acoust dens dat from survey conduc in the ear middl and lat period of the sum of to togeth with kril pop siz structure ov the sam period from pred diet dat wer us with a kril pop dynam model to evalu pot mech behind the observ chang in kril biomass kril abund was highest dur the middl of the sum in year and in the lat period in year in the lat ther was evid that kril recruit was delay by sev month a model scenario that includ empir der estim of both the magnitud and tim of recruit in each year show the greatest correl with the acoust sery the result ar consist with a kril pop with allochthon recruit ent a retain adult pop i e oc transport of adult kril doe not appear to be the maj fact determin the dynam of the adult pop the result highlight the import of the tim of recruit espec wher thi could introduc a mismatch between the peak of kril abund and the peak demand from pred which may exacerb the effect of chang in kril pop ar from commerc harvest and or clim chang,new,0.8051415903439612,0.72358927549857,0.6619507513405424,0.6158176945873155,0.5802470622361552,0.5520596571355888,0.529325999696858,0.5109044278228372,0.4962018346217294,0.4851800940715292,0.4787054052507403
2231,fish_oceanic,"Through a glass less darkly-New approaches for studying the distribution, abundance and biology of Euphausiids","Euphausiids are vital components of many oceanic foodwebs. Due to their large size, they are key prey species for many vertebrates, and several species are subject to commercial fisheries. The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises-usually in summer-to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species.

2341,fish_oceanic,Preliminary forecasts of Pacific bigeye tuna population trends under the A2 IPCC scenario,"An improved version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model SEAPODYM was used to investigate the potential impacts of global warming on tuna populations. The model included an enhanced definition of habitat indices, movements, and accessibility of tuna predators to different vertically migrant and non-migrant micronekton functional groups. The simulations covered the Pacific basin (model domain) at a 2¬∞√ó2¬∞ geographic resolution. The structure of the model allows an evaluation from multiple data sources, and parameterization can be optimized by adjoint techniques and maximum likelihood using fishing data. A first such optimized parameterization was obtained for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Pacific Ocean using historical catch data for the last 50years and a hindcast from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model driven by the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. The parameterization provided very plausible biological parameter values and a good fit to fishing data from the different fisheries, both within and outside the time period used for optimization. We then employed this model to forecast the future of bigeye tuna populations in the Pacific Ocean. The simulation was driven by the physical-biogeochemical fields predicted from a global marine biogeochemistry - climate simulation. This global simulation was performed with the IPSL climate model version 4 (IPSL-CM4) coupled to the oceanic biogeochemical model PISCES and forced by atmospheric CO2, from historical records over 1860-2000, and under the SRES A2 IPCC scenario for the 21st century (i.e. atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 850ppm in the year 2100). Potential future changes in distribution and abundance under the IPCC scenario are presented but without taking into account any fishing effort. The simulation showed an improvement in bigeye tuna spawning habitat both in subtropical latitudes and in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) where the surface temperature becomes optimal for bigeye tuna spawning. The adult feeding habitat also improved in the ETP due to the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration in the sub-surface allowing adults to access deeper forage. Conversely, in the Western Central Pacific the temperature becomes too warm for bigeye tuna spawning. The decrease in spawning is compensated by an increase of larvae biomass in subtropical regions. However, natural mortality of older stages increased due to lower habitat values (too warm surface temperatures, decreasing oxygen concentration in the sub-surface and less food). This increased mortality and the displacement of surviving fish to the eastern region led to stable then declining adult biomass at the end of the century. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.pocean.2010.04.021,2-s2.0-77957117601,31,0.6198268912214361,1,prelimin forecast of pac bigey tun pop trend und the a ipcc scenario an improv vert of the spat ecosystem and pop dynam model seapodym was us to investig the pot impact of glob warm on tun pop the model includ an enh definit of habit ind mov and access of tun pred to diff vert migr and non migr micronekton funct group the sim cov the pac basin model domain at a ¬∞√ó¬∞ geograph resolv the structure of the model allow an evalu from multipl dat sourc and paramet can be optim by adjoint techn and maxim lik us fish dat a first such optim paramet was obtain for bigey tun thunn obes in the pac oc us hist catch dat for the last year and a hindcast from a coupl phys biogeochem model driv by the ncep atmosph reanalys the paramet provid very plaus biolog paramet valu and a good fit to fish dat from the diff fishery both within and outsid the tim period us for optim we then employ thi model to forecast the fut of bigey tun pop in the pac oc the sim was driv by the phys biogeochem field predict from a glob marin biogeochem clim sim thi glob sim was perform with the ipsl clim model vert ipsl cm coupl to the oc biogeochem model pisc and forc by atmosph co from hist record ov and und the sre a ipcc scenario for the st century i e atmosph co cont reach ppm in the year pot fut chang in distribut and abund und the ipcc scenario ar pres but without tak into account any fish effort the sim show an improv in bigey tun spawn habit both in subtrop latitud and in the eastern trop pac etp wher the surfac temp becom optim for bigey tun spawn the adult fee habit also improv in the etp due to the increas of dissolv oxyg cont in the sub surfac allow adult to access deep for convers in the western cent pac the temp becom too warm for bigey tun spawn the decreas in spawn is compens by an increas of larva biomass in subtrop reg howev nat mort of old stag increas due to low habit valu too warm surfac temp decreas oxyg cont in the sub surfac and less food thi increas mort and the displac of surv fish to the eastern reg led to stabl then declin adult biomass at the end of the century,new,0.6466981111131865,0.6047482519267372,0.5771227927344145,0.558950379400529,0.5474624368744188,0.5412452595682484,0.5397310982135161,0.5430316634002252,0.5520782010509726,0.5692446377680365,0.6002097828392292
2491,fish_oceanic,"Abundance of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Cetacea: Delphinidae), inhabiting the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil: Implications for conservation","A new mark-recapture abundance estimate and a photographic census were carried out to investigate the possible decline in the abundance of the bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821), in the Patos Lagoon estuary due to the high levels of bycatch mortality which occurred between 2002 and 2006 in oceanic coastal areas close to the estuary. Fourteen systematic boat surveys were conducted between August and early December 2005 to photo-identify the bottlenose dolphins. The estimated number of animals, with long-lasting marks, in the population obtained from Chapman's and Mth models were 51 (95% CI = 49-53) and 52 (95% CI = 51-60), respectively. Taking into account the proportion of dolphins with long-lasting marks in the population, the total estimated population size ranged between 84 (95% CI = 76-93) and 86 (95% CI = 78-95) individuals, respectively, which was very similar to the 84 individuals revealed by the population census. Our results did not differ from the abundance estimate carried out in 1998, prior to the high fishing-related mortality event, suggesting that the population is stable. Plausible argument to explain the stability of the population is that some carcasses found on the oceanic coastal beaches near Patos Lagoon estuary come from animals that do not belong to the estuary community. Future studies should investigate fine-scale habitat partition between estuarine and adjacent coastal dolphins. If the existence of different communities living in close proximity (estuarine and coastal areas near to the estuary) is confirmed, a new abundance estimate is needed to access the conservation status of bottlenose dolphins in this region. ¬© 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.",10.1590/S1984-46702011000100004,2-s2.0-79954986951,112,0.843195431802915,1,abund of bottlenos dolphin tursiop truncat cetace delphinida inhabit the pato lagoon estu southern brazil imply for conserv a new mark recapt abund estim and a photograph cens wer carry out to investig the poss declin in the abund of the bottlenos dolphin tursiop truncat montagu in the pato lagoon estu due to the high level of bycatch mort which occur between and in oc coast area clos to the estu fourteen system boat survey wer conduc between august and ear decemb to photo ident the bottlenos dolphin the estim numb of anim with long last mark in the pop obtain from chapm s and mth model wer ci and ci respect tak into account the proport of dolphin with long last mark in the pop the tot estim pop siz rang between ci and ci individ respect which was very simil to the individ rev by the pop cens our result did not diff from the abund estim carry out in pri to the high fish rel mort ev suggest that the pop is stabl plaus argu to explain the stabl of the pop is that som carcass found on the oc coast beach near pato lagoon estu com from anim that do not belong to the estu commun fut study should investig fin scal habit partit between estuarin and adjac coast dolphin if the ex of diff commun liv in clos proxim estuarin and coast area near to the estu is confirm a new abund estim is nee to access the conserv stat of bottlenos dolphin in thi reg,new,0.8629254518817571,0.8271631542912742,0.7989100289556341,0.7761974571108007,0.7573652586000361,0.7413013642061992,0.7272651722496585,0.7147394295524605,0.7033345668591712,0.6927028744999827,0.6824647567041072

This study includes new data on the biological diversity and abundance of the region and research and management recommendations. We conducted surveys and over 300 research SCUBA dives among the remote Phoenix Islands: Nikumaroro (Gardner), McKean, Manra (Sydney), Kanton (Aba-Riringa), Enderbury, Orona (Hull) and Rawaki (Phoenix), only excluding Birnie Island due to time limitations. Corals, benthic and mobile invertebrates, fishes, algae, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals were surveyed at each site. Deep-sea life was sampled during seven deployments of an autonomous digital video camera system to 1,000 m depth at Kanton, Manra, and Orona. Coral reef and fish communities were surveyed using rapid assessment methods, small benthic fishes were collected using rotenone as a stunning agent, marine algae were collected by hand primarily during SCUBA dives, and a deepdrop collecting net was deployed to sample deep-sea animals. The reefs show evidence of the extreme isolation of these islands, pounded on three sides by the large ocean swells of the Pacific with only a narrow protected side to the west providing protection for anchorage. Coral species diversity of the islands was moderately high. While lacking in some corals dominant in other major reef areas, the reefs have interesting species assemblages, with prolific growth of some species normally subdominant in other reef areas. The reefs were in an excellent state of health, at the time of these surveys free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific recently and with no evidence of any coral diseases. Our data include new distribution records for species of algae, coral and fishes. Fish communities were abundant and diverse and included pelagic fishes such as tuna and oceanic mackerels. Significant populations of grey reef, whitetip reef, and blacktip reef sharks were also observed indicating a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Reef macropredators (trevally, Napoleon wrasse) were also abundant. The deep-sea camera recorded images of deep-water sharks including six-gilled and Pacific sleeper sharks. Marine mammal sightings include bottlenose dolphins, Pacific spinner dolphins, beaked whales (Mesoplodon spp.), and unidentified whales. Sea birds observed on Rawaki, McKean, Enderbury, and Orona Islands included tens of thousands of nesting spectacled terns (grey-backed), sooty terns, white fairy-terns, brown noddies, blue-grey noddies, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-footed boobies, red-tailed tropic birds, great frigate birds and lesser frigate birds.

258,fish_oceanic,Assessing the impacts of fishing and habitat loss on the Lord Howe Island population of flesh-footed shearwaters,"The flesh-footed shearwater Puffinus carneipes is a medium-sized seabird with a single eastern Australian population breeding on Lord Howe Island. Other breeding populations exist in New Zealand, south-western Western Australia and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. Tagging and banding studies indicate that breeding birds of the Lord Howe Island population inhabit waters mainly to the west of the Island during October to May. Birds then migrate north to waters surrounding Japan during the Austral winter. Seabirds are attracted to the baited hooks of longline vessels and can become snagged and drown as the line sinks into the water. Observations of flesh-footed shearwater (FFS) bycatch in Australian waters have been recorded on both Japanese and domestic longline fishing vessels. Increased observer coverage between 2002 and 2004 on Australian longline vessels, in order to monitor the effectiveness of an under-water setting chute and various line-weighting regimes, showed large bycatch rates of seabirds, and in particular flesh-footed shearwaters (Baker and Wise, 2005). In addition, substantial reductions in colony size have occurred on the island due to housing development. As a consequence of these sources of additional mortality, concerns have been expressed about the population's sustainability. Australia has international and national obligations to ensure that fishery interactions with seabird populations are not deleterious to their populations. The ""incidental catch (or by-catch) of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations"" has been listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as a key threatening process for seabirds (Environment Australia, 1998). Flesh-footed shearwaters were nominated as being at risk from longline fishing. This paper presents a quantitative impact assessment that fully integrates information on the biology, foraging distributions, links to oceanography, fishing interactions (Northern and Southern Hemisphere), and potential impacts from housing on Lord Howe Island. A discrete age-, sex- and colony-structured model is developed that accounts for natural and fishing mortality, together with potential consequences from the loss of nesting habitat on Lord Howe Island. The model is able to fit to tagging data on breeding foraging distributions. These data assist the model in predicting where the birds might be when at sea. The birds' position is assumed to be a function of time of year, sea surface temperature and longitude. Using the predicted positions, the model fits to data on the observed bycatch from the Australian domestic longline fishery. These data enable the model to predict the probability of catching a bird, given various operational characteristics (e.g. setting at night). The model also fits to data from the two surveys of breeding abundance that have occurred on Lord Howe Island.",,2-s2.0-80052979401,199,0.806503311678462,1,assess the impact of fish and habit loss on the lord how island pop of flesh foot shearw the flesh foot shearw puffin carneip is a med siz seabird with a singl eastern aust pop bree on lord how island oth bree pop ex in new zealand sou western western austral and st paul island in the ind oc tag and band study ind that bree bird of the lord how island pop inhabit wat main to the west of the island dur octob to may bird then migr nor to wat surround jap dur the aust wint seabird ar attract to the bait hook of longlin vessel and can becom snag and drown as the lin sink into the wat observ of flesh foot shearw ffs bycatch in aust wat hav been record on both japanes and domest longlin fish vessel increas observ cov between and on aust longlin vessel in ord to monit the effect of an und wat set chut and vary lin weight regim show larg bycatch rat of seabird and in particul flesh foot shearw bak and wis in addit subst reduc in colony siz hav occur on the island due to hous develop as a consequ of thes sourc of addit mort concern hav been express about the pop s sustain austral has intern and nat oblig to ens that fishery interact with seabird pop ar not deletery to their pop the incid catch or by catch of seabird dur oc longlin fish op has been list und the environ protect and biodivers conserv act as a key threatening process for seabird environ austral flesh foot shearw wer nomin as being at risk from longlin fish thi pap pres a quantit impact assess that ful integr inform on the biolog for distribut link to oceanograph fish interact northern and southern hemisph and pot impact from hous on lord how island a discret ag sex and colony structured model is develop that account for nat and fish mort togeth with pot consequ from the loss of nest habit on lord how island the model is abl to fit to tag dat on bree for distribut thes dat assist the model in predict wher the bird might be when at sea the bird posit is assum to be a funct of tim of year sea surfac temp and longitud us the predict posit the model fit to dat on the observ bycatch from the aust domest longlin fishery thes dat en the model to predict the prob of catch a bird giv vary op charact e g set at night the model also fit to dat from the two survey of bree abund that hav occur on lord how island,new,0.8248361005852012,0.7551802664884466,0.6970986159087511,0.6495977271273727,0.6101973899985368,0.5768247997018395,0.5479492409852065,0.5224254224240422,0.4993234371438815,0.4777373585403981,0.45645780253514673
2731,fish_oceanic,Re-Creating Missing Population Baselines for Pacific Reef Sharks,"Sharks and other large predators are scarce on most coral reefs, but studies of their historical ecology provide qualitative evidence that predators were once numerous in these ecosystems. Quantifying density of sharks in the absence of humans (baseline) is, however, hindered by a paucity of pertinent time-series data. Recently researchers have used underwater visual surveys, primarily of limited spatial extent or nonstandard design, to infer negative associations between reef shark abundance and human populations. We analyzed data from 1607 towed-diver surveys (>1 ha transects surveyed by observers towed behind a boat) conducted at 46 reefs in the central-western Pacific Ocean, reefs that included some of the world's most pristine coral reefs. Estimates of shark density from towed-diver surveys were substantially lower (<10%) than published estimates from surveys along small transects (<0.02 ha), which is not consistent with inverted biomass pyramids (predator biomass greater than prey biomass) reported by other researchers for pristine reefs. We examined the relation between the density of reef sharks observed in towed-diver surveys and human population in models that accounted for the influence of oceanic primary productivity, sea surface temperature, reef area, and reef physical complexity. We used these models to estimate the density of sharks in the absence of humans. Densities of gray reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), whitetip reef sharks (Triaenodon obesus), and the group ""all reef sharks"" increased substantially as human population decreased and as primary productivity and minimum sea surface temperature (or reef area, which was highly correlated with temperature) increased.

Itis suggested that oceanicregime shifts in the early 1970s, late 1980s and late 1990s occurred in the TWC region in winter, but the regime shifts in the mid-1970s and in the late 1980s were not evidentin the springSST anomaly series. The abundance and body size of Pacific saury fluctuated in association with the winter oceanic changes in the TWC region. The catch rates and abundance of large size saury were far bellow average during their northward migrations in the TWC region in the years with abnormally cool winters (e.g., 1963,1970, 1977, 1981-1989 and 2006) and above average in the years with warm winters. These patterns demonstrate decadal-scale variations together with large inter-annual fluctuations in the structure and abundance of Pacific saury in association with the climatic-oceanic changes. These results, along with an alternation of dominant pelagic fish species, indicate the status of the saury population in the TWC region is in good condition, similar to that in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) region during the warm regime after the late 1980s climate regime shift. ¬© Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",,2-s2.0-84873823198,20,0.76201767131072,1,effect of clim oc chang on the abund of pac saury effect of oc clim chang on the pop structure and abund of pac saury cololab sir wer investig on the bas of clim ind sea surfac temp sst anoma catch and body siz inform from the tsushim warm cur twc reg yellow sea east chin sea andeast jap sea dur theperiod it suggest that oceanicregim shift in the ear s lat s and lat s occur in the twc reg in wint but the regim shift in the mid s and in the lat s wer not evidentin the springsst anoma sery the abund and body siz of pac saury fluctu in assocy with the wint oc chang in the twc reg the catch rat and abund of larg siz saury wer far bellow av dur their northward migr in the twc reg in the year with abnorm cool wint e g and and abov av in the year with warm wint thes pattern demonst decad scal vary togeth with larg int an fluctu in the structure and abund of pac saury in assocy with the clim oc chang thes result along with an altern of domin pel fish specy ind the stat of the saury pop in the twc reg is in good condit simil to that in the kuroshio oyashio cur koc reg dur the warm regim aft the lat s clim regim shift,new,0.8157824402494963,0.7696164171889469,0.7347792620886949,0.7080344554323997,0.6869154213236159,0.6698848627798687,0.6560042254469954,0.6447164810402266,0.6357390684969871,0.629067248891325,0.6251412306400862

This study gives a synoptic view (January 2001) of the micro and mesoplankton size fractions and normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) in upper waters of five different ecological domains (shelf and oceanic Subantarctic and Antarctic waters) including the Brazil-Malvinas confluence (BMC). Copepods were always the main component of the zooplankton; the <300-Œºm fraction represented between 70 and 99% in terms of numbers and from 20 to 88% in terms of biomass. Other zooplankton contributed with <40% to total zooplankton densities, though showing some biomass peaks (>50%). Chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature and salinity were the environmental variables that best explained the distribution trend of zooplankton, mainly that of the <300-Œºm fraction. For all the domains, NBSS revealed flat slopes (-0.6 to-1), suggesting a higher proportion of large organisms than expected at equilibrium. A dome-shape feature was detected in the BMC. Total biomass and trophic levels of the system were related to the composition of the community and the hydrological conditions of the domains covered. ¬© 2013 The Author.",10.1093/plankt/fbt014,2-s2.0-84877343894,17,0.507724883442852,0,structure abund and biomass siz spectr of copepod and oth zooplankton commun in up wat of the southwestern atl oc dur sum littl at has been paid to smal copepod and oth zooplankton inhabit pel ecosystem of the southwestern atl oc und the influ of the antarct circumpol cur circ despit their import rol in the troph chain and fishery thi study giv a synopt view janu of the micro and mesoplankton siz fract and norm biomass siz spectr nbss in up wat of fiv diff ecolog domain shelf and oc subantarct and antarct wat includ the brazil malvina conflu bmc copepod wer alway the main compon of the zooplankton the œºm fract repres between and in term of numb and from to in term of biomass oth zooplankton contribut with to tot zooplankton dens though show som biomass peak chlorophyll a sea surfac temp and salin wer the environ vary that best explain the distribut trend of zooplankton main that of the œºm fract for al the domain nbss rev flat slop to suggest a high proport of larg org than expect at equilibr a dom shap feat was detect in the bmc tot biomass and troph level of the system wer rel to the composit of the commun and the hydrolog condit of the domain cov,new,0.5268736375720267,0.4665590870084484,0.4301285106270365,0.40767253670269576,0.3941160068726167,0.3870565406946697,0.38554832251422094,0.389689185134974,0.40075972801461446,0.42220589787433144,0.46265867340570555

Rugosity, number of crevices and benthic diversity positively predicted the distribution of O. trinitatis. Turf algae was the preferred food item at all sites, but given its high availability inside and outside territory boundaries, it did not seem to be a limiting factor on the density of this blenny, as opposed to substrate heterogeneity. Bite rate was higher in the afternoon and for smaller individuals (juveniles). Territory size showed local variation and, although larger territories may be an effect of density-dependent conditions (more available space in low-density areas), we propose that individuals expand territories to compensate for residing in areas of lower quality (i.e. of low structural complexity). Larger individuals defended larger territories and residents responded differently to intruders, with higher rates of agonistic interactions towards potential competitors. Higher agonistic rates were also observed in larger territories and at low-complexity sites. ¬© 2014 CSIC.",10.3989/scimar.03979.30G,2-s2.0-84903768650,26,0.7024954096084699,0,abund and behavio ecolog of the blenny ophioblenni trinit teleoste blenniida at an oc archipelago of brazil atl la abundanc y la ecolog√≠a del comportamiento del blenny ophioblenni trinit teleoste blenniida en un archipi√©lago oce√°nico de brasil atl√°ntico loc pattern of fish dens microhabit us fee behavio bit rat territ are and agon interact wer record for ophioblenni trinit at an oc archipelago southwestern atl rugos numb of crev and benth divers posit predict the distribut of o trinit turf alga was the prefer food item at al sit but giv it high avail insid and outsid territ bound it did not seem to be a limit fact on the dens of thi blenny as oppos to subst heterog bit rat was high in the afternoon and for smal individ juvenil territ siz show loc vary and although larg territ may be an effect of dens depend condit mor avail spac in low dens area we propos that individ expand territ to compens for resid in area of low qual i e of low structural complex larg individ defend larg territ and resid respond diff to intrud with high rat of agon interact toward pot competit high agon rat wer also observ in larg territ and at low complex sit,new,0.7101611263698469,0.6428523189318586,0.594013050174565,0.5579726980880729,0.5306971884908361,0.5097680839609086,0.49379817775859963,0.48209552774290904,0.4745812599547849,0.47201035155107557,0.4769409053144701
3231,fish_oceanic,Fishery management priorities vary with self-recruitment in sedentary marine populations,"Fisheries science often uses population models that assume no external recruitment, but nearshore marine populations harvested on small scales of ,200 km often exhibit an unknown mix of self-recruitment and recruitment from external sources. Since empirical determination of self-recruitment vs. external recruitment is difficult, we used a modeling approach to examine the sensitivity of fishery management priorities to recruitment assumptions (self [closed], external [open]) in a local population of harvested giant clams (Tridacna maxima) on Mo'orea, French Polynesia. From 2006 to 2010, we measured growth, fecundity, recruitment, and survival (resulting from natural and fishing mortality). We used these data to parameterize both a closed (complete self-recruitment) and an open (no selfrecruitment) integral projection model (IPM), and then calculated elasticities of demographic rates (growth, survival, recruitment) to future population abundance in 20 years. The models' lowest projected abundance was 93.4% (95% CI, [86.5%, 101.8%]) of present abundance, if the local population is entirely open and the present level of fishing mortality persists. The population will exhibit self-sustaining dynamics. 1 k 1.07. as for a closed population if the ratio of self-recruits per gram of dry gonad is .0.775 (equivalent to 52.85% selfrecruitment under present conditions). Elasticity analysis of demographic parameters indicated that future abundance can most effectively be influenced by increasing survival of mid-sized clams (;80-120 mm) if the population is self-sustaining, and by increasing survival of juvenile clams (;40-70 mm) if the population is non-self-sustaining (as for an open population). Our results illustrate that management priorities can vary depending on the amount of self-recruitment in a local population. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/13-1201.1,2-s2.0-84907016100,19,0.7946598791897871,0,fishery man pri vary with self recruit in sed marin pop fishery sci oft us pop model that assum no extern recruit but nearsh marin pop harvest on smal scal of km oft exhibit an unknown mix of self recruit and recruit from extern sourc sint empir determin of self recruit vs extern recruit is difficult we us a model approach to examin the sensit of fishery man pri to recruit assum self clos extern op in a loc pop of harvest giant clam tridacn maxim on mo ore french polynes from to we meas grow fecund recruit and surv result from nat and fish mort we us thes dat to paramet both a clos complet self recruit and an op no selfrecruit integr project model ipm and then calc elast of demograph rat grow surv recruit to fut pop abund in year the model lowest project abund was ci of pres abund if the loc pop is entir op and the pres level of fish mort persist the pop wil exhibit self sustain dynam k as for a clos pop if the ratio of self recruit per gram of dry gonad is equ to selfrecruit und pres condit elast analys of demograph paramet ind that fut abund can most effect be influ by increas surv of mid siz clam mm if the pop is self sustain and by increas surv of juvenil clam mm if the pop is non self sustain as for an op pop our result illust that man pri can vary depend on the amount of self recruit in a loc pop,new,0.7870725512018975,0.7649551127180164,0.7498910860137719,0.7395457080188731,0.73259300833391,0.7283530174044136,0.7265508946635889,0.7272440730289015,0.7309105555721991,0.7387708541111682,0.7538171637996545
328,fish_oceanic,"Inter-annual and seasonal trends in cetacean distribution, density and abundance off southern California","Trends in cetacean density and distribution off southern California were assessed through visual line-transect surveys during thirty-seven California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) cruises from July 2004-November 2013. From sightings of the six most commonly encountered cetacean species, seasonal, annual and overall density estimates were calculated. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted baleen whales with overall densities of 0.91/1000km2 (CV=0.27), 2.73/1000km2 (CV=0.19), and 1.17/1000km2 (CV=0.21) respectively. Species specific density estimates, stratified by cruise, were analyzed using a generalized additive model to estimate long-term trends and correct for seasonal imbalances. Variances were estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap with one day of effort as the sampling unit. Blue whales were primarily observed during summer and fall while fin and humpback whales were observed year-round with peaks in density during summer and spring respectively. Short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoidesdalli) were the most frequently encountered small cetaceans with overall densities of 705.83/1000km2 (CV=0.22), 51.98/1000km2 (CV=0.27), and 21.37/1000km2 (CV=0.19) respectively. Seasonally, short-beaked common dolphins were most abundant in winter whereas Pacific white-sided dolphins and Dall's porpoise were most abundant during spring. There were no significant long-term changes in blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, short-beaked common dolphin or Dall's porpoise densities while Pacific white-sided dolphins exhibited a significant decrease in density across the ten-year study. The results from this study were fundamentally consistent with earlier studies, but provide greater temporal and seasonal resolution. ¬© 2014 The Authors.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2014.10.008,2-s2.0-84921495236,27,0.8666457442369659,1,int an and season trend in cetac distribut dens and abund off southern californ trend in cetac dens and distribut off southern californ wer assess through vis lin transect survey dur thirty sev californ coop oc fishery investig calcof cru from july novemb from sight of the six most common encount cetac specy season an and overal dens estim wer calc blu whal balaenopter muscul fin whal balaenopter physal and humpback whal megapter novaeanglia wer the most frequ sight baleen whal with overal dens of km cv km cv and km cv respect specy spec dens estim stratified by cru wer analys us a gen addit model to estim long term trend and correct for season imb vary wer estim us a non paramet bootstrap with on day of effort as the sampl unit blu whal wer prim observ dur sum and fal whil fin and humpback whal wer observ year round with peak in dens dur sum and spring respect short beak common dolphin delphin delph pac whit sid dolphin lagenorhynch obliquid and dal s porpo phocoenoidesdall wer the most frequ encount smal cetac with overal dens of km cv km cv and km cv respect season short beak common dolphin wer most abund in wint wherea pac whit sid dolphin and dal s porpo wer most abund dur spring ther wer no sign long term chang in blu whal fin whal humpback whal short beak common dolphin or dal s porpo dens whil pac whit sid dolphin exhibit a sign decreas in dens across the ten year study the result from thi study wer funda consist with ear study but provid gre temp and season resolv,new,0.8738995797705218,0.8353701960862213,0.8042304448715151,0.7788260200308993,0.7575266390087727,0.739180956279835,0.7230003831475499,0.7084250138846739,0.6950209974150073,0.6824015679892387,0.6700890740767965
3421,fish_oceanic,Assemblages of micronektonic fishes and invertebrates in a gradient of regional warming along the Western Antarctic Peninsula,"Micronektonic fishes and invertebrates were sampled with 32 midwater trawls at nine sites along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the austral fall (March-April) of 2010. Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site.Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii.Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system. ¬© 2015.",10.1016/j.jmarsys.2015.07.005,2-s2.0-84939506886,219,0.7910138957237579,0,assembl of micronekton fish and invertebr in a grady of reg warm along the western antarct peninsul micronekton fish and invertebr wer sampl with midw trawl at nin sit along the western antarct peninsul wap in the aust fal march april of study sit wer loc within four hypothes hydrograph reg near joinvil island in reg i at crok pass near anv island and near renaud island in reg ii within marguerit bay and the marguerit trough in reg ii and near charcot island in reg iv a tot of tax repres taxonom group of pel invertebr and famy of fish wer capt but assembl wer domin by on a few specy the most num abund tax wer the euphausiid thysanoess macrur euphaus superb and e crystallorophia combin to contribut near of the tot catch biomass domin includ e superb which contribut mor than of the tot catch the notothenioid pleuragramm antarctic and the salp salp thompson a comparison of tot catch among sit rev that the largest volumet abund and biomass wer capt at the marguerit bay sit clust analys of abund dat ident distinct multispecy assembl at joinvil island in reg i crok pass in reg ii marguerit bay in reg ii and charcot island in reg iv a fif distinct assembl includ sampl from sit near anv and renaud island in reg ii and from the marguerit trough in reg ii assembl at joinvil island and crok pass wer both domin by e superb and s thompson but hydrograph condit at joinvil island fav a nerit assembl undersc by subst numb of p antarctic the assembl at crok pass was mor oc in nat with maj input from the myctophid electron antarctic and the hyperiid amphipod themisto gaudichaudi marguerit bay and charcot island wer wel mix assembl with strong repres by both nerit and oc faun the mid peninsul assembl was oc in charact being overwhelm domin by thysanoess macrur and t gaudichaudi pleuragramm antarctic wer capt at fiv sit joinvil island crok pass marguerit bay and the two sit near charcot island they wer complet abs at the two sit near anv island at renaud island and in the marguerit trough on fish was capt in crok pass the maj of fish capt in marguerit bay wer larg than mm standard leng sl with very few fish of smal siz pres if resid pop of pleuragramm reproduc and recruit loc rath than being sustain by larv advect thos pop wil be high suscept to loc disappear thi may be the caus fact behind the abs of pleuragramm from the mid peninsul reg continu warm and subsequ sea ic reduc may not on caus pleuragramm pop collaps in the marguerit bay and charcot island reg but may also chang the charact of the faun assembl along the wap to thos of an oc system,new,0.7970655531596814,0.7003038491776542,0.6221934206705184,0.5610070307075472,0.512254564691414,0.4724185654449786,0.43906434582455045,0.4105004526770438,0.38547848782249067,0.3629861927697711,0.34194967401264703
348,fish_oceanic,Recent collapse of northern anchovy biomass off California,"New estimates of abundance of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) are developed from California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) data on egg and larval densities for the period 1951-2011. Previous estimates utilizing mean density over the CalCOFI area show a hyperstability bias because of the nearshore concentration of CalCOFI stations and the tendency of the anchovy population to contract into this area when abundances are low. New abundance estimates weight sample egg and larval densities to the local area represented by that sample, and then sum contributions to obtain total abundance. We develop total egg and larval abundance estimates for January and April, form a combined index, and calibrate it to the absolute biomass estimates produced by the Daily Egg Production Method in the early 1980s. Anchovy spawning biomass was very low, 10,000-20,000 Metric Tons (MT), in the early 1950s when CalCOFI sampling began. Abundance increased and fluctuated between 0.5 and 2 million metric tons from 1960 through 1990. After 1990, spawning biomass fluctuated around 200,000 tons, briefly increased during 2005-2006, then declined substantially over four years to below 20,000 tons from 2009 to 2011. CalCOFI ichthyoplankton data collected after 2011 are not yet available for analysis, but continuous underway egg sampling conducted during CalCOFI cruises indicates continued low abundance and very limited spawning through 2015 in both southern and central California. The recent collapse of anchovy abundance occurred in the absence of a significant fishery. Present annual catches of a few thousand tons are small by historical comparison, but the exploitation rate may now be relatively high given the low stock abundance. The decline in anchovy abundance coincides with recent die-offs and reproductive failures of anchovy-dependent predators in the ecosystem (e.g., sea lions and pelicans). ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.fishres.2015.11.013,2-s2.0-84949266443,322,0.8308173644571171,0,rec collaps of northern anchovy biomass off californ new estim of abund of northern anchovy engra mordax ar develop from californ coop oc fishery investig calcof dat on eg and larv dens for the period prevy estim util mean dens ov the calcof are show a hyperst bia becaus of the nearsh cont of calcof stat and the tend of the anchovy pop to contract into thi are when abund ar low new abund estim weight sampl eg and larv dens to the loc are repres by that sampl and then sum contribut to obtain tot abund we develop tot eg and larv abund estim for janu and april form a combin index and calibr it to the absolv biomass estim produc by the dai eg produc method in the ear s anchovy spawn biomass was very low met ton mt in the ear s when calcof sampl beg abund increas and fluctu between and mil met ton from through aft spawn biomass fluctu around ton brief increas dur then declin subst ov four year to below ton from to calcof ichthyoplankton dat collect aft ar not yet avail for analys but continu underway eg sampl conduc dur calcof cru ind continu low abund and very limit spawn through in both southern and cent californ the rec collaps of anchovy abund occur in the abs of a sign fishery pres an catch of a few thousand ton ar smal by hist comparison but the exploit rat may now be rel high giv the low stock abund the declin in anchovy abund coincid with rec die off and reproduc fail of anchovy depend pred in the ecosystem e g sea lion and pel,new,0.8333644608509447,0.7890591736854389,0.754590487964786,0.7274735440697628,0.7055861707836595,0.6875414402080121,0.6724737006842346,0.6598740883635428,0.6495272155138705,0.6415694326879731,0.6368390779061286
3511,fish_oceanic,The role of environmental controls in determining sardine and anchovy population cycles in the California Current: Analysis of an end-to-end model,"Sardine and anchovy are two forage species of particular interest because of their low-frequency cycles in adult abundance in boundary current regions, combined with a commercially relevant contribution to the global marine food catch. While several hypotheses have been put forth to explain decadal shifts in sardine and anchovy populations, a mechanistic basis for how the physics, biogeochemistry, and biology combine to produce patterns of synchronous variability across widely separated systems has remained elusive. The present study uses a 50-year (1959-2008) simulation of a fully coupled end-to-end ecosystem model configured for sardine and anchovy in the California Current System to investigate how environmental processes control their population dynamics. The results illustrate that slightly different temperature and diet preferences can lead to significantly different responses to environmental variability. Simulated adult population fluctuations are associated with age-1 growth (via age-2 egg production) and prey availability for anchovy, while they depend primarily on age-0 survival and temperature for sardine. The analysis also hints at potential linkages to known modes of climate variability, whereby changes in adult abundance are related to ENSO for anchovy and to the PDO for sardine. The connection to the PDO and ENSO is consistent with modes of interannual and decadal variability that would alternatively favor anchovy during years of cooler temperatures and higher prey availability, and sardine during years of warmer temperatures and lower prey availability. While the end-to-end ecosystem model provides valuable insight on potential relationships between environmental conditions and sardine and anchovy population dynamics, understanding the complex interplay, and potential lags, between the full array of processes controlling their abundances in the California Current System remains an on-going challenge. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.pocean.2014.11.013,2-s2.0-84951570019,29,0.5507429075717901,0,the rol of environ control in determin sardin and anchovy pop cyc in the californ cur analys of an end to end model sardin and anchovy ar two for specy of particul interest becaus of their low frequ cyc in adult abund in bound cur reg combin with a commerc relev contribut to the glob marin food catch whil sev hypothes hav been put for to explain decad shift in sardin and anchovy pop a mech bas for how the phys biogeochem and biolog combin to produc pattern of synchron vary across wid sep system has remain elud the pres study us a year sim of a ful coupl end to end ecosystem model config for sardin and anchovy in the californ cur system to investig how environ process control their pop dynam the result illust that slight diff temp and diet pref can lead to sign diff respons to environ vary sim adult pop fluctu ar assocy with ag grow via ag eg produc and prey avail for anchovy whil they depend prim on ag surv and temp for sardin the analys also hint at pot link to known mod of clim vary whereby chang in adult abund ar rel to enso for anchovy and to the pdo for sardin the connect to the pdo and enso is consist with mod of interan and decad vary that would altern fav anchovy dur year of cool temp and high prey avail and sardin dur year of warm temp and low prey avail whil the end to end ecosystem model provid valu insight on pot rel between environ condit and sardin and anchovy pop dynam understand the complex interplay and pot lag between the ful array of process control their abund in the californ cur system remain an on going challeng,new,0.5746061341096766,0.5615364310088099,0.5565290927135094,0.5568424983278455,0.5612722936496829,0.5694533891595907,0.5815923408357602,0.598482925949458,0.6218088724248584,0.6549874879748186,0.7051868942562787

The most abundant species in the island was E. mathaei oblonga (3.96 + 0.83 ind m-2; average and standard error), followed by D. mexicanum (2.13 + 0.59 ind m-2), T. depressus and E. thouarsii (between 0.50 and 0.11 ind m-2, respectively). Binners Bay had the highest density with 15.98 + 0.43 ind m-2, mostly due to the high incidence of E. mathaei oblonga at the site. Seasonally, T. depressus and E. thouarsii did not significantly varied its abundance during the year, while D. mexicanum was more abundant in winter-spring, and E. mathaei oblonga in the fall. Two species (D. mexicanum and E. mathaei oblonga) had an aggregated distribution along the year and in the three study locations, but the other two echinoids followed a random distribution. This may be a defense against the abundant predatory fishes.

375,fish_oceanic,"Whale shark (Rhincodon typus) seasonal occurrence, abundance and demographic structure in the mid-equatorialatlantic ocean","Whale sharks are generally associated with environmental factors that drive their movements to specific locations where food availability is high. Consequently, foraging is believed to be the main reason for the formation of whale shark aggregations. Feeding aggregations occur mainly in nearshore areas and are composed primarily of immature individuals. Conversely, aggregations of mature adults are rarely observed, and their occurrence is correlated with oceanic environments. Despite an increase in the number of whale shark studies, information on mating and parturition grounds is still lacking. In the present work, we assessed the ecological and behavioural aspects of the whale sharks that visit the archipelago of S√£o Pedro and S√£o Paulo (ASPSP), located ‚àº1,000 km off the coast of Brazil in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Forty-nine whale sharks were recorded from February 2005 to May 2014. The estimated mean - SD size was 8.27-2.52 m (range: 2.5-14.0 m) with no significant differences in size across the year. The maturational stages were classified by size as immature (<8.0 m; 32.56%) and mature (>9.0 m; 46.51%); with almost half of the observed animals being mature specimens. The majority of sightings occurred between February and June. During this period, the ocean current weakens and the waters are enriched by eggs and larvae of fishes and invertebrates that attract marine life to forage. At the same time, evidence of reproductive activity in adult females (i.e. swollen abdomen and bite marks on the pectoral fins), and the potential mating behaviour exhibited by one male, suggest that the ASPSP area might also have a role in whale shark reproduction. Irrespective of its use for feeding or reproduction, this insular habitat serves as a meeting point for both juvenile and adult whale sharks, and may play an important ecological role for the species. ¬© 2016 Macena, Hazin.

379,fish_oceanic,Under pressure: Cetaceans and fisheries co-occurrence off the coasts of Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire (Gulf of Guinea),"Within the Gulf of Guinea high levels of fisheries-related cetacean mortality (bycatch and direct-capture) has been documented. For locally rare species such removals could potentially lead to significant population level effects. However, information on the cetacean abundance and distribution is scarce. Similarly, it remains largely unreported where fishing fleets operate offshore. A cetacean survey took place during geophysical surveys (2013-2014) along the coasts of Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire. This provided a unique opportunity to study both offshore cetacean and fishing communities. Due to large group-sizes, melon-headed whales were the most abundant (0.34 animals km-1) followed by Fraser's dolphins and short-finned pilot whales. Range state records were confirmed for melon-headed whale and Fraser's dolphin in Ivoirian waters and ten further species represented first at-sea sightings. The artisanal fishing canoe was most abundant (92% of all vessels) and recorded up to 99.5 km from the Ghanaian coast. Asian trawlers operated over shelf areas and tuna purse-seine vessels in deep oceanic and slope waters. Fraser's dolphins, melon-headed whales, pantropical spotted dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and pilot whales were recorded in areas with the highest fishing densities. Melon-headed whales, pilot whales, and rough-toothed dolphins were observed in vicinity of trawlers; bottlenose dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, and pilot whales in vicinity of canoes. Some notable differences were found in the species composition between the present surveys and port-based surveys of landed cetaceans (bycatch/direct-captures). These may be explained by (1) feeding strategies (nocturnal vs. diurnal; surface vs. deep water); (2) different attractions to vessels/fishing gear; (3) variable body sizes; and (4) difficulty to positively identify species. Despite these differences, both cetaceans and fishing vessels predominantly occurred in shelf and slope waters (&lt; 1000 m depth contour), making fishery-related mortality likely. The poor knowledge on population trends of cetaceans in this unique upwelling region, together with a high demand for cetacean products for human consumption (as ""marine bushmeat"") may lead to a potential decline of some species that may go unnoticed. These new insights can provide a foundation for the urgently required risk assessments of cetacean mortality in fisheries within the northern Gulf of Guinea. ¬© 2016 de Boer, Saulino, Van Waerebeek and Aarts.",10.3389/fmars.2016.00178,2-s2.0-85008627056,285,0.798760164041183,1,und press cetac and fishery co occur off the coast of ghan and c√¥te d ivoir gulf of guine within the gulf of guine high level of fishery rel cetac mort bycatch and direct capt has been docu for loc rar specy such remov could pot lead to sign pop level effect howev inform on the cetac abund and distribut is scarc simil it remain larg unreport wher fish fleet op offsh a cetac survey took plac dur geophys survey along the coast of ghan and c√¥te d ivoir thi provid a un opportun to study both offsh cetac and fish commun due to larg group siz melon head whal wer the most abund anim km follow by fras s dolphin and short fin pilot whal rang stat record wer confirm for melon head whal and fras s dolphin in ivoir wat and ten furth specy repres first at sea sight the art fish cano was most abund of al vessel and record up to km from the ghana coast as trawl op ov shelf area and tun purs sein vessel in deep oc and slop wat fras s dolphin melon head whal pantrop spot dolphin bottlenos dolphin and pilot whal wer record in area with the highest fish dens melon head whal pilot whal and rough tooth dolphin wer observ in vicin of trawl bottlenos dolphin pantrop spot dolphin and pilot whal in vicin of cano som not diff wer found in the specy composit between the pres survey and port bas survey of land cetac bycatch direct capt thes may be explain by fee strategies nocturn vs diurn surfac vs deep wat diff attract to vessel fish gear vary body siz and difficul to posit ident specy despit thes diff both cetac and fish vessel predomin occur in shelf and slop wat lt m dep conto mak fishery rel mort lik the poor knowledg on pop trend of cetac in thi un upwel reg togeth with a high demand for cetac produc for hum consum as marin bushm may lead to a pot declin of som specy that may go unnot thes new insight can provid a found for the urg requir risk assess of cetac mort in fishery within the northern gulf of guine,new,0.8218662781660843,0.7750129914008085,0.7388723815181093,0.7105365930071026,0.6876590874608592,0.6687210107736522,0.6527579756249778,0.6391576537254013,0.6275455810174408,0.6177729989798937,0.6100212645362564
3841,fish_oceanic,Surveying the distribution and abundance of flying fshes and other epipelagics in the northern Gulf of Mexico using airborne lidar,"Flying fshes (family Exocoetidae) are important components of epipelagic ecosystems and are targeted by fshing feets in the Caribbean Sea and elsewhere. However, owing to their anti-predator behavior and habitats, their ecology, abundance, and distributions are only partially known. From September 20 to October 6, 2011, we conducted a series of surveys over a large area (approximately 75,000 km2) of the northern Gulf of Mexico (87¬∞W-90.5¬∞W, 28¬∞N-30¬∞N). Te surveys used an airborne lidar and vessel-based sampling, supported by near real time satellite observations of oceanic conditions. Te aerial survey was conducted from a fxed wing aircraft that few repeated surveys day and night, enabling data collection that was both broad-scale and synoptic. Vessel-based sampling included quantitative visual observations, trawl sampling, and qualitative dip-netting for species identifcations. Te combined surveys identifed large aggregations of epipelagic organisms dominated by flying fshes. Large numbers of jellyfsh (Aurelia sp.) and low numbers of numerous other species were also observed. Te putative flying fsh aggregations had an average length scale of 6.1 km and an average population estimated at 10,000 individuals. While always near the surface, flying fsh aggregations were slightly deeper at night than during the day and found most often off the continental shelf in warm water with low chlorophyll concentrations. At least three species were present: Hirundichthys rondeletii (Valenciennes, 1847), Cheilopogon melanurus (Valenciennes, 1847), and Prognichthys occidentalis Parin, 1999. Tis combination of aerial and surface surveys aforded repeated synoptic, ground-truthed data collection over a large area and indicates that this method could be useful for surveying such mobile epipelagic fshes. ¬© 2017 Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.",10.5343/bms.2016.1039,2-s2.0-85018443852,24,0.660634904033744,0,survey the distribut and abund of fly fshes and oth epipel in the northern gulf of mexico us airborn lid fly fshes famy exocoetida ar import compon of epipel ecosystem and ar target by fshing feet in the carib sea and elsewh howev ow to their ant pred behavy and habit their ecolog abund and distribut ar on part known from septemb to octob we conduc a sery of survey ov a larg are approxim km of the northern gulf of mexico ¬∞w ¬∞w ¬∞n ¬∞n te survey us an airborn lid and vessel bas sampl support by near real tim satellit observ of oc condit te aer survey was conduc from a fxed wing aircraft that few rep survey day and night en dat collect that was both broad scal and synopt vessel bas sampl includ quantit vis observ trawl sampl and qualit dip net for specy identifc te combin survey id larg aggreg of epipel org domin by fly fshes larg numb of jellyfsh aurel sp and low numb of num oth specy wer also observ te put fly fsh aggreg had an av leng scal of km and an av pop estim at individ whil alway near the surfac fly fsh aggreg wer slight deep at night than dur the day and found most oft off the contin shelf in warm wat with low chlorophyll cont at least three specy wer pres hirundichthy rondeleti valencien cheilopogon melanur valencien and prognichthy occid parin tis combin of aer and surfac survey aford rep synopt ground truth dat collect ov a larg are and ind that thi method could be us for survey such mobl epipel fshes,new,0.6912011386475141,0.6217121787484267,0.573035848086101,0.5384343550727498,0.5132851728649336,0.4949178534539307,0.4818797822712587,0.4735416193304158,0.4700203568001919,0.472524657227691,0.4846339088367156
3851,fish_oceanic,Long-term trends in abundance of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) assessed by non-lethal capture rates in a coastal fishery,"Sea turtle populations underwent severe decline in historical times, mainly through harvesting eggs and adults on nesting beaches. With the reduction of this threat in many areas, coupled with other conservation actions, some populations have demonstrated encouraging recovery, although remaining below their previous levels and undergone additional modern threats such as incidental capture in fisheries and pollution. Trends in sea turtle populations have usually been assessed through monitoring of females or nests on nesting beaches. Here we present data from a 22-year monitoring period for a juvenile green sea turtle Chelonia mydas mixed-stock in southeastern Brazil that were incidentally captured in passive non-lethal pound nets. A total of 3639 green turtles were captured in 5323 fishing days.pound‚àí1 with mortality rate of 2%. Captures occurred in all months, but bycatch rates, excluding recapture events, were higher in September and October, probably due to the recruitment of turtles migrating from southern areas, as well as recruits from the oceanic zone. Capture rates increased by 9.2% per year in the period from 1995 to 2016, in line with increasing source populations, particularly the main source contributor at Ascension Island, but also Trindade Island (Brazil) and Aves Island (Venezuela). Mean Curved Carapace Length of green turtles was higher during austral summer/early autumn and decreased markedly in May, probably due to the small-sized individuals that recruited to the study site. We show that the incidental capture of sea turtles in non-lethal fisheries, such as Brazilian pound nets, could also provide data on trends of populations nesting in distant places, and can contribute to the assessment of population status of sea turtles within Regional Management Units throughout the Atlantic Ocean. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.008,2-s2.0-85018655985,5,0.920929568693568,1,long term trend in abund of green sea turtl chelon myda assess by non leth capt rat in a coast fishery sea turtl pop underw sev declin in hist tim main through harvest eg and adult on nest beach with the reduc of thi threat in many area coupl with oth conserv act som pop hav demonst enco recovery although remain below their prevy level and undergon addit modern threats such as incid capt in fishery and pollut trend in sea turtl pop hav us been assess through monit of fem or nest on nest beach her we pres dat from a year monit period for a juvenil green sea turtl chelon myda mix stock in southeastern brazil that wer incid capt in pass non leth pound net a tot of green turtl wer capt in fish day pound‚àí with mort rat of capt occur in al month but bycatch rat exclud recapt ev wer high in septemb and octob prob due to the recruit of turtl migr from southern area as wel as recruit from the oc zon capt rat increas by per year in the period from to in lin with increas sourc pop particul the main sourc contribut at ascend island but also trindad island brazil and av island venezuel mean curv carapac leng of green turtl was high dur aust sum ear autumn and decreas mark in may prob due to the smal siz individ that recruit to the study sit we show that the incid capt of sea turtl in non leth fishery such as brazil pound net could also provid dat on trend of pop nest in dist plac and can contribut to the assess of pop stat of sea turtl within reg man unit throughout the atl oc,new,0.933124214435479,0.9223849312314842,0.9140716157959644,0.9072683646109218,0.9013600621234578,0.8959417366135713,0.8907051122143999,0.8853535054155129,0.8795120270482435,0.8725462485330658,0.863144363636094
395,fish_oceanic,"Environmental modeling of occurrence of dolphinfish (Coryphaena spp.) in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico reveals seasonality in abundance, hot spots and migration patterns","Dolphinfish are little known migratory fish targeted by sport, artisanal and commercial fleets. In this study, we analyzed a 10¬†year database of incidental catches of the tuna purse seine fleet in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico with the aim to understand the environmental determinants of the spatial distribution and seasonal migration patterns of dolphinfish. We modeled the probability of occurrence of dolphinfish as a function of spatial (geographical coordinates), temporal (month/year) and environmental variables (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll [CHL] and sea surface height [SSH], inferred from satellites) using logistic Generalized Additive Models. Dolphinfish preferred waters with SST values from 23 to 28¬∞C, low (&lt;0.2¬†mg/m3) CHL values, and primarily positive SSH values. Two dolphinfish hot spots were found in the study area: one in an oceanic zone (10¬∞‚Äì15¬∞N, 120¬∞‚Äì125¬∞W), which was more defined during spring, and one on the Pacific side of the Baja California Peninsula, which became important during summer. Models suggested that dolphinfish migrated through the study area following a ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù that ran from the Gulf of Tehuantepec along the Equatorial Upwelling zone to the oceanic hot spot zone, which in turn connected with the hot spot off the BCP.

4141,fish_oceanic,Relating abundance of purpleback flying squid Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis (Cephalopoda: Ommastrephidae) to environmental parameters using GIS and GAM in south-eastern Arabian Sea,"The distribution pattern of purpleback flying squid and the relationship between its abundance and environmental variables in the south-eastern Arabian Sea were analysed using a geographical information system (GIS) and a generalised additive model (GAM). Highest abundances were observed during December and January within 10 and 13¬∞N and 71 and 72¬∞E around the Lakshadweep Islands. The mean abundance in the area was 4.21 tonnes/km2 and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated as 0.63 million tonnes. GAM indicated that very high squid abundance was associated with low values of dissolved oxygen (6.01‚Äì6.27¬†mg/L), sea surface temperature (28.03‚Äì28.62¬∞C), pH (7.75‚Äì8.56), salinity (30.42‚Äì34.48 psu), chlorophyll-a (0.4‚Äì0.6¬†mg/m3), zooplankton biomass (0.23‚Äì0.64¬†mL/m3), and shallow 20¬∞C isotherm (101.2‚Äì134.7¬†m) and mixed layer depth (17.8‚Äì29.8¬†m). As a carnivore from paralarval stages, S. oualaniensis depends on secondary and tertiary production to sustain its population for which primary production is used up. In the tropical Arabian Sea where temperature differences are not so pronounced, S. oualaniensis distribution was found to be related to a low but very narrow sea surface temperature¬†(SST) band.

140,mammal_antarctic,An assessment of Greenland walrus populations,"Recent abundance estimates were combined with historical catches and an age- and sex-structured population dynamic model to perform Bayesian assessments of the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) populations in West Greenland, the North Water in northern Baffin Bay, and East Greenland. The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

230,mammal_antarctic,"Abundance, distribution and status of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri","The abundance of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, was estimated using a model that incorporated estimated pup production. Pups are born at only five sites, four of which are at the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, which lie to the south of New Zealand. The remaining breeding site is at Campbell Island in the same region. Pup production was estimated during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons from mark-recapture studies at the two largest sea lion rookeries, at the Auckland Islands (Sandy Bay and Dundas Island), which account for almost 90% of total pup production for the species. Pup production for the other sites was estimated from direct counts or, in the case of Campbell Island, from recent tagging data. Total pup production estimates for all sites during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons are 2640 and 2807 respectively. During the four-week pupping season, pup mortality at most sites was estimated to be about 10%. The estimates of absolute abundance based on pup production for the two breeding seasons were 11 700 (95% confidence interval (CI): 10500-13100) and 12500 (95% CI: 11100-14000) respectively. This population abundance is among the smallest reported for a species within the Otariidae.

324,mammal_antarctic,The importance of the Patagonian Shelf for top predator species breeding at South Georgia,"1. The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals. These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf. 2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the east to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle. 3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species. 4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered. 5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators. ¬© 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/aqc.480,2-s2.0-0036117415,49,0.801142872,0,the import of the patagon shelf for top pred specy bree at sou georg the rich zooplankton fish and squid resourc on the patagon shelf sustain subst pop of larg resid seabird and marin mam thes habit ar also visit season by simil specy from elsewh but few dat ex on their stat and origin rec study us satellit track to determin for rang and fee area of seabird and marin mam bree at sou georg hav shown that sev specy mak subst us of the wat of the patagon shelf wand albatross us shelf edg area year round with direct observ of both sex of almost al ag class includ bree pre bree and non bree individ whit chin petrel and fem northern and southern giant petrel main visit dur incub and post bree particul to the falkland cur whit chin petrel and to upwel area around the southern shelf break from the burdwood bank in the east to stat island and diego ramirez in the west giant petrel northern giant petrel mal dur incub and antarct fur seal in wint reach in shelf habit in the northern sect in contrast sou georg pop of black brow and grey head albatross do not appear to us the patagon shelf at any stag of their bree cyc although the us of the patagon shelf by visit specy is now best docu for sou georg specy rec observ dat confirm that seabird from diego ramirez trist da cunh and gough visit the southern and northern sect dur both bree and non bree season respect sev antarct specy not antarct fulm and cap petrel wint in the reg as do at least two albatross specy from new zealand oth specy espec wilson s storm petrel us it as a stag ground on migr as do sev specy of baleen whal and poss oth cetac specy three of the seabird specy which bree on the patagon shelf ar glob threatened sev of the visit specy and four baleen whal specy also hav thi stat the patagon shelf is theref not on of glob import for the divers and abund of it resid top pred but is just as crit for the surv of many visit specy som of which ar ev mor endang combin dat from satellit track with conv map from direct observ off the prospect of defin the for rang and the main fee area within thes of a rang of key top pred specy such dat should be us in conjunct with simil inform of the distribut of fish squid and zooplankton resourc and of fish effort to ident crit marin habit whos precaut multipl us sustain man wil be vit to protect the interest of both commerc fish and top pred,new,0.8854327946460241,0.825246855935549,0.7695878741309237,0.7202921442649032,0.676639494701403,0.6374158501096701,0.6014199708031084,0.5674809453088672,0.5342823559122842,0.4999274801937499,0.4608353688817845
417,mammal_antarctic,Re-constructing historical Ad√©lie penguin abundance estimates by retrospectively accounting for detection bias,"Seabirds and other land-breeding marine predators are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because of their dependence on marine prey and the accessibility of their populations at breeding colonies. Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Ad√©lie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Ad√©lie penguin population change. Our approach is applicable to abundance data for a wide range of colonial, land-breeding marine species including other penguin species, flying seabirds and marine mammals. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0123540,2-s2.0-84929379144,2,0.800014998,1,re construct hist ad√©lie penguin abund estim by retrospect account for detect bia seabird and oth land bree marin pred ar consid to be us and pract ind of the stat of marin ecosystem becaus of their depend on marin prey and the access of their pop at bree colony hist count of bree pop of thes high ord marin pred ar on of few dat sourc avail for infer past chang in marin ecosystem howev hist abund estim der from thes pop count may be subject to unrecogn bia and uncertainty becaus of vary attend of bird at bree colony and vary tim of past pop survey we retrospect account for detect bia in hist abund estim of the colon land bree ad√©lie penguin through an analys of hist abund estim from bree sit in east antarctic the publ abund estim wer de construct to retriev the raw count dat and then re construct by apply contemp adjust fact obtain from remot op tim laps camera the re construct process incorp spat and temp vary in phenolog and attend by us dat from camera deploy at multipl sit ov multipl year and prop thi uncertainty through to the fin rev abund estim our re construct abund estim wer consist high and mor uncertain than publ estim the re construct estim alt the conclud reach for som sit in east antarctic in rec assess of long term ad√©lie penguin pop chang our approach is appl to abund dat for a wid rang of colon land bree marin specy includ oth penguin specy fly seabird and marin mam,new,0.8491117694192167,0.7738483094331122,0.7059868926665654,0.6479173745154905,0.5985908633960397,0.5563100719972954,0.5195110343110007,0.4868685805198956,0.45719795148102776,0.42922162036589023,0.4010358314503944
515,mammal_antarctic,"Population size and migratory connectivity of humpback whales wintering in Las Perlas Archipelago, Panama","From 2003 to 2009, we surveyed Las Perlas Archipelago off the Pacific coast of Panama 53 times between the months of August and October to estimate abundance of humpback whales and to test for a migratory connection with populations from the southern hemisphere. We identified 295 individuals using photo-identification of dorsal fins, including 58 calves, and the population estimate for a single season was 100-300 solitary adults plus 25-50 mothers with calves; the estimated population of animals across all seasons using a mark and recapture model was over 1,000. Eight of the 139 fluke identifications were matched to whales in photograph catalogues from the Antarctic Peninsula and a ninth was matched to a whale sighted in Chilean waters; four of these nine individuals have also been sighted in Colombia. We conclude that Panama (Las Perlas Archipelago in particular) is an important calving area for humpback whales in the Southern Hemisphere. These data should provide a foundation for monitoring of population change and to increase awareness in Panama about the need to manage vessel traffic and tourism related to the whales at Las Perlas. ¬© 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy.",10.1111/mms.12136,2-s2.0-84919624930,28,0.7998419859999999,1,pop siz and migr connect of humpback whal wint in las perla archipelago panam from to we survey las perla archipelago off the pac coast of panam tim between the month of august and octob to estim abund of humpback whal and to test for a migr connect with pop from the southern hemisph we ident individ us photo id of dors fin includ calv and the pop estim for a singl season was solit adult plu moth with calv the estim pop of anim across al season us a mark and recapt model was ov eight of the fluk id wer match to whal in photograph catalog from the antarct peninsul and a nin was match to a whal sight in chil wat four of thes nin individ hav also been sight in colomb we conclud that panam las perla archipelago in particul is an import calv are for humpback whal in the southern hemisph thes dat should provid a found for monit of pop chang and to increas aw in panam about the nee to man vessel traff and tour rel to the whal at las perla,new,0.8401044927753276,0.8018544379494784,0.7722044042152758,0.749115361134339,0.7308161282338903,0.7161352364382585,0.7043645603169899,0.6951481806712622,0.6884744889159173,0.6848439538021102,0.6858918333028258
614,mammal_antarctic,Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) post breeding dispersal and southward migration in the western Indian Ocean,"Investigating movement patterns of marine migratory species is critical to understand habitat use and population structure, and help inform conservation and management planning. Little is known about humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) dispersal and migration in the western Indian Ocean. In October 2011 and 2012, eleven satellite transmitters were deployed on wintering humpback whales from the south-western Indian Ocean breeding stock at the Comoros islands (Moh√©li, n = 6 and Mayotte, n = 5). Eight individuals were successfully tracked for 24.3 ¬± 12.4. days (range = 8-49. days) and travelled between 146. km and 5804. km in total. Whales either remained at their wintering site for several weeks (n = 3) or dispersed along the west coast (n = 4) or east (n = 1) coast of Madagascar where two main stop-over sites were identified. In addition, two individuals travelled along straight paths to distant, potential, foraging areas. One whale reached the French sub-Antarctic islands while the other travelled to one of the supposed Antarctic foraging areas for humpback whales of this breeding stock. This is the first time movements of humpback whales from this area are being described and their potential foraging areas in the Southern Ocean identified. Identification of these dispersal patterns is important for delineation of breeding regions and for allocating abundance estimates to stocks. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jembe.2013.10.014,2-s2.0-84889606621,34,0.792272905,0,humpback whal megapter novaeanglia post bree dispers and southward migr in the western ind oc investig mov pattern of marin migr specy is crit to understand habit us and pop structure and help inform conserv and man plan littl is known about humpback whal megapter novaeanglia dispers and migr in the western ind oc in octob and elev satellit transmit wer deploy on wint humpback whal from the sou western ind oc bree stock at the comoro island moh√©li n and mayot n eight individ wer success track for ¬± day rang day and travel between km and km in tot whal eith remain at their wint sit for sev week n or dispers along the west coast n or east n coast of madagasc wher two main stop ov sit wer ident in addit two individ travel along straight path to dist pot for area on whal reach the french sub antarct island whil the oth travel to on of the suppos antarct for area for humpback whal of thi bree stock thi is the first tim mov of humpback whal from thi are ar being describ and their pot for area in the southern oc ident id of thes dispers pattern is import for delin of bree reg and for alloc abund estim to stock,new,0.8429270732005498,0.7809296212992829,0.7282037045325455,0.684437191807158,0.6477749711267846,0.6165264868998872,0.5894000101894916,0.5654274000792798,0.5438557473228628,0.5240462324215405,0.5053859549072238

The size of the breeding population on the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, New Zealand, is unknown. Disappointment Island is thought to be the main white-chinned petrel breeding site in the Auckland Islands, and maybe also in the New Zealand region, and has never had introduced mammalian predators. We estimated the white-chinned petrel breeding population size taking into account the detection probability of burrows via distance sampling and the burrow occupancy rate. Eighty line transects were distributed over the island, with a total line length of 1600¬†m. Burrows were patchily distributed and most abundant in dense megaherb communities. White-chinned petrel burrow density D^ was 654 burrows/ha (95¬†% CI 528‚Äì809 burrows/ha), with burrow detection probability p^ varying among vegetation communities from 0.28¬†¬±¬†0.02 to 0.43¬†¬±¬†0.02 (¬±SE).

812,mammal_antarctic,Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) Reproductive Success is Influenced by Krill (Euphausia superba) Density and Climate,"The reproductive success of southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) depends on body condition and, therefore, on foraging success. This, in turn, might be affected by climatically driven change in the abundance of the species main prey, krill (Euphausia superba), on the feeding grounds. Annual data on southern right whale number of calves were obtained from aerial surveys carried out between 1997 and 2013 in southern Brazil, where the species concentrate during their breeding season. The number of calves recorded each year varied from 7 to 43 (= 21.11 ¬± 11.88). Using cross-correlation analysis we examined the response of the species to climate anomalies and krill densities. Significant correlations were found with krill densities (r = 0.69, p = 0.002, lag 0 years), Oceanic Ni√±o Index (r = '0.65, p = 0.03, lag 6 years), Antarctic Oscillation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01, lag 7 years) and Antarctic sea ice area (r = '0.68, p = 0.002, lag 0 years). Our results suggest that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success in southern Brazil by determining variation in food (krill) availability for the species. Therefore, increased frequency of years with reduced krill abundance, due to global warming, is likely to reduce the current rate of recovery of southern right whales from historical overexploitation.",10.1038/srep28205,2-s2.0-84975045802,43,0.7751467409999999,0,southern right whal eubalaen aust reproduc success is influ by kril euphaus superb dens and clim the reproduc success of southern right whal eubalaen aust depend on body condit and theref on for success thi in turn might be affect by clim driv chang in the abund of the specy main prey kril euphaus superb on the fee ground an dat on southern right whal numb of calv wer obtain from aer survey carry out between and in southern brazil wher the specy cont dur their bree season the numb of calv record each year vary from to ¬± us cross correl analys we examin the respons of the specy to clim anoma and kril dens sign correl wer found with kril dens r p lag year oc ni√±o index r p lag year antarct oscil r p lag year and antarct sea ic are r p lag year our result suggest that glob clim ind influ southern right whal bree success in southern brazil by determin vary in food kril avail for the specy theref increas frequ of year with reduc kril abund due to glob warm is lik to reduc the cur rat of recovery of southern right whal from hist overexploit,new,0.8053520439089648,0.7341402405676951,0.6784443460177494,0.6350403834366164,0.6003680754453146,0.5719651393907003,0.5482121959375792,0.5280230476450184,0.5106373001770402,0.4954699206701421,0.48194558188395437
910,mammal_antarctic,Winter dispersal of leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx): Environmental factors influencing demographics and seasonal abundance,"The dynamics of leopard seal Hydrurga leptonyx abundance and residency were investigated both within and between years at Bird Island, South Georgia, using observations of tagged and untagged individuals. Seals belonged to an open population, and were sampled outside the breeding season and during their northward winter dispersal (April-October). Seals at Bird Island were highly transient (41-63%) with only a limited number of individuals making repeat visits across years. A minimum yearly survival for resident seals was estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.85. The physical environment played an important role in leopard seal abundance, with observations following an apparent 4-year periodicity consistent with the frequency and timing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. Years of low sea-surface temperature (SST) and extensive pack-ice corresponded to a higher number of seals present, earlier arrivals, and longer periods of residency. Peak leopard seal arrivals at Bird Island corresponded to periods of low SST, which was consistent with the pagophilic nature of this species.",10.1017/S0952836904005102,2-s2.0-3142639196,10,0.772810535,1,wint dispers of leopard seal hydrurg leptonyx environ fact influ demograph and season abund the dynam of leopard seal hydrurg leptonyx abund and resid wer investig both within and between year at bird island sou georg us observ of tag and untag individ seal belong to an op pop and wer sampl outsid the bree season and dur their northward wint dispers april octob seal at bird island wer high transy with on a limit numb of individ mak rep visit across year a minim year surv for resid seal was estim to be between and the phys environ play an import rol in leopard seal abund with observ follow an app year period consist with the frequ and tim of the antarct circumpol wav year of low sea surfac temp sst and extend pack ic correspond to a high numb of seal pres ear ar and long period of resid peak leopard seal ar at bird island correspond to period of low sst which was consist with the pagophil nat of thi specy,new,0.8295875735328033,0.7739437143007173,0.7280993189310854,0.6907863886509793,0.6600731128690621,0.6344282070010199,0.6127700798942863,0.5943720414393319,0.5787983321332764,0.5659212156204042,0.5561437239768343
1010,mammal_antarctic,"Age-specific survival, abundance, and immigration rates of a Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) population in McMurdo Sound, Antartica","Since the 1960s, Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii (Lesson, 1826)) have been tagged and surveyed annually in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Mark-recapture analyses and model selection trials using Akaike's Information Criterion indicate that sex, cohort, and year affect juvenile (ages 1 and 2) survival. In contrast, year and perhaps sex and cohort are less important factors for adult survival. Average annual survival is higher among adults (0.93) than juveniles (0.55-0.59) and there is little evidence for senescence to at least age 17. The oldest known-aged female and male in the study were 27 and 24 years old, respectively. Data suggest that the abundance of a resident population of Weddell seals remains relatively stable over time despite annual fluctuations in Jolly-Seber abundance estimates for the entire population. We argue that this annual variability is likely the result of temporary immigration of animals born outside the study area; mean rates are estimated from a simulation model and tagging data to be between 16.8% and 39.7% for females and between -13.1% and 31.6% for males. Sea ice extent appears to affect immigration where, during times of reduced fast-ice, immigrants are forced, or allowed easier access, into the ice-covered areas of Erebus Bay from surrounding locations. Our findings contradict previous studies reporting lower survival and higher immigration. Model choice is shown to be the most likely cause of these discrepancies and we provide evidence that our models are more appropriate than those used elsewhere.",10.1139/z04-025,2-s2.0-4043098396,3,0.7663318109999999,1,ag spec surv abund and immigr rat of a weddel seal leptonychot weddelli pop in mcmurdo sound antartic sint the s weddel seal leptonychot weddelli lesson hav been tag and survey an in mcmurdo sound antarctic mark recapt analys and model select tri us akaik s inform crit ind that sex cohort and year affect juvenil ag and surv in contrast year and perhap sex and cohort ar less import fact for adult surv av an surv is high among adult than juvenil and ther is littl evid for senesc to at least ag the oldest known ag fem and mal in the study wer and year old respect dat suggest that the abund of a resid pop of weddel seal remain rel stabl ov tim despit an fluctu in jol seb abund estim for the entir pop we argu that thi an vary is lik the result of temp immigr of anim born outsid the study are mean rat ar estim from a sim model and tag dat to be between and for fem and between and for mal sea ic ext appear to affect immigr wher dur tim of reduc fast ic immigr ar forc or allow easy access into the ic cov area of ereb bay from surround loc our find contradict prevy study report low surv and high immigr model cho is shown to be the most lik caus of thes discrep and we provid evid that our model ar mor appropry than thos us elsewh,new,0.7761162951531096,0.7381893992754677,0.7103102201469788,0.6895771713548081,0.6740927402977365,0.6627438428765291,0.6549519953019457,0.6505734964029325,0.6499642691598431,0.6543288461233445,0.6668196523034093
1114,mammal_antarctic,Shifting trends: Detecting environmentally mediated regulation in long-lived marine vertebrates using time-series data,"Assessing the status and trends in animal populations is essential for effective species conservation and management practices. However, unless time-series abundance data demonstrate rapid and reliable fluctuations, objective appraisal of directionality of trends is problematic. We adopted a multiple-working hypotheses approach based on information-theoretic and Bayesian multi-model inference to examine the population trends and form of intrinsic regulation demonstrated by a long-lived species, the southern elephant seal. We also determined the evidence for density dependence in 11 other well-studied marine mammal species. (1) We tested the type of population regulation for elephant seals from Marion Island (1986-2004) and from 11 other marine mammal species, and (2) we described the trends and behavior of the 19-year population time series at Marion Island to identify changes in population trends. We contrasted five plausible trend models using information-theoretic and Bayesian-inference estimates of model parsimony. Our analyses identified two distinct phases of population growth for this population with the inflexion occurring in 1998. Thus, the population decreased between 1986 and 1997 (-3.7% per annum) and increased between 1997 and 2004 (1.9% per annum). An index of environmental stochasticity, the Southern Oscillation Index, explained some of the variance in r and N. We determined analytically that there was good evidence for density dependence in the Marion Island population and that density dependence was widespread among marine mammal species (67% of species showed evidence for population regulation). This approach demonstrates the potential functionality of a relatively simple technique that can be applied to short time series to identify the type of regulation, and the uncertainty associated with the phenomenon, operating in populations of large mammals. ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00442-008-1205-9,2-s2.0-58549119004,30,0.765170487,1,shift trend detect environ medy reg in long liv marin vertebr us tim sery dat assess the stat and trend in anim pop is ess for effect specy conserv and man pract howev unless tim sery abund dat demonst rapid and rely fluctu object appra of direct of trend is problem we adopt a multipl work hypothes approach bas on inform theoret and bayes mult model inf to examin the pop trend and form of intrins reg demonst by a long liv specy the southern eleph seal we also determin the evid for dens depend in oth wel study marin mam specy we test the typ of pop reg for eleph seal from mar island and from oth marin mam specy and we describ the trend and behavy of the year pop tim sery at mar island to ident chang in pop trend we contrast fiv plaus trend model us inform theoret and bayes inf estim of model parsimony our analys ident two distinct phas of pop grow for thi pop with the inflect occur in thu the pop decreas between and per ann and increas between and per ann an index of environ stochast the southern oscil index explain som of the vary in r and n we determin analys that ther was good evid for dens depend in the mar island pop and that dens depend was widespread among marin mam specy of specy show evid for pop reg thi approach demonst the pot funct of a rel simpl techn that can be apply to short tim sery to ident the typ of reg and the uncertainty assocy with the phenomenon op in pop of larg mam,new,0.8106638502076239,0.7795746911459355,0.7573779547606978,0.7412954738731063,0.7294727680975782,0.7208405627716962,0.7148376297474743,0.7112729544471742,0.7103376666085112,0.7128425890079179,0.7210541738297342
1211,mammal_antarctic,"Distribution, density, and abundance of pack-ice seals in the Amundsen and Ross Seas, Antarctica","We made three sets of population surveys of the four species of ice-inhabiting phocid pinnipeds in the Ross and Amundsen Seas between 26 December 1999 and 24 March 2000 using icebreakers and helicopters deployed from those icebreakers. We used line transect methods to survey 23,671km by helicopter and 3,694km by ship accounting for a total coverage of 53,217km2. We detected and identified 11,308 seals in 7,104 groups and estimated their abundance from estimates of densities using distance sampling methods and corrections for probability of haul out of seals derived from satellite telemetry of tagged seals. Crabeater seals were most abundant (ca 1.7 million) followed by Weddell seals (330,000), Ross seals (22,600), and leopard seals (15,000). Our estimates of abundance are difficult to directly compare with earlier estimates because of geographic areas covered and by our improvements in survey and analytical methods. Notwithstanding these limitations and with some adjustments for differences in methods, we found that our estimates of abundance for crabeater seals are similar to those from the most recent surveys in the Ross and Amundsen Seas and along the George-Oates Coast. Our estimates for Weddell seals are the first for the broad areas of pack ice that we surveyed in the Ross and Amundsen Seas but indicate that these habitats are ecologically important to this species. Our estimates of abundance of Ross seals were relatively similar to estimates for surveys in these areas in the 1970s and 1980s whereas our estimates of abundance of leopard seals were substantially lower. ¬© 2010.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.10.037,2-s2.0-79954632387,5,0.7624028270000001,0,distribut dens and abund of pack ic seal in the amunds and ross sea antarctic we mad three set of pop survey of the four specy of ic inhabit phocid pinnip in the ross and amunds sea between decemb and march us icebreak and helicopt deploy from thos icebreak we us lin transect method to survey km by helicopt and km by ship account for a tot cov of km we detect and ident seal in group and estim their abund from estim of dens us dist sampl method and correct for prob of haul out of seal der from satellit telemetry of tag seal crab seal wer most abund ca mil follow by weddel seal ross seal and leopard seal our estim of abund ar difficult to direct comp with ear estim becaus of geograph area cov and by our improv in survey and analys method notwithstand thes limit and with som adjust for diff in method we found that our estim of abund for crab seal ar simil to thos from the most rec survey in the ross and amunds sea and along the georg oat coast our estim for weddel seal ar the first for the broad area of pack ic that we survey in the ross and amunds sea but ind that thes habit ar ecolog import to thi specy our estim of abund of ross seal wer rel simil to estim for survey in thes area in the s and s wherea our estim of abund of leopard seal wer subst low,new,0.8038126468737202,0.7247774496915256,0.6598999217345757,0.6075918362356433,0.5647858140139962,0.529010040957337,0.4984891621540623,0.4719511834832445,0.44844954064466425,0.4272221573410996,0.407570798782453

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.",10.1017/S0030605308099997,2-s2.0-67349234507,47,0.7618189879999999,0,invas am mink mustel vison in wetland of the cap horn biosph reserv southern chil what ar they eat the impact of aly am mink on the nat faun of oc island has been demonst in a numb of loc in the sub antarct cap horn biosph reserv of southern chil the specy is cur expand in an are wher the nat faun evolv in the abs of terrest pred to evalu any emerg problem we theref investig season vary in prey us by mink on navarino island within the reserv we ident undigest remain in scat collect from the shor of pond ov januarynovemb diet consist main of mam and bird mam includ both nat and exot rod wer the predomin prey in al season but bird wer of eq import dur the sum when bird bree and their abund and divers increas on the island exot rod wer the on ident mam prey item dur wint nat wetland bird constitut a subst proport of mink diet and gre than that report in oth area many bird bree on navarino island ar ground nest a strategy that evolv in the abs of nat mam pred consid the intern import of thi reg our result emphas the nee for an assess of the impact of mink pred on the pop of nat prey,new,0.8255260635244983,0.7555303120206242,0.696492069722481,0.6478117106123075,0.607224063600313,0.5727299350431295,0.5428120688625278,0.5163169285473715,0.4922972333148426,0.4698287541618904,0.4477208431199885

1513,mammal_antarctic,"Cetacean occurrence patterns in the Amundsen and southern Bellingshausen sea sector, southern ocean","We conducted 239.5 h and 3,494 km of cetacean surveys in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas, from 15 February to 31 March 1994; most of the area, the large portion of which was ice covered, had never before nor has it since been surveyed for cetaceans, even to the date when this paper was prepared (2006). Logistic regression and an information-theoretic approach related the occurrence of Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis (the most abundant species) to whether we were in open- or pack-ice-covered pelagic or neritic waters, in or out of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and north or south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current southern boundary. Other variables included date and distance to the MIZ and shelfbreak front. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of sighting a minke, as well as killer whale - but not the case for an index to whale density - was related to the proximity of coastal polynyas in early autumn, switching offshore to the MIZ once waters within the pack began to freeze persistently later in the season. Probability of detection was higher with distance into the MIZ. Supporting these findings, the density index was strongly related to ice concentration in an inverse relationship. The strong relationship to polynyas and the MIZ indicate that sea-ice divergence altered by decadal or longer-term climate change, as described in the recent literature, could well affect any apparent, long-term trends evident in this species' abundance if surveyed only in open or near-to-ice waters. We speculate on how the minke whale's pagophilic nature (1) could have been encouraged by large-scale industrial whaling and by competition with species more characteristic of open waters and the outer MIZ, and (2) may have protected the population somewhat during industrial whaling resulting in the much greater abundance of this species now compared to other targeted species. ¬© 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.",10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.00109.x,2-s2.0-33947621183,29,0.7589295229999999,0,cetac occur pattern in the amunds and southern bellingshaus sea sect southern oc we conduc h and km of cetac survey in the amunds and bellingshaus sea from febru to march most of the are the larg port of which was ic cov had nev bef nor has it sint been survey for cetac ev to the dat when thi pap was prep log regress and an inform theoret approach rel the occur of antarct mink whal balaenopter bonaerens the most abund specy to wheth we wer in op or pack ic cov pel or nerit wat in or out of the margin ic zon miz and nor or sou of the antarct circumpol cur southern bound oth vary includ dat and dist to the miz and shelfbreak front stat analys show that the prob of sight a mink as wel as kil whal but not the cas for an index to whal dens was rel to the proxim of coast polynya in ear autumn switch offsh to the miz ont wat within the pack beg to freez persist lat in the season prob of detect was high with dist into the miz support thes find the dens index was strongly rel to ic cont in an invers rel the strong rel to polynya and the miz ind that sea ic diverg alt by decad or long term clim chang as describ in the rec lit could wel affect any app long term trend evid in thi specy abund if survey on in op or near to ic wat we spec on how the mink whal s pagophil nat could hav been enco by larg scal indust whal and by competit with specy mor charact of op wat and the out miz and may hav protect the pop somewh dur indust whal result in the much gre abund of thi specy now comp to oth target specy,new,0.8063148556728019,0.7483198881823456,0.703756630006492,0.6691349192945927,0.6414632956170941,0.6187824705863296,0.5998392257137831,0.5838189382049899,0.5701882780848136,0.5586086394906945,0.5489078277223565

Discussion of all sea‚Äêice habitats from all sightings of Ross seals from the 1996/97 summer is presented here, along with opportunistic sightings of Ross seals from the same icebreaker in December 1992‚ÄêJanuary 1993 and in 1997/98 along the coastline from about 57¬∞E to 100¬∞E. An unusually large concentration of Ross seals was observed during an 8 h period near Gaussberg (66¬∞ 13‚Ä≤S, 89¬∞35‚Ä≤E) on 7 January 1993, when a minimum of 40 Ross seals were counted. A search for an emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri colony was made in November ‚Äê December 1997 in the area of the West Ice Shelf, where a colony at Pingvin Island was discovered in 1956 and last seen in 1960. The original population of 30 000 birds was not found, but a smaller subcolony of about 200 breeding pairs (estimated) was found, perhaps a remnant of the original colony which was forced to re‚Äêlocate because of a major breakup of West Ice Shelf in 1968. ¬© 2000 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/03014223.2000.9518219,2-s2.0-0033884750,32,0.758892454,0,not on antarct wildl ross seal ommatophoc rossi and emp penguin aptenodyt forster system observ on bird and mam wer carry out in the aust sum in antarctic whil on a circumnavig of the entir contin by the russ icebreak kapit khlebnikov a tot of ross seal ommatophoc rossi wer record dur the period decemb ‚äì janu of that day cru with of them found in light to heavy pack ic condit the highest abund was in the riiser‚äêlarsen sea between ¬∞e and ¬∞e longitud half of the seal wer observ ov the shelf zon whil oth wer ov contin slop to deep oc discuss of al sea‚äêice habit from al sight of ross seal from the sum is pres her along with opportun sight of ross seal from the sam icebreak in decemb ‚äêjanuary and in along the coastlin from about ¬∞e to ¬∞e an unus larg cont of ross seal was observ dur an h period near gaussberg ¬∞ ‚ä≤s ¬∞‚ä≤e on janu when a minim of ross seal wer count a search for an emp penguin aptenodyt forster colony was mad in novemb ‚äê decemb in the are of the west ic shelf wher a colony at pingvin island was discov in and last seen in the origin pop of bird was not found but a smal subcolony of about bree pair estim was found perhap a remn of the origin colony which was forc to re‚äêlocat becaus of a maj breakup of west ic shelf in,new,0.8027901757844624,0.7428074539562949,0.695721671697393,0.6588514821073196,0.6294543241185904,0.6056368340423623,0.5862031723851943,0.5704716837570073,0.558213081228002,0.5497899574162262,0.5467454563576737
1710,mammal_antarctic,The Marine Mammal Programme at the Prince Edward Islands: 38 years of research,"The Marine Mammal Programme (MMP) conducts research on pinnipeds and killer whales Orcinus orca at Marion Island, Prince Edward Islands, under the auspices of the Mammal Research Institute, Department of Zoology and Entomology, University of Pretoria. The history of the MMP, which has benefited from collaboration with leading national and international researchers, is described from its start through to current research. The setting up of long-term studies such as the mark-resighting of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina commenced in 1983. The elephant seal population declined by 87% between an initial census in 1951 and 2004. This was followed by a stabilisation period and a current increase. The recovery, and subsequent increase of sympatric populations of Subantarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis and Antarctic fur seals A. gazella (following cessation of commercial sealing), are documented. Insights into many aspects of elephant seal and fur seal biology, including life history, demography, diet, growth, foraging and ranging behaviour are described. Ancillary work on morphology, genetics, anthropogenic influences and rare events are mentioned, as well as the extent of current research that addresses population dynamics in an ecosystem context. Opportunistic photographic identification of killer whales and recent dedicated observations at Marion Island are used to determine population size, seasonal abundance and sociality of this population, and to further understanding of its potential impact on resident pinniped populations. ¬© 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",10.2989/1814232X.2011.637356,2-s2.0-84856097075,12,0.7557609240000001,1,the marin mam program at the print edward island year of research the marin mam program mmp conduc research on pinnip and kil whal orcin orc at mar island print edward island und the ausp of the mam research institut depart of zoolog and entomolog univers of pretor the hist of the mmp which has benefit from collab with lead nat and intern research is describ from it start through to cur research the set up of long term study such as the mark resight of southern eleph seal miroung leonin com in the eleph seal pop declin by between an init cens in and thi was follow by a stabl period and a cur increas the recovery and subsequ increas of symp pop of subantarct fur seal arctocephal trop and antarct fur seal a gazell follow cess of commerc seal ar docu insight into many aspect of eleph seal and fur seal biolog includ lif hist demograph diet grow for and rang behavio ar describ ancil work on morpholog genet anthropog influ and rar ev ar ment as wel as the ext of cur research that address pop dynam in an ecosystem context opportun photograph id of kil whal and rec ded observ at mar island ar us to determin pop siz season abund and soc of thi pop and to furth understand of it pot impact on resid pinnip pop,new,0.7809145781687632,0.7432216624988849,0.7155483175696401,0.6951207678807326,0.67995903261918,0.6688917649445991,0.6613247222153178,0.657131851382233,0.6567222583925266,0.6614327797428982,0.6747814953973847
1810,mammal_antarctic,"Past and present distribution, densities and movements of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean","1. Blue whale locations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean were obtained from catches (303239), sightings (4383 records of ‚â•8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries (95), and acoustic recordings. 2. Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14676 days with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales (65.2%) or pairs (24.6%); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest in the waters of Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar. 3. Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering. 4. Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic ('true') subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic. 5. Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales. 6. South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and highsighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics, acoustics and length frequencies. 7. Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95% Bayesian interval 860-2900) in 1996 (less than 1% of original levels), but are increasing at 7.3% per annum (95% Bayesian interval 1.4-11.6%). The status of other populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue whales. ¬© 2007 The Authors.

1910,mammal_antarctic,Dynamic intra-seasonal habitat use by Antarctic fur seals suggests migratory hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula,"Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) are major secondary consumers in the Southern Ocean, placing them in potential competition with commercial fisheries and requiring research to understand their seasonal habitat use. Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km2) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with the autumn-winter krill fishery. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00227-013-2190-z,2-s2.0-84878173678,14,0.7454512240000001,0,dynam intr season habit us by antarct fur seal suggest migr hotspot near the antarct peninsul antarct fur seal arctocephal gazell ar maj second consum in the southern oc plac them in pot competit with commerc fishery and requir research to understand their season habit us us the dat obtain dur shipboard survey sampl on a fix grid k km dur mid to lat sum i quant the spat distribut and intr season vary of fur seal sight rel to dist to land and hydrograph bound i test the hypothes that fur seal display an increas in their at sea abund dur mid to lat sum near the antarct peninsul as they prep to tak up wint ground i also test wheth abund of their pot prey kril and myctophid exhibit intr season vary dur midsum high abund area ar loc near maj bree colony howev dur lat sum ther is an ord of magnitud increas in fur seal abund coincid with an increas in the numb of high abund area loc in bransfield strait coincid abund of euphaus superb decreas and the myctophid electron antarctic increas between mid and lat sum survey high abund area of fur seal ar not assocy with the southern antarct circumpol cur front but ar cont within km from land pot ind the loc of haul out and import coast habit us area the dynam increas in the numb and loc of high abund area dur lat sum repres a consid amount of mam pred ent the antarct peninsul marin ecosystem thi inform is import for understand the season impact of fur seal on reg marin food web and their pot interact with the autumn wint kril fishery,new,0.8075446952395926,0.7203643469059366,0.6490543841788071,0.5923238378441086,0.5465286966129549,0.5087112041042251,0.4767720122037201,0.44922296355631774,0.42495254293299917,0.4030239113552341,0.3824321290918547
2010,mammal_antarctic,Modelling predation by transient leopard seals for an ecosystem-based management of Southern Ocean fisheries,"Correctly quantifying the impacts of rare apex marine predators is essential to ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, where harvesting must be sustainable for targeted species and their dependent predators. This requires modelling the uncertainty in such processes as predator life history, seasonal abundance and movement, size-based predation, energetic requirements, and prey vulnerability. We combined these uncertainties to evaluate the predatory impact of transient leopard seals on a community of mesopredators (seals and penguins) and their prey at South Georgia, and assess the implications for an ecosystem-based management. The mesopredators are highly dependent on Antarctic krill and icefish, which are targeted by regional fisheries. We used a state-space formulation to combine (1) a mark-recapture open-population model and individual identification data to assess seasonally variable leopard seal arrival and departure dates, numbers, and residency times; (2) a size-based bioenergetic model; and (3) a size-based prey choice model from a diet analysis. Our models indicated that prey choice and consumption reflected seasonal changes in leopard seal population size and structure, size-selective predation and prey vulnerability. A population of 104 (90-125) leopard seals, of which 64% were juveniles, consumed less than 2% of the Antarctic fur seal pup production of the area (50% of total ingested energy, IE), but ca. 12-16% of the local gentoo penguin population (20% IE). Antarctic krill (28% IE) were the only observed food of leopard seal pups and supplemented the diet of older individuals. Direct impacts on krill and fish were negligible, but the ""escapement"" due to leopard seal predation on fur seal pups and penguins could be significant for the mackerel icefish fishery at South Georgia. These results suggest that: (1) rare apex predators like leopard seals may control, and may depend on, populations of mesopredators dependent on prey species targeted by fisheries; and (2) predatory impacts and community control may vary throughout the predator's geographic range, and differ across ecosystems and management areas, depending on the seasonal abundance of the prey and the predator's dispersal movements. This understanding is important to integrate the predator needs as natural mortality of its prey in models to set prey catch limits for fisheries. Reliable estimates of the variability of these needs are essential for a precautionary interpretation in the context of an ecosystem-based management. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.03.020,2-s2.0-65149098909,24,0.7362093270000001,0,model pred by transy leopard seal for an ecosystem bas man of southern oc fishery correct quant the impact of rar apex marin pred is ess to ecosystem bas approach to fishery man wher harvest must be sustain for target specy and their depend pred thi requir model the uncertainty in such process as pred lif hist season abund and mov siz bas pred energet requir and prey vuln we combin thes uncertainty to evalu the pred impact of transy leopard seal on a commun of mesopr seal and penguin and their prey at sou georg and assess the imply for an ecosystem bas man the mesopr ar high depend on antarct kril and icef which ar target by reg fishery we us a stat spac form to combin a mark recapt op pop model and individ id dat to assess season vary leopard seal ar and depart dat numb and resid tim a siz bas bioenerget model and a siz bas prey cho model from a diet analys our model ind that prey cho and consum reflect season chang in leopard seal pop siz and structure siz select pred and prey vuln a pop of leopard seal of which wer juvenil consum less than of the antarct fur seal pup produc of the are of tot ingest energy ie but ca of the loc gentoo penguin pop ie antarct kril ie wer the on observ food of leopard seal pup and suppl the diet of old individ direct impact on kril and fish wer neglig but the escap due to leopard seal pred on fur seal pup and penguin could be sign for the mackerel icef fishery at sou georg thes result suggest that rar apex pred lik leopard seal may control and may depend on pop of mesopr depend on prey specy target by fishery and pred impact and commun control may vary throughout the pred s geograph rang and diff across ecosystem and man area depend on the season abund of the prey and the pred s dispers mov thi understand is import to integr the pred nee as nat mort of it prey in model to set prey catch limit for fishery rely estim of the vary of thes nee ar ess for a precaut interpret in the context of an ecosystem bas man,new,0.7935193729288715,0.7148732505407915,0.6497720195376527,0.5969349221576653,0.5535920597476339,0.5174147284904334,0.48667143734585966,0.4600824923423861,0.43665613899793443,0.4155265575566641,0.3957801947441608
2114,mammal_antarctic,"Satellite imagery can be used to detect variation in abundance of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Erebus Bay, Antarctica","The Weddell seal population in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, represents one of the best-studied marine mammal populations in the world, providing an ideal test for the efficacy of satellite imagery to inform about seal abundance and population trends. Using high-resolution (0. 6m) satellite imagery, we compared counts from imagery to ground counts of adult Weddell seals and determined temporal trends in Erebus Bay during November 2004-2006 and 2009, and December 2007. Seals were counted from QuickBird-2 and WorldView-1 images, and these counts were compared with ground counts at overlapping locations within Erebus Bay during the same time. Counts were compared across years and within individual haul-out locations. We counted a total of 1,000 adult Weddell seals from five images across all years (for a total of 21 satellite-to-ground count comparisons), approximately 72% of the total counted on the ground at overlapping locations. We accurately detected an increase in abundance during 2004-2009. There was a strong, positive correlation (r=0. 98, df=3, P<0. 003) between ground counts and counts derived from the imagery. The correlation between counts at individual haul-out locations was also strong (r=0. 80, df=19, P>0. 001). Detection rates ranged from 30 to 88%. Overall, our results showed the utility of high-resolution imagery to provide an accurate way to detect the presence and variation in abundance of Weddell seals. Our methods may be applied to other species in polar regions, such as walruses or polar bears, particularly in areas where little is known about population status. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00300-011-1023-0,2-s2.0-80053976566,8,0.730877465,1,satellit imagery can be us to detect vary in abund of weddel seal leptonychot weddelli in ereb bay antarctic the weddel seal pop in ereb bay antarctic repres on of the best study marin mam pop in the world provid an id test for the eff of satellit imagery to inform about seal abund and pop trend us high resolv m satellit imagery we comp count from imagery to ground count of adult weddel seal and determin temp trend in ereb bay dur novemb and and decemb seal wer count from quickbird and worldview im and thes count wer comp with ground count at overlap loc within ereb bay dur the sam tim count wer comp across year and within individ haul out loc we count a tot of adult weddel seal from fiv im across al year for a tot of satellit to ground count comparison approxim of the tot count on the ground at overlap loc we acc detect an increas in abund dur ther was a strong posit correl r df p between ground count and count der from the imagery the correl between count at individ haul out loc was also strong r df p detect rat rang from to overal our result show the util of high resolv imagery to provid an acc way to detect the pres and vary in abund of weddel seal our method may be apply to oth specy in pol reg such as walrus or pol bear particul in area wher littl is known about pop stat,new,0.7318219728985916,0.6816411596657918,0.6455231623695006,0.6192629065195692,0.5999965624360202,0.5860525215917974,0.5765626094781944,0.5712761711956038,0.5706102463672689,0.5760920533557193,0.59180688315486
2210,mammal_antarctic,"Population status, trends and a re-examination of the hypotheses explaining the recent declines of the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina","1. Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Vald√©s, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. ¬© 2005 Mammal Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2907.2005.00055.x,2-s2.0-13844250597,15,0.7262456490000001,1,pop stat trend and a re examin of the hypothes explain the rec declin of the southern eleph seal miroung leonin between the s and s the southern eleph seal miroung leonin underw larg decreas in pop siz throughout most of it bree rang in the southern oc whil cur pop estim suggest a rec recovery som bree pop hav continu to decreas in rec year macqu and mar island oth hav eith remain stabl sou georg kerguel and heard island or hav increas peninsul vald√©s argentin intrins c hypothes for pattern of reg declin includ fact that ar affect by dens depend mech i pauc of mal ii pop overshoot and ii pandem diseas extrins hypothes includ iv pred v competit with fishery concern vi interspec competit vii environ chang and vii hum disturb of the eight hypothes propos and examin her we conclud that three can be discount i v vii three ar unlik but may requir mor test ii ii iv and two ar plaus vi vii the interspec competit hypot hes is difficult to test becaus it requir the simult monit of specy that overlap direct with eleph seal many of which hav not been ident or littl is known howev an analys of the rel between log vary and log abund tayl s pow law for pop of southern and northern eleph seal suggest that interspec competit is not a sign fact in the declin of the southern eleph seal the hypothes that decreas in southern eleph se al pop between the s and s wer caus by the environ chang is the easiest to test and most plaus of the hypothes we propos a framework by which to test thi hypothes to determin how food avail affect individ surv,new,0.7439866341360736,0.7056247740735443,0.6786048159766025,0.6595940560846714,0.6463263835251429,0.6375111125303091,0.6325336054514431,0.6313222165817717,0.6344301996893478,0.6435002659988697,0.662728471432567
2310,mammal_antarctic,First demographic insights on historically harvested and poorly known male sperm whale populations off the Crozet and Kerguelen Islands (Southern Ocean),"Age and sex dependent spatial segregation has resulted in limited knowledge of the ecology and demography of sperm whale adult males feeding seasonally in high latitudes. This study focused on adult males interacting with the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery operating off the Kerguelen and Crozet Archipelagos. Demographic parameters were estimated using a 10-yr-long photo-identification data set paired with multistate closed robust design capture-mark-recapture models. The examination of a set of 29,078 photographs taken from fishing vessels during sperm whale depredation events resulted in identification of 295 individuals with nine visiting both study areas. Dispersal between both study regions was estimated to be 1% per year. The mean annual number of interacting sperm whales was estimated to n = 82 (95% CI 58‚Äì141) in Crozet and n = 106 (95% CI 76‚Äì174) in Kerguelen.

2410,mammal_antarctic,"Penguins, fur seals, and fishing: Prey requirements and potential competition in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica","Antarctic and sub-Antarctic seabirds, marine mammals, and human fisheries concentrate their foraging efforts on a single species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Because these predators may have a significant effect on krill abundance, we estimated the energy and prey requirements of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins and female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica and compared these estimates with catch statistics from the Antarctic krill fishery. Published data on field metabolic rate, population size, diet, prey energy content, and metabolic efficiency were used to estimate prey requirements of these breeding, adult, land-based predators and their dependent offspring. Due to their large population size, chinstrap penguins were the most significant krill predators during the period examined, consuming an estimated 7.8 x 108 kg krill, followed by Adelie penguins (3.1 x 107 kg), gentoo penguins (1.2 x 107 kg), and Antarctic fur seals (3.6 x 106 kg). Total consumption of all land-based predators on the South Shetland Islands was estimated at 8.3 x 108 kg krill. The commercial krill fishery harvest in the South Shetland Island region (1.0 x 108 kg) was approximately 12% of this. Commercial harvest coincides seasonally and spatially with peak penguin and fur seal prey demands, and may affect prey availability to penguins and fur seals. This differs from the conclusions of Ichii et al. who asserted that the potential for competition between South Shetland predators and the commercial krill fishery is low.",10.1007/s003000050261,2-s2.0-0031841939,45,0.7243436240000001,0,penguin fur seal and fish prey requir and pot competit in the sou shetland island antarctic antarct and sub antarct seabird marin mam and hum fishery cont their for effort on a singl specy antarct kril euphaus superb becaus thes pred may hav a sign effect on kril abund we estim the energy and prey requir of ad pygoscel adelia chinstrap pygoscel antarctic and gentoo pygoscel papu penguin and fem antarct fur seal arctocephal gazell bree on the sou shetland island antarctic and comp thes estim with catch stat from the antarct kril fishery publ dat on field metabol rat pop siz diet prey energy cont and metabol efficy wer us to estim prey requir of thes bree adult land bas pred and their depend offspr due to their larg pop siz chinstrap penguin wer the most sign kril pred dur the period examin consum an estim x kg kril follow by ad penguin x kg gentoo penguin x kg and antarct fur seal x kg tot consum of al land bas pred on the sou shetland island was estim at x kg kril the commerc kril fishery harvest in the sou shetland island reg x kg was approxim of thi commerc harvest coincid season and spat with peak penguin and fur seal prey demand and may affect prey avail to penguin and fur seal thi diff from the conclud of ichi et al who assert that the pot for competit between sou shetland pred and the commerc kril fishery is low,new,0.8182029490427817,0.7081685141229812,0.6138816315907734,0.5385253290521373,0.47855510254830497,0.4301146109356167,0.39020782378407654,0.3566373525961685,0.3277504483880297,0.30216899778034345,0.27839953497634773
278,mammal_antarctic,"New Zealand king shag (Leucocarbo carunculatus) foraging distribution and use of mussel farms in Admiralty Bay, Marlborough Sounds","To date there has been no published information describing the relative abundance, behaviour or distribution of the New Zealand king shag (Leucocarbo carunculatus) within mussel farm areas, despite the sensitivity of the species to human disturbance and the potential overlap of its range with proposed development of marine aquaculture. Four survey methods were employed as part of a multi-species research programme to develop methods for surveying marine mammals and seabird populations in aquaculture management areas. Two of the techniques, involving continuous timelapse photography of mussel farms and boat-based surveys through coastal farms were developed for this study. Timelapse cameras showed that mussel farms buoys were used by king shags as temporary resting sites only. King shags were recorded on 36% of the farms (n = 44) from 13 surveys within inner Admiralty Bay. The low number of sightings within mussel farms suggests that farms are not important foraging or resting areas for king shags, at least in Admiralty Bay. The foraging range and density of king shags was not known before farms were developed, so no direct comparison or impact assessment can be made. Boat-based surveys were used to estimate the density of foraging shags, which showed that daily locations of foraging birds at sea can vary considerably on consecutive days and over the season. Previous environmental surveys to assess impacts of mussel farms on foraging areas are therefore unlikely to adequately represent the entire foraging range or most important feeding areas. The number of breeding pairs, chicks and nests was also found to vary considerably at colonies, dependent on when counts were undertaken during their protracted breeding season. Open water mid-bay aquaculture (shellfish and finfish) potentially poses a greater threat to king shags than 'coastal ribbon development', in terms of loss of open water habitat from farm structures, and loss of foraging habitat through modification to the water column (e.g., turbidity) and seabed. Given the lack of knowledge about the king shag population dynamics, diet and prey availability, there is an urgent requirement for more research to fill these gaps and also understand how we can conserve important shag feeding areas and associated marine environment through sustainable management of aquaculture. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",,2-s2.0-84875418658,18,0.696126615,0,new zealand king shag leucocarbo carunculat for distribut and us of mussel farm in admiral bay marlborough sound to dat ther has been no publ inform describ the rel abund behavio or distribut of the new zealand king shag leucocarbo carunculat within mussel farm area despit the sensit of the specy to hum disturb and the pot overlap of it rang with propos develop of marin aquacult four survey method wer employ as part of a mult specy research program to develop method for survey marin mam and seabird pop in aquacult man area two of the techn involv continu timelaps photograph of mussel farm and boat bas survey through coast farm wer develop for thi study timelaps camera show that mussel farm buoy wer us by king shag as temp rest sit on king shag wer record on of the farm n from survey within in admiral bay the low numb of sight within mussel farm suggest that farm ar not import for or rest area for king shag at least in admiral bay the for rang and dens of king shag was not known bef farm wer develop so no direct comparison or impact assess can be mad boat bas survey wer us to estim the dens of for shag which show that dai loc of for bird at sea can vary consid on consecut day and ov the season prevy environ survey to assess impact of mussel farm on for area ar theref unlik to adequ repres the entir for rang or most import fee area the numb of bree pair chick and nest was also found to vary consid at colony depend on when count wer undertak dur their protract bree season op wat mid bay aquacult shellf and finf pot pos a gre threat to king shag than coast ribbon develop in term of loss of op wat habit from farm structures and loss of for habit through mod to the wat column e g turbid and seab giv the lack of knowledg about the king shag pop dynam diet and prey avail ther is an urg requir for mor research to fil thes gap and also understand how we can conserv import shag fee area and assocy marin environ through sustain man of aquacult,new,0.7434208741238577,0.6760609163777062,0.6257076592518704,0.5879394511707897,0.5590603945661187,0.5367179711623334,0.5195317132719269,0.5068197390236248,0.4985460251510344,0.49560403971922584,0.5009262182652323
3112,mammal_antarctic,"The zooplankton of Marguerite Bay, Western Antarctic Peninsula-Part I: Abundance, distribution, and population response to variability in environmental conditions","The zooplankton community of Marguerite Bay was studied during austral fall of 2001 and 2002 using net and concurrent environmental data. Interannual differences were observed in zooplankton species composition, developmental stages, and abundances, which were linked to unusually high chlorophyll concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay during spring-summer 2000/2001. Copepod abundance was significantly higher in 2001 than in 2002 (46.3 and 28.3indm-3 in 2001 and 2002, respectively). During 2001, the copepod community was dominated by two species. Calanoides acutus, a herbivore, and Metridia gerlachei, an omnivore, accounted for 46% and 45% of the community, respectively. During 2002, however, several species were relatively abundant, including M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. acutus, Oithona spp., and Paraeuchaeta spp. Euphausiids also showed a rapid population response to high chlorophyll levels in 2001. Even though average total euphausiid (juvenile/adult) abundances were similar during both years (0.20 and 0.15indm-3 for 2001 and 2002, respectively), species composition showed marked interannual differences due to varying life history strategies among species. Thysanoessa macrura, which has a relatively rapid development from larval to juvenile stages between spring and fall of the same year, was the most abundant euphausiid in 2001. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba juvenile/adult populations increased in 2002, owing to a slower development in which larval stages overwinter and recruit to juveniles during the following spring/summer. Other zooplankton groups those were abundant in Marguerite Bay, but showed little variability between years, included ostracods, pteropods, chaetognaths, medusae, amphipods, and mysids. Summer phytoplankton concentrations strongly influenced copepods and euphausiids; however, there were no clear associations between zooplankton distributions and fall environmental conditions (i.e., pigment concentrations and surface salinity) or bottom depth. It is notable that ostracods and pteropods had the highest abundances of non-copepod zooplankton. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.12.007,2-s2.0-79957990658,1,0.67721474,0,the zooplankton of marguerit bay western antarct peninsul part i abund distribut and pop respons to vary in environ condit the zooplankton commun of marguerit bay was study dur aust fal of and us net and concur environ dat interan diff wer observ in zooplankton specy composit develop stag and abund which wer link to unus high chlorophyll cont in the bellingshaus sea and marguerit bay dur spring sum copepod abund was sign high in than in and indm in and respect dur the copepod commun was domin by two specy calanoid acut a herb and metrid gerlache an omn account for and of the commun respect dur howev sev specy wer rel abund includ m gerlache ctenocalan spp c acut oithon spp and paraeuchaet spp euphausiid also show a rapid pop respons to high chlorophyll level in ev though av tot euphausiid juvenil adult abund wer simil dur both year and indm for and respect specy composit show mark interan diff due to vary lif hist strategies among specy thysanoess macrur which has a rel rapid develop from larv to juvenil stag between spring and fal of the sam year was the most abund euphausiid in in contrast euphaus crystallorophia and euphaus superb juvenil adult pop increas in ow to a slow develop in which larv stag overwint and recruit to juvenil dur the follow spring sum oth zooplankton group thos wer abund in marguerit bay but show littl vary between year includ ostracod pteropod chaetognath medusa amphipod and mysid sum phytoplankton cont strongly influ copepod and euphausiid howev ther wer no clear assocy between zooplankton distribut and fal environ condit i e pig cont and surfac salin or bottom dep it is not that ostracod and pteropod had the highest abund of non copepod zooplankton,new,0.7027936050220971,0.621976015027496,0.5643690808548538,0.5225371952515905,0.4911237565605709,0.46698627069001686,0.44833288940309246,0.4342161173983867,0.4243525211574318,0.4192636242988688,0.4210262760351118
361,mammal_antarctic,The impact of predation by marine mammals on Patagonian toothfish longline fisheries,"Predatory interaction of marine mammals with longline fisheries is observed globally, leading to partial or complete loss of the catch and in some parts of the world to considerable financial loss. Depredation can also create additional unrecorded fishing mortality of a stock and has the potential to introduce bias to stock assessments. Here we aim to characterise depredation in the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery around South Georgia focusing on the spatio-temporal component of these interactions. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and orcas (Orcinus orca ) frequently feed on fish hooked on longlines around South Georgia. A third of longlines encounter sperm whales, but loss of catch due to sperm whales is insignificant when compared to that due to orcas, which interact with only 5% of longlines but can take more than half of the catch in some cases. Orca depredation around South Georgia is spatially limited and focused in areas of putative migration routes, and the impact is compounded as a result of the fishery also concentrating in those areas at those times. Understanding the seasonal behaviour of orcas and the spatial and temporal distribution of ""depredation hot spots"" can reduce marine mammal interactions, will improve assessment and management of the stock and contribute to increased operational efficiency of the fishery. Such information is valuable in the effort to resolve the human-mammal conflict for resources. ¬© 2015 S√∂ffker et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0118113,2-s2.0-84928966778,20,0.6286803089999999,0,the impact of pred by marin mam on patagon toothf longlin fishery pred interact of marin mam with longlin fishery is observ glob lead to part or complet loss of the catch and in som part of the world to consid fin loss depr can also cre addit unrecord fish mort of a stock and has the pot to introduc bia to stock assess her we aim to charact depr in the patagon toothf dissostich eleginoid fishery around sou georg focus on the spatio temp compon of thes interact antarct fur seal arctocephal gazell sperm whal physet macrocephal and orca orcin orc frequ fee on fish hook on longlin around sou georg a third of longlin encount sperm whal but loss of catch due to sperm whal is insign when comp to that due to orca which interact with on of longlin but can tak mor than half of the catch in som cas orc depr around sou georg is spat limit and focus in area of put migr rout and the impact is compound as a result of the fishery also cont in thos area at thos tim understand the season behavio of orca and the spat and temp distribut of depr hot spot can reduc marin mam interact wil improv assess and man of the stock and contribut to increas op efficy of the fishery such inform is valu in the effort to resolv the hum mam conflict for resourc,new,0.6842946350724549,0.6317349034106503,0.5944007048711447,0.5676700384984081,0.5484943906699404,0.5351274509087914,0.5267054170109752,0.5230677920085192,0.5248573913039852,0.5341122180853094,0.5561411091338916
386,mammal_antarctic,Spatio-temporal persistence of top predator hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula,"We quantified species richness and abundance of seabirds and marine mammals in order to identify marine areas that are persistently attractive to top predators. Shipboard surveys across a 150 000 km2 grid off the Antarctic Peninsula were conducted once or twice each year from 2003 to 2011 during which the distribution and abundance of top predators were mapped. We hypothesized that spatial organization of species richness and abundance hotspots reflect persistent habitat use and are regionalized according to distance from land and oceanographic boundaries. To test this, we used a new hotspot variance metric based on the percentage of time that the species richness or abundance estimate at any one location is greater than 1 standard deviation above the long term means for the entire survey grid. Species richness hotspots were based on all species sighted, while abundance hotspots were based on concentrations of 16 species: 13 seabirds (penguins, petrels and albatrosses), 1 pinniped and 2 baleen whales. Species abundance hotspots reflected 2 major groupings-those with oceanic and coastal origins. We identified 15 richness hotspots, 9 of which were in proximity to the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front; the 6 others were associated with major breeding colonies and the location of 2 submarine canyon systems. Our approach integrates temporal and spatial variances over 14 individual surveys and provides useful reference points for identifying ecologically important areas, refining food web models and developing spatial management of and conservation strategies for marine ecosystems. ¬© Inter-Research 2013.",10.3354/meps10350,2-s2.0-84881067357,22,0.620112223,1,spatio temp persist of top pred hotspot near the antarct peninsul we quant specy rich and abund of seabird and marin mam in ord to ident marin area that ar persist attract to top pred shipboard survey across a km grid off the antarct peninsul wer conduc ont or twic each year from to dur which the distribut and abund of top pred wer map we hypothes that spat org of specy rich and abund hotspot reflect persist habit us and ar reg accord to dist from land and oceanograph bound to test thi we us a new hotspot vary met bas on the perc of tim that the specy rich or abund estim at any on loc is gre than standard devy abov the long term mean for the entir survey grid specy rich hotspot wer bas on al specy sight whil abund hotspot wer bas on cont of specy seabird penguin petrel and albatross pinnip and baleen whal specy abund hotspot reflect maj group thos with oc and coast origin we ident rich hotspot of which wer in proxim to the southern antarct circumpol cur front the oth wer assocy with maj bree colony and the loc of submarin canyon system our approach integr temp and spat vary ov individ survey and provid us ref point for ident ecolog import area refin food web model and develop spat man of and conserv strategies for marin ecosystem,new,0.7190900145671457,0.6080226363796682,0.5248665264593866,0.46370285028671365,0.4176206282153906,0.3818799177360567,0.3534656550283175,0.3304561173863913,0.31161990118918803,0.2962043236398733,0.2839073735167588

435,mammal_antarctic,Shipboard line transect surveys of crabeater seal abundance in the pack-ice off east Antarctica: Evaluation of assumptions,"We examine the extent to which the assumptions underlying line transect sampling are satisfied in shipboard surveys of crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) hauled out on the Antarctic pack-ice. Measurement of the perpendicular distance of seal groups from the ship with an electronic inclinometer fitted to a rifle stock was unbiased. Crabeater seals showed little movement in response to the approaching ship. Movement away from the ship by seals close to the ship's track was partially responsible for a relative lack of sightings close to the transect-line, but otherwise had little effect on the sighting histogram. Minor deviations from the transect direction to avoid running over seals violated the assumption of uniform distribution of groups, and contributed to a relative lack in sightings close to (<40 m) the transect-line. We estimate that 5%-10% of seal groups close to the transect-line were not sighted by bridge observers prior to passing abeam of the ship, but most of these missed groups were likely to have been sighted some distance behind-abeam. Shipboard transects provided a biased sample of four environmental features known to be related to crabeater seal abundance because of logistical difficulties in the ship traversing along straight transects through thick ice. Calculation of transect length L from successive GPS locations was mildly sensitive to the frequency of locations. We provide analytical recommendations to reduce or eliminate the effect of assumption violation when present and hence minimize bias in abundance estimation.",10.1111/j.1748-7692.2004.tb01182.x,2-s2.0-3943082808,6,0.579635476,0,shipboard lin transect survey of crab seal abund in the pack ic off east antarctic evalu of assum we examin the ext to which the assum und lin transect sampl ar satisfy in shipboard survey of crab seal lobodon carcinophag haul out on the antarct pack ic meas of the perpendicul dist of seal group from the ship with an electron inclinomet fit to a rifl stock was unbias crab seal show littl mov in respons to the approach ship mov away from the ship by seal clos to the ship s track was part respons for a rel lack of sight clos to the transect lin but otherw had littl effect on the sight histogram min devy from the transect direct to avoid run ov seal viol the assum of uniform distribut of group and contribut to a rel lack in sight clos to m the transect lin we estim that of seal group clos to the transect lin wer not sight by bridg observ pri to pass abeam of the ship but most of thes miss group wer lik to hav been sight som dist behind abeam shipboard transect provid a bias sampl of four environ feat known to be rel to crab seal abund becaus of log difficul in the ship travers along straight transect through thick ic calc of transect leng l from success gps loc was mild sensit to the frequ of loc we provid analys recommend to reduc or elimin the effect of assum viol when pres and hent minim bia in abund estim,new,0.6069364094356166,0.5388843063938225,0.49350667663992764,0.46281985064540293,0.4419121562419788,0.4281285880121611,0.4201890404844795,0.41780235735480803,0.42172496610456023,0.43449343490998993,0.4628669509166833
453,mammal_antarctic,Climatically driven fluctuations in Southern Ocean ecosystems,"Determining how climate fluctuations affect ocean ecosystems requires an understanding of how biological and physical processes interact across a wide range of scales. Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of 1¬∞C over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century. ¬© 2007 The Royal Society.",10.1098/rspb.2007.1180,2-s2.0-36849007105,21,0.568473559,0,clim driv fluctu in southern oc ecosystem determin how clim fluctu affect oc ecosystem requir an understand of how biolog and phys process interact across a wid rang of scal her we examin the rol of phys and biolog process in gen fluctu in the ecosystem around sou georg in the sou atl sect of the southern oc anoma in sea surfac temp sst in the sou pac sect of the southern oc hav prevy been shown to be gen through atmosph teleconnect with el ni√±o southern oscil enso rel process thes sst anoma ar prop via the antarct circumpol cur into the sou atl on tim scal of mor than year wher enso and southern annul mod rel atmosph process hav a direct influ on short less than six month tim scal we find that across the sou atl sect thes chang in sst and rel fluctu in wint sea ic ext affect the recruit and dispers of antarct kril thi oceanograph driv vary in kril pop dynam and abund in turn affect the bree success of seabird and marin mam pred that depend on kril as food such prop anoma medy through phys and troph interact ar lik to be an import compon of vary in oc ecosystem and affect respons to long term chang pop model der on the bas of thes oc fluctu ind that plaus rat of reg warm of ¬∞c ov the next year could lead to mor than a reduc in the biomass and abund of kril across the scot sea by the end of the century,new,0.6676821279598153,0.5662214841601598,0.4951188679614946,0.44512725108655943,0.40897127546672696,0.3822685863726816,0.3624982474870463,0.34831085135529166,0.33925826697158196,0.3359711125869021,0.34126102491923893
462,mammal_antarctic,Contrasted structuring effects of mesoscale features on the seabird community in the Mozambique Channel,"The Mozambique Channel (western Indian Ocean) is a dynamic environment characterised by strong mesoscale features, which influence all biological components of the pelagic ecosystem. We investigated the distribution, abundance and feeding behaviour of seabirds in the Mozambique Channel in relation to physical and biological environmental variables, with a specific interest in mesoscale features. Seabird censuses were conducted in summer and winter during 7 cruises in the southern and northern Mozambique Channel. Tropical species accounted for 49% of the 37 species identified and 97% of the individuals, and species from the sub-Antarctic region constituted 30% of the identifications. The typically tropical sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscata) was the dominant species during all cruises, and overall accounted for 74% of the species observations and 85% of counted birds. Outputs of Generalised Linear Models at the scale of the Mozambique Channel suggested that higher densities of flying and feeding birds occurred in areas with lower sea surface temperatures and lower surface chlorophyll a concentrations. Most of the flocks of feeding birds did not associate with surface schools of fish or marine mammals, but when they did, these flocks were larger, especially when associated with tuna. While tropical species seemed to favour cyclonic eddies, frontal and divergence zones, non-tropical species were more frequently recorded over shelf waters. Sooty terns foraged preferentially in cyclonic eddies where zooplankton, micronekton and tuna schools were abundant. Among other major tropical species, frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) predominated in frontal zones between eddies, where tuna schools also frequently occurred and where geostrophic currents were the strongest. Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) concentrated in divergence zones characterised by low sea level anomalies, low geostrophic currents, and high zooplankton biomass close to the surface. Our results highlight the importance of mescoscale features in structuring the tropical seabird community in the Mozambique Channel, in addition to segregating tropical and non-tropical species. The mechanisms underlying the segregation of tropical seabirds seem to partially differ from that of other tropical regions, and this may be a consequence of the strong local mesoscale activity, affecting prey size and availability schemes. Beyond characterising the foraging habitats of the seabird community of the Mozambique Channel, this study highlights the importance of this region as a hot spot for seabirds; especially the southern part, where several endangered sub-Antarctic species over-winter. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.10.027,2-s2.0-84897612658,19,0.5662374410000001,0,contrast structuring effect of mesosc feat on the seabird commun in the mozamb channel the mozamb channel western ind oc is a dynam environ charact by strong mesosc feat which influ al biolog compon of the pel ecosystem we investig the distribut abund and fee behavio of seabird in the mozamb channel in rel to phys and biolog environ vary with a spec interest in mesosc feat seabird census wer conduc in sum and wint dur cru in the southern and northern mozamb channel trop specy account for of the specy ident and of the individ and specy from the sub antarct reg constitut of the id the typ trop sooty tern onychopr fuscat was the domin specy dur al cru and overal account for of the specy observ and of count bird output of gen linear model at the scal of the mozamb channel suggest that high dens of fly and fee bird occur in area with low sea surfac temp and low surfac chlorophyll a cont most of the flock of fee bird did not assocy with surfac schools of fish or marin mam but when they did thes flock wer larg espec when assocy with tun whil trop specy seem to favo cyclon eddy front and diverg zon non trop specy wer mor frequ record ov shelf wat sooty tern for pref in cyclon eddy wher zooplankton micronekton and tun schools wer abund among oth maj trop specy frigatebird fregat spp predomin in front zon between eddy wher tun schools also frequ occur and wher geostroph cur wer the strongest red foot booby sul sul cont in diverg zon charact by low sea level anoma low geostroph cur and high zooplankton biomass clos to the surfac our result highlight the import of mescosc feat in structuring the trop seabird commun in the mozamb channel in addit to segreg trop and non trop specy the mech und the segreg of trop seabird seem to part diff from that of oth trop reg and thi may be a consequ of the strong loc mesosc act affect prey siz and avail schemes beyond charact the for habit of the seabird commun of the mozamb channel thi study highlight the import of thi reg as a hot spot for seabird espec the southern part wher sev endang sub antarct specy ov wint,new,0.6315996257576958,0.5320207658102123,0.46256686802372765,0.41372076032980404,0.37837022354324207,0.35225144728583396,0.3329159722298688,0.3190626007006477,0.3102827499392244,0.30725236511725756,0.3128473622480306
474,mammal_antarctic,Environmental determinants of top predator distribution within the dynamic winter pack ice zone of the northern Antarctic Peninsula,"Global warming is predicted to reduce the amount of sea ice concentration in polar environments, thus presenting profound changes for populations of seabirds and marine mammals dependent on sea ice. Using data from a shipboard survey during August 2012, I test the hypothesis that relative abundance of seabird and marine mammals reflects environmental variability associated with the dynamic pack ice zone. Using environmental data and observations of sea ice concentration, I quantified an environmental gradient that describes the spatial organization of the dynamic pack ice zone. The relationship of top predators to this environmental gradient revealed three important aspects: (1) an open water and pack ice community is present with some top predator species exhibiting higher abundance associated with moderate sea ice concentration (40‚Äì60¬†%) as opposed to the pack ice edge (10¬†%), (2) Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were the most abundant pinniped and they were observed resting on ice floes and foraging within leads and polynyas, and (3) for the most abundant species, spatial regression models indicate that latitude and sea ice concentration (a principal north/south gradient) are the most important environmental determinants. Winter ocean conditions may strongly influence population dynamics of top predators; therefore, information regarding their habitat use during winter is needed for understanding ecosystem dynamics. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00300-014-1502-1,2-s2.0-84956826684,23,0.5506852560000001,0,environ determin of top pred distribut within the dynam wint pack ic zon of the northern antarct peninsul glob warm is predict to reduc the amount of sea ic cont in pol environ thu pres profound chang for pop of seabird and marin mam depend on sea ic us dat from a shipboard survey dur august i test the hypothes that rel abund of seabird and marin mam reflect environ vary assocy with the dynam pack ic zon us environ dat and observ of sea ic cont i quant an environ grady that describ the spat org of the dynam pack ic zon the rel of top pred to thi environ grady rev three import aspect an op wat and pack ic commun is pres with som top pred specy exhibit high abund assocy with mod sea ic cont ‚äì¬† as oppos to the pack ic edg ¬† antarct fur seal arctocephal gazell wer the most abund pinnip and they wer observ rest on ic flo and for within lead and polynya and for the most abund specy spat regress model ind that latitud and sea ic cont a princip nor sou grady ar the most import environ determin wint oc condit may strongly influ pop dynam of top pred theref inform regard their habit us dur wint is nee for understand ecosystem dynam,new,0.6116537488615976,0.533768037269713,0.48210579783186186,0.4465801502002414,0.4213247041508178,0.4031795219458416,0.3904674462806406,0.3824279550401586,0.379069858428271,0.3814614130805096,0.39296034402704216
484,mammal_antarctic,Geospatial variability of krill and top predators within an Antarctic submarine canyon system,"The spatial distribution patterns of krill, seabirds (penguin, petrel and albatross), fur seals and baleen whales were mapped in nearshore waters (<50 km from land) to investigate their habitat selection within two adjacent submarine canyons near Livingston Island, Antarctica. Three shipboard surveys were conducted (February 2005-2007), and an echosounder was used to measure the distribution and abundance of krill while simultaneously conducting visual surveys to map seabird and marine mammals. Using a multispecies approach, we test the hypothesis that spatial organization of krill and top predators co-vary according to fine-scale changes in bathymetry in the nearshore marine environment. GAMs are used to examine the effect of sea depth, slope and distance to isobaths on the spatial distribution and abundance of krill and predators. Spatial distribution patterns of krill and predators relate to fine-scale (1-10 km) changes in bathymetry and exhibit cross-shelf gradients in abundance. Krill were concentrated along the shelf-break and abundant within both submarine canyons. Predators exhibited different preferences for locations within the submarine canyon system that relates to their foraging behavior. Penguins concentrated closer to shore and within the head of the east submarine canyon immediately adjacent to a breeding colony. Whales were also concentrated over the head of the east canyon (overlapping with penguins), whereas albatrosses and fur seals were concentrated in the west canyon. Fur seals also showed preference for steep slopes and were concentrated along the shelf-break. Petrels exhibited peaks in abundance throughout both submarine canyons. Owing to their orientation, size and proximity to the coastline, submarine canyons provide important habitat heterogeneity for krill and a variety of predators. This study highlights the multispecies approach for studying spatial ecology of top predators and krill and has implications for marine spatial management of the Scotia Sea. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s00227-011-1753-0,2-s2.0-80255132115,17,0.540603843,1,geosp vary of kril and top pred within an antarct submarin canyon system the spat distribut pattern of kril seabird penguin petrel and albatross fur seal and baleen whal wer map in nearsh wat km from land to investig their habit select within two adjac submarin canyon near livingston island antarctic three shipboard survey wer conduc febru and an echosound was us to meas the distribut and abund of kril whil simult conduc vis survey to map seabird and marin mam us a multispecy approach we test the hypothes that spat org of kril and top pred co vary accord to fin scal chang in bathymetry in the nearsh marin environ gam ar us to examin the effect of sea dep slop and dist to isobath on the spat distribut and abund of kril and pred spat distribut pattern of kril and pred rel to fin scal km chang in bathymetry and exhibit cross shelf grady in abund kril wer cont along the shelf break and abund within both submarin canyon pred exhibit diff pref for loc within the submarin canyon system that rel to their for behavy penguin cont clos to shor and within the head of the east submarin canyon immedy adjac to a bree colony whal wer also cont ov the head of the east canyon overlap with penguin wherea albatross and fur seal wer cont in the west canyon fur seal also show pref for steep slop and wer cont along the shelf break petrel exhibit peak in abund throughout both submarin canyon ow to their ory siz and proxim to the coastlin submarin canyon provid import habit heterog for kril and a vary of pred thi study highlight the multispecy approach for study spat ecolog of top pred and kril and has imply for marin spat man of the scot sea,new,0.6106899688542886,0.49986197615494266,0.42641810262806407,0.3769551907404821,0.3423472274833022,0.3175097436485283,0.29966832739709454,0.2874047159647624,0.28030024355003036,0.2791168587034847,0.28701161742477005
150,mammal_australasia,Pests controlling pests: Does predator control lead to greater European rabbit abundance in Australasia?,"In New Zealand and Australia, rural landowners believe that local predator control to protect indigenous biota exacerbates European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus problems on their land. We assess the validity of their concerns by reviewing the published literature on effects of predators on rabbit abundance. In New Zealand, where rabbits and their predators are introduced, predators appear to have relatively little effect on rabbit numbers compared with other factors leading to mortality, such as disease, flooding of burrows and burrow collapse. Similarly, in Australia, rabbit numbers are driven primarily by climate and its effects on food abundance and quality, and by disease. However, where rabbit numbers are low following drought or major epizootics, predation can limit population recovery. In the Iberian Peninsula, where rabbits and their predators are indigenous, the effects of predators are unknown, as they are often confounded by other factors. Rabbit numbers are influenced mostly by habitat, food, disease and rainfall. Elsewhere in Europe, predators have their strongest effect when rabbit numbers have been reduced by other factors, but have little effect on high-density rabbit populations. In Australasia, abundance of predators (especially rabbit specialists) can usually be predicted from rabbit abundance, not vice versa. Although predation effects can be limiting under certain conditions, they are minor compared to the roles of climate, food, disease and habitat. A key unresolved question is whether those circumstances where predator control might lead to increases in rabbit populations can be identified with enough certainty to allow reliable predictions to be generated. One approach is to implement robust rabbit, predator and disease monitoring programmes at sites with predator control operations. Data on changes in rabbits, predators, and disease prevalence could be combined with local data on other key factors to facilitate reasonable inference about effects of predators on rabbits. The inclusion of carefully matched non-treatment areas is crucial if such programmes are to succeed. ¬© 2015 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/mam.12034,2-s2.0-84925303222,1,0.551293457,1,pest control pest doe pred control lead to gre europ rabbit abund in australas in new zealand and austral rur landown believ that loc pred control to protect indig biot exacerb europ rabbit oryctolag cunicul problem on their land we assess the valid of their concern by review the publ lit on effect of pred on rabbit abund in new zealand wher rabbit and their pred ar introduc pred appear to hav rel littl effect on rabbit numb comp with oth fact lead to mort such as diseas flood of burrow and burrow collaps simil in austral rabbit numb ar driv prim by clim and it effect on food abund and qual and by diseas howev wher rabbit numb ar low follow drought or maj epizoot pred can limit pop recovery in the ib peninsul wher rabbit and their pred ar indig the effect of pred ar unknown as they ar oft confound by oth fact rabbit numb ar influ most by habit food diseas and rainfal elsewh in europ pred hav their strongest effect when rabbit numb hav been reduc by oth fact but hav littl effect on high dens rabbit pop in australas abund of pred espec rabbit spec can us be predict from rabbit abund not vic vers although pred effect can be limit und certain condit they ar min comp to the rol of clim food diseas and habit a key unresolv quest is wheth thos circumst wher pred control might lead to increas in rabbit pop can be ident with enough certainty to allow rely predict to be gen on approach is to impl robust rabbit pred and diseas monit program at sit with pred control op dat on chang in rabbit pred and diseas prev could be combin with loc dat on oth key fact to facilit reason inf about effect of pred on rabbit the includ of car match non tre area is cruc if such program ar to success,new,0.5830950549979877,0.5419057075835044,0.5157914508535222,0.4993377177377823,0.48961229037951587,0.48519193119276344,0.4855795142343792,0.4910348541455813,0.5027679867958204,0.5237772962979554,0.5612998231581289
240,mammal_australasia,"Influence of contrasting urban edges on the abundance of arboreal mammals: A study of squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) in southeast Queensland, Australia","The primary impacts of urban development on biodiversity are loss and fragmentation of habitat, and changes in the structure, composition and function of remnant native ecosystems. Forest dependent species, including arboreal mammals, are particularly sensitive to these changes due to their highly specific habitat requirements and inability or reluctance to cross the urban matrix. We addressed this problem using a case study of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in fragmented urban landscapes of southeast Queensland, Australia. We applied a mixed effect modeling approach clustered by patch to quantify the importance of site-level habitat factors relative to edge contrast and habitat patch size on squirrel glider abundance. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in glider age and sex in interior habitats compared to road and residential edges. We found that edge contrast had a strong negative effect on the abundance of squirrel gliders but is conditional on the presence of a low numbers of unreliable flowering overstorey trees and the availability of critical resources such as nest hollows at a site. We also found that older male gliders prefer forest fragment interiors over road and residential edge habitats. We conclude that although interior habitats are ideal to maintain large stable populations, the conservation value of low contrast edges containing key site-level resources should not be underestimated for arboreal mammals such as the squirrel glider. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

325,mammal_australasia,"Underestimated and severe: Small mammal decline from the forests of south-eastern Australia since European settlement, as revealed by a top-order predator","In Australia, numerous small mammal species have suffered extinction or severe declines in distribution and abundance following European settlement. The extent of these declines from forested areas of south-eastern Australia, however, remains poorly understood. In this paper we use sub-fossil deposits of the sooty owl (Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa) as a tool for understanding the diversity of the small mammal palaeocommunity. These results are compared to the contemporary sooty owl diet from the same geographical region to investigate the degree of small mammal decline following European settlement. Of 28 mammal species detected in sub-fossil deposits and considered prey items of the sooty owl at the time of European settlement, only 10 species were detected in the contemporary sooty owl diet. Numerous small mammal species have not only recently suffered severe declines in distribution and abundance but have also recently undergone niche contraction, as they occupied a greater diversity of regions and habitats at the time of European settlement. For some species our understanding of their true ecological niche and ecological potential is therefore limited. The species that underwent the greatest declines occupied open habitat types or were terrestrial. The severity of decline is also likely to have resulted in severe disruption of ecosystem functions, with wide scale ecosystem consequences. There is an urgent need to improve small mammal conservation, to maintain crucial ecosystem functions performed by small mammals. It is recommended that broad-scale exotic predator control programs are conducted which may also provide suitable conditions for the re-introduction of locally extinct species. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

418,mammal_australasia,The end of an 80-million year experiment: A review of evidence describing the impact of introduced rodents on New Zealand's 'mammal-free' invertebrate fauna,"Since separating from its super-continental origin 80 million years ago, New Zealand has effectively been isolated from the impacts of terrestrial mammals. The arrival of Polynesians in 13th C heralded the end of this era, with the introduction of kiore, (Rattus exulans, or Pacific rat), which had far-reaching effects on plant regeneration, survival of small ground vertebrates, larger invertebrates, and seabird breeding colonies. This paper reviews the evidence available from raptor nest sites and Quaternary beetle fossils to summarise extinctions thought to be caused by kiore in New Zealand. It also utilises invertebrate comparisons between islands with and without rats, or where rats have been eradicated, in order to document the impacts of rats (R. exulans, R. norvegicus) on invertebrate abundance, body mass, and the behavioural responses of some large New Zealand insects to the presence of rats.

516,mammal_australasia,Evidence that dingoes limit abundance of a mesopredator in eastern Australian forests,"1. Aggressive behaviour of top predators may have strong effects on the distribution and abundance of mesopredator species. Such interactions between predator species can reduce the intensity of predation on vulnerable prey. Suppression of mesopredators by top predators is a potentially important process that could protect small prey species from unsustainable predation. 2. There is some evidence that in Australia, the dingo Canis lupus suppresses populations of the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This interaction could be significant to biodiversity conservation because while dingoes have been in Australia for several thousand years and coexist with a wide range of small mammals, the fox is a recent arrival which has caused declines and extinctions, and continues to threaten many prey species. 3. However the strength of the effect of dingoes on foxes is unclear, and some published data have been interpreted as demonstrating no relationship between abundance of the two species. These data come from forested habitats in eastern Australia, and may suggest that negative relationships of dingoes and foxes do not occur in complex habitats. 4. We re-analyse published data on fox vs. wild dog (i.e. dingoes plus, potentially, feral dogs and hybrids) abundance in eastern forests. These data reveal a triangular relationship of fox to wild dog density: when wild dogs are abundant, foxes are consistently rare, while when wild dogs are rare, foxes may be abundant but are not always so. This suggests that the abundance of wild dogs sets an upper limit on the abundance of foxes, but does not fully determine fox abundance. 5. Standard regression and correlation methods are not appropriate for analysing such triangular relationships. We apply two statistical methods that can be used to characterize the edges of data distributions, and use these to demonstrate a negative relationship of maximum fox abundance to the abundance of wild dogs. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis adds to evidence that dingoes may have negative effects on red foxes in a wide range of habitats, and therefore, that dingoes may be significant to conservation of mammal biodiversity in Australia. It also illustrates problems and solutions in the statistical analysis of abundance of one species as a function of the abundance of another species with which it has a strong interaction. ¬© 2008 British Ecological Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01650.x,2-s2.0-65349126035,5,0.673253808,1,evid that dingo limit abund of a mesopr in eastern aust forest aggress behavio of top pred may hav strong effect on the distribut and abund of mesopr specy such interact between pred specy can reduc the intens of pred on vuln prey suppress of mesopr by top pred is a pot import process that could protect smal prey specy from unsustain pred ther is som evid that in austral the dingo can lup suppress pop of the red fox vulp vulp thi interact could be sign to biodivers conserv becaus whil dingo hav been in austral for sev thousand year and coex with a wid rang of smal mam the fox is a rec ar which has caus declin and extinct and continu to threaten many prey specy howev the strength of the effect of dingo on fox is unclear and som publ dat hav been interpret as demonst no rel between abund of the two specy thes dat com from forest habit in eastern austral and may suggest that neg rel of dingo and fox do not occ in complex habit we re analys publ dat on fox vs wild dog i e dingo plu pot fer dog and hybrid abund in eastern forest thes dat rev a triangul rel of fox to wild dog dens when wild dog ar abund fox ar consist rar whil when wild dog ar rar fox may be abund but ar not alway so thi suggest that the abund of wild dog set an up limit on the abund of fox but doe not ful determin fox abund standard regress and correl method ar not appropry for analys such triangul rel we apply two stat method that can be us to charact the edg of dat distribut and us thes to demonst a neg rel of maxim fox abund to the abund of wild dog synthes and apply our analys ad to evid that dingo may hav neg effect on red fox in a wid rang of habit and theref that dingo may be sign to conserv of mam biodivers in austral it also illust problem and solv in the stat analys of abund of on specy as a funct of the abund of anoth specy with which it has a strong interact,new,0.7195679464268276,0.6512409996069817,0.600985109346622,0.5633841367732713,0.534469572855525,0.5118180447263017,0.49400475422420514,0.4802711212586348,0.4704164558276831,0.46500747710588,0.4662510877247902
615,mammal_australasia,Invasion by Rattus rattus into native coastal forests of south-eastern Australia: Are native small mammals at risk?,"The black rat, Rattus rattus, is an alien rodent in Australian ecosystems where niche overlap with native small mammals may lead to competition for resources and displacement of native species. In coastal habitats surrounding Jervis Bay in south-eastern Australia, R. rattus co-occurs with the native bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, and brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii. Relative distributions and abundances, and fine-scale space use suggest invasive and native rodents compete for use of space and habitat. Such competitive interactions were not evident between R. rattus and native A. stuartii, which was negatively influenced more by disturbance to habitat. Differences in rodent communities between spatially separate forests forming the northern and southern peninsulas of Jervis Bay potentially reflect symmetrical competition and differences in competitive outcomes. In southern forests, R. rattus was largely restricted to patches of disturbed forest associated with campgrounds. Competitive interference by native rodent populations inhabiting surrounding intact forests may have so far limited R. rattus colonization of these areas. In northern forests, R. rattus was the predominant rodent irrespective of disturbance, while populations of R. fuscipes were unusually low seemingly due to poor juvenile recruitment. Native individuals avoided areas frequented by adult R. rattus and given that species did not partition use of microhabitats, R. rattus most likely precluded R. fuscipes from suitable habitat and in doing so limited native populations. We discuss how natural disturbance of habitat and human activity have potentially facilitated successful invasion by R. rattus of the northern forests. Studies that manipulate rodent populations are required to support these interpretations of observed patterns. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.",10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01941.x,2-s2.0-66249129388,6,0.61742874,0,invas by ratt ratt into nat coast forest of sou eastern austral ar nat smal mam at risk the black rat ratt ratt is an aly rod in aust ecosystem wher nich overlap with nat smal mam may lead to competit for resourc and displac of nat specy in coast habit surround jerv bay in sou eastern austral r ratt co occ with the nat bush rat ratt fuscip and brown antechin antechin stuarti rel distribut and abund and fin scal spac us suggest invas and nat rod compet for us of spac and habit such competit interact wer not evid between r ratt and nat a stuarti which was neg influ mor by disturb to habit diff in rod commun between spat sep forest form the northern and southern peninsula of jerv bay pot reflect symmet competit and diff in competit outcom in southern forest r ratt was larg restrict to patch of disturb forest assocy with campground competit interf by nat rod pop inhabit surround intact forest may hav so far limit r ratt colon of thes area in northern forest r ratt was the predomin rod irrespect of disturb whil pop of r fuscip wer unus low seem due to poor juvenil recruit nat individ avoid area frequ by adult r ratt and giv that specy did not partit us of microhabit r ratt most lik preclud r fuscip from suit habit and in doing so limit nat pop we discuss how nat disturb of habit and hum act hav pot facilit success invas by r ratt of the northern forest study that manip rod pop ar requir to support thes interpret of observ pattern,new,0.6646645353326992,0.6122593617555144,0.5767033121339588,0.5520965344774684,0.5348618363675124,0.5230539939534687,0.51569387426405,0.5124676901544727,0.5137099536802824,0.5207991033420908,0.5374917955675151
717,mammal_australasia,Long-term wildlife road-kill counts in New Zealand,"We compare the number of medium- sized animals (between rat and dog-size) killed on repeated counts along the same 1660 km of North Island highways in 1984,1994 and 2005 with other counts going back to 1949. Eleven mammal and 14 bird species were recorded, but Australian possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) predominated, and pukekos (Porphyrio porphyrio), mynas (Acridotheres tristis), and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibiceri) were the most common birds. Counts of possums, hedgehogs and rabbits ranged between 0.7 and 89 corpses/100 km, and changed dramatically over six decades. The possum count rose 80% between 1984 and 1994, but declined 60% by 2005. A possible irruption of hedgehogs is reported in 1988-89, followed by an 82% decline in their numbers between 1994 and 2005. Although rabbit hemorrhagic disease was introduced to New Zealand in 1997,rabbit road-kill increased 59% between 1994 and 2005. The relationship between road-kill and traffic volume indicates that roads carrying more than 3000 vehicles per day act as barriers to larger mammals, while vehicles on less busy roads are more dangerous for crossing animals. We suggest that regular counts taken at annual intervals over the same roads is a useful method for gathering information about the changing distribution and relative abundance of certain animals on a provincial or national scale and over long periods of time. Regular counts at seasonal, monthly or weekly intervals are also a rich source of information. ¬© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.",10.1080/03014220909510147,2-s2.0-70249097744,7,0.7403049970000001,0,long term wildl road kil count in new zealand we comp the numb of med siz anim between rat and dog siz kil on rep count along the sam km of nor island highway in and with oth count going back to elev mam and bird specy wer record but aust possum trichosur vulpecul hedgehog erinace europae and rabbit oryctolag cunicul predomin and pukeko porphyrio porphyrio myna acridoth trist and aust magpy gymnorhin tibicer wer the most common bird count of possum hedgehog and rabbit rang between and corps km and chang dram ov six decad the poss count ros between and but declin by a poss irrupt of hedgehog is report in follow by an declin in their numb between and although rabbit hemorrh diseas was introduc to new zealand in rabbit road kil increas between and the rel between road kil and traff volum ind that road carry mor than vehic per day act as barry to larg mam whil vehic on less busy road ar mor dang for cross anim we suggest that regul count tak at an interv ov the sam road is a us method for gath inform about the chang distribut and rel abund of certain anim on a provint or nat scal and ov long period of tim regul count at season month or week interv ar also a rich sourc of inform,new,0.7779314223334398,0.7314616870578603,0.6968800562055963,0.6706815811666582,0.6504293552337778,0.6346480147132337,0.6224966932927244,0.613594131868365,0.6080077775789661,0.6064922565527481,0.611345084574353
813,mammal_australasia,"The impact of fox control on the relative abundance of forest mammals in East Gippsland, Victoria","Predation by European red foxes is believed to be the major cause of the extinction and decline of a large number of native medium-sized terrestrial mammals in Australia. We examined the impact of poisoning of foxes on the relative abundance of a group of medium-sized mammals in an experiment conducted in three large forest blocks in south-eastern Australia. The blocks consisted of paired sites, as follows: one site where poison baiting was used to control foxes (treatment site) and one where foxes were not controlled (non-treatment site). At all six sites, the population responses of a range of mammals were measured, and compared between treatment and non-treatment sites. The relative fox abundance, as indexed by bait-take, declined during the course of the study at treatment sites and to a lesser extent at non-treatment sites. The decline in bait-take at non-treatment sites was most likely due to treatment sites acting as ecological traps, so that reduced intra-specific competition attracted foxes from non-treatment to treatment sites, where they were subsequently poisoned. There was a significant treatment effect for the abundances of total mammals, long-nosed potoroos, southern brown bandicoots and common brushtail possums, with higher abundances at treatment sites than at non-treatment sites. Common ringtail possums increased in abundance during the course of the study, with no significant difference between treatment and non-treatment sites. There was no significant effect of time or treatment on the abundance of long-nosed bandicoots. The increase in the abundance of native mammals at treatment sites was most likely due to a lower predation pressure by foxes brought about by fox control, and the smaller increase in abundance in non-treatment blocks was likely due to the ecological-trap effect because of fox baiting at treatment sites. The present study demonstrated that broad-scale fox control can lead to increases in the abundance of native mammals in forested habitats, without recourse to aerial baiting or fences. The study also demonstrated that the influence of fox control on the fox abundance can extend well beyond the perimeter of the area baited. ¬© 2009 CSIRO.",10.1071/WR08135,2-s2.0-65249129041,8,0.6778403270000001,1,the impact of fox control on the rel abund of forest mam in east gippsland victor pred by europ red fox is believ to be the maj caus of the extinct and declin of a larg numb of nat med siz terrest mam in austral we examin the impact of poison of fox on the rel abund of a group of med siz mam in an expery conduc in three larg forest block in sou eastern austral the block consist of pair sit as follow on sit wher poison bait was us to control fox tre sit and on wher fox wer not control non tre sit at al six sit the pop respons of a rang of mam wer meas and comp between tre and non tre sit the rel fox abund as index by bait tak declin dur the cours of the study at tre sit and to a less ext at non tre sit the declin in bait tak at non tre sit was most lik due to tre sit act as ecolog trap so that reduc intr spec competit attract fox from non tre to tre sit wher they wer subsequ poison ther was a sign tre effect for the abund of tot mam long nos potoroo southern brown bandicoot and common brushtail possum with high abund at tre sit than at non tre sit common ringtail possum increas in abund dur the cours of the study with no sign diff between tre and non tre sit ther was no sign effect of tim or tre on the abund of long nos bandicoot the increas in the abund of nat mam at tre sit was most lik due to a low pred press by fox brought about by fox control and the smal increas in abund in non tre block was lik due to the ecolog trap effect becaus of fox bait at tre sit the pres study demonst that broad scal fox control can lead to increas in the abund of nat mam in forest habit without recours to aer bait or fent the study also demonst that the influ of fox control on the fox abund can extend wel beyond the perimet of the are bait,new,0.7157573723604111,0.6738339035259514,0.6456335529978791,0.6263634731267694,0.6132216805219929,0.6047341880970847,0.600232722203042,0.5996496992377167,0.6035781372525837,0.61374236990573,0.6343821744742257
911,mammal_australasia,"Arid Recovery - A comparison of reptile and small mammal populations inside and outside a large rabbit, cat and fox-proof exclosure in arid South Australia","Australian arid zone mammal species within the Critical Weight Range (CWR) of 35 g-5.5 kg have suffered disproportionately in the global epidemic of contemporary faunal extinctions. CWR extinctions have been attributed largely to the effects of introduced or invasive mammals; however, the impact of these threatening processes on smaller mammals and reptiles is less clear. The change in small mammal and reptile assemblages after the removal of rabbits, cats and foxes was studied over a 6-year period in a landscape-scale exclosure in the Australian arid zone. Rodents, particularly Notomys alexis and Pseudomys bolami, increased to 15 times higher inside the feral-proof Arid Recovery Reserve compared with outside sites, where rabbits, cats and foxes were still present. Predation by cats was thought to exert the greatest influence on rodent numbers owing to the maintenance of the disparity in rodent responses through dry years and the differences in dietary preferences between rabbits and P. bolami. The presence of introduced Mus domesticus or medium-sized re-introduced mammal species did not significantly affect resident small mammal or reptile abundance. Abundance of most dasyurids and small lizards did not change significantly after the removal of feral animals although reductions in gecko populations inside the reserve may be attributable to second order trophic interactions or subtle changes in vegetation structure and cover. This study suggests that populations of rodent species in northern South Australia below the CWR may also be significantly affected by introduced cats, foxes and/or rabbits and that a taxa specific model of Australian mammal decline may be more accurate than one based on body weight. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.",10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01916.x,2-s2.0-62749108425,9,0.727372184,1,arid recovery a comparison of reptil and smal mam pop insid and outsid a larg rabbit cat and fox proof exclos in arid sou austral aust arid zon mam specy within the crit weight rang cwr of g kg hav suff disproport in the glob epidem of contemp faun extinct cwr extinct hav been attribut larg to the effect of introduc or invas mam howev the impact of thes threatening process on smal mam and reptil is less clear the chang in smal mam and reptil assembl aft the remov of rabbit cat and fox was study ov a year period in a landscap scal exclos in the aust arid zon rod particul notom alex and pseudom bolam increas to tim high insid the fer proof arid recovery reserv comp with outsid sit wher rabbit cat and fox wer stil pres pred by cat was thought to exert the greatest influ on rod numb ow to the maint of the disp in rod respons through dry year and the diff in diet pref between rabbit and p bolam the pres of introduc mus domestic or med siz re introduc mam specy did not sign affect resid smal mam or reptil abund abund of most dasyurid and smal lizard did not chang sign aft the remov of fer anim although reduc in gecko pop insid the reserv may be attribut to second ord troph interact or subtl chang in veget structure and cov thi study suggest that pop of rod specy in northern sou austral below the cwr may also be sign affect by introduc cat fox and or rabbit and that a tax spec model of aust mam declin may be mor acc than on bas on body weight,new,0.7828249909734251,0.7438071068351835,0.715039286948444,0.6932240366636634,0.6762542224877035,0.6629135456116785,0.6525357802275068,0.6448437262683046,0.6399390574988549,0.6385257668636671,0.6426599212530315
1011,mammal_australasia,Small mammal populations in a eucalypt forest affected by fire and drought. I. Long-term patterns in an era of climate change,"This paper reports a study of ground-dwelling, small mammals in coastal eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia from 1970 through 2005. During this time, the study area burnt in an intense fire in December 1972 and was partially burnt in November 1980. Both fires were associated with prolonged drought. The mammals studied comprised two dasyurid marsupials, Antechinus agilis and A. swainsonii, two native murid rodents, Rattus fuscipes and R. lutreolus, and the introduced house mouse Mus musculus. After intensive sampling throughout the year from 1970 through 1972 to establish basic ecological and population parameters of the small mammal community, populations were sampled annually during late autumn and early winter before the onset of breeding. There were marked differences in the annual (autumn/winter) abundances of all species; numbers of A. agilis ranged from 4 to 142 individuals; A. swainsonii 0 to 43; R. fuscipes 4 to 54; R. lutreolus 0 to 11; M. musculus 0 to 23. Following the 1972 fire, numbers fell to the lowest level recorded during the study and each population subsequently disappeared from the plot between the 1973 and 1974 winter censuses. The less intense 1980 fire did not lead to extirpation, but numbers of A. agilis, A. swainsonii and R. fuscipes declined as drought conditions persisted through 1983. R. lutreolus occurred consistently only following the fires, when a grassy ground vegetation favoured by this species developed. Similarly, M. musculus colonised within two years of the fires and persisted on the plot for 3-4 years before disappearing. Following the fires, populations of the omnivorous R. fuscipes recovered first followed by the scansorial, insectivorous A. agilis and last by the fossorial, insectivorous A. swainsonii. Two primary conclusions emerged from this study. First, the intense fire of 1972 did not kill all the animals immediately, but led to the disappearance of each species from the plot over 18 months. Thus, intense fire had a delayed but catastrophic impact on small ground-dwelling mammals. The fluctuations in population levels, covering more than an order of magnitude, demonstrate that factors other than fire, such as rainfall and drought, drive the population dynamics of these small mammals. As stability and recovery are not features of local populations, long-term studies of benchmark populations are necessary to manage forest biodiversity. ¬© CSIRO 2009.",10.1071/WR08086,2-s2.0-60749084174,10,0.778838719,1,smal mam pop in a eucalypt forest affect by fir and drought i long term pattern in an er of clim chang thi pap report a study of ground dwel smal mam in coast eucalypt forest in sou eastern austral from through dur thi tim the study are burnt in an intens fir in decemb and was part burnt in novemb both fir wer assocy with prolong drought the mam study compr two dasyurid marsup antechin agil and a swainsoni two nat murid rod ratt fuscip and r lutreol and the introduc hous mous mus muscul aft intend sampl throughout the year from through to est bas ecolog and pop paramet of the smal mam commun pop wer sampl an dur lat autumn and ear wint bef the onset of bree ther wer mark diff in the an autumn wint abund of al specy numb of a agil rang from to individ a swainsoni to r fuscip to r lutreol to m muscul to follow the fir numb fel to the lowest level record dur the study and each pop subsequ disappear from the plot between the and wint census the less intens fir did not lead to extirp but numb of a agil a swainsoni and r fuscip declin as drought condit persist through r lutreol occur consist on follow the fir when a grassy ground veget favo by thi specy develop simil m muscul colon within two year of the fir and persist on the plot for year bef disappear follow the fir pop of the omn r fuscip recov first follow by the scans insect a agil and last by the foss insect a swainsoni two prim conclud emerg from thi study first the intens fir of did not kil al the anim immedy but led to the disappear of each specy from the plot ov month thu intens fir had a delay but catastroph impact on smal ground dwel mam the fluctu in pop level cov mor than an ord of magnitud demonst that fact oth than fir such as rainfal and drought driv the pop dynam of thes smal mam as stabl and recovery ar not feat of loc pop long term study of benchmark pop ar necess to man forest biodivers,new,0.8057736600306327,0.7816158963901149,0.7652601742499278,0.7539605266492212,0.7461277447162493,0.740909285243536,0.7378793644376069,0.7369035257786778,0.7381210899571815,0.7420831794808062,0.7502163573601451
1115,mammal_australasia,An inventory of mammalian pests in a New Zealand city,"Urban ecosystems include many habitat types supporting native flora and fauna. These habitats may also sustain populations of introduced mammalian pests, although relatively little is known about the composition or distributions of these species in urban environments. We made a preliminary survey of the distribution and relative abundance of pest mammals across three urban habitat types (gully, amenity park, residential) in Hamilton, New Zealand. Tracking tunnel and WaxTag¬Æ surveys showed that: (1) rats (Rattus rattus or R. norvegicus), mice (Mus musculus) and brushtail possums (Tricho‚Äêsurus vulpecula) were detected most often and in highest abundances in gullies, were relatively rare in amenity parks, and were not detected in residential areas; (2) hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were regularly detected in all habitats; and (3) mustelids were not detected in any habitat. Live trapping in areas where rats were detected captured 21 rats, of which 19 were R. rattus. Scat and animal sign surveys found evidence of lagomorphs in amenity parks and gullies but not in residential areas. Cats (Felis catus) were detected in all habitats. These data suggest that important mammalian pests other than cats are either absent (mustelids) or comparatively rare (rats) in urban Hamilton and largely confined to gully habitats. Further research is needed to determine whether detection probabilities of target species vary significantly between the species and habitats we sampled, and to quantify the impact that mammalian pests might have in limiting populations of other animals, especially avifauna. ¬© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.",10.1080/03014220909510136,2-s2.0-66149100595,11,0.6465813460000001,0,an inv of mam pest in a new zealand city urb ecosystem includ many habit typ support nat flor and faun thes habit may also sustain pop of introduc mam pest although rel littl is known about the composit or distribut of thes specy in urb environ we mad a prelimin survey of the distribut and rel abund of pest mam across three urb habit typ gul am park resid in hamilton new zealand track tunnel and waxtag¬æ survey show that rat ratt ratt or r norvegic mic mus muscul and brushtail possum tricho‚äêsurus vulpecul wer detect most oft and in highest abund in gul wer rel rar in am park and wer not detect in resid area hedgehog erinace europae wer regul detect in al habit and mustelid wer not detect in any habit liv trap in area wher rat wer detect capt rat of which wer r ratt scat and anim sign survey found evid of lagomorph in am park and gul but not in resid area cat fel cat wer detect in al habit thes dat suggest that import mam pest oth than cat ar eith abs mustelid or comp rar rat in urb hamilton and larg confin to gul habit furth research is nee to determin wheth detect prob of target specy vary sign between the specy and habit we sampl and to quant the impact that mam pest might hav in limit pop of oth anim espec avifaun,new,0.6987718919475534,0.626951133126012,0.5747235775796885,0.5361891920218412,0.5070630561012751,0.4847512098005667,0.4677616878844532,0.4553561535651807,0.4474700725116325,0.4449985697835254,0.45089130794461607
1212,mammal_australasia,Common dolphins subject to fisheries impacts in Southern Australia are genetically differentiated: Implications for conservation,"Interactions between short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis and the fishing industry of South Australia (SA) have lead to serious concerns over the long-term viability of the local dolphin population. Common dolphins are gregarious animals with high vagility and are expected to display limited genetic differentiation over large spatial scales. Here, we investigate population genetic structure of southern Australian common dolphins using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and seven microsatellite markers. We found unexpected levels of genetic differentiation for short-beaked common dolphins over a distance of ‚àº1500 km. Although no genetic structure was observed in common dolphins along the coast of SA, we detected marked differentiation between dolphins from SA and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting a minimum of two genetic populations in southern Australia. We hypothesize that the ephemeral distribution of small pelagic fish enhances movement and dispersal between dolphin groups at a local level. However, clear differences in water temperature, habitat features and fish abundance between SA and Tasmania may contribute to the contemporary isolation observed between dolphin populations. Our findings have important consequences for developing conservation management strategies, because SA has the largest purse-seine fishery by weight in Australia, and substantial numbers of fatal common dolphin interactions have occurred. In 2004/2005 alone, an estimated 1728 common dolphins were encircled and 377 died over a 7-month period. If these impacts lead to a reduction in population size, it is unlikely that dolphins from the adjacent south-eastern Tasmanian population will replace the lost individuals.

1311,mammal_australasia,Spatial variation in impacts of brushtail possums on two Loranthaceous mistletoe species,"Browsing by introduced brushtail possums is linked to major declines in mistletoe abundance in New Zealand, yet in some areas mistletoes persist, apparently unaffected by the presence of possums. To determine the cause of this spatial variation in impact I investigated the abundance and condition (crown dieback and extent of possum browse cover) of two mistletoes (Alepis flavida, Peraxilla tetrapetala) and abundance and diet of possums in two mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forests in the central-eastern South Island of New Zealand. Mistletoe is common and there are long-established uncontrolled possum populations in both forests. Mistletoes were abundant (216-1359 per hectare) and important in possum diet (41-59% of total diet), but possum density was low (c. 2 per hectare) in both areas. Possum impacts were slight with low browse frequencies and intensities over much of the study sites. However, impacts were significantly greater at a forest margin, where possum abundance was highest, and at a high-altitude site where mistletoe density was lowest. Mistletoe crown dieback was inversely proportional to intensity of possum browsing. These results suggest that the persistence of abundant mistletoe populations at these sites is due to mistletoe productivity matching or exceeding consumption by possums in these forests of low possum-carrying capacity, rather than low possum preference for the local mistletoe populations. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",,2-s2.0-58149171746,13,0.630228114,0,spat vary in impact of brushtail possum on two loranthac mistleto specy brows by introduc brushtail possum is link to maj declin in mistleto abund in new zealand yet in som area mistleto persist app unaffect by the pres of possum to determin the caus of thi spat vary in impact i investig the abund and condit crown dieback and ext of poss brows cov of two mistleto alep flavid peraxill tetrapetal and abund and diet of possum in two mountain beech nothofag solandr var cliffortioid forest in the cent eastern sou island of new zealand mistleto is common and ther ar long est uncontrol poss pop in both forest mistleto wer abund per hect and import in poss diet of tot diet but poss dens was low c per hect in both area poss impact wer slight with low brows frequ and intens ov much of the study sit howev impact wer sign gre at a forest margin wher poss abund was highest and at a high altitud sit wher mistleto dens was lowest mistleto crown dieback was invers proport to intens of poss brows thes result suggest that the persist of abund mistleto pop at thes sit is due to mistleto produc match or excess consum by possum in thes forest of low poss carry capac rath than low poss pref for the loc mistleto pop,new,0.6374382637544246,0.5631881428980527,0.5121255323453017,0.47631077404565403,0.45065699220141775,0.4323125088341334,0.4197772573317915,0.412474251826467,0.41070765148451455,0.41614058685770844,0.43348313707561975
1411,mammal_australasia,Dietary overlap between the nocturnal letter-winged kite Elanus scriptus and barn owl Tyto alba during a rodent outbreak in arid Australia,"The letter-winged kite Elanus scriptus is unique in being the only truly nocturnal raptor (Falconiformes). An endemic of arid/semi-arid Australia, the kite is sympatric with the barn owl, Tyto alba, throughout most of its range. Although the letter-winged kite is nocturnal, it seems to possess intermediate degrees of adaptation for nocturnal hunting, whereas the barn owl is specialized for nocturnal activity. We studied sympatric populations of both species during a rodent population outbreak in the north-west Simpson Desert to understand how their different nocturnal adaptations influenced diet and prey selection. The commonest rodents, in order of abundance, were Pseudomys australis (body mass: 40-75 g), P. hermannsburgensis (9-17 g), and Notomys alexis (27-45 g). Rodents dominated the diets of kites (96% of 225 prey items) and owls (98% of 303 prey items). Dietary niche breadth was relatively low for both kites (BA=0.16) and owls (BA=0.13), whereas niche overlap was extremely high (O=0.98). Barn owls exhibited greater prey choice, specifically; they selected the larger P. australis and avoided the small P. hermannsburgensis, whereas kites captured Pseudomys species in proportion to their availability. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1514,mammal_australasia,The effects of an arid-zone road on vertebrates: What are the priorities for management?,"The strategic management of the impacts of roads on vertebrates is hampered by a lack of information on 1) the scale of such impacts in different ecosystems, 2) the responses of populations and communities, and 3) the relative vulnerabilities of various vertebrate groups. We therefore examined the effects of a typical road in an and ecosystem on kangaroo populations and communities, threatened small mammal species (Sminthopsis macroura and Leggadina forresti), and small mammal and lizard communities over two years. We determined which vertebrate populations and communities were negatively affected by the road, thereby informing management priorities for mitigating road effects. The study was conducted along the Silver City Highway on the UNSW Arid Zone Research Station, Fowlers Gap, in north-western New South Wales. We found that the road influenced the spatial distribution of kangaroos relative to the road, particularly those of Macropus rufus, and was associated with increased kangaroo mortality. Further, the road altered the composition of small mammal and lizard communities and reduced the abundance of S. macroura. However, roadkill of kangaroos did not significantly affect the population demographics or community composition of kangaroos. There were no changes in sex ratios (female dominance) which would threaten the sustainability of S. macroura and L. forresti populations near the road. Further, changes in the species composition of small mammal and lizard communities were likely to be localised near the road, rather than altered at larger scales, because the differences in resource availability driving community differences were restricted to a narrow band immediately adjacent to the road. Thus, none of the vertebrate taxa studied were significantly threatened by the presence of the road and its associated vehicle traffic. Even so, we recommend that management efforts focus on reducing the frequency of kangaroo roadkill (the most serious animal and human welfare issue) through encouraging the growth of shrubs and low vegetation unpalatable to kangaroos adjacent to arid-zone roads. Such a management strategy could also have positive flow-on effects for other vertebrate taxa, and could restore the natural integrity of and landscapes near roads.",,2-s2.0-58149284188,15,0.542398754,1,the effect of an arid zon road on vertebr what ar the pri for man the strategic man of the impact of road on vertebr is hamp by a lack of inform on the scal of such impact in diff ecosystem the respons of pop and commun and the rel vuln of vary vertebr group we theref examin the effect of a typ road in an and ecosystem on kangaroo pop and commun threatened smal mam specy sminthops macrour and leggadin forrest and smal mam and lizard commun ov two year we determin which vertebr pop and commun wer neg affect by the road thereby inform man pri for mitig road effect the study was conduc along the silv city highway on the unsw arid zon research stat fowl gap in nor western new sou wal we found that the road influ the spat distribut of kangaroo rel to the road particul thos of macrop ruf and was assocy with increas kangaroo mort furth the road alt the composit of smal mam and lizard commun and reduc the abund of s macrour howev roadkil of kangaroo did not sign affect the pop demograph or commun composit of kangaroo ther wer no chang in sex ratio fem domin which would threaten the sustain of s macrour and l forrest pop near the road furth chang in the specy composit of smal mam and lizard commun wer lik to be loc near the road rath than alt at larg scal becaus the diff in resourc avail driv commun diff wer restrict to a narrow band immedy adjac to the road thu non of the vertebr tax study wer sign threatened by the pres of the road and it assocy vehic traff ev so we recommend that man effort foc on reduc the frequ of kangaroo roadkil the most sery anim and hum welf issu through enco the grow of shrubs and low veget unp to kangaroo adjac to arid zon road such a man strategy could also hav posit flow on effect for oth vertebr tax and could rest the nat integr of and landscap near road,new,0.5885746998401198,0.5331013758075689,0.49721659252762124,0.4731253125034191,0.45672726474559255,0.4459514318023599,0.43983482001700436,0.4381754098697846,0.44155578140498974,0.4518982761364481,0.47428433131731906
1611,mammal_australasia,Distribution and abundance of roadkill on Tasmanian highways: Human management options,"An obvious sign of potential human impact on animal populations is roadkill. In Tasmania, this impact is perceived as relatively greater than in other Australian states, and is often noted by visitors and locals alike, such that calls for management action are common in the popular press. The goal of this three-year study was to assess the frequency and distribution of species killed on Tasmanian roads. Seasonal surveys were completed along five major routes, for a total of 154 trips. Over 15000km of road were surveyed and 5691 individuals in 54 taxa were recorded for an average roadkill density of 0.372km-1. Over 50% of encountered roadkill could be identified to species, with common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) the most common species identified, both in overall numbers and frequency of trips encountered. The 10 most common taxa accounted for 99% of the items observed. The seasonal occurrence, relationship with vehicle speed, and clustering in local hotspots for particular taxa all suggest that mitigation measures, such as vehicle speed reduction in specific areas, may be effective in reducing the number of animals killed. Mitigation measures, however, will not apply equally to all species and, in particular, success will depend on changing human behaviours. ¬© CSIRO 2008.",10.1071/WR08067,2-s2.0-56649114487,16,0.643521719,0,distribut and abund of roadkil on tasm highway hum man opt an obvy sign of pot hum impact on anim pop is roadkil in tasman thi impact is perceiv as rel gre than in oth aust stat and is oft not by visit and loc alik such that cal for man act ar common in the popul press the goal of thi three year study was to assess the frequ and distribut of specy kil on tasm road season survey wer complet along fiv maj rout for a tot of trip ov km of road wer survey and individ in tax wer record for an av roadkil dens of km ov of encount roadkil could be ident to specy with common brushtail possum trichosur vulpecul and tasm pademelon thylog billardieri the most common specy ident both in overal numb and frequ of trip encount the most common tax account for of the item observ the season occur rel with vehic spee and clust in loc hotspot for particul tax al suggest that mitig meas such as vehic spee reduc in spec area may be effect in reduc the numb of anim kil mitig meas howev wil not apply eq to al specy and in particul success wil depend on chang hum behavio,new,0.6569207432750288,0.5915967982261944,0.5468250667901697,0.5157849563747733,0.49404786719149313,0.4791236854184097,0.4697333591832954,0.46545573887378894,0.46672880340983985,0.4753573132704785,0.49626678010294456
1712,mammal_australasia,"Measurement, management and mitigation of operational interactions between the South Australian Sardine Fishery and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis)","This study arose from recommendations given in response to a legislated ecological assessment of the South Australian Sardine Fishery in 2004, urging it to: (i) attempt to mitigate operational interactions with marine mammals if excessive levels were detected; and (ii) improve the accuracy of their reporting of these events. An initial observer program revealed high rates of encirclement and mortality (1.78 and 0.39 dolphins per net-set, respectively) of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). This equated to an estimate of 1728 encirclements and 377 mortalities across the entire fleet over the same period. The average time taken for fishers to respond to encirclements was 135.93 ¬± 3.72 min and 21.3% of encircled animals subsequently died. During that time, fishers only reported 3.6% of encirclements and 1.9% of mortalities recorded by observers. A code of practice (CoP) was subsequently introduced aimed at mitigating operational interactions. A second observer program revealed a significant reductions in the observed rates of dolphin encirclement (0.22; down 87.3%) and mortality (0.01; down 97.1%) with an estimate of 169 and eight, respectively. The average time taken for fishers to respond to dolphin encirclements also reduced to 16.33 ¬± 4.67 min (down 76.9%) and the proportion of encircled animals that subsequently died reduced to 5.0%. Agreement between industry reports and observer records improved, with the fishery reporting 57.9% and 58.9% of the rate of encirclements and mortalities, respectively, recorded by observers. A number of avoidance and release strategies in the CoP may have been responsible for these improvements. In particular, fishers were required to delay or relocate their activities if dolphins were observed prior to fishing and to release encircled dolphins immediately or abort the fishing event if release procedures were unsuccessful. Future improvements to the CoP include: (i) improved response times when an encircled dolphin is detected; (ii) better use of behavioural cues for deciding when to abort a net-set; (iii) ceasing fishing during rough weather; and (iv) continuing to increase reporting accuracy by fishers. It is also recommended that the abundance, movements and boundaries of the common dolphin population in the region be determined, so that the impact of fishing activities on their status can be established.

1811,mammal_australasia,Long-term dynamics of a fragmented rainforest mammal assemblage,"Habitat fragmentation is a severe threat to tropical biotas, but its long-term effects are poorly understood. We evaluated longer-term changes in the abundance of larger (>1 kg) mammals in fragmented and intact rainforest and in riparian ""corridors"" in tropical Queensland, with data from 190 spotlighting surveys conducted in 1986-1987 and 2006-2007. In 1986-1987 when most fragments were already 20-50 years old, mammal assemblages differed markedly between fragmented and intact forest. Most vulnerable were lemuroid ringtail possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides), followed by Lumholtz's tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) and Herbert River ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus herbertensis). Further changes were evident 20 years later. Mammal species richness fell significantly in fragments, and the abundances of 4 species, coppery brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula johnstoni), green ringtail possums (Pseudochirops archeri), red-legged pademelons (Thylogale stigmatica), and tree-kangaroos, declined significantly. The most surprising finding was that the lemuroid ringtail, a strict rainforest specialist, apparently recolonized one fragment, despite a 99.98% decrease in abundance in fragments and corridors.

1912,mammal_australasia,"History of weta (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae) translocation in New Zealand: Lessons learned, islands as sanctuaries and the future","Establishing new populations by transferring founder individuals from source populations has been effective for managing the recovery of many threatened species including some weta (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae) in New Zealand. These large-bodied flightless insects are ""flagship species"" for insect conservation in New Zealand and many are rare or threatened. The declining abundance of most weta species, particularly giant weta, can be attributed to the introduction of mammalian predators, habitat destruction, and habitat modification by introduced mammalian browsers. New populations of some weta have been established in locations, particularly on islands, where these threats have been eliminated or severely reduced in order to reduce the risk of extinction. Some populations were established to provide food for endemic vertebrates, ecosystem restoration and ready access for the general public. We illustrate how methods for both transferring weta and monitoring them have become more sophisticated by using a series of case studies. Other transfers of weta not included in the case studies are also summarised. We conclude by re-iterating the importance of documenting the transfer and post-release monitoring for all insect transfers, both for biogeographical reasons and to provide information to improve future transfers. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",10.1007/s10841-008-9154-5,2-s2.0-44949202446,19,0.592767331,0,hist of wet orthopter anostostomatida transloc in new zealand lesson learn island as sanctu and the fut est new pop by transfer found individ from sourc pop has been effect for man the recovery of many threatened specy includ som wet orthopter anostostomatida in new zealand thes larg body flightless insect ar flag specy for insect conserv in new zealand and many ar rar or threatened the declin abund of most wet specy particul giant wet can be attribut to the introduc of mam pred habit destruct and habit mod by introduc mam brows new pop of som wet hav been est in loc particul on island wher thes threats hav been elimin or sev reduc in ord to reduc the risk of extinct som pop wer est to provid food for endem vertebr ecosystem rest and ready access for the gen publ we illust how method for both transfer wet and monit them hav becom mor soph by us a sery of cas study oth transf of wet not includ in the cas study ar also summ we conclud by re it the import of docu the transf and post releas monit for al insect transf both for biogeograph reason and to provid inform to improv fut transf,new,0.6222424435227257,0.5757251237852202,0.5449381784214763,0.5245630911000696,0.5115177820254458,0.5042233735874161,0.5020700564198415,0.5052540556914618,0.5149911194720489,0.5344163070868678,0.5712368496350925
2012,mammal_australasia,Population dynamics and prey selection of native and introduced predators during a rodent outbreak in arid Australia,"We examined population dynamics and trophic ecology of a predator-prey system in the Simpson Desert, Australia, consisting of an assemblage of small mammals (body mass < 100 g) and 4 species of predators: the endemic letter-winged kite (Elanus scriptus), a nocturnal-hunting rodent specialist; and 3 introduced mammalian predators (dingo [Canis lupus dingo], European red fox [Vulpes vulpes], and house cat [Felis catus]). This is the 1st comprehensive study of the responses of both the kite and introduced carnivores to a rodent outbreak. The 3.5-year study period included a population outbreak of about 24 months duration involving 3 native rodent species. Mammalian predators and kites exhibited similar population responses. Kites immigrated into the area within 6 months of the outbreak commencing, and remained while rodent abundance was high; however, all birds left the area after rodent populations crashed within a 6-week period. Dingoes and foxes were more abundant than cats and both species increased during the outbreak. All carnivores were resident. The letter-winged kite fed almost entirely on rodents. Rodents were the main prey of the 3 mammalian predators during the outbreak; however, all species had intermediate niche breadths. Dietary overlap between the kite and each carnivore was high during the rodent outbreak. During a nonoutbreak period, predation on rodents by the red fox remained high, whereas that by the dingo declined.

2311,mammal_australasia,Predictors of clutch predation of a globally significant avifauna in New Zealand's braided river ecosystems,"Predation by introduced mammals is decimating New Zealand's indigenous fauna. Understanding factors that influence this process allows resources for predator control to be applied with maximum effect. This study examines how predation of a secondary prey species (a relatively common but declining native plover, the banded dotterel Charadrius bicinctus) varied with reductions in abundance of a major prey source (rabbits), kill-trapping of predators, nest density and habitat complexity. Banded dotterels mostly nest in open braided riverbeds alongside a number of endemic threatened species. We measured the fate of 753 dotterel clutches exposed to predation by cats, ferrets and hedgehogs. We found key times and places of high predation risk. Immediately after widespread reduction in rabbit populations by rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), clutch predation rates were almost as high (mean, 50%) as those recorded during past rabbit poisoning programmes (mean, 57%). Both rates were significantly higher than the mean predation rate of 22% without rabbit control, suggesting a shift in predator diet immediately after rabbit population declines. Unlike after rabbit poisoning, clutch predation rate remained high in the years after RHD. Other patterns observed included higher clutch predation rate where nest density was lower, suggesting that predation can potentially cause local extinction. Clutch predation was also higher along riverbed margins where vegetation was dense. There was equivocal evidence for an effect of predator kill-trapping on clutch predation rate. Management strategies that could potentially reduce clutch predation risks include focusing predator mitigation measures during periods of rabbit decline, maintaining them for more than one breeding season if the rabbit declines are widespread (e.g. RHD epidemics), and applying greater effort at sites with relatively low nest density and along riverbed margins where predator use is more frequent. ¬© Journal compilation ¬© 2007 The Zoological Society of London.",10.1111/j.1469-1795.2007.00142.x,2-s2.0-38949157734,23,0.73623222,0,predict of clutch pred of a glob sign avifaun in new zealand s braid riv ecosystem pred by introduc mam is decim new zealand s indig faun understand fact that influ thi process allow resourc for pred control to be apply with maxim effect thi study examin how pred of a second prey specy a rel common but declin nat plov the band dotterel charadri bicinct vary with reduc in abund of a maj prey sourc rabbit kil trap of pred nest dens and habit complex band dotterel most nest in op braid riverb alongsid a numb of endem threatened specy we meas the fat of dotterel clutch expos to pred by cat ferret and hedgehog we found key tim and plac of high pred risk immedy aft widespread reduc in rabbit pop by rabbit haemorrh diseas rhd clutch pred rat wer almost as high mean as thos record dur past rabbit poison program mean both rat wer sign high than the mean pred rat of without rabbit control suggest a shift in pred diet immedy aft rabbit pop declin unlik aft rabbit poison clutch pred rat remain high in the year aft rhd oth pattern observ includ high clutch pred rat wher nest dens was low suggest that pred can pot caus loc extinct clutch pred was also high along riverb margin wher veget was dens ther was equivoc evid for an effect of pred kil trap on clutch pred rat man strategies that could pot reduc clutch pred risk includ focus pred mitig meas dur period of rabbit declin maintain them for mor than on bree season if the rabbit declin ar widespread e g rhd epidem and apply gre effort at sit with rel low nest dens and along riverb margin wher pred us is mor frequ,new,0.7841557985132022,0.7415763237417301,0.7091244979156809,0.6840191369686248,0.6642091755957231,0.6484022013731928,0.635814893538487,0.6260206659621005,0.6189048255736375,0.61475942861788,0.6147298495802986
298,mammal_australasia,Attempting to manage complex predator-prey interactions fails to avert imminent extinction of a threatened New Zealand skink population,"The current primary threats to biodiversity on a global scale are species invasions and habitat modification. Management of vulnerable populations often involves a lengthy sequence of 1) research to identify threats and recommend management strategies, 2) active management, and 3) results monitoring to assess effectiveness of management. The last mainland population of the large, endemic New Zealand skink (Whitaker's skink [Cyclodina whitakeri]) provides an opportunity to test this process in a system where the synergistic effects between invasive species (introduced rodents and grasses) have predicted outcomes. A low abundance of Whitaker's skink at the Pukerua Bay Scientific Reserve in the 1980s prompted management recommendations to remove grazing stock and revegetate the site to simultaneously restore habitat and provide protection against introduced mammalian predators. Since Whitaker's skink have low detectability, it was recommended that sympatric copper skink (C. aenea) be used an indicator species of management effectiveness. Grazing stock were removed in 1987, but efforts to revegetate the site were ineffective. Long-term monitoring (1984-2006) of the Whitaker's skink population and 4 other sympatric lizard species within a 336-m area at the site resulted in 1,693 lizard captures over 7,597 trap days. Whitaker's skink represented 2.8% of all captures in 1984-1988, but declined relative to other species to represent only 0.2% of captures in 2000-2006 (representing 2 individuals). Congeneric copper skink showed a similar decline with capture rates also approaching zero by 2006. Removing grazing stock did not result in an increased abundance of Whitaker's skink or copper skink through improved habitat quality, as was intended by the management recommendation. Instead, reduced grazing has allowed introduced seeding grasses to proliferate, which may have led to periodic rodent irruptions, supporting a guild of introduced mammalian predators and depleting populations of Whitaker's skink and copper skink. In this instance, attempted protection may have driven a vulnerable population towards extinction. We recommend investigating the feasibility of constructing a mammal-proof fence around the core Whitaker's skink habitat, as the last remaining management option to salvage the population.",10.2193/2006-488,2-s2.0-48249140174,29,0.783080545,1,attempt to man complex pred prey interact fail to avert immin extinct of a threatened new zealand skink pop the cur prim threats to biodivers on a glob scal ar specy invas and habit mod man of vuln pop oft involv a lengthy sequ of research to ident threats and recommend man strategies act man and result monit to assess effect of man the last mainland pop of the larg endem new zealand skink whitak s skink cyclodin whitaker provid an opportun to test thi process in a system wher the synerg effect between invas specy introduc rod and grass hav predict outcom a low abund of whitak s skink at the pukeru bay sci reserv in the s prompt man recommend to remov graz stock and reveget the sit to simult rest habit and provid protect against introduc mam pred sint whitak s skink hav low detect it was recommend that symp cop skink c aene be us an ind specy of man effect graz stock wer remov in but effort to reveget the sit wer ineffect long term monit of the whitak s skink pop and oth symp lizard specy within a m are at the sit result in lizard capt ov trap day whitak s skink repres of al capt in but declin rel to oth specy to repres on of capt in repres individ cong cop skink show a simil declin with capt rat also approach zero by remov graz stock did not result in an increas abund of whitak s skink or cop skink through improv habit qual as was intend by the man recommend instead reduc graz has allow introduc see grass to prol which may hav led to period rod irrupt support a guild of introduc mam pred and deplet pop of whitak s skink and cop skink in thi inst attempt protect may hav driv a vuln pop toward extinct we recommend investig the feas of construct a mam proof fent around the cor whitak s skink habit as the last remain man opt to salv the pop,new,0.8087333161391306,0.7770691748200135,0.7530943391705625,0.7344929950238072,0.7197367791618166,0.7079109875409568,0.6984967086913607,0.6912640248504835,0.6862721854922463,0.6840401704035505,0.6861535106831679

At the time of European settlement the quokka was widespread and abundant and its distribution encompassed an area of approximately 41 200 km2 of south-west Western Australia inclusive of two offshore islands, Bald Island and Rottnest Island. Historical reports indicated an extensive population decline occurred in the 1930s. The decline continued, with a previously undocumented decline apparent in the period from 1980 to 1992. However, this decline may be an artefact of the time scales used for mapping and may well equate with a previously reported decline for a suite of south-west mammals in the 1970s. By 1992 the quokka's distribution had been reduced to an area of approximately 17 800 km2. An increased awareness of the presence of the quokka on the mainland has resulted in numerous rcportings of quokka presence since 1992, has confirmed the existence of several populations at the northern extent of the quokka's known geographic range and indicated the current, 2005, distribution to be similar to that in 1992. However, survey and population estimates at six of these mainland locations from the northern jarrah forest indicated low abundance. There have been no population estimates elsewhere on the mainland. Two populations have been reported from the Swan Coastal Plain, but neither has been confirmed extant. Predation by the introduced fox, Vulpes vulpes, is implicated as a major cause of the quokka's initial decline, while ongoing predation, habitat destruction and modification through altered fire regimes have contributed to the continued decline. Specific conservation management actions are recommended, namely: (i) Implementing an active adaptive management program in the northern jarrah forest to determine quokka population response to habitat manipulation through the use of fire, fox baiting and pig control; (ii) Surveying the Stirling Range and Green Range populations with emphasis placed on determining population size and population genetic structure; (iii) Surveying the reported occurrences from the Swan Coastal Plain, with emphasis on unambiguously determining presence. If confirmed, priority should be directed to assessing population size and determining the management requirements to ensure persistence of the population; (iv) Surveying southern forest and south coast populations to assess quokka population size, the extent of movement between subpopulations and assessment of the range of habitat types used by quokkas. The latter should be combined with spatial analyses of known extant populations and suitable and potentially suitable habitat; (v) Determining the role of fire in establishing and maintaining preferred habitat of southern forest and south coast populations; and (vi) Establishing a program to assess the potential effects from management operations.",,2-s2.0-36248949718,30,0.8984204840000001,1,review of the distribut caus for the declin and recommend for man of the quokk setonix brachyur macropodida marsupial an endem macropolid marsup from sou west western austral the form and cur distribut of the quokk setonix brachyur was map from publ and al avail unpubl record at the tim of europ settl the quokk was widespread and abund and it distribut encompass an are of approxim km of sou west western austral includ of two offsh island bald island and rottnest island hist report ind an extend pop declin occur in the s the declin continu with a prevy undocu declin app in the period from to howev thi declin may be an artefact of the tim scal us for map and may wel equ with a prevy report declin for a suit of sou west mam in the s by the quokk s distribut had been reduc to an are of approxim km an increas aw of the pres of the quokk on the mainland has result in num rcportings of quokk pres sint has confirm the ex of sev pop at the northern ext of the quokk s known geograph rang and ind the cur distribut to be simil to that in howev survey and pop estim at six of thes mainland loc from the northern jarrah forest ind low abund ther hav been no pop estim elsewh on the mainland two pop hav been report from the swan coast plain but neith has been confirm ext pred by the introduc fox vulp vulp is imply as a maj caus of the quokk s init declin whil ongo pred habit destruct and mod through alt fir regim hav contribut to the continu declin spec conserv man act ar recommend nam i impl an act adapt man program in the northern jarrah forest to determin quokk pop respons to habit manip through the us of fir fox bait and pig control ii survey the stirl rang and green rang pop with emphas plac on determin pop siz and pop genet structure ii survey the report occur from the swan coast plain with emphas on unambigu determin pres if confirm pri should be direct to assess pop siz and determin the man requir to ens persist of the pop iv survey southern forest and sou coast pop to assess quokk pop siz the ext of mov between subpop and assess of the rang of habit typ us by quokka the lat should be combin with spat analys of known ext pop and suit and pot suit habit v determin the rol of fir in est and maintain prefer habit of southern forest and sou coast pop and vi est a program to assess the pot effect from man op,new,0.9226013595268089,0.8980542499048539,0.8768711213100034,0.8583818032117071,0.8417306265730559,0.8261982934357569,0.811148007887719,0.7958999842437743,0.779521946628297,0.7603593857230887,0.7347744267335611

355,mammal_australasia,Habitat factors related to wild rabbit population trends after the initial impact of rabbit haemorrhagic disease,"The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is an introduced pest species in Australia and New Zealand. Rabbits have a devastating negative impact on agricultural production and biodiversity in these countries, and Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD) is currently included in control strategies for rabbit populations. On the other hand, the European wild rabbit is a key native prey species in the Iberian Peninsula. Since the arrival of RHD, however, rabbit populations have undergone dramatic decreases and several predator species at risk of extinction are currently dependent on the rabbit population density. Therefore, from the point of view of biodiversity conservation, evaluating habitat correlates and trends of rabbit populations after the first RHD epizootic is of great interest to improve the long-term control or promotion of wild rabbit populations. We estimated the relationship between habitat factors and long-term population trends as well as the relationships between habitat factors and rabbit abundance 2 and 14 years after the arrival of RHD in several Iberian rabbit populations. We observed that only 26% of surveyed populations seemed to experience an increase in rabbit abundance over the last 12 years and that this increase was higher in the low-rabbit-abundance areas of l992, leading to high rabbit abundance in 2004. Our results suggested that short- and long-term impacts of RHD were related to habitat quality. The initial impact of RHD was higher in more suitable habitats, but increasing long-term population trends were positively related to good habitat quality. ¬© CSIRO 2006.",10.1071/WR05107,2-s2.0-33749373839,35,0.732902355,1,habit fact rel to wild rabbit pop trend aft the init impact of rabbit haemorrh diseas the europ wild rabbit oryctolag cunicul is an introduc pest specy in austral and new zealand rabbit hav a devast neg impact on agricult produc and biodivers in thes country and rabbit haemorrh diseas rhd is cur includ in control strategies for rabbit pop on the oth hand the europ wild rabbit is a key nat prey specy in the ib peninsul sint the ar of rhd howev rabbit pop hav undergon dram decreas and sev pred specy at risk of extinct ar cur depend on the rabbit pop dens theref from the point of view of biodivers conserv evalu habit correl and trend of rabbit pop aft the first rhd epizoot is of gre interest to improv the long term control or promot of wild rabbit pop we estim the rel between habit fact and long term pop trend as wel as the rel between habit fact and rabbit abund and year aft the ar of rhd in sev ib rabbit pop we observ that on of survey pop seem to expery an increas in rabbit abund ov the last year and that thi increas was high in the low rabbit abund area of l lead to high rabbit abund in our result suggest that short and long term impact of rhd wer rel to habit qual the init impact of rhd was high in mor suit habit but increas long term pop trend wer posit rel to good habit qual,new,0.7415749482362374,0.7222979976232217,0.7104061166435193,0.7032415521268468,0.6994621498646634,0.6984465056463253,0.7000089792756437,0.7043293378413514,0.7120577391122612,0.7247264002013886,0.7459104564939748

An aerial survey using a helicopter was considered more efficient than ground survey because of the size of the area, relatively high relief and dense tree cover, and the need for regular monitoring. Tree cover and landscape relief was used to stratify the five RLPB districts into areas of probable high, medium and low kangaroo density. Kangaroo density estimated from helicopter surveys conducted in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales was used to suggest densities and thereby allocate survey effort in each stratum.

463,mammal_australasia,Should managed populations be monitored every year?,"We often need to estimate the size of wild populations to determine the appropriate management action, for example, to set a harvest quota. Monitoring is usually planned under the assumption that it must be carried out at fixed intervals in time, typically annually, before the harvest quota is set. However, monitoring can be very expensive, and we should weigh the cost of monitoring against the improvement that it makes in decision making. A less costly alternative to monitoring annually is to predict the population size using a population model and information from previous surveys. In this paper, the problem of monitoring frequency is posed within a decision-theory framework. We discover that a monitoring regime that varies according to the state of the system can outperform fixed-interval monitoring. This idea is illustrated using data for a red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) population in South Australia. Whether or not one should monitor in a given year is dependent on the estimated population density in the previous year, the uncertainty in that population estimate, and past rainfall. We discover that monitoring is important when a model-based prediction of population density is very uncertain. This may occur if monitoring has not taken place for several years, or if rainfall has been above average. Monitoring is also important when prior information suggests that the population is near a critical threshold in population abundance. However, monitoring is less important when the optimal management action would not be altered by new information. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[0807:SMPBME]2.0.CO;2,2-s2.0-33646142072,46,0.7838286870000001,1,should man pop be monit every year we oft nee to estim the siz of wild pop to determin the appropry man act for exampl to set a harvest quot monit is us plan und the assum that it must be carry out at fix interv in tim typ an bef the harvest quot is set howev monit can be very expend and we should weigh the cost of monit against the improv that it mak in decid mak a less cost altern to monit an is to predict the pop siz us a pop model and inform from prevy survey in thi pap the problem of monit frequ is pos within a decid the framework we discov that a monit regim that vary accord to the stat of the system can outperform fix interv monit thi ide is illust us dat for a red kangaroo macrop ruf pop in sou austral wheth or not on should monit in a giv year is depend on the estim pop dens in the prevy year the uncertainty in that pop estim and past rainfal we discov that monit is import when a model bas predict of pop dens is very uncertain thi may occ if monit has not tak plac for sev year or if rainfal has been abov av monit is also import when pri inform suggest that the pop is near a crit threshold in pop abund howev monit is less import when the optim man act would not be alt by new inform,new,0.7803603868516598,0.7535733565176849,0.7344733821571426,0.7206814705474315,0.7107616595779942,0.703931781285238,0.699839818531763,0.6984931847802632,0.700341543666993,0.7066293175410966,0.7205001722605964

Though both species are not permanent residents in Cleveland Bay, they both used the area regularly from year to year following a model of emigration and reimmigration. Individuals of both species spend periods of days to a month or more in coastal waters of Cleveland Bay before leaving, and periods of over a month outside the study area before entering the bay again. Because of their small population sizes and movement patterns, snubfin and humpback dolphins are particularly vulnerable to local extinction. Our results illustrate that: (1) detection of population trends should not be a necessary criterion for enacting conservation measures of both species in this region, and (2) efforts to maintain viable populations of both species in Cleveland Bay must include management strategies that integrate anthropogenic activities in surrounding areas. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

582,mammal_australasia,Historical marine population estimates: Triggers or targets for conservation? The dugong case study,"Recent studies have estimated the historical abundance of large marine vertebrates to determine potential targets for conservation. We evaluated this approach using 1990s aerial survey estimates of dugong abundance and an estimate of the decline in dugong numbers since the 1960s based on changes in the catch per unit effort of dugong bycatch in a government shark control program on the east coast of Queensland, Australia. This analysis indicated that the catch rate of dugongs caught in shark nets, at six locations between latitudes 16.5¬∞ S and 28¬∞ S, declined at an average of 8.7% per year between 1962 and 1999. This represents a decline to 3.1% of initial catch rates over the sampling period. If the changes in the populations sampled by the shark nets and aerial surveys were equivalent, this result suggests that the region supported 72 000 dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4220 dugongs in the mid-1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region is currently insufficient to support 72 000 dugongs, suggesting that our hindcast estimate may be an unrealistic target for recovery. Nonetheless, the evidence of serious dugong decline from the shark-net data and other sources has triggered significant conservation initiatives. This case study indicates that comparisons between historical and contemporary estimates of the abundance of large marine vertebrates can be powerful qualitative triggers for conservation action, but that quantitative targets for recovery require systematic testing of the assumptions underlying hindcast estimates, scientific evaluation of the current carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the target species, and consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. For some species, it may be more productive to set anthropogenic mortality targets that are designed to enable the population to recover to its optimum sustainable population than to set recovery targets per se. ¬© 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",10.1890/04-0673,2-s2.0-15944418980,58,0.8343572090000001,1,hist marin pop estim trig or target for conserv the dugong cas study rec study hav estim the hist abund of larg marin vertebr to determin pot target for conserv we evalu thi approach us s aer survey estim of dugong abund and an estim of the declin in dugong numb sint the s bas on chang in the catch per unit effort of dugong bycatch in a govern shark control program on the east coast of queensland austral thi analys ind that the catch rat of dugong caught in shark net at six loc between latitud ¬∞ s and ¬∞ s declin at an av of per year between and thi repres a declin to of init catch rat ov the sampl period if the chang in the pop sampl by the shark net and aer survey wer equ thi result suggest that the reg support dugong in the ear s comp with an estim dugong in the mid s the seagrass habit in the reg is cur insufficy to support dugong suggest that our hindcast estim may be an unr target for recovery nonetheless the evid of sery dugong declin from the shark net dat and oth sourc has trig sign conserv in thi cas study ind that comparison between hist and contemp estim of the abund of larg marin vertebr can be pow qualit trig for conserv act but that quantit target for recovery requir system test of the assum und hindcast estim sci evalu of the cur carry capac of the ecosystem for the target specy and consult with a broad rang of stakehold for som specy it may be mor produc to set anthropog mort target that ar design to en the pop to recov to it optim sustain pop than to set recovery target per se,new,0.8165040842190281,0.7638473157466751,0.7213774428646196,0.6872216065319818,0.6593810767118096,0.6364362255758164,0.6174803159208142,0.6020253637232004,0.59001613315878,0.5820475062917845,0.5802085925428712
643,mammal_australasia,"Change in abundance of dugongs in Shark Bay, Ningaloo and Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia: Evidence for large-scale migration","The third in a series of five-yearly aerial surveys for dugongs in Shark Bay, Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth Gulf was conducted in July 1999. The first two surveys provided evidence of an apparently stable population of dugongs, with ‚àº1000 animals in each of Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef, and 10000 in Shark Bay. We report estimates of less than 200 for each of Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef and ‚àº14000 for Shark Bay. This is an apparent overall increase in the dugong population over this whole region, but with a distributional shift of animals to the south. The most plausible hypothesis to account for a large component of this apparent population shift is that animals in Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef moved to Shark Bay, most likely after Tropical Cyclone Vance impacted available dugong forage in the northern habitat. Bias associated with survey estimate methodology, and normal changes in population demographics may also have contributed to the change. The movement of large numbers of dugongs over the scale we suggest has important management implications. First, such habitat-driven shifts in regional abundance will need to be incorporated in assessing the effectiveness of marine protected areas that aim to protect dugongs and their habitat. Second, in circumstances where aerial surveys are used to estimate relative trends in abundance of dugongs, animal movements of the type we propose could lead to errors in interpretation.",10.1071/WR02073,2-s2.0-4344674757,64,0.775613346,1,chang in abund of dugong in shark bay ningaloo and exmou gulf western austral evid for larg scal migr the third in a sery of fiv year aer survey for dugong in shark bay ningaloo reef and exmou gulf was conduc in july the first two survey provid evid of an app stabl pop of dugong with ‚àº anim in each of exmou gulf and ningaloo reef and in shark bay we report estim of less than for each of exmou gulf and ningaloo reef and ‚àº for shark bay thi is an app overal increas in the dugong pop ov thi whol reg but with a distribut shift of anim to the sou the most plaus hypothes to account for a larg compon of thi app pop shift is that anim in exmou gulf and ningaloo reef mov to shark bay most lik aft trop cyclon vant impact avail dugong for in the northern habit bia assocy with survey estim methodolog and norm chang in pop demograph may also hav contribut to the chang the mov of larg numb of dugong ov the scal we suggest has import man imply first such habit driv shift in reg abund wil nee to be incorp in assess the effect of marin protect area that aim to protect dugong and their habit second in circumst wher aer survey ar us to estim rel trend in abund of dugong anim mov of the typ we propos could lead to er in interpret,new,0.7404139429075489,0.6775823736827243,0.6299903807871802,0.5937397289610731,0.5657300999603823,0.5439882990845724,0.5273624812636877,0.5153329867559222,0.5080320798916323,0.5066082064641751,0.5145258319853325

We report on a co-operative project between Maori landowners, the Department of Conservation, and Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research researchers to restore a Northland kukupa population and to examine kukupa nesting success in relation to pest abundance. Ship rats and possums were targeted by trapping and poisoning throughout Motatau Forest (350 ha) from 1997 to 1999; only possums were targeted in 2000. All 13 kukupa nests located before pest control started in late 1997 failed at the egg stage, but all seven nests located in 1998-99 successfully fledged young when trapping and tracking indices of possums and ship rats were less than 4%. After pest control, counts of kukupa and some other bird species increased at Motatau compared with counts in a nearby non-treatment block, suggesting numbers of adult kukupa can be increased in small forest areas by intensive pest control. This increase is due at least partly to increased nest success. Evidence from time-lapse video cameras, sign remaining at nests, and nest success rates under different pest control regimes suggest both ship rats and possums are important predators at kukupa nests. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",,2-s2.0-4344689239,65,0.7361223109999999,0,respons of kukup hemiphag novaeseelandia and oth bird to mam pest control at motatau northland the kukup or new zealand pigeon hemiphag novaeseelandia is grad declin on the new zealand mainland due most to pred by introduc pest mam includ ship rat ratt ratt and brushtail possum trichosur vulpecul we report on a co op project between maor landown the depart of conserv and manaak whenu landc research research to rest a northland kukup pop and to examin kukup nest success in rel to pest abund ship rat and possum wer target by trap and poison throughout motatau forest ha from to on possum wer target in al kukup nest loc bef pest control start in lat fail at the eg stag but al sev nest loc in success fledg young when trap and track ind of possum and ship rat wer less than aft pest control count of kukup and som oth bird specy increas at motatau comp with count in a nearby non tre block suggest numb of adult kukup can be increas in smal forest area by intend pest control thi increas is due at least part to increas nest success evid from tim laps video camera sign remain at nest and nest success rat und diff pest control regim suggest both ship rat and possum ar import pred at kukup nest,new,0.7461806235372522,0.7029273178668392,0.6717558532802169,0.6491882287778202,0.6328374854181698,0.621326157535437,0.6139823603709045,0.610709657449222,0.6120871740318967,0.6198791659351021,0.6385894252913608

In this aerial line-transect survey for Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) we recorded dive times from a helicopter to estimate the proportion of time that dolphins could be seen at or near the water surface and were therefore ""available"" to be counted. The proportion of available sightings that were counted on transect lines was estimated by comparing sightings by two independent teams of two observers in the fixed-wing plane. The survey covered the area between Farewell Spit and Milford Sound, off the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Survey effort was stratified according to existing distribution data. A total of 142 separate sightings was made on 1,355 km of trackline. Average availability for fifty Hector's dolphin groups observed from the helicopter (161 dive/surface cycles) was 46.3% (CV = 4.2%). Data from the two independent observer teams indicated that 96.2% (CV = 2.3%) of the dolphin groups that were at the surface and on the trackline were seen.

70,mammal_australasia,A comparison of 3 aerial survey techniques to estimate wild horse abundance in the Australian Alps,"Estimates of the size or density of wildlife populations are essential for effective management. Aerial surveys often are the only practical way of obtaining these estimates for large mammals ranging over a large area. Different aerial survey techniques are available. This paper reports on a study that estimated abundance and population density of wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Australian Alps using helicopter aerial surveys. Three frequently used techniques were compared simultaneously: strip counts, mark-recapture, and line transect. Using data on horse groups over a strip width of 200 m, estimates of horse abundance from mark-recapture analyses were higher (NÃÇ = 3,045 modified Petersen and NÃÇ = 3,298 Huggins estimators, respectively) than from strip counts (NÃÇ = 1,814 and NÃÇ = 2,242 for observers 1 and 2, respectively). Use of line-transect analysis yielded the highest estimates of abundance (NÃÇ = 5,200-5,830, population density DÃÇ = 1.86-2.09 km -2). The coefficient of variation (CV) of estimates varied from 22% for strip counts (0-50 m) to 28% for mark-recapture analysis (0-50 m) and 31-32% for line-transect analysis (0-200 m). Mark-recapture estimates of horse abundance from the modified Petersen estimator were substantially lower when the strip width was 200 m (NÃÇ = 2,061) compared with a strip width of 50 m (NÃÇ = 4,345). These results suggested that in aerial surveys using strip or mark-recapture analyses, the effect of wide strip width should be examined; otherwise estimates may be strongly negatively biased. Observer 1 estimated mean group size of 4.91¬±0.61 SE horses and observer 2 estimated mean group size as 3.79¬±0.57 SE horses. Mean group size observed from the ground was 5.65¬±0.51 SE.

The Australian northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii) is one of the world's most endangered mammals, but precise abundance estimation by trapping surveys has proven exceedingly difficult. A mark-recapture study was conducted in the sole remaining L. krefftii population, based on microsatellite identification of individuals and their gender from DNA in remotely collected single hairs. Population size was estimated to be 113 (95% confidence interval of 96 to 150). This suggests an increase in population size over the previous estimate of 65 (95% CI 42-186) in 1993, although the estimates did not differ significantly. There was a significant male bias in the sex ratio (2.25 males: 1 female), in agreement with recent trapping surveys. The non-invasive approach used here is vital for estimating population size and trends, and hence it is the most important recent advance in the conservation management of the northern hairy-nosed wombat. ¬© 2003 The Zoological Society of London.",10.1017/S1367943003003135,2-s2.0-1642579286,72,0.819005402,1,demograph monit of an entir specy the northern hairy nos womb lasiorhin kreffti by genet analys of non invas collect mat success man of endang specy may be gre facilit by the abl to monit pop trend the aust northern hairy nos womb lasiorhin kreffti is on of the world s most endang mam but prec abund estim by trap survey has prov excess difficult a mark recapt study was conduc in the sol remain l kreffti pop bas on microsatellit id of individ and their gend from dna in remot collect singl hair pop siz was estim to be confid interv of to thi suggest an increas in pop siz ov the prevy estim of ci in although the estim did not diff sign ther was a sign mal bia in the sex ratio mal fem in agr with rec trap survey the non invas approach us her is vit for estim pop siz and trend and hent it is the most import rec adv in the conserv man of the northern hairy nos womb,new,0.834897968693834,0.7982753047554006,0.7698631400893904,0.7476418601693122,0.7299741578456999,0.7158123539664971,0.7045497050007449,0.6959298521738807,0.6900755431172918,0.6877133864657657,0.6909874506017994
250,mammal_neotropic,Numerical and functional response of predators to a long-term decline in mammalian prey at a semi-arid Neotropical site,"Occurrence and diet of ten carnivorous predators (four falconiforms, four owls, and two foxes), and population levels of their mammalian prey, were monitored over 45 months at a semi-arid site in north-central Chile. Early in this period, small mammals irrupted and then declined markedly to a density 7% of that at peak. All four falconiforms (Buteo polyosoma, Falco sparverius, Geranoaetus melanoleucus, Parabuteo unicinctus) and one owl (Tyto alba) responded numerically to the decline in mammalian prey by virtually abandoning the study site. The three other owls (Athene cunicularia, Bubo virginianus, Glaucidium nanum) and the two foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus and P. griseus) remained. With few exceptions, throughout the study predators maintained species-specific preferences among small mammal species regardless of the absolute and proportional abundance of these prev. At no time did the two prey species most responsible for the irruption (the rodents Phyllotis darwini and Akodon olivaceus) occur in predators' diets out of proportion to their estimated relative abundance in the field. Predators were clearly unable to prevent the irruption from occurring. Given the absence of a clear functional response to the most irruptive species, predators seemed unlikely to have been responsible for the observed crash. At present, however, predators may be prolonging the crash and delaying the return of small-mammal populations to typical densities. ¬© 1992 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/BF00319020,2-s2.0-0027075279,62,0.7702283288459479,1,num and funct respons of pred to a long term declin in mam prey at a sem arid neotrop sit occur and diet of ten carn pred four falconiform four owl and two fox and pop level of their mam prey wer monit ov month at a sem arid sit in nor cent chil ear in thi period smal mam irrupt and then declin mark to a dens of that at peak al four falconiform buteo polyosom falco sparveri geranoaet melanoleuc parabuteo unicinct and on owl tyto alb respond num to the declin in mam prey by virt abandon the study sit the three oth owl ath cunicular bubo virginian glaucid nan and the two fox pseudalopex culpae and p grise remain with few exceiv throughout the study pred maintain specy spec pref among smal mam specy regardless of the absolv and proport abund of thes prev at no tim did the two prey specy most respons for the irrupt the rod phyllot darwin and akodon olivace occ in pred diet out of proport to their estim rel abund in the field pred wer clear un to prev the irrupt from occur giv the abs of a clear funct respons to the most irrupt specy pred seem unlik to hav been respons for the observ crash at pres howev pred may be prolong the crash and delay the return of smal mam pop to typ dens,new,0.8216819590000226,0.7816207297293677,0.7508974555882393,0.7267848841407023,0.7072735759998596,0.6911139619938885,0.6775398243531673,0.6660956612960595,0.6565715622559215,0.6490547842296632,0.644264984495757
326,mammal_neotropic,A long-term study on the dynamics of guild structure among predatory vertebrates at a semi-arid Neotropical site,"Diets and populations of 10 species of predatory vertebrates (two foxes, four falconiforms, four owls) were monitored in semi-desert scrub at Auco, Chile. Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors",10.2307/3545099,2-s2.0-0027386301,61,0.7793025358190121,1,a long term study on the dynam of guild structure among pred vertebr at a sem arid neotrop sit diet and pop of specy of pred vertebr two fox four falconiform four owl wer monit in sem desert scrub at auco chil pellet bird and fec fox collect month contain ident remain of smal mam bird reptil amphib larg insect oth arthropod and in som fox fec fruit for non mam prey season vary in avail appear to be mor pronount than long term vary avail of the eight specy of smal mam vary rel littl between pred bree and non bree season but declin by an ord of magnitud through the first yr of the study rath than respond to thes shift in food avail by diverg in diet dur lean tim and converg opportun dur fat tim pred respond in idiosyncr way pred of al specy tend to maintain specy spec mean in siz of prey tak regardless of shift in the rel avail of prey siz class two owl specy maintain strict mam diet throughout the declin in mam abund wherea two oth owl plu the two fox specy maintain a tight fee guild bas on arthropod as wel as mam and oth food group the four falconiform fail to maintain consist diet from season to season and consequ end up temp in un posit in diet hyperspac or els join temp on of the two consist guild the degr to which falconiform diet wer un in a giv season show no clear rel to food abund chang in us of habit did howev rel to chang in food abund non of the falconiform resid continu in the study are throughout the period from auth,new,0.84666471381179,0.7943508315193447,0.7511578453394,0.7154985451209558,0.6853487566844428,0.6591608154789835,0.6357912903669258,0.6143147145363033,0.5938337174398486,0.5731545632203736,0.5501301357451804

814,mammal_neotropic,Influence of habitat structure on a streamside small mammal community in a Brazilian rural area,"A capture-mark-recapture population study of small mammals was carried out in the Pamparrao valley, rural area of Sumidouro County, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Trapping was carried out every other month from June 1991 to July 1996, for five trapping nights on seven transects along the valley, totaling 12250 trap nights. The roles of habitat complexity (vegetation density in vertical strata) and heterogeneity (horizontal physiognomy) on structuring the small mammal community were investigated correlating heterogeneity and complexity with mammal abundance and richness. Heterogeneity variables were related to small mammal species and habitats, simultaneously, by a Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Marsupials were more related to the forest transects and to the presence of trees. Rodents were most related to the herbaceous stratum near the ground. Abundance of mammals was influenced mostly by complexity. The study area presented low habitat complexity, and it suffered frequent anthropogenic disturbances. These factors provided low species richness by neotropical standards.

1012,mammal_neotropic,Forest bird community structure in central Panama: Influence of spatial scale and biogeography,"Historical and biogeographic contexts can play important, yet sometimes overlooked, roles in determining structure of local communities. In particular, few examinations of historical influences on patterns of species richness and relative abundances in tropical communities have been conducted. In part, that gap in our knowledge has been caused by a paucity of data on tropical communities, even for relatively well-studied taxa such as birds. In the Neotropics, only two sites, a 97-ha plot in lowland Peru and a 100-ha plot in French Guiana, have been inventoried on a spatial scale sufficient to estimate population densities for a majority of resident bird species. Results from those studies revealed extremely similar species richness, community biomass, and patterns of relative abundance. A third site in lowland Panama was originally censused in 1968-1969 and has often been compared with many other tropical and temperate sites. Results from Panama suggested an exceptionally different community structure from that observed at the Amazonian sites. Informative comparisons among sites have been hampered, however, by differences in sampling protocols. The Panama site was sampled on a much smaller spatial scale (2 ha) than the two Amazonian sites. To improve comparisons, we censused a 104-ha area (the Limbo plot) encompassing the original 2-ha Panama study area and used several census methods, including those used at the Amazonian sites. As expected, spatial scale had a strong effect on estimates of species richness. We detected 252 species on the Limbo plot, compared with 161 detected on the original 2-ha area. Estimates of total individual birds per 100 ha were similar, but estimates from the original study were based on densities measured for one-third fewer species than we measured on our larger study area. Of the 53 species for which both Panama studies estimated population densities, a significant number of estimates were higher in the original study. Thus, the small spatial scale of the original study apparently led to inflated density estimates. The primary cause of disparities appeared to result from undersampling in the smaller plot of many species with patchy distributions and large territory sizes. Compared with Amazonian communities, the Panama community had far fewer rare species. Although 33% of species in Amazonian sites had densities of ‚â§1 pair/100 ha, only 17% were equally rare in Panama. Furthermore, eight species in Panama were, by tropical standards, 'superabundant,' attaining densities as high as 212 breeding individuals/100 ha; the most abundant species in Amazonia barely reached one-third of that number. In total, those eight species accounted for 36% of all individuals at Limbo. The median abundance at Limbo was 7 pairs/100 ha, vs. 2.5 pairs/100 ha in Amazonia. Consequently, the total number of birds on the Limbo study area was nearly twice that found in Amazonia, despite species richness being only three-fourths as great. We conclude, first, that spatial scale has indeed had an important effect on the characterization of the Panama bird community. The intrinsically patchy distributions of most forest-dwelling bird species raise the need for large-scale censuses. Second, the Panama community, compared with the two Amazonian sites, has a fundamentally different organization; it hosts nearly twice as many individual birds and is distinctly less dominated by rarity. Similar patterns of community structure appear to be present within tree and mammal communities as well. Therefore, results from the Amazonian studies cannot be generalized to all lowland Neotropical communities. We attribute differences in community structure primarily to differing biogeographic histories. The lower species richness and the greater number of total birds present in Panama appear to derive, at least in part, from two important factors: an area effect linked to the location of Panama on a narrow isthmus, and the repeated history of disturbance on multiple temporal scales in Panama.",10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0209:FBCSIC]2.0.CO;2,2-s2.0-0033820819,53,0.658913540994902,0,forest bird commun structure in cent panam influ of spat scal and biogeograph hist and biogeograph context can play import yet sometim overlook rol in determin structure of loc commun in particul few examin of hist influ on pattern of specy rich and rel abund in trop commun hav been conduc in part that gap in our knowledg has been caus by a pauc of dat on trop commun ev for rel wel study tax such as bird in the neotrop on two sit a ha plot in lowland peru and a ha plot in french guian hav been inv on a spat scal sufficy to estim pop dens for a maj of resid bird specy result from thos study rev extrem simil specy rich commun biomass and pattern of rel abund a third sit in lowland panam was origin census in and has oft been comp with many oth trop and temp sit result from panam suggest an exceiv diff commun structure from that observ at the amazon sit inform comparison among sit hav been hamp howev by diff in sampl protocol the panam sit was sampl on a much smal spat scal ha than the two amazon sit to improv comparison we census a ha are the limbo plot encompass the origin ha panam study are and us sev cens method includ thos us at the amazon sit as expect spat scal had a strong effect on estim of specy rich we detect specy on the limbo plot comp with detect on the origin ha are estim of tot individ bird per ha wer simil but estim from the origin study wer bas on dens meas for on third few specy than we meas on our larg study are of the specy for which both panam study estim pop dens a sign numb of estim wer high in the origin study thu the smal spat scal of the origin study app led to infl dens estim the prim caus of disp appear to result from undersampl in the smal plot of many specy with patchy distribut and larg territ siz comp with amazon commun the panam commun had far few rar specy although of specy in amazon sit had dens of ‚â§ pair ha on wer eq rar in panam furtherm eight specy in panam wer by trop standard superabund attain dens as high as bree individ ha the most abund specy in amazon bar reach on third of that numb in tot thos eight specy account for of al individ at limbo the med abund at limbo was pair ha vs pair ha in amazon consequ the tot numb of bird on the limbo study are was near twic that found in amazon despit specy rich being on three fourth as gre we conclud first that spat scal has indee had an import effect on the charact of the panam bird commun the intrins patchy distribut of most forest dwel bird specy rais the nee for larg scal census second the panam commun comp with the two amazon sit has a funda diff org it host near twic as many individ bird and is distinct less domin by rar simil pattern of commun structure appear to be pres within tre and mam commun as wel theref result from the amazon study cannot be gen to al lowland neotrop commun we attribut diff in commun structure prim to diff biogeograph hist the low specy rich and the gre numb of tot bird pres in panam appear to der at least in part from two import fact an are effect link to the loc of panam on a narrow isthm and the rep hist of disturb on multipl temp scal in panam,new,0.7535630039767033,0.6589073885137426,0.5847387948348701,0.5271546619086743,0.4814004002467248,0.4440057100296129,0.41258978838221333,0.3854581580541388,0.3612923161700883,0.3388222666692341,0.31644442937113954
1312,mammal_neotropic,Breeding distribution and abundance of seabirds on islands off northcentral Chile,"Between 1999 and 2003 we collected information on the breeding distribution and abundance of 12 seabird species occurring on nine islands off the coasts of north and central Chile (27¬∞-33¬∞ S). The Peruvian booby Sula variegata was the most abundant seabird with a breeding population of ca. 18,000 pairs concentrated in two islands, followed by the Humboldt penguin Spheniscus humboldti with ca. 9,000 pairs, the largest colony being at Cha√±aral Island with ca. 7,000 pairs. Kelp gulls Larus dominicanus bred at all the surveyed sites in colonies of variable size, ranging from 40 to 2, 000 pairs. Peruvian diving-petrels Pelecanoides garnotii and Peruvian pelicans Pelecanus occidentalis bred at restricted sites, but generally in large colonies. Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, wedge-rumped storm-petrels Oceanodroma tethys, Neotropical cormorants Hypoleucos brasiliensis, guanay cormorants Leucocarbo bougainvillii, red-legged cormorants Stictocarbo gairmardi, band-tailed gulls Larus belcheri and Inca terns Larosterna inca nested at few sites forming small colonies (from a few to 150 pairs). Two new breeding sites are reported for the Peruvian diving-petrel and nesting of the wedge-rumped storm-petrel is confirmed on the Chilean coast for the first time. Despite protective status, most of the islands showed human disturbance, derived mainly from guano harvesting, egging and tourism. On at least five of these islands we were able to confirm introduced mammals including rats, rabbits and cats. These factors are likely to be detrimental to seabirds and thus demand detailed assessment. Further comprehensive ornithological surveys in other areas are needed so as to improve the scarce knowledge that we currently have on the seabird populations along the Chilean coast.",10.4067/S0716-078X2003000200016,2-s2.0-1042279367,51,0.8284363151853981,1,bree distribut and abund of seabird on island off northc chil between and we collect inform on the bree distribut and abund of seabird specy occur on nin island off the coast of nor and cent chil ¬∞ ¬∞ s the peruv booby sul variegat was the most abund seabird with a bree pop of ca pair cont in two island follow by the humboldt penguin spheniscus humboldt with ca pair the largest colony being at cha√±aral island with ca pair kelp gul lar dominican bred at al the survey sit in colony of vary siz rang from to pair peruv div petrel pelecanoid garnoti and peruv pel pelecan occid bred at restrict sit but gen in larg colony magel penguin spheniscus magellanic wedg rump storm petrel oceanodrom tethy neotrop corm hypoleuco brasiliens guanay corm leucocarbo bougainvilli red leg corm stictocarbo gairmard band tail gul lar belcher and inc tern larostern inc nest at few sit form smal colony from a few to pair two new bree sit ar report for the peruv div petrel and nest of the wedg rump storm petrel is confirm on the chil coast for the first tim despit protect stat most of the island show hum disturb der main from guano harvest eg and tour on at least fiv of thes island we wer abl to confirm introduc mam includ rat rabbit and cat thes fact ar lik to be detry to seabird and thu demand detail assess furth comprehend ornitholog survey in oth area ar nee so as to improv the scarc knowledg that we cur hav on the seabird pop along the chil coast,new,0.8745860169948916,0.818131333223471,0.7693550107167041,0.7285033921325047,0.693958006839387,0.66416691348674,0.6379304240290615,0.614328888955798,0.5926194723017646,0.5720841613995877,0.5518961512833165
1713,mammal_neotropic,Basin-wide effects of game harvest on vertebrate population densities in Amazonian forests: implications for animal-mediated seed dispersal,"Vertebrate responses to hunting are widely variable for target and nontarget species depending on the history of hunting and productivity of any given site and the life history traits of game species. We provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of changes in population density or other abundance estimates for 30 mid-sized to large mammal, bird and reptile species in 101 hunted and nonhunted, but otherwise undisturbed, Neotropical forest sites. The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative. Populations of all species combined declined across greater differences in hunting pressure by up to 74.8 percent from their numeric abundance in less intensively hunted sites, but harvest-sensitive species faired far worse. Of the 30 species examined, 22 declined significantly at high levels of hunting. Body size significantly affected the direction and magnitude of abundance changes, with large-bodied species declining faster in overhunted sites. Frugivorous species showed more marked declines in abundance in heavily hunted sites than seed predators and browsers, regardless of the effects of body size. The implications of hunting for seed dispersal are discussed in terms of community dynamics in semi-defaunated tropical forests. ¬© 2007 The Author(s).",10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00272.x,2-s2.0-34247329805,44,0.7873778426957802,0,basin wid effect of gam harvest on vertebr pop dens in amazon forest imply for anim medy see dispers vertebr respons to hunt ar wid vary for target and nontarget specy depend on the hist of hunt and produc of any giv sit and the lif hist trait of gam specy we provid a comprehend met analys of chang in pop dens or oth abund estim for mid siz to larg mam bird and reptil specy in hunt and nonhunt but otherw undisturb neotrop forest sit the dat set was analys us both an unnest approach bas on pop dens estim and a nest approach in which pairw comparison of abund met wer restrict to geograph group of sit shar simil habit and soil condit thi result in geograph clust of sit within which pop abund estim wer comp across diff level of hunt press av nest chang in abund across increas gre level of hunt press rang from mod posit to high neg pop of al specy combin declin across gre diff in hunt press by up to perc from their num abund in less intend hunt sit but harvest sensit specy fair far wors of the specy examin declin sign at high level of hunt body siz sign affect the direct and magnitud of abund chang with larg body specy declin fast in overhunt sit frug specy show mor mark declin in abund in heavy hunt sit than see pred and brows regardless of the effect of body siz the imply of hunt for see dispers ar discuss in term of commun dynam in sem defaun trop forest,new,0.82182028464695,0.7714874997453102,0.7312661196938833,0.6985234172885437,0.6710490117036991,0.6473351751337775,0.6263367820817094,0.607265648769632,0.5894308132748386,0.5720389322695782,0.5538660144165631

We examined effects of both forest-patch metrics and forest disturbance in determining richness and abundance of midsized to large-bodied mammal species in a highly fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. Twenty-one forest fragments, ranging from 2 to 14,480 ha, and two continuous forest sites were sampled based on sightings, tracks, line-transect censuses, armadillo burrow censuses, and camera trapping. Patch occupancy of 37 species recorded ranged from 4% to all forest sites surveyed. Forest fragment size was the strongest predictor of species persistence, explaining 90% of the variation in species richness. Information-theoretic analysis confirmed that fragment area was the most important explanatory variable for the overall species richness and abundance of mammal species, followed by surface fires, which affected the abundance of seven species. Large mammal species were typically absent from fragments <100 ha, whereas some ubiquitous species were favored by fragmentation, exhibiting hyperabundance in small patches. Our findings highlight the importance of large (>10,000 ha), relatively undisturbed forest patches to maximize persistence and maintain baseline abundances of Neotropical forest mammal species. ¬© 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.",10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00797.x,2-s2.0-37349074468,39,0.657740815662782,0,disturb medy mam persist and abund are rel in amazon forest frag few research hav investig the synerg effect of trop forest frag and disturb on specy persist and abund we examin effect of both forest patch met and forest disturb in determin rich and abund of mids to larg body mam specy in a high frag amazon forest landscap twenty on forest frag rang from to ha and two continu forest sit wer sampl bas on sight track lin transect census armadillo burrow census and camer trap patch occup of specy record rang from to al forest sit survey forest frag siz was the strongest predict of specy persist explain of the vary in specy rich inform theoret analys confirm that frag are was the most import expl vary for the overal specy rich and abund of mam specy follow by surfac fir which affect the abund of sev specy larg mam specy wer typ abs from frag ha wherea som ubiquit specy wer fav by frag exhibit hyperabund in smal patch our find highlight the import of larg ha rel undisturb forest patch to maxim persist and maintain baselin abund of neotrop forest mam specy,new,0.7592122358909175,0.6629805958111967,0.5875554412077485,0.5291975577609563,0.48305393019562104,0.4455648944324953,0.4142968568869357,0.387526481319918,0.36391692050810903,0.342161878693941,0.3204625235944497
259,mammal_neotropic,"Estimating puma densities from camera trapping across three study sites: Bolivia, Argentina, and Belize","Estimates of abundance are extremely valuable for species conservation, yet determining abundance for elusive, wide-ranging, carnivores is difficult. We estimated density of pumas using remote cameras across study sites in Bolivia, Argentina, and Belize. We used obvious and subtle markings to identify individual pumas in photographs and conducted double-blind identifications to examine the degree of agreement among investigators. Average agreement on identification between pairs of investigators was nearly 80.0% and 3-way agreement was 72.9%. Identification of pumas as different individuals was uncommon (7.8% pairwise, 0.69% 3-way disagreement) with the remainder described as unidentifiable. Densities of pumas varied consistently from site to site regardless of investigator. Bolivian pumas moved the shortest distances between camera stations and Argentinean pumas the longest, but distances among cameras and area covered by surveys varied among sites. We applied a correction factor to the Bolivian data to account for the small area surveyed and found that, averaged across investigator, Bolivia had significantly more pumas per 100 km2 (mean ¬± SD; 6.80 ¬± 1.5) than Belize (3.42 ¬± 1.3) or Argentina (0.67 ¬± 0.2). Numbers of pumas in Argentina match those of low-density North American sites, and those for Belize are consistent with the Pantanal and high-density North American sites. Densities of pumas can be reliably estimated with remote cameras for these sites, and our work presents the 1st density estimates for Central America and for forested environments in South America. ¬© 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.",10.1644/06-MAMM-A-424R.1,2-s2.0-43049136221,36,0.673286239820852,0,estim pum dens from camer trap across three study sit boliv argentin and bel estim of abund ar extrem valu for specy conserv yet determin abund for elud wid rang carn is difficult we estim dens of puma us remot camera across study sit in boliv argentin and bel we us obvy and subtl mark to ident individ puma in photograph and conduc doubl blind id to examin the degr of agr among investig av agr on id between pair of investig was near and way agr was id of puma as diff individ was uncommon pairw way disagr with the remaind describ as unident dens of puma vary consist from sit to sit regardless of investig bol puma mov the shortest dist between camer stat and argentin puma the longest but dist among camera and are cov by survey vary among sit we apply a correct fact to the bol dat to account for the smal are survey and found that av across investig boliv had sign mor puma per km mean ¬± sd ¬± than bel ¬± or argentin ¬± numb of puma in argentin match thos of low dens nor am sit and thos for bel ar consist with the pant and high dens nor am sit dens of puma can be rely estim with remot camera for thes sit and our work pres the st dens estim for cent americ and for forest environ in sou americ,new,0.678442790376297,0.6245383730868239,0.5878155633634915,0.5623047301077644,0.5443772261688077,0.5320719304534164,0.5244356940696525,0.5212438282987535,0.5230453843012915,0.5316914633053443,0.5520952225997479
279,mammal_neotropic,"Mammals of Cabo Blanco: History, diversity, and conservation after 45 years of regrowth of a Costa Rican dry forest","Reserva Natural Absoluta Cabo Blanco, a strongly seasonal deciduous forest located at the southernmost tip of northwestern Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, was established in 1963 and is the country's oldest nationally protected reserve. The peninsula has been occupied for millennia and is a heavily impacted landscape, and, unfortunately, its biotic diversity is among the most poorly studied in Central America. As part of multiyear studies of the flora and fauna of the region, we assess the changes in vegetation and the terrestrial mammal community from earlier times to the present day. Through historical records, interviews with long-term residents of the area, and our studies over the past decade, we document changes in forest cover, settlement, and land use, and assess the changes in species diversity and in mammal species' abundance. We then discuss the ecology of the mammal species on the peninsula, emphasizing the role that humans have played in influencing population levels. After 45 years of protection, the forest structure of the 3100 ha reserve differs markedly from that observed in the early 20th Century and it is quite heterogeneous. Species diversity of both the native vegetation and the mammals is substantial in the regenerating forest. The known mammal fauna included at least 37 species of non-flying mammals and 39 species of bats. Six species (Geoffroy's Spider Monkey, Giant Anteater, White-lipped Peccary, Central American Red Brocket Deer, Baird's Tapir, and Jaguar) have been extirpated from the reserve. Poaching of game species continues and will be difficult to eliminate completely. Nevertheless, with regenerating habitats, coupled with protection of wildlife, reestablishment of the reserve's native species has been dramatic both in terms of species diversity and abundance. The reserve is not in a defaunated condition. Many mammalian frugivores, seed dispersers, and/or seed predators are common and most top mammalian predators are present. We present several testable hypotheses regarding the significance of this mammalian community in the context of other Neotropical forest mammal and plant communities. Rapid expansion of tourism in this region has the potential to affect the reserve adversely. In recent years, the reserve has served as an important site for teaching tropical biology courses. Small reserves, such as Cabo Blanco, even if not connected to larger protected areas through corridors, provide critical habitat for native flora and fauna, a source of genetic stock, and valuable regional teaching and research sites. ¬© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

3010,mammal_neotropic,Vertebrate population responses to reduced-impact logging in a neotropical forest,"Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9 m3 ha-1, equivalent to only 1.1 trees ha-1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

327,mammal_neotropic,Long-term monitoring of tropical bats for anthropogenic impact assessment: Gauging the statistical power to detect population change,"Bats are ecologically important mammals in tropical ecosystems; however, their populations face numerous environmental threats related to climate change, habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and emerging diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (‚â•20. years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (‚â•0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (‚â§10. years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20. years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.biocon.2010.07.029,2-s2.0-77956876153,32,0.738252732818643,1,long term monit of trop bat for anthropog impact assess gaug the stat pow to detect pop chang bat ar ecolog import mam in trop ecosystem howev their pop fac num environ threats rel to clim chang habit loss frag hunt and emerg diseas thu ther is a press nee to develop and impl larg scal network to monit trend in bat pop ov extend tim period us dat from a rang of neotrop and paleotrop bat assembl we assess the abl for long term monit program to rely detect temp trend in specy abund we expl the magnitud of within sit temp vary in abund and evalu the stat pow of a suit of diff sampl design for sev diff bat specy and ensembl despit pronount temp vary in abund of most trop bat specy pow sim suggest that long term monit program ‚â• year can detect pop trend of per year or mor with adequ stat pow ‚â• howev short monit program ‚â§ year hav insufficy pow for trend detect overal our analys demonst that a monit program extend ov year with four survey conduc bien on fiv plot per monit sit would hav the pot for detect a an chang in abund for a suit of bat specy from diff ensembl the lik of reach adequ stat pow was sensit to init specy abund and the magnitud of count vary stressing that on the most abund specy in an assembl and thos with gen low vary in abund should be consid for detail pop monit,new,0.7933134975163532,0.7646429475578373,0.7447441218998757,0.7305051216432574,0.7201481619155727,0.7127089385981572,0.7076977922492518,0.7049575547007483,0.7046632914482197,0.7075061369439942,0.7153443795973319
387,mammal_neotropic,Effects of Climate and Exurban Development on Nest Predation and Predator Presence in the southern Appalachian Mountains (U.S.A.),"In the eastern United States, land-use and climate change have likely contributed to declines in the abundance of Neotropical migrant birds that occupy forest interiors, but the mechanisms are not well understood. We conducted a nest-predation experiment in southern Appalachian Mountain forests (North Carolina, U.S.A.) during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons to determine the effects of exurban development and temperature on predator presence and the average number of days until eggs in an artificial nest were disturbed by predators. We baited artificial nests with quail (Excalfactoria chinensi) eggs and monitored them for 18 days. We used clay eggs, track plates, and motion-triggered cameras to detect and identify nest predators. The average number of days a nest was undisturbed decreased as mean temperature increased and, to a lesser extent, as the density of buildings increased. Nests on the ground were more often depredated than those in trees, likely due to increased predation by opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and other carnivores. Raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums, corvids (Corvus brachyrhynchos and Cyanocitta cristata), chipmunks (Tamias striatus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and domestic cats (Felis catus) were the most commonly detected predators. Presence of these predators did not vary as a function of mean temperature. Domestic cats and corvids were detected more frequently in plots with high rather than low densities of buildings. Forest-interior specialists and Neotropical migrants often nest in cool, high-elevation areas with low housing density. These bird species, especially those that nest on the ground, may be most vulnerable to increased nest predation if temperature and exurban development increase at higher elevations as anticipated. ¬© 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.",10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01851.x,2-s2.0-84864018677,24,0.737607224941597,0,effect of clim and exurb develop on nest pred and pred pres in the southern appalach mountain u s a in the eastern unit stat land us and clim chang hav lik contribut to declin in the abund of neotrop migr bird that occupy forest intery but the mech ar not wel understood we conduc a nest pred expery in southern appalach mountain forest nor carolin u s a dur the and bree season to determin the effect of exurb develop and temp on pred pres and the av numb of day until eg in an art nest wer disturb by pred we bait art nest with quail excalfactor chinens eg and monit them for day we us clay eg track plat and mot trig camera to detect and ident nest pred the av numb of day a nest was undisturb decreas as mean temp increas and to a less ext as the dens of build increas nest on the ground wer mor oft depr than thos in tre lik due to increas pred by oposs didelph virginian and oth carn raccoon procyon lot opossum corvid corv brachyrhyncho and cyanocitt cristat chipmunk tamia striatus black bear urs american and domest cat fel cat wer the most common detect pred pres of thes pred did not vary as a funct of mean temp domest cat and corvid wer detect mor frequ in plot with high rath than low dens of build forest intery spec and neotrop migr oft nest in cool high elev area with low hous dens thes bird specy espec thos that nest on the ground may be most vuln to increas nest pred if temp and exurb develop increas at high elev as anticip,new,0.7857067498688027,0.7278331353872911,0.6822564989262024,0.6463038823273872,0.61746248490898,0.5939727242549177,0.5746651326295864,0.5587794034914311,0.545866818397746,0.5357268516013387,0.5284896318111321

A stronger effect of host-related factors on flea than on mite assemblages, and a stronger effect of environmental factors on mite than on flea assemblages were predicted. In addition, the effects of parasite-related factors on flea and mite diversity and abundance were predicted to manifest mainly at the scale of infracommunities, whereas the effects of host-related and environmental factors were predicted to manifest mainly at the scale of component and compound communities. This study found that, in general, diversity and abundance of flea and mite assemblages at two lower hierarchical levels (infracommunities and component communities) were affected by host-related, parasite-related and environmental factors, and compound communities were affected mainly by host-related and environmental factors. The effects of factors differed between fleas and mites: in fleas, community structure and abundance depended on host diversity to a greater extent than in mites. In addition, the effects of factors differed among parasite assemblages harboured by different host species. ¬© 2012 The Royal Entomological Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2915.2012.01025.x,2-s2.0-84873996551,22,0.334570293772455,0,pattern of divers and abund of flea and mit in the neotrop host rel parasit rel and environ rel fact the effect of host rel parasit rel and environ fact on the divers and abund of two ectoparasit tax flea insect siphonapter and mit acar mesostigmat parasit on smal mam rod and marsup wer study in diff loc across brazil a stronger effect of host rel fact on fle than on mit assembl and a stronger effect of environ fact on mit than on fle assembl wer predict in addit the effect of parasit rel fact on fle and mit divers and abund wer predict to manifest main at the scal of infracommun wherea the effect of host rel and environ fact wer predict to manifest main at the scal of compon and compound commun thi study found that in gen divers and abund of fle and mit assembl at two low hierarch level infracommun and compon commun wer affect by host rel parasit rel and environ fact and compound commun wer affect main by host rel and environ fact the effect of fact diff between flea and mit in flea commun structure and abund depend on host divers to a gre ext than in mit in addit the effect of fact diff among parasit assembl harbo by diff host specy,new,0.3459864249904859,0.3074012694684031,0.2862461188573551,0.27503491131077634,0.2704187290235381,0.2710606040866699,0.2767982460887386,0.28852037666686586,0.3086863196023158,0.34314343405404274,0.4067568089034015
407,mammal_neotropic,Phenotypic changes and small mammal impoverishment on a Brazilian Atlantic Forest Island,"Faunal impoverishment and distorted species compositions are common phenomena in oceanic islands; however, many land-bridge islands are poorly inventoried, especially in the Neotropics. We sampled a small mammal community on a land-bridge island (Anchieta Island) along the Brazilian coast. We found only one marsupial Didelphis aurita (Wied-Neuwied, 1826) and two rodent species Oligoryzomys nigripes (Olfers, 1818) and Trinomys iheringi (Thomas, 1911) during 12 months of live trapping and 9195 trap-nights. The diversity of rodents and marsupials was not explained by species-area relations, indicating possible past extinctions. The abundance of D. aurita and O. nigripes was approximately three times higher, while the abundance of T. iheringi was approximately four times lower than abundances reported from other Brazilian Atlantic Forest sites. The population of D. aurita exhibited many phenotypic changes; males were on average 8 % smaller and females produced 30 % less litters than those from the mainland and other land-bridge islands. The long history of forest disturbance, habitat loss, reduction in forest productivity, and the recent introduction of mesopredators may be the major drivers that explain the small mammal community composition on this island. ¬© 2013 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",10.1515/mammalia-2011-0099,2-s2.0-84878148025,23,0.732423941722677,0,phenotyp chang and smal mam impov on a brazil atl forest island faun impov and distort specy composit ar common phenomen in oc island howev many land bridg island ar poor inv espec in the neotrop we sampl a smal mam commun on a land bridg island anchiet island along the brazil coast we found on on marsup didelph aurit wied neuwy and two rod specy oligoryzom nigrip olf and trinom ihering thoma dur month of liv trap and trap night the divers of rod and marsup was not explain by specy are rel ind poss past extinct the abund of d aurit and o nigrip was approxim three tim high whil the abund of t ihering was approxim four tim low than abund report from oth brazil atl forest sit the pop of d aurit exhibit many phenotyp chang mal wer on av smal and fem produc less lit than thos from the mainland and oth land bridg island the long hist of forest disturb habit loss reduc in forest produc and the rec introduc of mesopr may be the maj driv that explain the smal mam commun composit on thi island,new,0.764631245198662,0.6817646694654805,0.6169899532436691,0.5667580471475433,0.5269717531012861,0.49472422883791123,0.4680907159600585,0.4457961288062138,0.42700590176444086,0.41119613086256007,0.3981585273283362
419,mammal_neotropic,"Potential Effects of Climate Change on the Water Level, Flora and Macro-fauna of a Large Neotropical Wetland","Possible consequences of climate change in one of the world's largest wetlands (Ibera, Argentina) were analysed using a multi-scale approach. Climate projections coupled to hydrological models were used to analyse variability in wetland water level throughout the current century. Two potential scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions were explored, both resulting in an increase in the inter-annual fluctuations of the water level. In the scenario with higher emissions, projections also showed a long-term negative trend in water-level. To explore the possible response of biota to such water-level changes, species-area relationships of flora and aerial censuses of macro-fauna were analysed during an extraordinary dry period. Plant species richness at the basin scale was found to be highly resistant to hydrological changes, as the large dimension of the wetland acts to buffer against the water-level variations. However, local diversity decreased significantly with low water levels, leading to the loss of ecosystem resilience to additional stressors. The analysis of macro-fauna populations suggested that wetland provides refuge, in low water periods, for the animals with high dispersal ability (aquatic and migratory birds). On the contrary, the abundance of animals with low dispersal ability (mainly herbivorous species) was negatively impacted in low water periods, probably because they are required to search for alternative resources beyond the wetland borders. This period of resource scarcity was also related to increased mortality of large mammals (e.g. marsh deer) around water bodies with high anthropogenic enrichment and cyanobacteria dominance. The synergy between recurrent climatic fluctuations and additional stressors (i.e. biological invasions, eutrophication) presents an important challenge to the conservation of neotropical wetlands in the coming decades. ¬© 2013 √öbeda et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0067787,2-s2.0-84879901777,21,0.5140390196604321,1,pot effect of clim chang on the wat level flor and macro faun of a larg neotrop wetland poss consequ of clim chang in on of the world s largest wetland iber argentin wer analys us a mult scal approach clim project coupl to hydrolog model wer us to analys vary in wetland wat level throughout the cur century two pot scenario of greenh gas emit wer expl both result in an increas in the int an fluctu of the wat level in the scenario with high emit project also show a long term neg trend in wat level to expl the poss respons of biot to such wat level chang specy are rel of flor and aer census of macro faun wer analys dur an extraordin dry period plant specy rich at the basin scal was found to be high resist to hydrolog chang as the larg dimend of the wetland act to buff against the wat level vary howev loc divers decreas sign with low wat level lead to the loss of ecosystem resy to addit stressors the analys of macro faun pop suggest that wetland provid refug in low wat period for the anim with high dispers abl aqu and migr bird on the cont the abund of anim with low dispers abl main herb specy was neg impact in low wat period prob becaus they ar requir to search for altern resourc beyond the wetland bord thi period of resourc scarc was also rel to increas mort of larg mam e g marsh deer around wat body with high anthropog enrich and cyanobacter domin the synergy between recur clim fluctu and addit stressors i e biolog invas eutroph pres an import challeng to the conserv of neotrop wetland in the com decad,new,0.5596826406971541,0.5233346013578646,0.5011248642131143,0.4877329351470204,0.4805339708256027,0.47833144953010465,0.48077757370629787,0.4882311356730151,0.5019674371070386,0.5249920713666716,0.5643986472651077
425,mammal_neotropic,"Group dynamics, behavior, and current and historical abundance of peccaries in Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands","The abundances and habitat preferences of peccaries in Neotropical forests are important to understand because these keystone species influence many aspects of the ecosystem. In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, we conducted walking surveys for ‚àº2 years to study the behavior and population trends of collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), and found that peccaries are abundant at La Selva Biological Station and overall, detection rates were relatively constant through time. A stable estimate of detection rates was achieved only after 7-9 months of surveying. We found no habitat preferences between primary and secondary forest, yet there were some differences in group dynamics - group radius was larger and sighting distance was greater in primary forest, whereas the number of singletons was higher in secondary forest. More peccaries were seen closer to the laboratory clearing than at greater distances, for a variety of probable reasons: habituation to humans, lower predation and hunting pressure, and various environmental and habitat factors. Peccary groups had spatially clumped distributions across the landscape and were more active diurnally than nocturnally. Collared peccary densities are relatively high at La Selva compared to other Neotropical sites, with the exception of Barro Colorado Island. We combined our data with a review of the historical literature to assess changes in the populations of peccaries in the Caribbean lowlands. We found that collared peccaries have likely increased in abundance at La Selva, seemingly a few years after the extirpation of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari), which were abundant in the area 40-50 years ago. An understanding of the group dynamics, behavior, and habitat preference of collared peccaries is essential for management decisions and conservation efforts. Additionally, assessment of population changes should be carefully considered in a historical context, with a particular focus on how the populations of the 2 peccary species have changed, and how these species might differentially affect their environment. ¬© 2013 American Society of Mammalogists.",10.1644/12-MAMM-A-266.1,2-s2.0-84882377861,20,0.6883574582531279,1,group dynam behavy and cur and hist abund of pecc in cost ric s carib lowland the abund and habit pref of pecc in neotrop forest ar import to understand becaus thes keyston specy influ many aspect of the ecosystem in the carib lowland of cost ric we conduc walk survey for ‚àº year to study the behavy and pop trend of coll pecc pecar tajacu and found that pecc ar abund at la selv biolog stat and overal detect rat wer rel const through tim a stabl estim of detect rat was achiev on aft month of survey we found no habit pref between prim and second forest yet ther wer som diff in group dynam group radi was larg and sight dist was gre in prim forest wherea the numb of singleton was high in second forest mor pecc wer seen clos to the lab clear than at gre dist for a vary of prob reason habitu to hum low pred and hunt press and vary environ and habit fact pecc group had spat clump distribut across the landscap and wer mor act diurn than nocturn coll pecc dens ar rel high at la selv comp to oth neotrop sit with the exceiv of barro colorado island we combin our dat with a review of the hist lit to assess chang in the pop of pecc in the carib lowland we found that coll pecc hav lik increas in abund at la selv seem a few year aft the extirp of whit lip pecc tayassu pecar which wer abund in the are year ago an understand of the group dynam behavy and habit pref of coll pecc is ess for man decid and conserv effort addit assess of pop chang should be car consid in a hist context with a particul foc on how the pop of the pecc specy hav chang and how thes specy might diff affect their environ,new,0.710884131312007,0.6484284430374406,0.6033712482036337,0.5698728872057518,0.5441810239562824,0.5241068094426333,0.5083853832007339,0.4963398124344019,0.487771377491639,0.48306664127096743,0.4837823629469838
436,mammal_neotropic,Experimental Seed Predator Removal Reveals Shifting Importance of Predation and Dispersal Limitation in Early Life History Stages of Tropical Forest Trees,"Recruitment limitation of trees in tropical forests can occur because of high rates of seed predation or low rates of seed dispersal, but the degree to which limitation is influenced by variation in seed predator abundance, and hence variation in seed predation and dispersal, is not well understood. We experimentally reduced the density of a granivorous small mammal (Heteromys desmarestianus) by 90 % to assess the degree to which its rates of seed predation and dispersal limit seed to seedling survival of nine species of trees in a Neotropical lowland forest. Overall, the proportion of seeds that germinated was influenced more by high rates of predation than by limited dispersal. Reduction in density of H. desmarestianus resulted in an order of magnitude decrease in fruit removal rates and an order of magnitude increase in both the absolute and relative numbers of seeds that germinated. However, the proportion of seeds that were cached remained relatively constant across all periods and between control grids and removal plots. In removal plots, H. desmarestianus dispersed and cached about 10 % of the fruits they handled, of which approximately 25 % germinated. This was 2 to 3 times greater than the germination rates of undispersed seeds, and for two species dispersed seeds were the only ones that germinated. The results suggest the simultaneous occurrence of both seed predation and dispersal limitation for trees with animal-dispersed seeds, but there may also be a hierarchy of importance in the relative strength of these two mechanisms that is determined by the dynamics of seed predator populations. ¬© 2013 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.",10.1007/s12224-013-9178-9,2-s2.0-84885937390,19,0.43029004814406896,0,expery see pred remov rev shift import of pred and dispers limit in ear lif hist stag of trop forest tre recruit limit of tre in trop forest can occ becaus of high rat of see pred or low rat of see dispers but the degr to which limit is influ by vary in see pred abund and hent vary in see pred and dispers is not wel understood we expery reduc the dens of a gran smal mam heterom desmarestian by to assess the degr to which it rat of see pred and dispers limit see to seedl surv of nin specy of tre in a neotrop lowland forest overal the proport of see that germin was influ mor by high rat of pred than by limit dispers reduc in dens of h desmarestian result in an ord of magnitud decreas in fruit remov rat and an ord of magnitud increas in both the absolv and rel numb of see that germin howev the proport of see that wer cach remain rel const across al period and between control grid and remov plot in remov plot h desmarestian dispers and cach about of the fruit they handl of which approxim germin thi was to tim gre than the germin rat of undispers see and for two specy dispers see wer the on on that germin the result suggest the simult occur of both see pred and dispers limit for tre with anim dispers see but ther may also be a hierarchy of import in the rel strength of thes two mech that is determin by the dynam of see pred pop,new,0.42594589340673483,0.40056681783043313,0.387889789809582,0.38345142950747746,0.3851366954386763,0.392209085145472,0.40487374208376736,0.424290098094594,0.4530698106193681,0.49673584512398383,0.5674093606323626
454,mammal_neotropic,"Comparing capture-recapture, mark-resight, and spatial mark-resight models for estimating puma densities via camera traps","Camera-trapping surveys, in combination with traditional capture-recapture or spatially explicit capture-recapture techniques, have become popular for estimating the density of individually identifiable carnivores. When only a portion of the population is uniquely identifiable, traditional and spatial mark-resight models provide a viable alternative. We reanalyzed a data set that used photographic capture-recapture methods to estimate the densities of pumas (Puma concolor) across 3 study sites in Belize, Argentina, and Bolivia using newer, more-Advanced modeling including spatial and nonspatial mark-resight techniques. Additionally, we assessed how photo identification influenced density estimates by comparing estimates based on capture histories constructed by 3 independent investigators. We estimated the abundances of pumas using mark-resight models in program MARK and then estimated densities ad hoc. We also estimated densities directly using spatial mark-resight models implemented in a Bayesian framework. Puma densities did not vary substantially among observers but estimates generated from the 3 statistical techniques did differ. Density estimates (pumas/100 km2) from spatial mark-resight models were lower (0.22-7.92) and had increased precision compared to those from nonspatial capture-recapture (0.50-19.35) and mark-resight techniques (0.54-14.70). Our study is the 1st to estimate the density of a population of carnivores, where only a subset of the individuals are naturally marked, using camera-trapping surveys in combination with spatial mark-resight models. The development of spatial mark-resight and spatially explicit capture-recapture techniques creates the potential for using a single camera-trapping array to estimate the density of multiple, sympatric carnivores, including both partially marked and uniquely marked species. ¬© 2014 American Society of Mammalogists.",10.1644/13-MAMM-A-126,2-s2.0-84898887713,18,0.647758783661838,0,comp capt recapt mark resight and spat mark resight model for estim pum dens via camer trap camer trap survey in combin with tradit capt recapt or spat explicit capt recapt techn hav becom popul for estim the dens of individ ident carn when on a port of the pop is un ident tradit and spat mark resight model provid a viabl altern we reanalys a dat set that us photograph capt recapt method to estim the dens of puma pum concol across study sit in bel argentin and boliv us new mor adv model includ spat and nonsp mark resight techn addit we assess how photo id influ dens estim by comp estim bas on capt hist construct by independ investig we estim the abund of puma us mark resight model in program mark and then estim dens ad hoc we also estim dens direct us spat mark resight model impl in a bayes framework pum dens did not vary subst among observ but estim gen from the stat techn did diff dens estim puma km from spat mark resight model wer low and had increas precid comp to thos from nonsp capt recapt and mark resight techn our study is the st to estim the dens of a pop of carn wher on a subset of the individ ar nat mark us camer trap survey in combin with spat mark resight model the develop of spat mark resight and spat explicit capt recapt techn cre the pot for us a singl camer trap array to estim the dens of multipl symp carn includ both part mark and un mark specy,new,0.6604272270427792,0.6281916858191597,0.6085685481192532,0.5970772037108516,0.5912764265938127,0.5899974781639363,0.5928609004844405,0.6001437307985505,0.6129418664341978,0.6338712229884939,0.6690164292816349
464,mammal_neotropic,Neotropical small mammals' diversity in the early cycle of commercial Eucalyptus plantations,"Studies carried out in Brazil revealed that Eucalyptus plantations shelter numerous species of small-size non-flying mammals. However, their distribution pattern inside the Eucalyptus plantations remains unknown. This study aimed at the identification of possible influence of distances from the remaining native revegetation areas and riparian systems, on spatial distribution and abundance of small-size mammals in Eucalyptus plantations. This study was carried at Eucalyptus stands recently planted (0-3 years) at the municipality of Angatuba, Sao Paulo state, Brazil between August 2007 and July 2009. The survey was carried out using pitfall traps at 14 sampling units inside Eucalyptus plantations 60-1130 m away from the borders. With a sampling effort of 2,449 bucket night, the experiment captured 680 individuals belonging to 12 species of small-size mammals (rodents and marsupials). The colonization process of Eucalyptus plantations was apparently initiated by generalist species from open Cerrado. In the present study, we did not find any clear correlation between specific richness and abundance of individuals and the distance from native revegetation areas or closer riparian systems. The study suggests that Eucalyptus plantations are permeable matrices to, at least, more generalist species present in the silvicultural landscapes (i.e. composed by an Eucalyptus plantation as the matrix and native vegetation patches). However, further studies must prioritize analyzing the influence of agricultural/sivilcultural practices (e.g., plantation structure and harvest frequency) on habitat quality and carrying capacity of agricultural/silvicultural landscape matrices, as well as implementing long-term monitoring programs to assess the impact of complete production cycles (some years) and along cycles of Eucalyptus plantations (some decades), on rodents population's diversity and dynamics patterns. ¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10.1007/s10457-014-9702-9,2-s2.0-84902344587,17,0.556856531447424,1,neotrop smal mam divers in the ear cyc of commerc eucalypt plant study carry out in brazil rev that eucalypt plant shelt num specy of smal siz non fly mam howev their distribut pattern insid the eucalypt plant remain unknown thi study aim at the id of poss influ of dist from the remain nat reveget area and rip system on spat distribut and abund of smal siz mam in eucalypt plant thi study was carry at eucalypt stand rec plant year at the municip of angatub sao paulo stat brazil between august and july the survey was carry out us pitfal trap at sampl unit insid eucalypt plant m away from the bord with a sampl effort of bucket night the expery capt individ belong to specy of smal siz mam rod and marsup the colon process of eucalypt plant was app in by gen specy from op cerrado in the pres study we did not find any clear correl between spec rich and abund of individ and the dist from nat reveget area or clos rip system the study suggest that eucalypt plant ar perm mat to at least mor gen specy pres in the silvicult landscap i e compos by an eucalypt plant as the matrix and nat veget patch howev furth study must priorit analys the influ of agricult sivilcult pract e g plant structure and harvest frequ on habit qual and carry capac of agricult silvicult landscap mat as wel as impl long term monit program to assess the impact of complet produc cyc som year and along cyc of eucalypt plant som decad on rod pop s divers and dynam pattern,new,0.533298874117844,0.49002270750155486,0.4634865271464088,0.447411622915709,0.4385617286950075,0.4354544856895747,0.43768848051485315,0.44579080441369723,0.4615540543937286,0.4892745521037109,0.5393194654105454
476,mammal_neotropic,Defaunation affect population and diet of rodents in Neotropical rainforests,"Most tropical rainforests have been defaunated of large-bodied mammals and the cascading effects of such extirpations have been poorly studied, particularly on other animals. We used a natural experiment in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to investigate the ecological responses of rodents to the functional extinction of a dominant terrestrial mammal, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). We detected a 45% increase in the abundance and a decrease in diversity of rodents in defaunated forests. Two of these species (Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes) are important hosts of Hantavirus, a lethal virus for humans. Stable isotope ratios (Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N) derived from the hair of rodents and peccaries and their food resources indicate that at least two rodent species shifted to a diet more similar to peccaries in the defaunated forest.

485,mammal_neotropic,Cranial and mandibular shape variation in the genus Carollia (Mammalia: Chiroptera) from Colombia: Biogeographic patterns and morphological modularity,"Neotropical bats of the genus Carollia are widely studied due to their abundance, distribution and relevance for ecosystems. However, the ecomorphological boundaries of these species are poorly differentiated, and consequently correspondence between their geographic distribution, ecological plasticity and morphological variation remains unclear. In this study, patterns of cranial and mandibular morphological variation were assessed for Carollia brevicauda, C. castanea and C. perspicillata from Colombia. Using geometric morphometrics, morphological variation was examined with respect to: differences in intraspecific variation, morphological modularity and integration, and biogeographic patterns. Patterns of intraspecific variation were different for each species in both cranial and mandibular morphology, with functional differences apparent according to diet. Cranial modularity varied between species whereas mandibular modularity did not. High cranial and mandibular correlation reflects Cranium-Mandible integration as a functional unit. Similarity between the biogeographic patterns in C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata indicates that the Andes do not act as a barrier but rather as an independent region, isolating the morphology of Andean populations of larger-bodied species. The biogeographic pattern for C. castanea was not associated with the physiography of the Andes, suggesting that large body size does not benefit C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata in maintaining homogeneous morphologies among populations. ¬© 2015 L√≥pez-Aguirre et al.",10.7717/peerj.1197,2-s2.0-84940375126,16,0.297545396417044,0,cran and mandibul shap vary in the gen caroll mammal chiropter from colomb biogeograph pattern and morpholog modul neotrop bat of the gen caroll ar wid study due to their abund distribut and relev for ecosystem howev the ecomorpholog bound of thes specy ar poor differenty and consequ correspond between their geograph distribut ecolog plast and morpholog vary remain unclear in thi study pattern of cran and mandibul morpholog vary wer assess for caroll brevicaud c castane and c perspicillat from colomb us geomet morphomet morpholog vary was examin with respect to diff in intraspec vary morpholog modul and integr and biogeograph pattern pattern of intraspec vary wer diff for each specy in both cran and mandibul morpholog with funct diff app accord to diet cran modul vary between specy wherea mandibul modul did not high cran and mandibul correl reflect cran mand integr as a funct unit simil between the biogeograph pattern in c brevicaud and c perspicillat ind that the and do not act as a barry but rath as an independ reg isol the morpholog of and pop of larg body specy the biogeograph pattern for c castane was not assocy with the physiograph of the and suggest that larg body siz doe not benefit c brevicaud and c perspicillat in maintain homog morpholog among pop,new,0.2886090255614806,0.27175685275631184,0.265167603960411,0.26515668251119723,0.270222735662728,0.2800982765533749,0.2954338692772827,0.31796929038998295,0.3513408612848487,0.40335460407440815,0.4920729844676972
493,mammal_neotropic,"On palms, bugs, and Chagas disease in the Americas","Palms are ubiquitous across Neotropical landscapes, from pristine forests or savannahs to large cities. Although palms provide useful ecosystem services, they also offer suitable habitat for triatomines and for Trypanosoma cruzi mammalian hosts. Wild triatomines often invade houses by flying from nearby palms, potentially leading to new cases of human Chagas disease. Understanding and predicting triatomine-palm associations and palm infestation probabilities is important for enhancing Chagas disease prevention in areas where palm-associated vectors transmit T. cruzi. We present a comprehensive overview of palminfestation by triatomines in the Americas, combining a thorough reanalysis of our published and unpublished records with an in-depth review of the literature. We use site-occupancy modeling (SOM) to examine infestation in 3590 palms sampled with non-destructive methods, and standard statistics to describe and compare infestation in 2940 palms sampled by felling-and-dissection. Thirty-eight palm species (18 genera) have been reported to be infested by ~39 triatomine species (10 genera) from the USA to Argentina. Overall infestation varied from 49.1-55.3% (SOM) to 62.6-66.1% (dissection), with important heterogeneities among sub-regions and particularly among palm species. Large palms with complex crowns (e.g., Attalea butyracea, Acrocomia aculeata) and some medium-crowned palms (e.g.,Copernicia, Butia) are often infested; in slender, small-crowned palms (e.g., Euterpe) triatomines associate with vertebrate nests. Palm infestation tends to be higher in rural settings, but urban palms can also be infested.

501,mammal_neotropic,Detecting and modelling delayed density-dependence in abundance time series of a small mammal (Didelphis aurita),"We study the population size time series of a Neotropical small mammal with the intent of detecting and modelling population regulation processes generated by density-dependent factors and their possible delayed effects. The application of analysis tools based on principles of statistical generality are nowadays a common practice for describing these phenomena, but, in general, they are more capable of generating clear diagnosis rather than granting valuable modelling. For this reason, in our approach, we detect the principal temporal structures on the bases of different correlation measures, and from these results we build an ad-hoc minimalist autoregressive model that incorporates the main drivers of the dynamics. Surprisingly our model is capable of reproducing very well the time patterns of the empirical series and, for the first time, clearly outlines the importance of the time of attaining sexual maturity as a central temporal scale for the dynamics of this species. In fact, an important advantage of this analysis scheme is that all the model parameters are directly biologically interpretable and potentially measurable, allowing a consistency check between model outputs and independent measurements.",10.1038/srep19553,2-s2.0-84958576669,11,0.45194622789016603,1,detect and model delay dens depend in abund tim sery of a smal mam didelph aurit we study the pop siz tim sery of a neotrop smal mam with the int of detect and model pop reg process gen by dens depend fact and their poss delay effect the apply of analys tool bas on principl of stat gen ar nowaday a common pract for describ thes phenomen but in gen they ar mor cap of gen clear diagnos rath than grant valu model for thi reason in our approach we detect the princip temp structures on the bas of diff correl meas and from thes result we build an ad hoc minim autoregress model that incorp the main driv of the dynam surpr our model is cap of reproduc very wel the tim pattern of the empir sery and for the first tim clear outlin the import of the tim of attain sex mat as a cent temp scal for the dynam of thi specy in fact an import adv of thi analys scheme is that al the model paramet ar direct biolog interpret and pot meas allow a consist check between model output and independ meas,new,0.4460204550202907,0.4176154859269801,0.4024142805910958,0.3955419456371295,0.3947139006249913,0.3990748798000982,0.4087062456272023,0.4246165509376621,0.44921786578525463,0.4878133566902361,0.5526070855704482
517,mammal_neotropic,Ecology and status of the jaguarundi Puma yagouaroundi: A synthesis of existing knowledge,"The ecology of the jaguarundi is poorly known, so I reviewed the literature for all original data and remarks on jaguarundi observations, ecology, and behaviour, to synthesize what is known about the species. Jaguarundis occupy and use a range of habitats with dense undergrowth from northern Mexico to central Argentina, but may be most abundant in seasonal dry, Atlantic, gallery, and mixed grassland/agricultural forest landscapes. Jaguarundis are principally predators of small (sigmodontine) rodents, although other mammals, birds, and squamate reptiles are taken regularly. The vast majority of jaguarundi camera-trap records occurred during daylight hours (0600h-1800h); jaguaurndis are also predominantly terrestrial, although they appear to be capable tree climbers. Home range sizes for jaguarundis vary greatly, but most are ‚â§25km2; females' territories may be much smaller than or similar in size to those of males. Males may concentrate movements in one area before shifting to another and, as with other felids, intersexual overlap in habitat use appears to be common. Interference competition may be important in influencing the distribution and ecology of jaguarundis, although their diurnal habits may somewhat mitigate its effect. Conflict between humans and jaguarundis over small livestock may be widespread among rural human communities and is likely to be underreported. Despite this conflict, jaguarundis can persist in agriculturally modified landscapes and small forest fragments. Additional research on local jaguarundi populations from more areas should be a priority to determine the true status of the species. ¬© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",10.1111/mam.12051,2-s2.0-84958773010,12,0.631959266146432,0,ecolog and stat of the jaguarund pum yagouaround a synthes of ex knowledg the ecolog of the jaguarund is poor known so i review the lit for al origin dat and remark on jaguarund observ ecolog and behavio to synthes what is known about the specy jaguarund occupy and us a rang of habit with dens undergrow from northern mexico to cent argentin but may be most abund in season dry atl gallery and mix grassland agricult forest landscap jaguarund ar princip pred of smal sigmodontin rod although oth mam bird and squam reptil ar tak regul the vast maj of jaguarund camer trap record occur dur daylight hour h h jaguaurnd ar also predomin terrest although they appear to be cap tre climb hom rang siz for jaguarund vary gre but most ar ‚â§km fem territ may be much smal than or simil in siz to thos of mal mal may cont mov in on are bef shift to anoth and as with oth felid intersex overlap in habit us appear to be common interf competit may be import in influ the distribut and ecolog of jaguarund although their diurn habit may somewh mitig it effect conflict between hum and jaguarund ov smal livestock may be widespread among rur hum commun and is lik to be underreport despit thi conflict jaguarund can persist in agricult mod landscap and smal forest frag addit research on loc jaguarund pop from mor area should be a pri to determin the tru stat of the specy,new,0.6564405645661353,0.6011480732691782,0.5630302673167469,0.5365373912277657,0.5181138359258834,0.5057686326998346,0.4985227055466983,0.49616175607015406,0.4993178301958277,0.5100593801506206,0.5339160807609517
523,mammal_neotropic,Line transect surveys underdetect terrestrial mammals: Implications for the sustainability of subsistence hunting,"Conservation of Neotropical game species must take into account the livelihood and food security needs of local human populations. Hunting management decisions should therefore rely on abundance and distribution data that are as representative as possible of true population sizes and dynamics. We simultaneously applied a commonly used encounterbased method and an infrequently used sign-based method to estimate hunted vertebrate abundance in a 48,000-km2 indigenous landscape in southern Guyana. Diurnal direct encounter data collected during three years along 216, four-kilometer -long transects consistently under-detected many diurnal and nocturnal mammal species readily detected through sign. Of 32 species analyzed, 31 were detected by both methods; however, encounters did not detect one and under-detected another 12 of the most heavily hunted species relative to sign, while sign under-detected 12 never or rarely collected species relative to encounters. The six most important game animals in the region, all ungulates, were not encountered at 11-40% of village and control sites or on 29-72% of transects where they were detected by sign. Using the sign methodology, we find that tapirs, one of the terrestrial vertebrates considered most sensitive to overexploitation, are present at many sites where they were never visually detected during distance sampling. We find that this is true for many other species as well. These high rates of under-detection suggest that behavioral changes in hunted populations may affect apparent occurrence and abundance of these populations. Accumulation curves (detection of species on transects) were much steeper for sign for 12 of 16 hunted species than for encounters, but that pattern was reversed for 12 of 16 species unhunted in our area. We conclude that collection of sign data is an efficient and effective method of monitoring hunted vertebrate populations that complements encounter and camera-trapping methods in areas impacted by hunting. Sign surveys may be the most viable method for large-scale, management-oriented studies in remote areas, particularly those focused on community-based wildlife management. ¬© 2016 Fragoso et al.

531,mammal_neotropic,Nonvolant mammalian populations in primary and secondary Central American rainforests as revealed by transect surveys,"Secondary forests are now prominent features in Neotropical landscapes, yet little is known about their conservation value for nonvolant mammalian communities. We performed a 20-month study using transect walks to survey the nonvolant mammal fauna in primary and secondary forests at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We found that secondary forests can hold complex mammalian communities and no species exhibited habitat preferences between primary and secondary forests. With few exceptions, behavioral and group dynamic characteristics of mammal species were similar between forest types. Our research allows us to address methodological questions and assess the effectiveness of transect sampling. Monthly detection rates vary widely by species and likely reflect short-term changes in behavior rather than population fluctuations. Air temperature and rainfall are the factors most associated with monthly detection rates for various species. Small-scale areas of higher and lower use are evident for several species. Neither time of morning for surveys nor number of observers per trail affects detection rate. We report current abundances for the most commonly observed species and note generally lower densities in the Caribbean lowlands than elsewhere in the Neotropics. This research highlights that in less seasonal, evergreen forests climatic factors can still affect mammalian behavior. Overall, we find that secondary forests are of high conservation value and that transect walks are an effective methodology to sample many nonvolant mammal species, and we present recommendations on how to sample properly to conduct rigorous and long-term studies. ¬© 2016 American Society of Mammalogists.",10.1093/jmammal/gyw009,2-s2.0-84964425498,10,0.596771602493218,1,nonvol mam pop in prim and second cent am rainforest as rev by transect survey second forest ar now promin feat in neotrop landscap yet littl is known about their conserv valu for nonvol mam commun we perform a mon study us transect walk to survey the nonvol mam faun in prim and second forest at la selv biolog stat in the carib lowland of northeastern cost ric we found that second forest can hold complex mam commun and no specy exhibit habit pref between prim and second forest with few exceiv behavy and group dynam charact of mam specy wer simil between forest typ our research allow us to address methodolog quest and assess the effect of transect sampl month detect rat vary wid by specy and lik reflect short term chang in behavy rath than pop fluctu air temp and rainfal ar the fact most assocy with month detect rat for vary specy smal scal area of high and low us ar evid for sev specy neith tim of morn for survey nor numb of observ per trail affect detect rat we report cur abund for the most common observ specy and not gen low dens in the carib lowland than elsewh in the neotrop thi research highlight that in less season evergreen forest clim fact can stil affect mam behavy overal we find that second forest ar of high conserv valu and that transect walk ar an effect methodolog to sampl many nonvol mam specy and we pres recommend on how to sampl prop to conduc rig and long term study,new,0.6652006085029659,0.596126066405575,0.5474646571254863,0.5122882213225562,0.48614740963159503,0.46648492447627776,0.45187511634218575,0.4416304508041512,0.43571231808396815,0.4349714286540622,0.4422201181057935
541,mammal_neotropic,What if it gets crowded? Density-dependent tortuosity in individual movements of a Neotropical mammal,"Effects of density dependence on animal movements have received much attention in ecology, but it is still debated to what extent dispersal and movements in general are density dependent, and their potential contribution to population regulation processes. Here, we determine the occurrence and nature of density dependence in the movements of a Neotropical marsupial, the black-eared opossum Didelphis auritaWied-Neuwied 1826. Using spool-and-line tracking devices, we estimated the tortuosity of fine-scale movements of 149 individuals by their fractal dimension D. We evaluated the relative importance of population size, reproductive or climatic seasons and reproductive maturity of individuals as determinants of movement tortuosity, using a model selection approach. Population size was the most important determinant of movement tortuosity, with season (climatic seasons for females, reproductive seasons for males) and reproductive maturity as secondary but also important variables. We detected a positive density-dependent effect on movement tortuosity, resulting in more intensive use of areas by individuals during periods of high population size. This positive association between movement tortuosity and population size is more likely to result from intraspecific competition, which forces individuals to explore their environment more intensively during high-density periods. Therefore, despite being density dependent, movements in D.aurita apparently do not contribute to population regulation mechanisms. ¬© 2015 Ecological Society of Australia.",10.1111/aec.12250,2-s2.0-84983175060,13,0.668577525367559,0,what if it get crowd dens depend tortuos in individ mov of a neotrop mam effect of dens depend on anim mov hav receiv much at in ecolog but it is stil deb to what ext dispers and mov in gen ar dens depend and their pot contribut to pop reg process her we determin the occur and nat of dens depend in the mov of a neotrop marsup the black ear oposs didelph auritawy neuwy us spool and lin track dev we estim the tortuos of fin scal mov of individ by their fract dimend d we evalu the rel import of pop siz reproduc or clim season and reproduc mat of individ as determin of mov tortuos us a model select approach pop siz was the most import determin of mov tortuos with season clim season for fem reproduc season for mal and reproduc mat as second but also import vary we detect a posit dens depend effect on mov tortuos result in mor intend us of area by individ dur period of high pop siz thi posit assocy between mov tortuos and pop siz is mor lik to result from intraspec competit which forc individ to expl their environ mor intend dur high dens period theref despit being dens depend mov in d aurit app do not contribut to pop reg mech,new,0.6688362806228743,0.6202536565875009,0.5868422324526825,0.5636971945543335,0.5477751048446382,0.5374259969927594,0.5319034402709419,0.531186982505799,0.5361175642318832,0.5490894414622696,0.5761990302933142
552,mammal_neotropic,Use of Atlantic Forest protected areas by free-ranging dogs: Estimating abundance and persistence of use,"Worldwide, domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are one of the most common carnivoran species in natural areas and their populations are still increasing. Dogs have been shown to impact wildlife populations negatively, and their occurrence can alter the abundance, behavior, and activity patterns of native species. However, little is known about abundance and density of the free-ranging dogs that use protected areas. Here, we used camera trap data with an open-robust design mark-recapture model to estimate the number of dogs that used protected areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We estimated the time period these dogs used the protected areas, and explored factors that influenced the probability of continued use (e.g., season, mammal richness, proportion of forest), while accounting for variation in detection probability. Dogs in the studied system were categorized as rural free-ranging, and their abundance varied widely across protected areas (0-73 individuals). Dogs used protected areas near human houses for longer periods (e.g., >50% of sampling occasions) compared to more distant areas. We found no evidence that their probability of continued use varied with season or mammal richness. Dog detection probability decreased linearly among occasions, possibly due to the owners confining their dogs after becoming aware of our presence. Comparing our estimates to those for native carnivoran, we found that dogs were three to 85 times more abundant than ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), two to 25 times more abundant than puma (Puma concolor), and approximately five times more abundant than the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). Combining camera trapping data with modern mark-recapture methods provides important demographic information on free-ranging dogs that can guide management strategies to directly control dogs' abundance and ranging behavior.

562,mammal_neotropic,"Predators, prey and habitat structure: Can key conservation areas and early signs of population collapse be detected in neotropical forests?","Tropical forests with a low human population and absence of large-scale deforestation provide unique opportunities to study successful conservation strategies, which should be based on adequate monitoring tools. This study explored the conservation status of a large predator, the jaguar, considered an indicator of the maintenance of how well ecological processes are maintained. We implemented an original integrative approach, exploring successive ecosystem status proxies, from habitats and responses to threats of predators and their prey, to canopy structure and forest biomass. Niche modeling allowed identification of more suitable habitats, significantly related to canopy height and forest biomass. Capture/recapture methods showed that jaguar density was higher in habitats identified as more suitable by the niche model. Surveys of ungulates, large rodents and birds also showed higher density where jaguars were more abundant. Although jaguar density does not allow early detection of overall vertebrate community collapse, a decrease in the abundance of large terrestrial birds was noted as good first evidence of disturbance. The most promising tool comes from easily acquired LiDAR data and radar images: a decrease in canopy roughness was closely associated with the disturbance of forests and associated decreasing vertebrate biomass. This mixed approach, focusing on an apex predator, ecological modeling and remote-sensing information, not only helps detect early population declines in large mammals, but is also useful to discuss the relevance of large predators as indicators and the efficiency of conservation measures. It can also be easily extrapolated and adapted in a timely manner, since important open-source data are increasingly available and relevant for large-scale and real-time monitoring of biodiversity. ¬© 2016 de Thoisy et al.

571,mammal_neotropic,"Estimating the potential distribution and conservation priorities of Chironectes minimus (Zimmermann, 1780) (Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae)","The water opossum (Chironectes minimus) is an elusive and solitary Neotropical semi-aquatic species, whose population dynamics cannot be studied using traditional methods to capture small mammals. Therefore, some aspects of its distribution, habitat requirements, and abundance are mostly unknown; which makes a proper determination of its conservation status difficult. Considering that new techniques known as species distribution models (SDMs) allow us to estimate the suitable areas and the most important variables for the distribution of a species, we compiled water opossum occurrences and modeled its potential distribution on a continental scale. We performed a SDM for the water opossum using MaxEnt and assessed the extent of habitat loss (km2) and the importance of Protected Areas (PAs). We compared the suitability values within and outside PAs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to evaluate the efficiency of PAs. The results obtained were compared with the IUCN historical water opossum's map. Additionally, we identified gaps in the potential distribution where for future surveys should be focused. We obtained models that describe the distribution of this species based on 292 occurrences with new information for 16 countries. Deforestation reduced the area of suitable habitat by ‚àº40 % and only ‚àº18 % corresponds to natural forest within PAs. Areas inside PAs showed higher suitability values (0.351 ¬± 0.276; P &lt; 0.001) than areas outside them. We identified gaps within the distribution that need attention during future surveys such as the frontier between Venezuela and Guyana, the Amazonian region, and central-eastern Brazil. Our results showed areas absent in the IUCN's distribution map, indicating that it needs to be updated. Thus, we proposed a new tentative extent of the water opossum distribution information here obtained. We demonstrated that PAs included areas with high habitat suitability values for C. minimus, which could protect the water opossum in the medium and long-term. Modifications to the physicochemical characteristics of the habitat due to forest loss and fragmentation can considerably affect water opossum populations and reduce local diversity. Thus, the preservation of river ecosystems and surrounding areas represents a necessary step for the conservation of C. minimus. ¬© 2017 Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Mastozoolog√≠a, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.",10.12933/therya-17-478,2-s2.0-85020797138,6,0.578131939980885,0,estim the pot distribut and conserv pri of chironect minim zimmerman didelphimorph didelphida the wat oposs chironect minim is an elud and solit neotrop sem aqu specy whos pop dynam cannot be study us tradit method to capt smal mam theref som aspect of it distribut habit requir and abund ar most unknown which mak a prop determin of it conserv stat difficult consid that new techn known as specy distribut model sdms allow us to estim the suit area and the most import vary for the distribut of a specy we compil wat oposs occur and model it pot distribut on a contin scal we perform a sdm for the wat oposs us max and assess the ext of habit loss km and the import of protect area pas we comp the suit valu within and outsid pas us a kolmogorov smirnov ks test to evalu the efficy of pas the result obtain wer comp with the iucn hist wat oposs s map addit we ident gap in the pot distribut wher for fut survey should be focus we obtain model that describ the distribut of thi specy bas on occur with new inform for country deforest reduc the are of suit habit by ‚àº and on ‚àº correspond to nat forest within pas area insid pas show high suit valu ¬± p lt than area outsid them we ident gap within the distribut that nee at dur fut survey such as the fronty between venezuel and guyan the amazon reg and cent eastern brazil our result show area abs in the iucn s distribut map ind that it nee to be upd thu we propos a new tent ext of the wat oposs distribut inform her obtain we demonst that pas includ area with high habit suit valu for c minim which could protect the wat oposs in the med and long term mod to the physicochem charact of the habit due to forest loss and frag can consid affect wat oposs pop and reduc loc divers thu the preserv of riv ecosystem and surround area repres a necess step for the conserv of c minim,new,0.6131339151976298,0.5384120163862245,0.4881462502109067,0.4536651884736337,0.42952897986011984,0.41273563719626966,0.4017277142371138,0.395912104179001,0.3956030275087905,0.4025059043938202,0.4215626503448219
583,mammal_neotropic,Atlantic small-mammal: a dataset of communities of rodents and marsupials of the Atlantic forests of South America,"The contribution of small mammal ecology to the understanding of macroecological patterns of biodiversity, population dynamics, and community assembly has been hindered by the absence of large datasets of small mammal communities from tropical regions. Here we compile the largest dataset of inventories of small mammal communities for the Neotropical region. The dataset reviews small mammal communities from the Atlantic forest of South America, one of the regions with the highest diversity of small mammals and a global biodiversity hotspot, though currently covering less than 12% of its original area due to anthropogenic pressures. The dataset comprises 136 references from 300 locations covering seven vegetation types of tropical and subtropical Atlantic forests of South America, and presents data on species composition, richness, and relative abundance (captures/trap-nights). One paper was published more than 70¬†yr ago, but 80% of them were published after 2000. The dataset comprises 53,518 individuals of 124 species of small mammals, including 30 species of marsupials and 94 species of rodents. Species richness averaged 8.2 species (1‚Äì21) per site. Only two species occurred in more than 50% of the sites (the common opossum, Didelphis aurita and black-footed pigmy rice rat Oligoryzomys nigripes). Mean species abundance varied 430-fold, from 4.3 to 0.01 individuals/trap-night. The dataset¬†also revealed a hyper-dominance of 22 species that comprised 78.29% of all individuals captured, with only seven species representing 44% of all captures. The information contained on this dataset can be applied in the study of macroecological patterns of biodiversity, communities, and populations, but also to evaluate the ecological consequences of fragmentation and defaunation, and predict disease outbreaks, trophic interactions and community dynamics in this biodiversity hotspot. ¬© 2017 by the Ecological Society of America",10.1002/ecy.1893,2-s2.0-85021446349,4,0.5982491027273671,1,atl smal mam a dataset of commun of rod and marsup of the atl forest of sou americ the contribut of smal mam ecolog to the understand of macroecolog pattern of biodivers pop dynam and commun assembl has been hind by the abs of larg dataset of smal mam commun from trop reg her we compil the largest dataset of inv of smal mam commun for the neotrop reg the dataset review smal mam commun from the atl forest of sou americ on of the reg with the highest divers of smal mam and a glob biodivers hotspot though cur cov less than of it origin are due to anthropog press the dataset compr ref from loc cov sev veget typ of trop and subtrop atl forest of sou americ and pres dat on specy composit rich and rel abund capt trap night on pap was publ mor than ¬†yr ago but of them wer publ aft the dataset compr individ of specy of smal mam includ specy of marsup and specy of rod specy rich av specy ‚äì per sit on two specy occur in mor than of the sit the common oposs didelph aurit and black foot pigmy ric rat oligoryzom nigrip mean specy abund vary fold from to individ trap night the dataset¬†also rev a hyp domin of specy that compr of al individ capt with on sev specy repres of al capt the inform contain on thi dataset can be apply in the study of macroecolog pattern of biodivers commun and pop but also to evalu the ecolog consequ of frag and defaun and predict diseas outbreak troph interact and commun dynam in thi biodivers hotspot,new,0.6709918977041589,0.6040466477232183,0.5568297370752374,0.5225574943714735,0.4969129262100723,0.4774210071218156,0.4626958700547708,0.4520509829932247,0.4454079442612081,0.4435199193717048,0.4490292644316163

617,mammal_neotropic,Ecological drivers of Hepacivirus infection in a neotropical rodent inhabiting landscapes with various degrees of human environmental change,"Anthropogenic environmental change can impact community and population traits such as species diversity and population densities, which have been shown to influence the prevalence of viruses in wildlife reservoirs. In particular, host species resilient to changes in their natural habitat may increase in numbers, which in turn can affect the prevalence of directly transmitted viruses. We have carried out a survey of small mammal communities in three tropical landscapes differing in their degree of environmental change in Central Panama and investigated the effects of community changes on Hepacivirus prevalence. The modification of continuous habitat into partly connected or isolated habitat patches during the past century was linked to changes in species diversity and species assemblages, which was further associated with shifts in the abundance of generalist marsupial (Didelphis marsupialis, Philander opossum) and rodent (Proechimys semispinosus) species. The latter has become dominant in isolated habitat patches and was the only identified Hepacivirus host in our study system. Our analyses suggest that, in addition to the effects of host age and sex, host population density in interaction with sex ratio is a crucial predictor of infection probability. Although we found no significant relationships between species diversity per se and infection probability, the lowest prevalence detected in the landscape with the highest species diversity indicates that shifts in species assemblages (e.g. changes in the presence and abundance of marsupial predators) impact the host‚Äôs intraspecific contact rates, the probability of virus transmission and, thus, the virus prevalence. Our study additionally provides important data on the influence of human-induced landscape changes on infection probability and, therefore, on virus prevalence in wildlife and emphasizes the importance of a landscape-scale approach with concomitant consideration of the complex interactions between ecological factors. ¬© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s00442-018-4210-7,2-s2.0-85048957516,2,0.41765307561183507,1,ecolog driv of hepacivir infect in a neotrop rod inhabit landscap with vary degr of hum environ chang anthropog environ chang can impact commun and pop trait such as specy divers and pop dens which hav been shown to influ the prev of virus in wildl reservoir in particul host specy resy to chang in their nat habit may increas in numb which in turn can affect the prev of direct transmit virus we hav carry out a survey of smal mam commun in three trop landscap diff in their degr of environ chang in cent panam and investig the effect of commun chang on hepacivir prev the mod of continu habit into part connect or isol habit patch dur the past century was link to chang in specy divers and specy assembl which was furth assocy with shift in the abund of gen marsup didelph marsup philand oposs and rod proechimy semispinos specy the lat has becom domin in isol habit patch and was the on ident hepacivir host in our study system our analys suggest that in addit to the effect of host ag and sex host pop dens in interact with sex ratio is a cruc predict of infect prob although we found no sign rel between specy divers per se and infect prob the lowest prev detect in the landscap with the highest specy divers ind that shift in specy assembl e g chang in the pres and abund of marsup pred impact the host‚äôs intraspec contact rat the prob of vir transmit and thu the vir prev our study addit provid import dat on the influ of hum induc landscap chang on infect prob and theref on vir prev in wildl and emphas the import of a landscap scal approach with concomit consid of the complex interact between ecolog fact,new,0.4477013111404013,0.41883272231631763,0.40396278246516915,0.39756925946371036,0.39716805498513524,0.40183542211107937,0.41160882079473743,0.4274236292611311,0.4515490449376709,0.488967560790654,0.5511664154171699
621,mammal_neotropic,Negative or positive density-dependence in movements depends on climatic seasons: The case of a Neotropical marsupial,"One of the major challenges in animal ecology is to understand the factors and processes driving movement behaviour. Although density may influence movement patterns, the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in animal movements are still unclear, particularly whether it may vary among populations of a species, or across time within a population. Here, we evaluate the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in the movements of a Neotropical marsupial, the Grey four-eyed opossum Philander frenatus (Didelphidae, Didelphimorphia). We quantified fine-scale path tortuosity of individuals inhabiting continuous forest areas and forest fragments, in different climatic seasons (humid vs. super-humid). We also determined the relative importance of population size compared to sex and body mass on movements, using a model-selection approach. In forest fragments, path tortuosity increased with population size in the super-humid season, but decreased in the humid season. In the continuous forest, path tortuosity was affected only by sex and body mass, being slightly higher in males and negatively related to body mass. The occurrence of density-dependence on movements only in forest fragments is likely to reflect the higher overall density of P.¬†frenatus in small forest fragments. The variation in the nature of density-dependence between climatic seasons is likely to reflect a trade off between foraging over large areas (humid season, low resource availability) versus avoiding agonistic encounters (super-humid season, high resource availability). Our results show that (i) density-dependence in movements may be context-dependent occurring only in areas of relatively high overall population density; and (ii) density may affect movements in different ways at different climatic seasons. ¬© 2018 Ecological Society of Australia",10.1111/aec.12666,2-s2.0-85053672644,3,0.651680373007663,0,neg or posit dens depend in mov depend on clim season the cas of a neotrop marsup on of the maj challeng in anim ecolog is to understand the fact and process driv mov behavio although dens may influ mov pattern the occur and nat of dens depend in anim mov ar stil unclear particul wheth it may vary among pop of a specy or across tim within a pop her we evalu the occur and nat of dens depend in the mov of a neotrop marsup the grey four ey oposs philand frenat didelphida didelphimorph we quant fin scal path tortuos of individ inhabit continu forest area and forest frag in diff clim season humid vs sup humid we also determin the rel import of pop siz comp to sex and body mass on mov us a model select approach in forest frag path tortuos increas with pop siz in the sup humid season but decreas in the humid season in the continu forest path tortuos was affect on by sex and body mass being slight high in mal and neg rel to body mass the occur of dens depend on mov on in forest frag is lik to reflect the high overal dens of p ¬†frenatus in smal forest frag the vary in the nat of dens depend between clim season is lik to reflect a trad off between for ov larg area humid season low resourc avail vers avoid agon encount sup humid season high resourc avail our result show that i dens depend in mov may be context depend occur on in area of rel high overal pop dens and ii dens may affect mov in diff way at diff clim season,new,0.6802768947006242,0.6148441717643529,0.5689664489969087,0.5363434689643756,0.5127465492082576,0.49574621955292986,0.4840418684424147,0.47711940221606947,0.47522451430038976,0.47974764525574287,0.4946920840242571

170,mammal_oceanic,Distribution and abundance of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and other marine mammals off the northern Washington coast,"We examined the summer distribution of marine mammals off the northern Washington coast based on six ship transect surveys conducted between 1995 and 2002, primarily from the NOAA ship McArthur. Additionally, small boat surveys were conducted in the same region between 1989 and 2002 to gather photographic identification data on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) to examine movements and population structure. In the six years of ship survey effort, 706 sightings of 15 marine mammal species were made. Humpback whales were the most common large cetacean species and were seen every year and a total of 232 sightings of 402 animals were recorded during ship surveys. Highest numbers were observed in 2002, when there were 79 sightings of 139 whales. Line-transect estimates for humpback whales indicated that about 100 humpback whales inhabited these waters each year between 1995 and 2000; in 2002, however, the estimate was 562 (CV=0.21) whales. A total of 191 unique individuals were identified photographically and mark-recapture estimates also indicated that the number of animals increased from under 100 to over 200 from 1995 to 2002. There was only limited interchange of humpback whales between this area and feeding areas off Oregon and California. Killer whales were also seen on every ship survey and represented all known ecotypes of the Pacific Northwest, including southern and northern residents, transients, and offshore-type killer whales. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were the most frequently sighted small cetacean; abundance was estimated at 181-291 individuals, except for 2002 when we observed dramatically higher numbers (876, CV=0.30).

260,mammal_oceanic,An assessment of Greenland walrus populations,"Recent abundance estimates were combined with historical catches and an age- and sex-structured population dynamic model to perform Bayesian assessments of the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) populations in West Greenland, the North Water in northern Baffin Bay, and East Greenland. The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

329,mammal_oceanic,"Inter-annual and seasonal trends in cetacean distribution, density and abundance off southern California","Trends in cetacean density and distribution off southern California were assessed through visual line-transect surveys during thirty-seven California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) cruises from July 2004-November 2013. From sightings of the six most commonly encountered cetacean species, seasonal, annual and overall density estimates were calculated. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted baleen whales with overall densities of 0.91/1000km2 (CV=0.27), 2.73/1000km2 (CV=0.19), and 1.17/1000km2 (CV=0.21) respectively. Species specific density estimates, stratified by cruise, were analyzed using a generalized additive model to estimate long-term trends and correct for seasonal imbalances. Variances were estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap with one day of effort as the sampling unit. Blue whales were primarily observed during summer and fall while fin and humpback whales were observed year-round with peaks in density during summer and spring respectively. Short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoidesdalli) were the most frequently encountered small cetaceans with overall densities of 705.83/1000km2 (CV=0.22), 51.98/1000km2 (CV=0.27), and 21.37/1000km2 (CV=0.19) respectively. Seasonally, short-beaked common dolphins were most abundant in winter whereas Pacific white-sided dolphins and Dall's porpoise were most abundant during spring. There were no significant long-term changes in blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, short-beaked common dolphin or Dall's porpoise densities while Pacific white-sided dolphins exhibited a significant decrease in density across the ten-year study.

This study includes new data on the biological diversity and abundance of the region and research and management recommendations. We conducted surveys and over 300 research SCUBA dives among the remote Phoenix Islands: Nikumaroro (Gardner), McKean, Manra (Sydney), Kanton (Aba-Riringa), Enderbury, Orona (Hull) and Rawaki (Phoenix), only excluding Birnie Island due to time limitations. Corals, benthic and mobile invertebrates, fishes, algae, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals were surveyed at each site. Deep-sea life was sampled during seven deployments of an autonomous digital video camera system to 1,000 m depth at Kanton, Manra, and Orona. Coral reef and fish communities were surveyed using rapid assessment methods, small benthic fishes were collected using rotenone as a stunning agent, marine algae were collected by hand primarily during SCUBA dives, and a deepdrop collecting net was deployed to sample deep-sea animals. The reefs show evidence of the extreme isolation of these islands, pounded on three sides by the large ocean swells of the Pacific with only a narrow protected side to the west providing protection for anchorage. Coral species diversity of the islands was moderately high. While lacking in some corals dominant in other major reef areas, the reefs have interesting species assemblages, with prolific growth of some species normally subdominant in other reef areas. The reefs were in an excellent state of health, at the time of these surveys free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific recently and with no evidence of any coral diseases. Our data include new distribution records for species of algae, coral and fishes. Fish communities were abundant and diverse and included pelagic fishes such as tuna and oceanic mackerels. Significant populations of grey reef, whitetip reef, and blacktip reef sharks were also observed indicating a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Reef macropredators (trevally, Napoleon wrasse) were also abundant. The deep-sea camera recorded images of deep-water sharks including six-gilled and Pacific sleeper sharks. Marine mammal sightings include bottlenose dolphins, Pacific spinner dolphins, beaked whales (Mesoplodon spp.), and unidentified whales. Sea birds observed on Rawaki, McKean, Enderbury, and Orona Islands included tens of thousands of nesting spectacled terns (grey-backed), sooty terns, white fairy-terns, brown noddies, blue-grey noddies, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-footed boobies, red-tailed tropic birds, great frigate birds and lesser frigate birds. Green sea turtle nesting sites were identified on Nikumaroro, McKean and Phoenix Islands.

518,mammal_oceanic,Seasonal distribution and abundance of cetaceans off southern California estimated from CalCOFI cruise data from 2004 to 2008,"Documenting year-round diversity and distribution of marine mammals off Southern California is important for assessment of effects of potentially harmful anthropogenic activities. Although the waters off Southern California have been surveyed extensively for marine mammals over the past 18 years, such surveys have been periodic and were conducted primarily from summer to fall, thereby missing potential seasonal shifts. We examined seasonal abundance and population density of cetaceans off Southern California from 16 shipboard line-transect surveys conducted quarterly during 2004-08. The study area consisted of 238,494 km2 of coastal, shelf, and pelagic oceanic habitat from nearshore waters to 700 km offshore. Based on 693 encounters of 20 cetacean species, abundance estimates by seasonal period (summer-fall or winter-spring) and depth (shallow: &lt;2000.5 m; deep: ‚â•2000.5 m) were determined for the 11 most commonly encountered species. The following are values of uncorrected density (individuals/1000 km2, coefficients of variation in parentheses) for the seasonal period and depth with greatest density for a selection of the species in this study: blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), summer-fall, shallow, 3.2 (0.26); fin whale (B. physalus), summer-fall, shallow, 3.7 (0.30); humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), summer- fall, shallow, 3.1 (0.36); short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), summer-fall, shallow, 1319.7 (0.24); long-beaked common dolphin (D. capensis), summer-fall, shallow, 687.9 (0.52); and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), winter-spring, deep, 48.65 (0.28).

618,mammal_oceanic,"Distribution and abundance of dugongs in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia","Dugong abundances in Moreton Bay (south-east Queensland) were estimated during six bi-monthly aerial surveys throughout 1995. Sampling intensity ranged between 20 and 80% for different sampling zones within the Bay, with a mean intensity of 40.5%. Population estimates for dugongs were corrected for perception bias (the proportion of animals visible in the transect that were missed by observers), and standardised for availability bias (the proportion of animals that were invisible due to water turbidity) with survey and species-specific correction factors. Population estimates for dugongs in Moreton Bay ranged from 503 ¬± 64 (s.e.) in July to 1019 ¬± 166 in January. The highest uncorrected count was 857 dugongs in December. This is greater than previous population estimates, suggesting that either previous surveys have underestimated abundance and/or that this population may have increased through recruitment, immigration, or a combination of both. The high degree of variation in population estimates between surveys may be due to temporal differences in distribution and herding behaviour. In winter, dugongs were found in smaller herds and were dispersed over a wider area than in summer. The Eastern Banks region of the bay supported 80-98% of the dugong population at any one time. Within this region, there were several dugong 'hot spots' that were visited repeatedly by large herds. These 'hot spots' contained seagrass communities that were dominated by species that dugongs prefer to eat. The waters of Rous Channel, South Passage and nearby oceanic waters are also frequently inhabited by dugongs in the winter months. Dugongs in other parts of Moreton Bay were at much lower densities than on the Eastern Banks.",10.1071/WR98082,2-s2.0-0141763557,9,0.830886639,0,distribut and abund of dugong in moreton bay queensland austral dugong abund in moreton bay sou east queensland wer estim dur six bi month aer survey throughout sampl intens rang between and for diff sampl zon within the bay with a mean intens of pop estim for dugong wer correct for perceiv bia the proport of anim vis in the transect that wer miss by observ and standard for avail bia the proport of anim that wer invis due to wat turbid with survey and specy spec correct fact pop estim for dugong in moreton bay rang from ¬± s e in july to ¬± in janu the highest uncorrect count was dugong in decemb thi is gre than prevy pop estim suggest that eith prevy survey hav underestim abund and or that thi pop may hav increas through recruit immigr or a combin of both the high degr of vary in pop estim between survey may be due to temp diff in distribut and herd behavio in wint dugong wer found in smal herd and wer dispers ov a wid are than in sum the eastern bank reg of the bay support of the dugong pop at any on tim within thi reg ther wer sev dugong hot spot that wer visit rep by larg herd thes hot spot contain seagrass commun that wer domin by specy that dugong pref to eat the wat of rou channel sou pass and nearby oc wat ar also frequ inhabit by dugong in the wint month dugong in oth part of moreton bay wer at much low dens than on the eastern bank,new,0.7941220738724273,0.7381481577897633,0.6956570526868343,0.663015814216126,0.637258048886246,0.6164891570087025,0.599547687033502,0.5857594813590807,0.5748344559332409,0.5669269990870011,0.563031507159336

815,mammal_oceanic,Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) Reproductive Success is Influenced by Krill (Euphausia superba) Density and Climate,"The reproductive success of southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) depends on body condition and, therefore, on foraging success. This, in turn, might be affected by climatically driven change in the abundance of the species main prey, krill (Euphausia superba), on the feeding grounds. Annual data on southern right whale number of calves were obtained from aerial surveys carried out between 1997 and 2013 in southern Brazil, where the species concentrate during their breeding season. The number of calves recorded each year varied from 7 to 43 (= 21.11 ¬± 11.88). Using cross-correlation analysis we examined the response of the species to climate anomalies and krill densities. Significant correlations were found with krill densities (r = 0.69, p = 0.002, lag 0 years), Oceanic Ni√±o Index (r = '0.65, p = 0.03, lag 6 years), Antarctic Oscillation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01, lag 7 years) and Antarctic sea ice area (r = '0.68, p = 0.002, lag 0 years). Our results suggest that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success in southern Brazil by determining variation in food (krill) availability for the species. Therefore, increased frequency of years with reduced krill abundance, due to global warming, is likely to reduce the current rate of recovery of southern right whales from historical overexploitation.",10.1038/srep28205,2-s2.0-84975045802,40,0.7751467409999999,0,southern right whal eubalaen aust reproduc success is influ by kril euphaus superb dens and clim the reproduc success of southern right whal eubalaen aust depend on body condit and theref on for success thi in turn might be affect by clim driv chang in the abund of the specy main prey kril euphaus superb on the fee ground an dat on southern right whal numb of calv wer obtain from aer survey carry out between and in southern brazil wher the specy cont dur their bree season the numb of calv record each year vary from to ¬± us cross correl analys we examin the respons of the specy to clim anoma and kril dens sign correl wer found with kril dens r p lag year oc ni√±o index r p lag year antarct oscil r p lag year and antarct sea ic are r p lag year our result suggest that glob clim ind influ southern right whal bree success in southern brazil by determin vary in food kril avail for the specy theref increas frequ of year with reduc kril abund due to glob warm is lik to reduc the cur rat of recovery of southern right whal from hist overexploit,new,0.7964168924058513,0.7147090641967485,0.6523829607472962,0.6049776711969767,0.5678487977156363,0.5379423008254801,0.513325342458352,0.49275692443936536,0.47541350959975287,0.4607581075951834,0.448424813050116
912,mammal_oceanic,Assessment of the seabird community of the Mozambique Channel and its potential use as an indicator of tuna abundance,"Tropical seabirds are known to associate with aggregations of surface dwelling predators, like tunas when feeding. Some species are even regarded as near obligate commensals of tunas. As food is one of the main factors that shape breeding strategies and determine breeding success of seabirds, it is of interest to test the hypothesis that variations in tuna abundance may have effects on foraging success and thus on breeding parameters of tropical seabirds. The Mozambique Channel is appropriate for such a study because relative tuna abundance is assessed annually (through fishery catches) and seabird populations are abundant. A regional synopsis shows that at least 3.034 million pairs of seabirds breed on islands of the Mozambique Channel, 99.3% being sooty terns. This super-abundant seabird is strongly associated with tuna and marine mammals when feeding. More than 99% of the sooty tern population of the Mozambique Channel breeds at three remote coralline islands, namely Juan de Nova (66%), Europa (25%) and Glorieuses (9%). Various breeding parameters (breeding population size, breeding time, growth rate of the chicks, daily food intake, diet) are studied at these three sites in order to investigate their relation to the marine environment (including tuna abundance). A preliminary estimate is made of the quantity of food eaten by the sooty tern population. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1013,mammal_oceanic,Large-scale predator control increases population viability of a rare New Zealand riverine duck,"The introduction of mammalian predators to oceanic islands has led to dramatic declines in the abundance of many native species. Conservation management of these species often relies on low-cost predator control techniques that can be implemented over large scales. Assessing the effectiveness of such management techniques is difficult, but using population viability analyses (PVA), which identify the population growth rate (Œª) and extinction risk of threatened species, may offer a solution. PVA provide the opportunity to compare the relative effectiveness of various management options and can identify knowledge gaps to prioritize research efforts. We used PVA to assess the population viability of whio (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos), a rare riverine duck endemic to New Zealand. Current populations are threatened by introduced mammalian predators and are rapidly declining in both distribution and abundance. Whio conservation management is dominated by large-scale, low-intensity predator control, targeting introduced stoats (Mustela erminea). There is evidence that such control increases whio productivity but it is unknown if this increase is sufficient for long-term population persistence. We undertook a stochastic PVA to assess the viability of whio populations under different management scenarios using data obtained from a 6-year study of whio demographic responses to predator control. Populations with no predator control and low productivity will rapidly decline to extinction. Increasing productivity through predator control increased population viability but populations still showed a declining trajectory. A perturbation analysis showed that the growth rate of whio populations was largely driven by adult survival. Therefore, future research should target obtaining more robust estimates of adult survival, particularly how it is affected by predator control. Overall, our analysis indicated that large-scale predator control increases the short-term viability of whio populations but is insufficient for long-term population persistence. ¬© 2009 The Authors.

Environmental variability between 2014 and 2015 was also analyzed, in terms of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration. Both otariids reached their highest abundance in July of both years; however, relative to 2014, the 2015 survey showed a 59.7% decline in the total GFS abundance and a 42.9% decrease of GFS pups, while total CSL abundance decreased 52.0% and CSL pup presence decreased in 61.7%. All monthly surveys for both otariids showed a similar trend (&gt;50% decrease in 2015). Compared to 2014, the 2015 GFSs isotopic niche was three times larger (2.0 in 2015, 0.6 in 2014) and the Œ¥13C was significantly lower. CSLs also showed significantly lower Œ¥31C and higher Œ¥15N in 2015. Interannual segregation was greater for CSLs, and their pup body mass was also significantly lower during the 2015 breeding season (mean = 8.7 kg) than in the same season of 2014 (mean = 9.9 kg). The decrease in Œ¥13C for both otariids reflected a more oceanic foraging; most likely associated with the decline in primary productivity in surrounding areas to the SBA, related to a higher SST caused by the 2015 ENSO, with a subsequent increase in foraging effort. These would explain the fewer observed individuals on land, especially pups, which showed diminished body condition (CSLs). This study highlights the importance of marine mammals as sentinel species that respond dynamically to changes in environment, providing valuable information on the effect of ENSO on pinnipeds in Mexican waters. ¬© 2016 Elorriaga-Verplancken et al.

1213,mammal_oceanic,"Invasive american mink mustela vison in wetlands of the cape horn biosphere reserve, southern Chile: What are they eating?","The impact of alien American mink on the native fauna of oceanic islands has been demonstrated in a number of locations. In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.",10.1017/S0030605308099997,2-s2.0-67349234507,48,0.7618189879999999,0,invas am mink mustel vison in wetland of the cap horn biosph reserv southern chil what ar they eat the impact of aly am mink on the nat faun of oc island has been demonst in a numb of loc in the sub antarct cap horn biosph reserv of southern chil the specy is cur expand in an are wher the nat faun evolv in the abs of terrest pred to evalu any emerg problem we theref investig season vary in prey us by mink on navarino island within the reserv we ident undigest remain in scat collect from the shor of pond ov januarynovemb diet consist main of mam and bird mam includ both nat and exot rod wer the predomin prey in al season but bird wer of eq import dur the sum when bird bree and their abund and divers increas on the island exot rod wer the on ident mam prey item dur wint nat wetland bird constitut a subst proport of mink diet and gre than that report in oth area many bird bree on navarino island ar ground nest a strategy that evolv in the abs of nat mam pred consid the intern import of thi reg our result emphas the nee for an assess of the impact of mink pred on the pop of nat prey,new,0.8252847502102957,0.7538039111576917,0.6938868763895835,0.6447312120503718,0.603883574370059,0.5692485656982762,0.5392647183852622,0.5127610499277107,0.4887887866027072,0.46644332756138945,0.4446111312647302
1313,mammal_oceanic,"Influence of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic Ocean on a parasite, Echinorhynchus gadi (Acanthocephala) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) occurring off coastal Labrador, Canada","A study was conducted to determine the influence of environmental change on an endoparasite, Echinorhynchus gadi (Acanthocephala) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) over a 30-year period off the coast of Labrador in the north-western Atlantic, North Atlantic Fisheries Organization subareas 2J-3K. Cod, once an abundant fish species that had been commercially exploited for many decades, declined precipitously during the mid-1980s onwards. This decline was attributed to climatic changes that affected the entire food chain from zooplankton to fish, sea birds and marine mammals. A monitoring programme was introduced, sampling cod by otter trawling using research vessels. The fish, after capture, were frozen at - 20¬∞C, subsequently thawed and the digestive tract removed and examined for the parasite in 2006. Data from samples taken in 1976, 1980-81, 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2003 were compared statistically with those collected in 2006. The results indicate a decline in the prevalence and mean abundance of E. gadi in 1986 with a minimum in 2000 but increasing gradually in 2003 and 2006. These changes were coincident initially with a decline of oceanic temperature and the entire food web, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), a preferred prey of cod and primary source of E. gadi. The increase in prevalence and mean abundance of the parasite in 2006 were associated with an increase of oceanic temperature and the return of small schools of capelin to offshore areas. Cod older than 4 years harboured a greater abundance of E. gadi than younger fish, while no difference was observed between the sexes. The results suggest that the abundance of E. gadi can be useful as a bioindicator of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic. ¬© 2008 Cambridge University Press.",10.1017/S0022149X0897615X,2-s2.0-55949132378,14,0.7548359920000001,1,influ of environ chang in the nor western atl oc on a parasit echinorhynch gad acanthocephal of atl cod gad morhu occur off coast labrad canad a study was conduc to determin the influ of environ chang on an endoparasit echinorhynch gad acanthocephal of atl cod gad morhu ov a year period off the coast of labrad in the nor western atl nor atl fishery org subarea j k cod ont an abund fish specy that had been commerc exploit for many decad declin precipit dur the mid s onward thi declin was attribut to clim chang that affect the entir food chain from zooplankton to fish sea bird and marin mam a monit program was introduc sampl cod by ot trawl us research vessel the fish aft capt wer froz at ¬∞c subsequ thaw and the digest tract remov and examin for the parasit in dat from sampl tak in and wer comp stat with thos collect in the result ind a declin in the prev and mean abund of e gad in with a minim in but increas grad in and thes chang wer coincid init with a declin of oc temp and the entir food web includ capelin mallot villos a prefer prey of cod and prim sourc of e gad the increas in prev and mean abund of the parasit in wer assocy with an increas of oc temp and the return of smal schools of capelin to offsh area cod old than year harbo a gre abund of e gad than young fish whil no diff was observ between the sex the result suggest that the abund of e gad can be us as a bioind of environ chang in the nor western atl,new,0.7480316028490535,0.7002942491498244,0.6659014553618507,0.6405593755951676,0.6214961420068575,0.6071204813305138,0.5965693635663479,0.5894882989493103,0.5860083629768207,0.5869773703638816,0.5947927300218612
1412,mammal_oceanic,Wintering habitat model for the north atlantic right whale (eubalaena glacialis) in the southeastern united states,"The coastal waters off the southeastern United States (SEUS) are a primary wintering ground for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), used by calving females along with other adult and juvenile whales. Management actions implemented in this area for the recovery of the right whale population rely on accurate habitat characterization and the ability to predict whale distribution over time. We developed a temporally dynamic habitat model to predict wintering right whale distribution in the SEUS using a generalized additive model framework and aerial survey data from 2003/2004 through 2012/2013. We built upon previous habitat models for right whales in the SEUS and include data from new aerial surveys that extend the spatial coverage of the analysis, particularly in the northern portion of this wintering ground. We summarized whale sightings, survey effort corrected for probability of whale detection, and environmental data at a semimonthly resolution. Consistent with previous studies, sea surface temperature (SST), water depth, and survey year were significant predictors of right whale relative abundance. Additionally, distance to shore, distance to the 22uC SST isotherm, and an interaction between time of year and latitude (to account for the latitudinal migration of whales) were also selected in the analysis presented here. Predictions from the model revealed that the location of preferred habitat differs within and between years in correspondence with variation in environmental conditions. Although cow-calf pairs were rarely sighted in the company of other whales, there was minimal evidence that the preferred habitat of cow-calf pairs was different than that of whale groups without calves at the scale of this study. The results of this updated habitat model can be used to inform management decisions for a migratory species in a dynamic oceanic environment. ¬© 2014 Lihong et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0095126.g002,2-s2.0-84899700411,41,0.745970603,1,wint habit model for the nor atl right whal eubalaen glac in the southeastern unit stat the coast wat off the southeastern unit stat seu ar a prim wint ground for the endang nor atl right whal eubalaen glac us by calv fem along with oth adult and juvenil whal man act impl in thi are for the recovery of the right whal pop rely on acc habit charact and the abl to predict whal distribut ov tim we develop a temp dynam habit model to predict wint right whal distribut in the seu us a gen addit model framework and aer survey dat from through we built upon prevy habit model for right whal in the seu and includ dat from new aer survey that extend the spat cov of the analys particul in the northern port of thi wint ground we summ whal sight survey effort correct for prob of whal detect and environ dat at a semimonth resolv consist with prevy study sea surfac temp sst wat dep and survey year wer sign predict of right whal rel abund addit dist to shor dist to the uc sst isotherm and an interact between tim of year and latitud to account for the latitudin migr of whal wer also select in the analys pres her predict from the model rev that the loc of prefer habit diff within and between year in correspond with vary in environ condit although cow calf pair wer rar sight in the company of oth whal ther was minim evid that the prefer habit of cow calf pair was diff than that of whal group without calv at the scal of thi study the result of thi upd habit model can be us to inform man decid for a migr specy in a dynam oc environ,new,0.7733076633425634,0.7213212721936867,0.6824184499642826,0.6530723060791992,0.6305720919413147,0.6132146245571354,0.6000088444274545,0.5904892002291512,0.5846940249120197,0.5834165882711047,0.5891310528921272
1515,mammal_oceanic,You can‚Äôt run but you can hide: the negative influence of human presence on mid-sized mammals on an¬†Atlantic island,"Here, we report the results of a camera-trapping survey of mid-sized (1‚Äì50 kg) mammals on an oceanic Atlantic forest island in Brazil. Despite 80% of the island being formally reserved for conservation, the island‚Äôs northern areas support a small, but rapidly growing human population that we expected would disturb the mammals and their foraging and movement behaviors. Hunting activities are also more frequent and severe on the north side of the island, closer to the villages. We tested the following hypothesis: the probability of occupancy, detectability, and abundance of mid-sized mammals will be higher in less-disturbed areas on southern parts of the island than in more-disturbed areas to the north. Ordination using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) highlighted that mammal assemblages were differentiated between the northern and southern slope areas, and regression analyses showed MDS scores to be associated strongly with an index of human population density. Occupancy models for Didelphis aurita, Dasypus novemcinctus, Dasyprocta leporina, and Cuniculus paca showed no effect of habitat covariates, but there were marked effects of human activity impact on the detection probability of all species, except D. aurita. Species detections and local abundances were higher in the less disturbed southern parts of the island. Our results support the notion that mid-sized mammals will change their movement and foraging behaviors as a function of human activities, even inside reserved, protected areas. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",10.1007/s11852-017-0544-2,2-s2.0-85027376138,43,0.740329169,0,you can‚äôt run but you can hid the neg influ of hum pres on mid siz mam on an¬†atlantic island her we report the result of a camer trap survey of mid siz ‚äì kg mam on an oc atl forest island in brazil despit of the island being form reserv for conserv the island‚äôs northern area support a smal but rapid grow hum pop that we expect would disturb the mam and their for and mov behavy hunt act ar also mor frequ and sev on the nor sid of the island clos to the vil we test the follow hypothes the prob of occup detect and abund of mid siz mam wil be high in less disturb area on southern part of the island than in mor disturb area to the nor ordin us mult dimend scal mds highlight that mam assembl wer differenty between the northern and southern slop area and regress analys show mds scor to be assocy strongly with an index of hum pop dens occup model for didelph aurit dasyp novemcinct dasyproct leporin and cunicul pac show no effect of habit cov but ther wer mark effect of hum act impact on the detect prob of al specy exceiv d aurit specy detect and loc abund wer high in the less disturb southern part of the island our result support the not that mid siz mam wil chang their mov and for behavy as a funct of hum act ev insid reserv protect area,new,0.7599117817665644,0.6732524471811832,0.6046018595736901,0.55122966206517,0.5091667379571385,0.4754234855861403,0.4479814666962742,0.4255334384671064,0.4073152270957507,0.3931069436520821,0.3835870623375302

Prey consumption varies annually and accordingly with the physical and biological environment surrounding each island Juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is the most common prey of northern fur seals from St Paul Island; the island is surrounded by a broad neritic environment with widely separated frontal zones and is the greatest distance from the continental shelf-edge. Gonatid squid (Gonatopsis horealis/Berryteuthis magister and Gonatus madokai/Gonatus middendorffi) were the most common prey of northern fur seals from Medny Island; the island is surrounded by a compressed neritic environment and is adjacent to the continental shelf-edge and the oceanic marine environment. A combination of walleye pollock and gonatid squid is consumed by northern fur seals from St. George Island; the island has a surrounding oceanographic environment intermediate between the other two islands. Variability in predation on walleye pollock is consistent with fishery information concerning the relative abundance and availability of walleye pollock around St George and St Paul Islands.

1714,mammal_oceanic,The forgotten whale: A bibliometric analysis and literature review of the North Atlantic sei whale Balaenoptera borealis,"A bibliometric analysis of the literature on the sei whale Balaenoptera borealis is presented. Research output on the species is quantified and compared with research on four other whale species. The results show a significant increase in research for all species except the sei whale. Research output is characterized chronologically and by oceanic basin. The species' distribution, movements, stock structure, feeding, reproduction, abundance, acoustics, mortality and threats are reviewed for the North Atlantic, and the review is complemented with previously unpublished data. Knowledge on the distribution and movements of the sei whale in the North Atlantic is still mainly derived from whaling records. Movement patterns and winter distribution are not clear. Surveys in some known summering areas show that the species has changed its distribution in parts of its previously known range. With the present information, it is impossible to determine whether or not the North Atlantic sei whale population is subdivided into biological units. Abundance estimates are fragmentary and cover a restricted part of the summering habitat. In the North Atlantic, sei whales seem to be stenophagous, feeding almost exclusively on calanoid copepods and euphausiids. On feeding grounds, they are associated with oceanic frontal systems, but how they find and explore these structures has not been fully investigated. The available data on vital rates are based on whaling-derived studies and are 25 years old or older. Despite increasing human and environmentally induced pressures, there are no current estimates for mortality and population trends. Current research needs include the clear definition of stock units, reliable abundance estimates, studies of distribution and migration that incorporate the identification of wintering areas, acquisition of up-to-date data on reproduction and mortality, and investigations into the consequences of environmental changes for the species. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

1812,mammal_oceanic,Phenotypic changes and small mammal impoverishment on a Brazilian Atlantic Forest Island,"Faunal impoverishment and distorted species compositions are common phenomena in oceanic islands; however, many land-bridge islands are poorly inventoried, especially in the Neotropics. We sampled a small mammal community on a land-bridge island (Anchieta Island) along the Brazilian coast. We found only one marsupial Didelphis aurita (Wied-Neuwied, 1826) and two rodent species Oligoryzomys nigripes (Olfers, 1818) and Trinomys iheringi (Thomas, 1911) during 12 months of live trapping and 9195 trap-nights. The diversity of rodents and marsupials was not explained by species-area relations, indicating possible past extinctions. The abundance of D. aurita and O. nigripes was approximately three times higher, while the abundance of T. iheringi was approximately four times lower than abundances reported from other Brazilian Atlantic Forest sites. The population of D. aurita exhibited many phenotypic changes; males were on average 8 % smaller and females produced 30 % less litters than those from the mainland and other land-bridge islands. The long history of forest disturbance, habitat loss, reduction in forest productivity, and the recent introduction of mesopredators may be the major drivers that explain the small mammal community composition on this island. ¬© 2013 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",10.1515/mammalia-2011-0099,2-s2.0-84878148025,31,0.732423942,0,phenotyp chang and smal mam impov on a brazil atl forest island faun impov and distort specy composit ar common phenomen in oc island howev many land bridg island ar poor inv espec in the neotrop we sampl a smal mam commun on a land bridg island anchiet island along the brazil coast we found on on marsup didelph aurit wied neuwy and two rod specy oligoryzom nigrip olf and trinom ihering thoma dur month of liv trap and trap night the divers of rod and marsup was not explain by specy are rel ind poss past extinct the abund of d aurit and o nigrip was approxim three tim high whil the abund of t ihering was approxim four tim low than abund report from oth brazil atl forest sit the pop of d aurit exhibit many phenotyp chang mal wer on av smal and fem produc less lit than thos from the mainland and oth land bridg island the long hist of forest disturb habit loss reduc in forest produc and the rec introduc of mesopr may be the maj driv that explain the smal mam commun composit on thi island,new,0.7981699136612292,0.7234220415887815,0.6628207180472764,0.6141742195342912,0.5743752518762031,0.5410611085240675,0.512567827109575,0.4876950005488138,0.4654928316794445,0.44505691399325814,0.4251574733141762

Nearly 50% of the world's threatened bats are island endemics and because they are often the only native mammals on islands, they fulfil important ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal. Long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are critically endangered because of predation by exotic mammals, particularly ship rats (Rattus rattus), introduced by humans to the island archipelago of New Zealand. We monitored the survival of bats in three colonies in temperate rainforest in Fiordland over 22 years. Since 2009, we controlled predators during irruption phases and compared survival of bats in previously untreated areas with survival in forest blocks treated using rodenticides deployed in bait stations. Survival was estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models in Program Mark 7.0 with > 15,000 bats tagged. Survival was primarily dependent on year and age of bats, although seedfall intensity of the dominant canopy tree and predator management was also influential. Survival in long-tailed bats was as high as, or higher, than figures for bats generally in years with low predator numbers or predator control. Survival was markedly higher in treatment years when predators were managed (0.82 compared to 0.55). Population modelling indicated managed colonies will increase (Œª > 1.05) whereas unmanaged colonies will decline (Œª = 0.89 ‚àí 0.98) under scenarios that reflect increased frequency of beech mast and predator irruptions. Thus, effective predator control is essential for recovering long-tailed bat populations. Warming temperatures indicate that predator irruptions are becoming more frequent, which would require more predator control in the future than at present if declines in bat populations are to be reversed. These results are relevant to the conservation of threatened bats on oceanic islands, given the abundance of exotic mammalian predators, particularly ship rats, on them. ¬© 2017",10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.015,2-s2.0-85027719679,38,0.731413318,1,control invas pred enh the long term surv of endang new zealand long tail bat chalinolob tuberculat imply for conserv of bat on oc island invas mam pred pos on of the greatest threats to biodivers glob particul on oc island howev littl is known about the impact of thes invas pred on bat chiropter on of the most specy mam group and on of the most widespread group of mam threatened on oc island spp near of the world s threatened bat ar island endem and becaus they ar oft the on nat mam on island they fulfil import ecolog rol such as pollin and see dispers long tail bat chalinolob tuberculat ar crit endang becaus of pred by exot mam particul ship rat ratt ratt introduc by hum to the island archipelago of new zealand we monit the surv of bat in three colony in temp rainforest in fiordland ov year sint we control pred dur irrupt phas and comp surv of bat in prevy unt area with surv in forest block tre us rodenticid deploy in bait stat surv was estim us mult stat mark recapt model in program mark with bat tag surv was prim depend on year and ag of bat although seedfal intens of the domin canop tre and pred man was also influ surv in long tail bat was as high as or high than fig for bat gen in year with low pred numb or pred control surv was mark high in tre year when pred wer man comp to pop model ind man colony wil increas œª wherea unm colony wil declin œª ‚àí und scenario that reflect increas frequ of beech mast and pred irrupt thu effect pred control is ess for recov long tail bat pop warm temp ind that pred irrupt ar becom mor frequ which would requir mor pred control in the fut than at pres if declin in bat pop ar to be revers thes result ar relev to the conserv of threatened bat on oc island giv the abund of exot mam pred particul ship rat on them,new,0.7754922284587051,0.722885034329247,0.6825349757649101,0.6514684907987071,0.6271646296518085,0.6079731503096929,0.5928890854633717,0.5813779179206702,0.5733315496933515,0.5692064585643767,0.5706376565510342
2014,mammal_oceanic,Cetacean populations on the SE Bering Sea shelf during the late 1990s: Implications for decadal changes in ecosystem structure and carbon flow,"Baleen whales typically migrate to high-latitudes to feed during summer in regions of predictably high concentrations of their zooplankton or fish prey. Therefore, their presence in shelf systems is a good indicator of productive food webs. Line-transect surveys of cetaceans conducted during the late 1990s in the SE Bering Sea (160.32 to 171.08¬∞ W) indicate that the middle shelf (50 m &lt; z &lt; 100 m) now supports the highest whale biomass in this region. In recent decades, whales were rare and hence their ecological role on the shelf was limited. During July 1997, the density and abundance (N) of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were highest on the middle shelf between 163.7 and 168.1¬∞ W: 0.0236 humpback whales km -2, N = 1308 (coefficient of variation, CV = 0.65), and 0.00924 fin whales km-2, N = 513 (CV = 0.61), respectively. Similarly, during June 1999, fin whales were the most numerically dominant species of large whale in the SE Bering Sea, with highest densities and abundance in the 'central' middle shelf (163.7 to 168.1¬∞ W): 0.0169 fin whales km-2, N = 938 (CV = 0.54). During the summers of 1997 and 1999, 65 and 79 % of the prey consumption by fin whales in the SE Bering Sea occurred on the central middle shelf. Prey biomass consumed by fin and humpback whales on the SE Bering Sea shelf and slope in 1997 (264474 to 723504 metric tons, mt) is equivalent to 34-94% of the 1997 echo-integration trawl estimate of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma biomass (age 1+) for the shelf east of 170¬∞ W (0.77 √ó 106 mt). Large whales were much more abundant on the middle shelf during the late 1990s than during preceding decades and, therefore, their foraging may have impacted trophic dynamics, carbon pathways and nutrient cycling. The partitioning of available carbon and energy in the pelagic and benthic systems of the shelf, as determined previously during the 1970s, when whales were rare, should now be reexamined relative to the increased ecological impact of these top-level predators. Fluxes of carbon that involve pathways through whales should be incorporated in shelf and oceanic carbon budgets.",10.3354/meps272281,2-s2.0-3042565851,29,0.7293686709999999,1,cetac pop on the se ber sea shelf dur the lat s imply for decad chang in ecosystem structure and carbon flow baleen whal typ migr to high latitud to fee dur sum in reg of predict high cont of their zooplankton or fish prey theref their pres in shelf system is a good ind of produc food web lin transect survey of cetac conduc dur the lat s in the se ber sea to ¬∞ w ind that the middl shelf m lt z lt m now support the highest whal biomass in thi reg in rec decad whal wer rar and hent their ecolog rol on the shelf was limit dur july the dens and abund n of humpback whal megapter novaeanglia and fin whal balaenopter physal wer highest on the middl shelf between and ¬∞ w humpback whal km n coefficy of vary cv and fin whal km n cv respect simil dur jun fin whal wer the most num domin specy of larg whal in the se ber sea with highest dens and abund in the cent middl shelf to ¬∞ w fin whal km n cv dur the sum of and and of the prey consum by fin whal in the se ber sea occur on the cent middl shelf prey biomass consum by fin and humpback whal on the se ber sea shelf and slop in to met ton mt is equ to of the echo integr trawl estim of walley pollock theragr chalcogramm biomass ag for the shelf east of ¬∞ w √ó mt larg whal wer much mor abund on the middl shelf dur the lat s than dur prec decad and theref their for may hav impact troph dynam carbon pathway and nutry cyc the partit of avail carbon and energy in the pel and benth system of the shelf as determin prevy dur the s when whal wer rar should now be reexamin rel to the increas ecolog impact of thes top level pred flux of carbon that involv pathway through whal should be incorp in shelf and oc carbon budget,new,0.7556911730985199,0.6892460774619776,0.6401958751909311,0.6039425401953038,0.5766535079546001,0.5559212869946685,0.5403586482239677,0.5293089691092113,0.5227839978167579,0.5217705449208482,0.5293795180971367
2115,mammal_oceanic,"Population status, trends and a re-examination of the hypotheses explaining the recent declines of the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina","1. Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Vald√©s, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. ¬© 2005 Mammal Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2907.2005.00055.x,2-s2.0-13844250597,12,0.7262456490000001,1,pop stat trend and a re examin of the hypothes explain the rec declin of the southern eleph seal miroung leonin between the s and s the southern eleph seal miroung leonin underw larg decreas in pop siz throughout most of it bree rang in the southern oc whil cur pop estim suggest a rec recovery som bree pop hav continu to decreas in rec year macqu and mar island oth hav eith remain stabl sou georg kerguel and heard island or hav increas peninsul vald√©s argentin intrins c hypothes for pattern of reg declin includ fact that ar affect by dens depend mech i pauc of mal ii pop overshoot and ii pandem diseas extrins hypothes includ iv pred v competit with fishery concern vi interspec competit vii environ chang and vii hum disturb of the eight hypothes propos and examin her we conclud that three can be discount i v vii three ar unlik but may requir mor test ii ii iv and two ar plaus vi vii the interspec competit hypot hes is difficult to test becaus it requir the simult monit of specy that overlap direct with eleph seal many of which hav not been ident or littl is known howev an analys of the rel between log vary and log abund tayl s pow law for pop of southern and northern eleph seal suggest that interspec competit is not a sign fact in the declin of the southern eleph seal the hypothes that decreas in southern eleph se al pop between the s and s wer caus by the environ chang is the easiest to test and most plaus of the hypothes we propos a framework by which to test thi hypothes to determin how food avail affect individ surv,new,0.7522098655371009,0.7065528235039622,0.6751804123611379,0.6534580689777544,0.6383210348564713,0.628079872511635,0.6219112505558585,0.6196239252405663,0.6216873929183593,0.6296832576086705,0.6477630586542289
2211,mammal_oceanic,"A critical review of the regime shift-""junk food""-nutritional stress hypothesis for the decline of the western stock of steller sea lion","Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in the central and western Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and Bering Sea have declined by 80% in the last 30 yr. One hypothesis for the decline in this western Steller sea lion population is that a climate regime shift in 1976-1977 changed the species composition of the fish community and reduced the nutritional quality (energy density) of the sea lion prey field. This in turn led to nutritional stress and reduced individual fitness, survival, and reproduction of sea lions. Implications of this regime shift-""junk food"" hypothesis are that (1) the recruitment and abundance of supposed high quality species (e.g., Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi) decreased while those of supposed low quality (e.g., species in the family Gadidae) increased following the regime shift, (2) Steller sea lion diets shifted in response to this change in fish community structure, and (3) a diet composed principally of gadids (e.g., walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma) is detrimental to sea lion fitness and survival. We examine data relating to each of these implications and find little support for the hypothesis that increases in the availability and consumption of gadids following the regime shift are primarily responsible for the decline of the western population of Steller sea lion. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.",10.1111/j.1748-7692.2005.tb01245.x,2-s2.0-20744454798,39,0.703699415,1,a crit review of the regim shift junk food nutrit stress hypothes for the declin of the western stock of stel sea lion stel sea lion eumetopia jubat in the cent and western gulf of alask aleut island and ber sea hav declin by in the last yr on hypothes for the declin in thi western stel sea lion pop is that a clim regim shift in chang the specy composit of the fish commun and reduc the nutrit qual energy dens of the sea lion prey field thi in turn led to nutrit stress and reduc individ fit surv and reproduc of sea lion imply of thi regim shift junk food hypothes ar that the recruit and abund of suppos high qual specy e g pac her clupe pallas decreas whil thos of suppos low qual e g specy in the famy gadida increas follow the regim shift stel sea lion diet shift in respons to thi chang in fish commun structure and a diet compos princip of gadid e g walley pollock theragr chalcogramm is detry to sea lion fit and surv we examin dat rel to each of thes imply and find littl support for the hypothes that increas in the avail and consum of gadid follow the regim shift ar prim respons for the declin of the western pop of stel sea lion,new,0.741897894445066,0.7287922072313412,0.7223385323926195,0.7197315432393957,0.719758461810842,0.7219394977487732,0.7261936076185443,0.7327649740749278,0.742325985847442,0.7563762672537035,0.77836440404504
2312,mammal_oceanic,"Range expansion, population sizes, and management of wild pigs in California","The introduction and spread of nonnative organisms to new regions can disrupt ecosystems by causing declines or extinctions of native species. Widely introduced wild pigs (Sus scrofa) have contributed to declines and extinctions of numerous species on oceanic islands and can have pronounced negative ecological effects on mainland areas when population densities are high. Although range expansion by introduced wild pigs has ceased in many regions of the United States, it has increased significantly since the 1950s in California. Our analyses of data from annual hunter surveys and mapped locations of hunter-killed wild pigs shows that the distribution of wild pigs increased from around 10 coastal counties in the early 1960s to parts of 49 of California's 58 counties by 1996. An index to density based on locations of hunter-killed wild pigs plotted in a Geographic Information System (GIS) indicated that within the 79,550 km2 (25%) of the total land area of the state now occupied by wild pigs, populations are most abundant in the central and north-coast regions. By stratifying each county into 1 of 3 relative abundance classes and assigning density values based on research at multiple sites, we estimated there were around 133,106 (range = 106,485-159,727) wild pigs in California in 1996. The recent increase in the range of wild pigs in California was facilitated by a combination of multiple hunting-related introductions, deliberate releases of domestic pigs, and, possibly, increased forage availability associated with agricultural development. Natural range expansion also has occurred, however, and the dynamics of the spread of wild pigs in California appears typical of invasions observed among other organisms. Forage and water availability are important factors influencing the distribution and abundance of wild pigs in California, and predation may be important to an unknown extent. Up to 40% of California's wild pigs are removed from the population annually, which may control populations in some areas but not others. Wild pigs may be causing ecological damage in some coastal regions where population densities are very high, and detailed studies are needed in those areas to help mitigate potential problems with this increasingly widespread mammal in California.",10.2307/3802513,2-s2.0-0033042934,28,0.7020307859999999,0,rang expand pop siz and man of wild pig in californ the introduc and spread of non org to new reg can disrupt ecosystem by caus declin or extinct of nat specy wid introduc wild pig sus scrofa hav contribut to declin and extinct of num specy on oc island and can hav pronount neg ecolog effect on mainland area when pop dens ar high although rang expand by introduc wild pig has ceas in many reg of the unit stat it has increas sign sint the s in californ our analys of dat from an hunt survey and map loc of hunt kil wild pig show that the distribut of wild pig increas from around coast county in the ear s to part of of californ s county by an index to dens bas on loc of hunt kil wild pig plot in a geograph inform system gis ind that within the km of the tot land are of the stat now occupy by wild pig pop ar most abund in the cent and nor coast reg by stratifying each county into of rel abund class and assign dens valu bas on research at multipl sit we estim ther wer around rang wild pig in californ in the rec increas in the rang of wild pig in californ was facilit by a combin of multipl hunt rel introduc delib releas of domest pig and poss increas for avail assocy with agricult develop nat rang expand also has occur howev and the dynam of the spread of wild pig in californ appear typ of invas observ among oth org for and wat avail ar import fact influ the distribut and abund of wild pig in californ and pred may be import to an unknown ext up to of californ s wild pig ar remov from the pop an which may control pop in som area but not oth wild pig may be caus ecolog dam in som coast reg wher pop dens ar very high and detail study ar nee in thos area to help mitig pot problem with thi increas widespread mam in californ,new,0.6839212275467382,0.6404259990222388,0.6109876015215248,0.5909905693359988,0.5776278700190273,0.5694104352636874,0.5656936200659732,0.5665005149264298,0.5726380242314475,0.5862953386410564,0.6128503687577085

We identified and enumerated seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans along a replicated 1500 km survey path, representing 450 km2 of coastal and 2000 km 2 of oceanic habitat. Near-surface temperature (5 m depth) fluctuated considerably from year to year, in part due to the timing of the survey, with an early survey in 1996 and a late survey in 2002. Many species were observed across the entire gradient, particularly procellariiform (tubenose) seabirds and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). We observed peaks in abundance in the oceanic zone in 1998, 2001, and 2002, owing primarily to influxes of dark shearwaters (Puffinus spp.) and Leach's storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leuchora). Rank correlations indicated similar year-to-year changes in density between species, and species-specific responses to temperature and ocean productivity as indexed by nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations. We developed topographic/bathymetric models of habitat selection for the coastal zone. Although we found some distinct habitat preferences in this zone, overall we observed a continuum in the marine bird and mammal community across the entire eastern GOA. The strength of the coupling between coastal and oceanic environments as provided by variation in top predator dispersion appears related to large-scale variations in oceanography, though we have yet to fully investigate causal mechanisms. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Hete, the genetic uniqueness of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the eastern Baltic is evaluated in the light of new information on the distribution and abundance of Baltic and eastern North Sea populations during the last 11,000 yr, recent hunting statistics, and population counts. Archaeological records reveal that the Baltic population of harbor seals was founded about 8,000 yr ago. Adjacent populations in the North Sea areas were either small, or went extinct, and became significant only during the last 300 yr. This information generates the hypothesis that the Baltic population has been isolated during the last 8,000 yr, despite the lack of geographical barriers. We show that stochastic effects, isolation, and a documented recent population bottleneck can account for the low observed genetic variation in Baltic harbor seals. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.",10.1111/j.1748-7692.2005.tb01260.x,2-s2.0-25844477044,30,0.673698967,0,colon hist of the balt harb seal integr archaeolog behavy and genet dat detail knowledg about the hist of colon pop dynam and behavy gre enh evalu of genet model of pop unit and migr rat in spat structured pop het the genet un of harb seal phoc vitulin in the eastern balt is evalu in the light of new inform on the distribut and abund of balt and eastern nor sea pop dur the last yr rec hunt stat and pop count archaeolog record rev that the balt pop of harb seal was found about yr ago adjac pop in the nor sea area wer eith smal or went extinct and becam sign on dur the last yr thi inform gen the hypothes that the balt pop has been isol dur the last yr despit the lack of geograph barry we show that stochast effect isol and a docu rec pop bottleneck can account for the low observ genet vary in balt harb seal,new,0.6669110183358439,0.6434937141132799,0.6311033617946664,0.625488279398766,0.6245625044382345,0.6274562659333826,0.6340102040477639,0.6446558058886483,0.660592742190453,0.6844702170804416,0.7221510365889783
2710,mammal_oceanic,Can static habitat protection encompass critical areas for highly mobile marine top predators? Insights from coastal East Africa,"Along the East African coast, marine top predators are facing an increasing number of anthropogenic threats which requires the implementation of effective and urgent conservation measures to protect essential habitats. Understanding the role that habitat features play on the marine top predator' distribution and abundance is a crucial step to evaluate the suitability of an existing Marine Protected Area (MPA), originally designated for the protection of coral reefs. We developed species distribution models (SDM) on the IUCN data deficient Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in southern Kenya. We followed a comprehensive ecological modelling approach to study the environmental factors influencing the occurrence and abundance of dolphins while developing SDMs. Through the combination of ensemble prediction maps, we defined recurrent, occasional and unfavourable habitats for the species. Our results showed the influence of dynamic and static predictors on the dolphins' spatial ecology: dolphins may select shallow areas (5-30 m), close to the reefs (< 500 m) and oceanic fronts (< 10 km) and adjacent to the 100m isobath (< 5 km).We also predicted a significantly higher occurrence and abundance of dolphins within the MPA. Recurrent and occasional habitats were identified on large percentages on the existing MPA (47% and 57% using presence-absence and abundance models respectively). However, the MPA does not adequately encompass all occasional and recurrent areas and within this context, we propose to extend the MPA to incorporate all of them which are likely key habitats for the highly mobile species. The results from this study provide two key conservation and management tools: (i) an integrative habitat modelling approach to predict key marine habitats, and (ii) the first study evaluating the effectiveness of an existing MPA for marine mammals in the Western Indian Ocean.

299,mammal_oceanic,Effects of an offshore oil development on local abundance and distribution of ringed seals (Phoca hispida) of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea,"This study investigates how densities of ringed seals were affected by construction and oil production activities at Northstar, an artificial island built in the nearshore Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Intensive and replicated aerial surveys of seals on landfast ice were conducted during six spring seasons: for three seasons before island construction began (1997-1999); after a winter of intensive island construction (2000); and after more limited construction plus drilling (2001) and drilling plus oil production (2002). A Poisson regression model was used to examine seal densities relative to distance from Northstar after allowance for environmental covariates. Post hoc power analysis indicated that the study design and Poisson regression approach had high power to detect small-scale changes in seal densities near Northstar if such changes had occurred. However, seal densities during spring were not significantly affected by proximity to Northstar in 2000-2002. Habitat, temporal, and weather factors did have significant effects on seal densities. This study shows that effects of the Northstar oil development on local distribution of basking ringed seals are no more than slight, and are small relative to the effects of natural environmental factors. An understanding of environmental effects is essential when assessing potential impacts of industrial activity on ringed seals. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.",10.1111/j.1748-7692.2005.tb01225.x,2-s2.0-18244373676,2,0.6551875079999999,1,effect of an offsh oil develop on loc abund and distribut of ring seal phoc hispid of the alask beaufort sea thi study investig how dens of ring seal wer affect by construct and oil produc act at northst an art island built in the nearsh alask beaufort sea intend and reply aer survey of seal on landfast ic wer conduc dur six spring season for three season bef island construct beg aft a wint of intend island construct and aft mor limit construct plu dril and dril plu oil produc a poisson regress model was us to examin seal dens rel to dist from northst aft allow for environ cov post hoc pow analys ind that the study design and poisson regress approach had high pow to detect smal scal chang in seal dens near northst if such chang had occur howev seal dens dur spring wer not sign affect by proxim to northst in habit temp and weath fact did hav sign effect on seal dens thi study show that effect of the northst oil develop on loc distribut of bask ring seal ar no mor than slight and ar smal rel to the effect of nat environ fact an understand of environ effect is ess when assess pot impact of indust act on ring seal,new,0.687715817108849,0.6104324962982902,0.5578576813512885,0.5214144229215855,0.49541509475392853,0.47671839020482437,0.4636704143992747,0.4555777081619673,0.45258574927025885,0.45608799571667674,0.47024614184142705
3210,mammal_oceanic,Spatio-temporal persistence of top predator hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula,"We quantified species richness and abundance of seabirds and marine mammals in order to identify marine areas that are persistently attractive to top predators. Shipboard surveys across a 150 000 km2 grid off the Antarctic Peninsula were conducted once or twice each year from 2003 to 2011 during which the distribution and abundance of top predators were mapped. We hypothesized that spatial organization of species richness and abundance hotspots reflect persistent habitat use and are regionalized according to distance from land and oceanographic boundaries. To test this, we used a new hotspot variance metric based on the percentage of time that the species richness or abundance estimate at any one location is greater than 1 standard deviation above the long term means for the entire survey grid. Species richness hotspots were based on all species sighted, while abundance hotspots were based on concentrations of 16 species: 13 seabirds (penguins, petrels and albatrosses), 1 pinniped and 2 baleen whales. Species abundance hotspots reflected 2 major groupings-those with oceanic and coastal origins. We identified 15 richness hotspots, 9 of which were in proximity to the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front; the 6 others were associated with major breeding colonies and the location of 2 submarine canyon systems. Our approach integrates temporal and spatial variances over 14 individual surveys and provides useful reference points for identifying ecologically important areas, refining food web models and developing spatial management of and conservation strategies for marine ecosystems. ¬© Inter-Research 2013.",10.3354/meps10350,2-s2.0-84881067357,17,0.620112223,1,spatio temp persist of top pred hotspot near the antarct peninsul we quant specy rich and abund of seabird and marin mam in ord to ident marin area that ar persist attract to top pred shipboard survey across a km grid off the antarct peninsul wer conduc ont or twic each year from to dur which the distribut and abund of top pred wer map we hypothes that spat org of specy rich and abund hotspot reflect persist habit us and ar reg accord to dist from land and oceanograph bound to test thi we us a new hotspot vary met bas on the perc of tim that the specy rich or abund estim at any on loc is gre than standard devy abov the long term mean for the entir survey grid specy rich hotspot wer bas on al specy sight whil abund hotspot wer bas on cont of specy seabird penguin petrel and albatross pinnip and baleen whal specy abund hotspot reflect maj group thos with oc and coast origin we ident rich hotspot of which wer in proxim to the southern antarct circumpol cur front the oth wer assocy with maj bree colony and the loc of submarin canyon system our approach integr temp and spat vary ov individ survey and provid us ref point for ident ecolog import area refin food web model and develop spat man of and conserv strategies for marin ecosystem,new,0.7154481029168311,0.5939525031215153,0.5047945825853919,0.44069407806759414,0.39334439209810135,0.35723674484914114,0.32896711430970876,0.3064285774284942,0.2883105558527957,0.2738842368061696,0.26302074247094653
356,mammal_oceanic,Shark Predation on Migrating Adult American Eels (Anguilla rostrata) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,"In an attempt to document the migratory pathways and the environmental conditions encountered by American eels during their oceanic migration to the Sargasso Sea, we tagged eight silver eels with miniature satellite pop-up tags during their migration from the St. Lawrence River in Qu√©bec, Canada. Surprisingly, of the seven tags that successfully transmitted archived data, six were ingested by warm-gutted predators, as observed by a sudden increase in water temperature. Gut temperatures were in the range of 20 to 25¬∞C-too cold for marine mammals but within the range of endothermic fish. In order to identify the eel predators, we compared their vertical migratory behavior with those of satellite-tagged porbeagle shark and bluefin tuna, the only endothermic fishes occurring non-marginally in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. We accurately distinguished between tuna and shark by using the behavioral criteria generated by comparing the diving behavior of these two species with those of our unknown predators. Depth profile characteristics of most eel predators more closely resembled those of sharks than those of tuna. During the first days following tagging, all eels remained in surface waters and did not exhibit diel vertical migrations. Three eels were eaten at this time. Two eels exhibited inverse diel vertical migrations (at surface during the day) during several days prior to predation. Four eels were eaten during daytime, whereas the two night-predation events occurred at full moon. Although tagging itself may contribute to increasing the eel's susceptibility to predation, we discuss evidence suggesting that predation of silver-stage American eels by porbeagle sharks may represent a significant source of mortality inside the Gulf of St. Lawrence and raises the possibility that eels may represent a reliable, predictable food resource for porbeagle sharks. ¬© 2012 B√©guer-Pon et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0046830,2-s2.0-84867660709,15,0.60980934,0,shark pred on migr adult am eel anguill rostrat in the gulf of st lawr in an attempt to docu the migr pathway and the environ condit encount by am eel dur their oc migr to the sargasso sea we tag eight silv eel with miny satellit pop up tag dur their migr from the st lawr riv in qu√©bec canad surpr of the sev tag that success transmit arch dat six wer ingest by warm gut pred as observ by a sud increas in wat temp gut temp wer in the rang of to ¬∞c too cold for marin mam but within the rang of endotherm fish in ord to ident the eel pred we comp their vert migr behavy with thos of satellit tag porbeagl shark and bluefin tun the on endotherm fish occur non margin in the gulf of st lawr we acc distinct between tun and shark by us the behavy criter gen by comp the div behavy of thes two specy with thos of our unknown pred dep profil charact of most eel pred mor clos resembl thos of shark than thos of tun dur the first day follow tag al eel remain in surfac wat and did not exhibit diel vert migr three eel wer eat at thi tim two eel exhibit invers diel vert migr at surfac dur the day dur sev day pri to pred four eel wer eat dur daytim wherea the two night pred ev occur at ful moon although tag itself may contribut to increas the eel s suscept to pred we discuss evid suggest that pred of silv stag am eel by porbeagl shark may repres a sign sourc of mort insid the gulf of st lawr and rais the poss that eel may repres a rely predict food resourc for porbeagl shark,new,0.6667158282066689,0.6307628511298882,0.6073565810258011,0.5921222203878926,0.5826512657870353,0.577746060266603,0.5769556653452825,0.5804373888317669,0.5891021908393932,0.6052391795593246,0.6343666332296046
372,mammal_oceanic,Seals and seascapes: Covariation in Hawaiian monk seal subpopulations and the oceanic landscape of the Hawaiian Archipelago,"Aim The possible linkages between the spatial distribution of primary productivity over the north-western Hawaiian islands and trends of subpopulations of Hawaiian monk seals in the period 1956-1995 were assessed. This endangered seal is endemic to the north-western Hawaiian islands (NWHIs), where about 1300-1400 individuals are distributed among six main breeding subpopulations. A striking property in patterns of abundance among subpopulations is their spatial nature, a feature suggesting that these may be related to variation in the biotic marine environment. In examining linkages between trends in abundance at these subpopulations and the marine habitat of the NWHIs, an understanding of the relative importance of intrinsic or extrinsic regulatory processes to the long-term dynamics of the seal can be gained. Location The north-western Hawaiian islands (Hawaiian Archipelago). Methods Productivity of the seascape was mapped using both remotely sensed images and data collected during oceanographic cruises. Measurements included sea surface temperature (SST), vertical water column structure, integrated chlorophyll, and their respective levels of variability. The spatial structure and heterogeneity of both mean values and coefficients of variation of these variables were quantified statistically by calculating descriptive statistics for each block of a 20¬∞ √ó 10¬∞ grid (with 200 blocks of dimensions 1¬∞) overlain on each map, and computing spatial statistics for each variable (based on the summary statistics calculated for each block). Multivariate techniques were used to identify biogeographical regions within the pelagic landscape of the NWHIs. Monk seal trends among breeding sites within and among biogeographical regions were compared by analysing correlations among mean beach counts for each subpopulation. Results Primary productivity over the marine habitat of the Hawaiian monk seal was found to be non-uniform. A significant spatial pattern of primary productivity over the NWHIs, most apparent in a gradient along latitudinal lines, was documented. Multivariate groupings of environmental data partitioned the NWHIs into distinct biogeographical regions, and Hawaiian monk seal breeding areas can be differentiated on the basis of these. Regions with similar environments displayed synchronous variation in monk seal abundance. Main conclusions These findings suggest the local trends in monk seal abundance have ultimately been shaped by the quality of the surrounding marine environment. In assessing the dynamics of the Hawaiian monk seal as a whole, and notwithstanding the short-term and local effects of proximate mortality factors, extrinsic, ecosystem-level mechanisms appear to be important in shaping the long-term population dynamics of this endangered mammal. If that is the case, then environmental variation may also be an important determinant of the potential for recovery of these subpopulations and therefore for the entire species.",10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00451.x,2-s2.0-0034503181,19,0.587236499,1,seal and seascap cov in haway monk seal subpop and the oc landscap of the haway archipelago aim the poss link between the spat distribut of prim produc ov the nor western haway island and trend of subpop of haway monk seal in the period wer assess thi endang seal is endem to the nor western haway island nwhis wher about individ ar distribut among six main bree subpop a striking property in pattern of abund among subpop is their spat nat a feat suggest that thes may be rel to vary in the biot marin environ in examin link between trend in abund at thes subpop and the marin habit of the nwhis an understand of the rel import of intrins or extrins reg process to the long term dynam of the seal can be gain loc the nor western haway island haway archipelago method produc of the seascap was map us both remot sens im and dat collect dur oceanograph cru meas includ sea surfac temp sst vert wat column structure integr chlorophyll and their respect level of vary the spat structure and heterog of both mean valu and coefficy of vary of thes vary wer quant stat by calc describ stat for each block of a ¬∞ √ó ¬∞ grid with block of dimend ¬∞ overlain on each map and comput spat stat for each vary bas on the sum stat calc for each block mult techn wer us to ident biogeograph reg within the pel landscap of the nwhis monk seal trend among bree sit within and among biogeograph reg wer comp by analys correl among mean beach count for each subpop result prim produc ov the marin habit of the haway monk seal was found to be non uniform a sign spat pattern of prim produc ov the nwhis most app in a grady along latitudin lin was docu mult group of environ dat partit the nwhis into distinct biogeograph reg and haway monk seal bree area can be differenty on the bas of thes reg with simil environ display synchron vary in monk seal abund main conclud thes find suggest the loc trend in monk seal abund hav ultim been shap by the qual of the surround marin environ in assess the dynam of the haway monk seal as a whol and notwithstand the short term and loc effect of proxim mort fact extrins ecosystem level mech appear to be import in shap the long term pop dynam of thi endang mam if that is the cas then environ vary may also be an import determin of the pot for recovery of thes subpop and theref for the entir specy,new,0.6268152730818056,0.5658845500402103,0.5277094119620801,0.5034085018253374,0.4879856576465958,0.4789470818869083,0.4751850574626863,0.47653604258135657,0.48379994885370475,0.499408234222768,0.5296005893335395
4110,mammal_oceanic,"Patterns of abundance, population size structure and microhabitat usage of Paracentrotus lividus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea) in SW Portugal and NW Italy","In coastal habitats, wave exposure influences several aspects of the life history of marine organisms. Here, we assess how hydrodynamic conditions can generate variation in density, size structure and microhabitat usage of Paracentrotus lividus and whether these effects are consistent between regions that are markedly different for oceanic climate, such as the coasts of SW Portugal and NW Italy. The abundance of P. lividus was ~4 times higher in SW Portugal than in NW Italy, but within each region, there was no effect of wave exposure. In SW Portugal, higher urchin abundances were found at shallower depths, while no effect of depth on urchin abundance emerged in NW Italy. Most of the variation in urchin abundance occurred at small spatial scales (metres), and our results suggest that habitat complexity, that is, the presence of cracks and crevices, is an important determinant of patterns of distribution of this species. The population in NW Italy was characterized by a unimodal size distribution, with a higher proportion of medium-sized individuals. In contrast, in SW Portugal, smaller individuals represented a large proportion of the populations. Size structure varied between exposed and sheltered habitats in SW Portugal, suggesting that the proportion of individuals from different size cohorts may vary along wave-exposure gradients as a result of direct or indirect effects of hydrodynamic forces. In SW Portugal, most urchins occurred in burrows, while in NW Italy, urchins were mainly observed in crevices. These results suggest that creating/occupying burrows might be an adaptive behaviour that allows sea urchins to better withstand stressful hydrodynamic conditions and, therefore, are more common on exposed Atlantic coasts. Overall, our study suggests that the effects of hydrodynamic forces on sea urchin populations are context dependent and vary according to background oceanic climate. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/s00227-013-2166-z,2-s2.0-84876452854,1,0.5471243689999999,0,pattern of abund pop siz structure and microhabit us of paracentrot livid echinodermat echinoide in sw portug and nw ita in coast habit wav expos influ sev aspect of the lif hist of marin org her we assess how hydrodynam condit can gen vary in dens siz structure and microhabit us of paracentrot livid and wheth thes effect ar consist between reg that ar mark diff for oc clim such as the coast of sw portug and nw ita the abund of p livid was tim high in sw portug than in nw ita but within each reg ther was no effect of wav expos in sw portug high urchin abund wer found at shallow depth whil no effect of dep on urchin abund emerg in nw ita most of the vary in urchin abund occur at smal spat scal met and our result suggest that habit complex that is the pres of crack and crev is an import determin of pattern of distribut of thi specy the pop in nw ita was charact by a unimod siz distribut with a high proport of med siz individ in contrast in sw portug smal individ repres a larg proport of the pop siz structure vary between expos and shelt habit in sw portug suggest that the proport of individ from diff siz cohort may vary along wav expos grady as a result of direct or indirect effect of hydrodynam forc in sw portug most urchin occur in burrow whil in nw ita urchin wer main observ in crev thes result suggest that cre occupy burrow might be an adapt behavio that allow sea urchin to bet withstand stressful hydrodynam condit and theref ar mor common on expos atl coast overal our study suggest that the effect of hydrodynam forc on sea urchin pop ar context depend and vary accord to background oc clim,new,0.5391758038344812,0.46703176916070804,0.42006164886352515,0.38868804945440544,0.36742439663847354,0.35337828946757943,0.3451387191157861,0.3423116800816237,0.3455415193249247,0.3572080207152045,0.3839026694126455
455,mammal_oceanic,Cascading top-down effects of changing oceanic predator abundances,"1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. ¬© 2009 British Ecological Society.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01531.x,2-s2.0-66749121926,3,0.534185877,1,cascad top down effect of chang oc pred abund top down control can be an import determin of ecosystem structure and funct but in oc ecosystem wher cascad effect of pred deplet recovery and invas could be sign such effect had rar been demonst until rec her we synthes the evid for oc top down control that has emerg ov the last decad focus on larg high troph level pred inhabit contin shelv sea and the op oc in thes ecosystem wher control manip ar larg infeas pseudo expery analys of pred prey interact that tre independ pred pop as reply and temp or spat contrast in pred pop and clim as tre ar increas employ to help disentangl pred effect from environ vary and nois subst reduc in marin mam shark and pisc fish hav led to mesopr and invertebr pred increas convers abund oc pred hav suppress prey abund pred has also inhibit recovery of deplet specy sometim through pred prey rol revers troph cascad hav been in by oc pred link to nerit food web but seem inconsist in the pel realm with effect oft attenu at plankton top down control is not uniform strong in the oc and appear cont on the intens and nat of perturb to pred abund pred divers may damp cascad effect exceiv wher nonselect fishery deplet entir pred funct group in oth cas simult exploit of pred and prey can inhibit prey respons explicit consid of anthropog mod to oc foodweb should help inform predict about troph control synthes and apply oc top down control can hav import socio econom conserv and man imply as mesopr and invertebr assum domin and recovery of overexploit pred is impair continu research aim at integr across troph level is nee to understand and forecast the ecosystem effect of chang oc pred abund the rel strength of top down and bottom up control and interact with intens anthropog stressors such as clim chang,new,0.5709579891039892,0.5112827947656405,0.47211982791360263,0.44571420180875526,0.4277605858849199,0.4160196639224813,0.4094321269374915,0.40777598400858883,0.4117164046576614,0.4234500905678329,0.4488990332489895

Here we present collaborative research between the Aboriginal Rangers from Warddeken Land Management Limited and Western scientists which quantified the ground-level impacts of buffalo on seven perennial freshwater springs of the Arnhem Plateau. A secondary aim was to build the capacity of Aboriginal Rangers to self-monitor and evaluate the ecological outcomes of their land management activities. Sites with high buffalo abundance had significantly different ground, ground cover, and water quality attributes compared to sites with low buffalo abundance. The low buffalo abundance sites were characterized by tall herbaceous vegetation and flat ground, whereas wallows, bare ground, and short ungrazed grasses were indicators of sites with high buffalo abundance. Water turbidity was greater when buffalo abundance was high. The newly acquired monitoring skills and derived indicators of buffalo damage will be used by Aboriginal Rangers to assess the ecological outcomes of their future buffalo control efforts on the Arnhem Plateau. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s00267-010-9452-z,2-s2.0-77952096162,11,0.499040451,0,combin aborigin and non aborigin knowledg to assess and man fer wat buffalo impact on peren freshw springs of the aborigin own arnhem plateau austral aborigin land man hav observ that fer as wat buffalo bub bub lydekk ar threatening the ecolog and cult integr of peren freshw sourc in arnhem land austral her we pres collab research between the aborigin rang from warddek land man limit and western sci which quant the ground level impact of buffalo on sev peren freshw springs of the arnhem plateau a second aim was to build the capac of aborigin rang to self monit and evalu the ecolog outcom of their land man act sit with high buffalo abund had sign diff ground ground cov and wat qual attribut comp to sit with low buffalo abund the low buffalo abund sit wer charact by tal herbac veget and flat ground wherea wallow bar ground and short ungraz grass wer ind of sit with high buffalo abund wat turbid was gre when buffalo abund was high the new acquir monit skil and der ind of buffalo dam wil be us by aborigin rang to assess the ecolog outcom of their fut buffalo control effort on the arnhem plateau,new,0.48382593442174154,0.4498532717850366,0.4305891563512081,0.42044384729677553,0.4166956385012878,0.41821225394506306,0.4248429718393772,0.43731385047640087,0.45757919538369857,0.4900159598484222,0.5447426301302051
524,mammal_oceanic,Community structure in pelagic marine mammals at large spatial scales,"The understanding of a species' niche is fundamental to the concept of ecology, yet relatively little work has been done on niches in pelagic marine mammal communities. Data collection on the distribution and abundance of marine mammals is costly, time consuming and complicated by logistical difficulties. Here we take advantage of a data archive comprising many different datasets on the distribution and abundance of cetaceans from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Mexico in an effort to uncover community structure at large spatial scales (1000s of km). We constructed a multivariate ordination of the species data, tested for group structure that might exist within the ordination space, and determined how these groups might differ in environmental space. We examined 3 biogeographic regions: the oceanic waters north and south of Cape Hatteras, NC, and the Gulf of Mexico. North of Hatteras, we found 2 main groups split along a temperature and chlorophyll gradient, with most piscivores being found in cooler, more productive waters of the continental shelf, and most teuthivores being found farther offshore in warmer, less productive waters at the shelf break (200 m isobath). South of Hatteras, we found 3 groups, with the largest group being in warmer, lower chlorophyll waters that are closest to shore. In the Gulf of Mexico, we found 7 groups arrayed along a bottom depth gradient. We also tested the effect of taxonomically lumping different beaked whale species on ordination results. Results showed that when beaked whales were identified to the species level, they clustered out into distinct niches that are separate from those of other Odontocete groups. These results add to an increasing understanding of wildlife habitat associations and niche partitionings in the community structure of pelagic species, and provide important baseline information for future population monitoring efforts. ¬© Inter-Research 2011.",10.3354/meps09183,2-s2.0-79961086221,18,0.44883878,0,commun structure in pel marin mam at larg spat scal the understand of a specy nich is funda to the conceiv of ecolog yet rel littl work has been don on nich in pel marin mam commun dat collect on the distribut and abund of marin mam is cost tim consum and comply by log difficul her we tak adv of a dat arch compr many diff dataset on the distribut and abund of cetac from nov scot through the gulf of mexico in an effort to uncov commun structure at larg spat scal s of km we construct a mult ordin of the specy dat test for group structure that might ex within the ordin spac and determin how thes group might diff in environ spac we examin biogeograph reg the oc wat nor and sou of cap hattera nc and the gulf of mexico nor of hattera we found main group split along a temp and chlorophyll grady with most pisc being found in cool mor produc wat of the contin shelf and most teuth being found farth offsh in warm less produc wat at the shelf break m isoba sou of hattera we found group with the largest group being in warm low chlorophyll wat that ar closest to shor in the gulf of mexico we found group array along a bottom dep grady we also test the effect of taxonom lump diff beak whal specy on ordin result result show that when beak whal wer ident to the specy level they clust out into distinct nich that ar sep from thos of oth odontocet group thes result ad to an increas understand of wildl habit assocy and nich partit in the commun structure of pel specy and provid import baselin inform for fut pop monit effort,new,0.48842300478218714,0.41883906045403735,0.37600483319365785,0.34882162995331545,0.3314170091691979,0.32088945714879735,0.31593552637316996,0.31632558968100777,0.3229443307906805,0.3386362336852083,0.3711922295792866
