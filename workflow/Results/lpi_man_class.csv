"1","amphib_neotropic","The demography of Atelopus decline: Harlequin frog survival and abundance in central Panama prior to and during a disease outbreak","Harlequin frogs (Bufonidae: Atelopus) are a species-rich genus of Neotropical toads that have experienced disproportionately severe population declines and extinctions caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (. Bd). The genus Atelopus is of high conservation concern, but relatively little is known about the population dynamics and life history of the majority of species. We examined the demography of one population of Atelopus zeteki and two populations of A. varius in central Panama using three to six years of mark-recapture data collected prior to and during an outbreak of Bd. We estimated male survival probabilities prior to the arrival of Bd and sex-specific population sizes for these three populations using state-space Bayesian population models. Prior to the arrival of Bd, monthly apparent survival probabilities were higher for A. varius males than for A. zeteki males, and recaptures among years were low in both species. Abundance of both species varied over time and declined rapidly after the arrival of Bd. Male densities were generally greater than female densities, though female densities were higher or equivalent to males after the arrival of Bd. Estimates of survival and abundance over time may be explained by differences in the use of stream habitat by the two sexes and three populations, both during and between breeding seasons. These estimates provide key baseline population information that can be used to inform reintroductions from captive assurance colonies and studies of extant Atelopus populations as part of conservation and management programs. ¬© 2015 The Authors.","10.1016/j.gecco.2015.07.003","2-s2.0-84937555508",4,0.846857644,1
"2","amphib_neotropic","Spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics of Andean frogs: Effects of forest disturbance and evidence for declines","Biodiversity loss is a global phenomenon that can result in the collapse of food webs and critical ecosystem services. Amphibian population decline over the last century is a notable case of species loss because amphibians survived the last four major extinction events in global history, their current rate of extinction is unprecedented, and their rate of extinction is greater than that for most other taxonomic groups. Despite the severity of this conservation problem and its relevance to the study of global biodiversity loss, major knowledge gaps remain for many of the most threatened species and regions in the world. Rigorous estimates of population parameters are lacking for many amphibian species in the Neotropics. The goal of our study was to determine how the demography of seven species of the genus Pristimantis varied over time and space in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes. We completed a long term capture-mark-recapture study to estimate abundance, survival, and population growth rates in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes; from 2002 to 2009 at Yanayacu in the Eastern Cordillera and from 2002 to 2003 at Cashca Totoras in the Western Cordillera. Our results showed seasonal and annual variation in population parameters by species and sex. P. bicantus experienced significant reductions in abundance over the course of our study. Abundance, apparent survival, and population growth rates were lower in disturbed than in primary or mature secondary forest. The results of our study raise concerns for the population status of understudied amphibian groups and provide insights into the population dynamics of Neotropical amphibians. ¬© 2014 The Authors.","10.1016/j.gecco.2014.06.002","2-s2.0-84919332430",26,0.833651963,1
"3","amphib_neotropic","Site fidelity, home range behaviour and habitat utilization of male harlequin toads (Amphibia: Atelopus hoogmoedi) from Suriname: Relevant aspects for conservation breeding","Recently, neotropical harlequin toads (Atelopus spp.) have undergone drastic population declines. Captive breeding has been suggested as a way to conserve harlequin frogs threatened by the amphibian chytrid fungus and global warming. A major problem is that little is known with regard to the natural history of Atelopus species. We studied male A. hoogmoedi site fidelity, home range and habitat utilization during the long rainy season (April to August) at Brownsberg Nature Park, Suriname. During this period, males and females occupy different habitats (i.e. streams versus forest). We studied male toads along a stream site. In total, 19 males were observed; relative abundance was 0.475 individuals per meter. Fourteen males were recaptured at the same site or its vicinity at least once and 12 maintained home ranges (38.1 ¬± 17.7 m 2 in size) for up to four months. However, male-male interaction was not observed. In the vicinity of streams, male A. hoogmoedi were perched 51.95 ¬± 36.7 cm above ground in dense understory. In conservation breeding efforts, we recommend to keep sexes separately prior to mating and to simulate the rainy season. Because males occupy home ranges at the breeding site, reproductive success in captivity may be higher when females are moved to male containers (which should have some running water imitating a stream habitat). Low male density and home range size should be considered when populating tanks with males. Tanks for males and breeding should address that wild specimens were mostly found on low vegetation. ¬© 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Herpetologie und Terrarienkundee. V.

"4","amphib_neotropic","A long-term study on the dynamics of guild structure among predatory vertebrates at a semi-arid Neotropical site","Diets and populations of 10 species of predatory vertebrates (two foxes, four falconiforms, four owls) were monitored in semi-desert scrub at Auco, Chile. Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors","10.2307/3545099","2-s2.0-0027386301",36,0.779302536,1
"5","amphib_neotropic","Reproductive dynamics of the neotropical treefrog Hypsiboas albopunctatus (Anura, Hylidae)","To understand the seasonal reproductive dynamics of Hypsiboas albopunctatus, a Neotropical treefrog, we studied the following components: 1) the influence of abiotic factors on seasonality, 2) how this seasonality relates to population dynamics, and 3) male breeding recruitment. We conducted fieldwork every month from August 2007 to July 2008 within an ecotone connecting semideciduous Atlantic Forest and Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) in S√£o Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. Over the course of the prolonged breeding season, we recorded the maximum number of calling males and measured their snout-vent lengths; we then compared our data from the beginning and the end of the breeding season. We found that the breeding pattern of H. albopunctatus is correlated with climatic, physical, and biological factors. Male competition and aggression varied according to the population density, most likely as a function of resource availability. There appears to be a social hierarchy among males of H. albopunctatus according to body size. Large calling males dominated the chorus in the beginning of the breeding season, but smaller males contributed more to the assemblage as the breeding season progressed. The average size of calling males at the end of the breeding season was significantly smaller. Smaller males occurred most in January and February, marking the H. albopunctatus breeding recruitment, when an abundance of adequate breeding microhabitats exist. Our full-season study serves as a cautionary tale: hypotheses based on body size, particularly for prolonged anuran breeder species, may be affected by seasonality.

"7","amphib_neotropic","Ineffectiveness of Call Surveys for Estimating Population Size in a Widespread Neotropical Frog, Oophaga pumilio","Call surveys offer a valuable method to monitor anuran populations attributable to their temporal breeding habits and close association with water. Many temperate locations have adopted citizen science programs to monitor local anuran populations using call surveys and road transects. These surveys, however, are not commonly conducted in the tropics. I tested use of call surveys for estimating population density of a small terrestrial poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in six different populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama. By conducting three-minute call surveys, and searching for all individual frogs in a 10 m radius of the survey point, I directly compared the number of calling males to the observed number of frogs in a given area. I found call density to be a poor predictor of population density. Despite there being differences in population densities, the lack of a relationship between the number of calls and population density highlights the limited use for call surveys for terrestrial, territorial species. Although call surveys may be useful in some taxa for general abundance estimates, this study clearly demonstrates a startling deficiency of call surveys for anuran monitoring and highlights the need for species-specific analysis to further explore the utility of this method. ¬© Copyright 2017 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.","10.1670/14-148","2-s2.0-85009349865",28,0.739937118,0

Some toad species of the Bufonidae family are common, thus allowing the study of their populations. We studied a population in r√≠o Ca√±aza, Golfito, Costa Rica, in a sector 360 m upstream of Barrio Ure√±a, divided in 36 sectors of 10 m. The study was carried out for five years, but taking samples of adults in January 1995, 1997, 1998 (except March), and 1999. We also studied tadpoles during four days in 1997. In total, 443 males and 7 females were marked, with 315 males recaptured and no females. Females are bigger (91.1 mm) than males (61.3 mm). Most recaptured individuals occurred in the same or adjacent sectors, with a maximum movement of 28 sectors. One individual was recaptured repeatedly in all the samples. This indicates that they survived at least five reproductive cycles. The reproductive cycle takes place during the dry season, between December and April. We found more individuals during the reproductive cycle of 1997 and less during 1995. Sector 6 had the most number of males and sector number 4 had the least. Sectors with semi-open vegetation had more males compared to sectors with more forest cover. February is the month with the highest abundance of males. There are intermediate values in December and January, and fewer individuals in March and April. In every month, except February, the abundance of individuals was greater where there were beaches. Tadpoles were found both during the day and night in the 31 river sectors, but it was less likely to find tadpoles in the river section during the night. During the day all tadpoles were found scattered around the river, at night they congregated near river margins. The reproductive cycle of this toad occurs during the dry season and females are present only in the reproductive season, resulting in an almost only male sex ratio (only seven females were found). Males can reproduce at least in 5 reproductive cycles, and -unexpectedly- day and night distribution of tadpoles varies.",NA,"2-s2.0-77955286629",31,0.731695803,1

We surveyed frogs in the Peruvian Andes in montane forests along a steep elevational gradient (1200-3700 m). We used visual encounter surveys to sample stream-dwelling and arboreal species and leaf-litter plots to sample terrestrial-breeding species. We compared species richness and abundance among the wet seasons of 1999, 2008, and 2009. Despite similar sampling effort among years, the number of species (46 in 1999) declined by 47% between 1999 and 2008 and by 38% between 1999 and 2009. When we combined the number of species we found in 2008 and 2009, the decline from 1999 was 36%. Declines of stream-dwelling and arboreal species (a reduction in species richness of 55%) were much greater than declines of terrestrial-breeding species (reduction of 20% in 2008 and 24% in 2009). Similarly, abundances of stream-dwelling and arboreal frogs were lower in the combined 2008-2009 period than in 1999, whereas densities of frogs in leaf-litter plots did not differ among survey years. These declines may be associated with the infection of frogs with Bd. B. dendrobatidis prevalence correlated significantly with the proportion of species that were absent from the 2008 and 2009 surveys along the elevational gradient. Our results suggest Bd may have arrived at the site between 1999 and 2007, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this pathogen is spreading in epidemic waves along the Andean cordilleras. Our results also indicate a rapid decline of frog species richness and abundance in our study area, a national park that contains many endemic amphibian species and is high in amphibian species richness. ¬©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01604.x","2-s2.0-79952716626",1,0.728088498,1
"10","amphib_neotropic","Endemic Ecuadorian glassfrog Cochranella mache is Critically Endangered because of habitat loss","Amphibians are one of the most threatened animal groups. In the Family Centrolenidae c. 50% of the species are declining and threatened with extinction. One of these is the glassfrog Cochranella mache, endemic to seasonal evergreen forests of the West Ecuadorian region and restricted to highly fragmented forest of &lt; 100 km2 in the Cordillera Mache-Chindul, north-western coastal Ecuador, at 100-640 m. We surveyed this region to elucidate the distribution and conservation status of C. mache. We located it in three new localities and also found a museum specimen from a further new locality. We recommend that the species should be categorized as Critically Endangered because of the continuous and progressive destruction of its increasingly fragmented habitat. Recent surveys of glassfrog species sympatric with C. mache showed low relative abundances compared to surveys in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the relationship between forest and local climate we suggest that gradual declines of lowland glassfrog populations may be caused by local climate changes produced by forest destruction. In situ conservation is required to halt and mitigate these impacts. Further research on the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, and associated climate changes on Neotropical amphibians is required. ¬© 2009 Fauna &amp; Flora International.","10.1017/S0030605309990640","2-s2.0-77952520908",7,0.716245778,1
"11","amphib_neotropic","Taking the lead on climate change: Modelling and monitoring the fate of an Amazonian frog","Climate change is expected to have important impacts on biodiversity. However, cases showing explicit links between species decline and climate are scarce, mostly because of a lack of baseline data. Tropical ectotherms with narrow altitudinal ranges are particularly sensitive to climate change; for example the frog Pristimantis espedeus may be at risk, with only nine populations known to date in French Guiana, all on isolated massifs. Ecological niche modelling indicated that these populations could disappear by 2070. To facilitate testing of this prediction we conducted a study to design an efficient, cost-effective monitoring protocol, combining occupancy rate estimations using passive acoustic recorders, and abundance estimations using acoustic repeated counts and capture-mark-recapture. We found the passive recorders to be effective, with a detection probability of 0.8. Two recording sessions were sufficient to estimate occupancy rates reliably. A minimum of 57 surveyed sites were required to detect a decline of 15% in occupancy between two consecutive monitoring events. Acoustic repeated counts and capture-mark-recapture yielded similar density estimates (1.6 and 1.8 calling males per 100 m2, respectively). Based on these results we present a protocol based on passive acoustic recording and abundance monitoring to monitor P. espedeus populations.

"12","amphib_neotropic","The effects of amphibian population declines on the structure and function of neotropical stream ecosystems","Amphibians can be important consumers in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and may represent an important energetic link between the two, particularly in the tropics, where amphibian species richness and abundance are high. In the past 20 years, amphibian populations have declined dramatically around the world; numbers have decreased catastrophically in protected upland sites throughout the neotropics, usually resulting in the disappearance of over 75% of amphibians at a given site, particularly those species that breed in streams. Most studies of amphibian declines have focused on identifying causes and documenting changes in adult abundance, rather than on their ecological consequences. Here, we review evidence for the potential ecological effects of catastrophic amphibian declines, focusing on neotropical highland streams, where impacts will likely be greatest. Evidence to date suggests that amphibian declines will have large-scale and lasting ecosystem-level effects, including changes in algal community structure and primary production, altered organic matter dynamics, changes in other consumers such as aquatic insects and riparian predators, and reduced energy transfers between streams and riparian habitats. Furthermore, because of habitat and functional differences between larvae and adults in most amphibians, the loss of a single species is akin to losing two species. ¬© The Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/1540-9295(2006)004[0027:TEOAPD]2.0.CO;2","2-s2.0-32444435569",22,0.675905069,0

A total of 1,265 terrestrial amphibians were captured, representing 12 species and six families.

However, the floods homogeneously distributed the amphibian species over the fragment.

Of the amphibians, salamanders have the highest portion of their species in one of the risk categories, even higher than the frogs. To date there have been few studies that have used recent field data to examine the status of populations of endangered salamanders. In this study we evaluate the current situation of two tiny salamanders, Parvimolge townsendi and Thorius pennatulus, both of which are distributed at intermediate elevations in the mountains of the northern Neotropics and are considered to be critically endangered; the first has been proposed as possibly extinct. By carrying out exhaustive surveys in both historical and potentially suitable sites for these two species, we evaluated their abundance and the characteristics of their habitats, and we estimated their potential geographic distribution. We visited 22 sites, investing 672 person-hours of sampling effort in the surveys, and found 201 P. townsendi salamanders in 11 sites and only 13 T. pennatulus salamanders in 5 sites. Both species were preferentially found in cloud forest fragments that were well conserved or only moderately transformed, and some of the salamanders were found in shade coffee plantations. The potential distribution area of both species is markedly fragmented and we estimate that it has decreased by more than 48%. The results of this study highlight the importance of carrying out exhaustive, systematic field surveys to obtain accurate information about the current situation of critically endangered species, and help us better understand the crisis that amphibians are facing worldwide. ¬© 2012 Sandoval-Comte et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0034023","2-s2.0-84859242633",15,0.665617123,0
"15","amphib_neotropic","Integrating life-history traits and amphibian upland habitat use in a Neotropical hotspot","Effective management of semi-aquatic animals requires detailed information on upland habitat use around aquatic habitats. Quantifying the amount of habitats needed to sustain local animals' populations is a crucial criterion when setting protective buffers to water bodies, especially for amphibians, which depend on these upland habitats for breeding and development. Differences in upland habitat use can emerge among amphibian species with distinct life-history traits, including reproductive-strategy (pond-breeding vs. non-pond breeding anurans), life-stage (adults vs. juveniles), and sex (males vs. females). To date there has been no quantitative study of upland habitat use in the Neotropics, which can provide a baseline for quantifying the amount of upland forested habitats needed to sustain local amphibian populations. We monitored three ponds for over two sampling year using drift fences with pitfall traps to investigate how reproductive-strategy, life-stage, and sex affect anuran upland habitat use in a forest remnant in the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We found no differences in upland habitat use between adult and juvenile anurans. However, we found that although the species richness of pond-breeding and non-pond breeding anurans was similar near wetlands, there was greater abundance of pond-breeding compared to non-pond breeding anurans. We also found a strong difference between the sexes in pond-breeding anurans, with males remaining closer to wetlands than females. Thus, the sex ratio of amphibian populations can be strongly skewed toward males if only small protective terrestrial buffers (50-m) are enforced during land development. Our findings also point to the inadequacy of current Brazilian policies to protect small wetlands and the fauna that depend on them. We recommend that policymakers adjust regulatory criteria to set hierarchical protective buffers around wetlands allowing different levels of land-use intervention. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","10.1016/j.actao.2015.09.009","2-s2.0-84942862520",23,0.652108897,1

The mountainous region of central Veracruz, Mexico, is considered a priority area for amphibian conservation because of its high level of endemism and the number of threatened species. The original tropical montane cloud forest in the region has been dramatically reduced and fragmented and is now mainly confined to ravines and hillsides. We evaluated the current situation of amphibian diversity in the cloud forest fragments of this region by analyzing species richness and abundance, comparing assemblage structure and species composition, examining the distribution and abundance of threatened species, and identifying the local and landscape variables associated with the observed amphibian diversity. From June to October 2012 we sampled ten forest fragments, investing 944 person-hours of sampling effort. A total of 895 amphibians belonging to 16 species were recorded. Notable differences in species richness, abundance, and assemblage structure between forest fragments were observed. Species composition between pairs of fragments differed by an average of 53%, with the majority (58%) resulting from species replacement and the rest (42%) explained by differences in species richness. Half of the species detected are under threat of extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and although their distribution and abundance varied markedly, there were also ubiquitous and abundant species, along with rare species of restricted distribution. The evident heterogeneity of the ten study sites indicates that to conserve amphibians in a mountainous region such as this one it is necessary to protect groups of fragments which represent the variability of the system. Both individually and together cloud forest fragments are very important to conservation because each remnant is inhabited by several threatened species, some of them at imminent risk of extinction. ¬© 2015 Meza-Parral, Pineda.","10.1371/journal.pone.0121652","2-s2.0-84925797523",6,0.649278088,0
"17","amphib_neotropic","Stream invertebrate responses to a catastrophic decline in consumer diversity","Tadpoles are often abundant and diverse consumers in headwater streams in the Neotropics. However, their populations are declining catastrophically in many regions, in part because of a chytrid fungal pathogen. These declines are occurring along a moving disease front in Central America and offer the rare opportunity to quantify the consequences of a sudden, dramatic decline in consumer diversity in a natural system. As part of the Tropical Amphibian Declines in Streams (TADS) project, we examined stream macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and production for 2 y in 4 stream reaches at 2 sites in Panama. One site initially had healthy amphibians but declined during our study (El Cop), and 1 site already had experienced a decline in 1996 (Fortuna). During the 1st y, total macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and production were generally similar among sites and showed no consistent patterns between pre- and post-decline streams. However, during the 2nd y, tadpole densities declined precipitously at El Cop, and total macroinvertebrate production was significantly lower in the El Cop streams than in Fortuna streams. Functional structure differed between sites. Abundance, biomass, and production of filterers generally were higher at Fortuna, and shredders generally were higher at El Cop. However, shredder production declined significantly in both El Cop reaches in the 2nd y as tadpoles declined. Nonmetric dimensional scaling (NMDS) based on abundance and production indicated that assemblages differed between sites, and patterns were linked to variations in relative availability of basal resources. Our results indicate that responses of remaining consumers to amphibian declines might not be evident in coarse metrics (e.g., total abundance and biomass), but functional and assemblage structure responses did occur. Ongoing, long-term studies at these sites might reveal further ecological consequences of the functional and taxonomic shifts we observed. ¬© 2010 by The North American Benthological Society.","10.1899/09-102.1","2-s2.0-77955579354",11,0.642634999,0

The frog was introduced to a number of South American mainland localities, including French Guiana. Other species of the genus have become invasive on oceanic islands such as Hawaii where they pose serious biological and economical problems. No data are available on the invasion status of E. johnstonei populations from coastal South America. Here we present the first assessment of the status of a mainland population from French Guiana 10 years after the introduction of the species. We found that the species has not spread significantly within the last ten years and so far does not exhibit a high invasion potential. Frogs were restricted to urban garden habitats showing significantly higher abundance in gardens containing ornamental potted plants. Distribution patterns were best explained by two dispersal-related factors operating at different scales: (1) distance of occupied sites to nearest population indicating short-distance active dispersal using stepping stone habitats, and (2) distance of occupied sites to shore with a distinct bimodal pattern indicating long-distance passive or jump-dispersal, most likely due to the exchange or transfer of ornamental plants. Even though past and current invasion potential can be considered low, we advocate the implementation of a regional monitoring scheme and detailed studies on biotic interactions with native fauna. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10530-010-9930-5","2-s2.0-79960061662",37,0.627957048,0

We identified 21,925 prey items from samples of fresh pellets collected in summer (n = 23) and winter (n = 26). Mammals,' mostly sigmodontine rodents, were the main prey items (91.9%), followed by amphibians (6.5%) and birds (1.6%). Arthropods were also a common prey item (found in 45% of the samples). The consumption of arthropods and amphibians was higher in summer than in winter, indicating that seasonal changes in prey abundances are reflected in the Barn Owl diet. We found no differences in food-niche breadth among the four study districts, but food-niche breadth varied between seasons, being higher during summer. Six rodent species were common to all districts: Calomys spp., Akodon azarae, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Mus musculus, Rattus spp., and Holochilus brasiliensis. Calomys spp. was numerically dominant in 46 of the 49 samples, and together with A. azarae and O. flavescens comprised the bulk of the diet (> 80%).

Here, we use abundance data of amphibians and reptiles to study their responses to forest edges in nine fragmented forested landscapes of the Neotropics. Species-specific abundance data were collected in plots established at varying distances from their respective nearest forest edge. We tested for edge effects on the abundance of species, and used curve clustering techniques to group species with similar edge responses, i.e. species with either increasing or decreasing abundance from the matrix towards the forest interior. We also grouped species that showed no change in abundance with respect to the nearest forest edge and those whose abundance response was unimodal, peaking in either forest habitat or the surrounding matrix habitat. We found that 96% of all amphibians and 90% of all reptiles showed an edge response, with the abundance of 74.5% of amphibians and 57.3% of reptiles decreasing with increasing proximity to forest edges. However, species-specific edge effects were not always consistent, with some species having opposite edge responses when measured in different landscapes. The depth of edge effects exhibited by forest species, i.e. species that increased in abundance in the forest interior, extended up to one kilometre away from forest edges. We show that the median edge effect on forest species extends to 250¬†m within the forest interior, indicating that tropical forest patches with a mean diameter¬†<¬†500¬†m (minimum area¬†‚âà¬†78¬†ha) are unsuitable for half of forest-dependent species considered in this study. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.06.011","2-s2.0-84976330785",3,0.614293309,0

Herein we combined three sampling methods (large plots, visual encounter surveys and pit-fall traps) to present data on species composition, richness, relative abundance and densities. The local assemblage of frogs associated to the leaf-litter was composed by 14 species, belonging to nine families. Haddadus binotatus, a direct-developing frog, was the most abundant species in the community. The estimated density of the local leaflitter frog assemblage based on plot sampling was 4.3 frogs/100 m 2. Haddadus binotatus had the highest density (1.1 ind/100 m 2). Frogs were predominantly found at night. Thoropa miliaris had the largest values of SVL (39.0 ¬± 10.3 mm), whereas the smallest species were Euparkerella brasiliensis (16.7 ¬± 2.2 mm) and E. cochranae (16.0 ¬± 2.7 mm). Rhinella ornata had the highest mean body mass (12.1 ¬± 7.5 g), and E. cochranae the lowest (0.4 ¬± 0.2 g). The overall frog mass was 938.6 g/ha.

Few studies have assessed the role of tadpoles in tropical streams, although they are often abundant and conspicuous components of these systems. Moreover, amphibian populations are declining around the globe, particularly stream-dwelling species in tropical uplands, and the ecological consequences of these losses are not understood. 2. We chose a stream in the central Panamanian highlands, which has an intact fauna of stream-breeding anurans, to examine the ecological consequences of amphibian losses. This site differs dramatically from sites in nearby western Panama and Costa Rica where anuran diversity and abundance have declined greatly in the last two decades. 3. We used an underwater electric field to create tadpole exclosures in runs, so that we could evaluate their influence on sediment dynamics and the abundance and community structure of algae and aquatic insects. Tadpoles reduced total sediments and both organic and inorganic fractions on substrata. Tadpoles also reduced algal abundance on substrata by approximately 50% and decreased algal biovolume. Gut content analyses showed that tadpoles consumed algae and sediments and we could see that algae and sediments were also displaced through bioturbation. 4. Atelopus zeteki, Rana warszewitschii, and Hyla spp. were the dominant larval anurans responsible for the effects observed. Visual surveys indicated that the densities of these taxa ranged from 23 (R. warszewitschii and Hyla spp. combined) to 43 m-2 (A. zeteki) in runs. 5. The abundance of baetid mayflies was lower in tadpole exclosures compared with controls, and this was attributed to tadpoles facilitating mayfly feeding by removing sediments and exposing underlying periphyton. 6. Tadpoles affect the abundance and diversity of basal resources and other primary consumers, and thus influence food web dynamics and energy flow in these tropical streams. Catastrophic decline in stream-breeding anuran populations will influence the structure and function of neotropical stream ecosystems.","10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01184.x","2-s2.0-1442265052",20,0.553673727,0

Anuran larvae are important prey in freshwater communities and spatiotemporal variation in risk can arise from changes in the number and identity of predators; however, our understanding of variation in abundance, identity, and foraging rates for natural predator assemblages in tropical pond communities is limited. We surveyed ponds near Gamboa, Panama in 2004 and 2010 to estimate variation in predator communities of tadpoles over space and time.We also conducted short-term predation trials with the 10 most common predators using hatchling tadpoles of two widespread Neotropical frog species, Red-Eyed Treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and Pantless Treefrogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Predator abundance varied nearly threefold across ponds within a single year and as much as 19-fold within a pond across years. Dominant taxa also varied, with backswimmers (Notonectidae), poeciliid fish, or libellulid dragonfly naiads being the most common depending upon pond and year. Predation trials revealed that prey-specific predation rates differed among predator taxa. Some presumed predators did not consume hatchlings, whereas others consumed >90% of prey. The smaller D. ebraccatus hatchlings generally experienced higher predation rates; however, large invertebrate predators like aeshnid dragonfly naiads, giant water bugs, and fishing spiders consumed more A. callidryas. These results suggest that strong but variable larval-stage risk may be an important selective factor shaping tadpole communities and phenotypes in Neotropical ponds. ¬© 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.","10.1670/14-111","2-s2.0-84959866101",13,0.540339602,1

We investigated the road-edge effect of a low-use dirt road on amphibian and reptile abundance, diversity, and composition within adjacent lowland Amazonian rainforest at San Jos√© de Payamino, Ecuador. The road has been closed to vehicle traffic since its construction in 2010. Thus, effects from vehicle mortality, vehicle-related pollution, and road noise were not confounding factors. Herpetofauna were surveyed using both visual encounter surveys and drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps at varying distances from the road. Structural and microclimate features of the forest were measured at each sampling distance. Several habitat variables were found to differ at intermediate and interior sampling distances from the road compared to forest edge conditions, suggesting the road-edge effect began to attenuate by the intermediate sampling distance. However, the edge effect on amphibians and reptiles appeared to extend 100 m from the road edge, as abundance and diversity were significantly greater at the interior forest compared to the forest edge. Additionally, assemblage composition as well as the hierarchical position of species shifted between sampling distances. Habitat predictor models indicate that amphibian abundance was best predicted by vine abundance, while both vine and mature tree abundance were the best predictors for species richness and diversity.

Optimal conservation actions ideally rely on basic ecological and natural history data, such as population size, habitat requirements and availability, or biotic interactions. Unfortunately, we lack basic natural history information for most frogs, making it difficult to determine species vulnerability in nature. Our goal in this study was to apply a 'rarity' index to assess whether rarity and other endangerment assessment criteria can serve complementary roles in conservation prioritization. We applied Rabinowitz' ""eight forms of rarity"" classification, which is based on geographic range, habitat specificity, and local population size, to evaluate its value as an indicator of species vulnerability in the anuran assemblage endemic to the Atlantic Coastal Forest of Brazil. We compared patterns of rarity in anurans to IUCN endangerment status, and investigated possible relationships between spatial traits (topographic complexity, elevation, and latitudinal variation) and groups of species with different forms of rarity. We found similar patterns of rarity across taxonomic groups and among local anuran communities, indicating that these patterns are consistent across taxa and geographic scales. We provide evidence that rarity rankings increase in areas of higher elevation and topographic complexity. Our results also indicate that the majority of rare species are classified as threatened according to IUCN; however, 32 species ranked as rare are still considered 'least concern' or 'data deficient' by the current Brazilian red list of threatened species. We propose that including rarity categories in endangerment assessment for anurans can improve our ability to prioritize conservation efforts for threatened amphibian taxa. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.08.012","2-s2.0-84907484302",17,0.524512799,0

Several factors contribute separately or jointly to these declines. However, the reduction of an available habitat due to human expansion is still the main cause, and roads are a major mean for this expansion. Both the construction phase and the subsequent use of roads have negative consequences for amphibians. We reviewed the literature on the subject within the Neotropical context. To this end, the paper begins with a summary of recent reviews and proceeds through an analysis of sampling methods used in roadkill studies, mitigation measures and the Neotropical scenario and concludes with several suggestions to guide future studies. More attention will be given to roadkills, which is one of the primary impacts on wildlife that is caused by roads. Even in the Neotropical zone most studies are foot-based, the richness and abundance of amphibians affected are higher in regions outside the Neotropics. One possible explanation is that in the other regions, the proportion of studies exclusively on amphibians is bigger.

Because peccaries are also important agents of disturbance and microhabitat variation in the litter, peccary loss could have important consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles that depend entirely upon the litter for shelter, foraging and reproduction sites, and thermoregulation. However, very little is known about the effects of peccaries or their loss on litter amphibians and reptiles. We experimentally reduced peccary density in 20. √ó. 50. m fenced exclusion plots (. n=. 5). We compared standing litter structure and amphibian and reptile abundance where peccaries were excluded to paired, open-forest control plots that had natural peccary densities. We encountered 16% more amphibian and reptile individuals in open control plots, and we encountered more juveniles of the most common anuran species in control plots than on peccary exclusions. Control plots had more compacted litter than peccary exclusion plots, indicating that peccaries alter the physical structure of the standing leaf litter in a way that promotes greater recruitment of juvenile anurans. Our results demonstrate that peccaries should be viewed not just as seed predators or ecosystem engineers for palms and pond-breeding amphibians, but also as important agents that affect leaf litter structure and abundance of terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. Peccary extirpation from overhunting or habitat degradation could have unexpected negative consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles, a diverse group already severely threatened by habitat loss, climate change, disease, and other anthropogenic effects worldwide. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.12.015","2-s2.0-84879177789",30,0.508829758,0

"29","amphib_neotropic","Assessing the links among environmental contaminants, endocrinology, and parasites to understand amphibian declines in montane regions of Costa Rica","Amphibians inhabiting montane riparian zones in the Neotropics are particularly vulnerable to decline, but the reasons are poorly understood. Because environmental contaminants, endocrine disruption, and pathogens often figure prominently in amphibian declines it is imperative that we understand how these factors are potentially interrelated to affect montane populations. One possibility is that increased precipitation associated with global warming promotes the deposition of contaminants in montane regions. Increased exposure to contaminants, in turn, potentially elicits chronic elevations in circulating stress hormones that could contribute to montane population declines by compromising resistance to pathogens and/or production of sex steroids regulating reproduction. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining contaminant levels, stress and sex steroid levels, and nematode abundances in male drab treefrogs, Smilisca sordida, from lowland and montane populations in Costa Rica. We found no evidence that montane populations were more likely to possess contaminants (i.e., organochlorine, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides or benzidine and chlorophenoxy herbicides) than lowland populations. We also found no evidence of elevational differences in circulating levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, estradiol or progesterone. However, montane populations possessed lower androgen levels, hosted more nematode species, and had higher nematode abundances than lowland populations. Although these results suggested that nematodes contributed to lower androgens in montane populations, we were unable to detect a significant inverse relationship between nematode abundance and androgen level. Our results suggest that montane populations of this species are not at greater risk of exposure to contaminants or chronic stress, but implicate nematodes and compromised sex steroid levels as potential threats to montane populations. ¬© 2018 Leary et al.

The abundance and species richness of Neotropical amphibian communities suggest that losses of this magnitude are likely to have strong effects at the ecosystem level. To improve understanding of the implications of their loss we used stable isotope analysis to examine trophic relationships in an ecosystem in which amphibians are dominant in a second-order forest stream at 750 m asl in Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama. We analysed Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and C:N ratios of major biotic components (basal resources, invertebrates, amphibians, fish and reptiles) in the stream and of the adjacent riparian food web. Tadpoles (mean Œ¥15N = 4.49‚Ä∞) and adult amphibians (mean Œ¥15N = 5.45‚Ä∞) were intermediate links in the aquatic and terrestrial food web respectively. High Œ¥15N signatures identified fish as top predators in the aquatic food web and snakes and the toad Bufo as top predators in the terrestrial food web. Isotopic signatures clearly distinguished between trophic groups of tadpoles: microbial feeders (Centrolenidae, Œ¥15N range = 0.91-3.05‚Ä∞), herbivores (Rana and Hyla, Œ¥15N range = 4.74-5.15‚Ä∞) and neuston feeders (Colostethus, Œ¥15N range = 5.31-6.40‚Ä∞). Dependence on autotrophic production was indicated by enriched signatures of carbon isotopes in pool dwellers versus those that reside in faster-flowing sections of the stream. High nitrogen concentrations in detrital matter (average 0.8%, C:N = 10.3) suggested that grazing tadpoles enhanced nitrogen fluxes and improved the quality of organic matter available to detritivores.

In some regions of the world (e.g., the Neotropics and Western United States), Bd has caused recent reductions in amphibian population abundance and species richness, while in other regions the impacts are less clear. Although Bd is present in the Midwestern United States, its history and impact in the region is not known. We used a qPCR assay to determine historic Bd prevalence in Illinois, testing 1028 specimens representing 10 anuran species, collected 1888-1989. We used two complementary sets of samples to first assess historic prevalence with the primary set, and used a secondary set to confirm Bd presence and examine older samples with a more sensitive technique. Prevalence varied among species; in the primary dataset of 1008 samples extracted with PrepMan Ultra collected 1892-1989, Bd was found in four species (11.1%, CI: 9.3-13.2%). Rana (. Lithobates) sphenocephala, the southern leopard frog, had the highest prevalence (38.3%, CI 32.7-44.2%); prevalence among other infected species was <7%. Overall prevalence was <10% in most decades but >40% in the 1940s. In the secondary set of 50 samples extracted with Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kits (30 re-swabbed of the original 1008 and 20 additional older specimens), 17 of the 20 additional samples were Bd+ (85.0%, CI 64.0-94.8%) including the oldest Bd+ specimen, which was collected in 1888. We confirmed Bd presence by sequencing 42 Bd+ samples and found ‚â•99% homology with Bd sequences in Genbank. By 1900, Bd was geographically widespread throughout Illinois-40. years earlier than the current oldest estimate in the U.S.-meaning that Illinois amphibians have been coexisting with Bd for at least 126. years. This long period of coexistence from our results raises new questions about the history of Bd in North America, possible coevolution between host and pathogen, and the potential role of Bd in historic population declines. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.007","2-s2.0-84920733529",24,0.467862517,0

Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation. ¬© 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00659.x","2-s2.0-34249098657",16,0.435009053,1

About half of the variation in frog biomass (48%) could be attributed to stem turnover rate, while over two-thirds of the variation in lizard biomass (69%) was explained by primary productivity. Biomass variation in frogs resulted from variation in abundance and size, and abundance was related to cation exchange capacity (45% of variation explained), but size was not. Lizard biomass across sites varied mostly with individual lizard size, but not with abundance, and size was highly dependent on primary productivity (85% of variation explained).

We documented the community disassembly of a Neotropical tadpole community during a chytridiomycosis outbreak, triggered by the generalist fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Within the first 11 months of Bd arrival, tadpole density and occupancy rapidly declined. Species rarity, in terms of tadpole occupancy and adult relative abundance, did not predict the odds of tadpole occupancy declines. But species losses were taxonomically selective, with glassfrogs (Family: Centrolenidae) disappearing the fastest and tree frogs (Family: Hylidae) and dart-poison frogs (Family: Dendrobatidae) remaining the longest. We detected biotic homogenization of tadpole communities, with post-decline communities resembling one another more strongly than pre-decline communities. The entire tadpole community was extirpated within 22 months following Bd arrival, and we found limited signs of recovery within 10 years post-outbreak. Because of imperfect species detection inherent to sampling species-rich tropical communities and the difficulty of devising a single study design protocol to sample physically complex tropical habitats, we used simulations to provide recommendations for future surveys to adequately sample diverse Neotropical communities. Our unique data set on tadpole community composition before and after Bd arrival is a valuable baseline for assessing amphibian recovery.

However, not all regions and species are equally affected. Here, we show that association with amphibian aquatic habitat types (bromeliad phytotelmata versus stream) across Central America results in the odds of being threatened by Bd being five times higher in stream microhabitats. This differential threat of Bd was supported in our study by a significantly lower prevalence of Bd in bromeliad-associated amphibian species compared to riparian species in Honduran cloud forests. Evidence that the bromeliad environment is less favorable for Bd transmission is exemplified by significantly less suitable physicochemical conditions and higher abundance of Bd-ingesting micro-eukaryotes present in bromeliad water. These factors may inhibit aquatic Bd zoospore survival and the development of an environmental reservoir of the pathogen. Bromeliad phytotelmata thus may act as environmental refuges from Bd, which contribute to protecting associated amphibian communities against chytridiomycosis-driven amphibian declines that threaten the nearby riparian communities. ¬© 2017 Blooi et al.

However, some amphibians avoid UV-B radiation when given the opportunity. The strawberry poison dart frog, Oophaga pumilio, is diurnal and males vocalize throughout the day in light gaps under forest canopies that expose them to solar radiation. Previous studies have demonstrated that males calling from high perches are more successful at mating than those at lower perches. We investigated whether frogs at higher perches receive more ultraviolet-B than those calling from lower perches. We also investigated whether frogs on perches receiving relatively low ultraviolet-B levels maintained their positions for longer compared to individuals calling from perches receiving higher levels of ultraviolet-B. Finally, since it has been hypothesized that some animals utilize levels of UV-A as a visual cue to avoid UV-B damage, we artificially elevated ultraviolet-A levels to examine whether males exposed to artificially elevated ultraviolet-A abandoned their perches sooner compared to males exposed to visible light. We found that frogs called from perches receiving low ultraviolet-B regardless of perch height, and that frogs maintain their positions longer on perches receiving low ultraviolet-B compared to perches receiving even slightly higher ultraviolet-B levels. Exposing the frogs to artificially elevated levels of ultraviolet-A radiation caused males to move off of their perches faster than when they were exposed to a control light source. These experiments suggest that ultraviolet radiation plays an important role in frog behavior related to perch selection, even in rainforests where much of the solar radiation is shielded by the forest canopy. ¬© 2012 Kats et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0051364","2-s2.0-84871219919",19,0.36832605,0

Here, we measured the species richness, abundance, and community composition of amphibians and reptiles in reference primary forest and mono-dominant plantations of three native tree species (Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, Vochysia guatemalensis) at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northern Costa Rica. Because these plantation species generate markedly different forest-floor habitats, we hypothesized that tree species would support different assemblages of leaf-litter herpetofauna. Primary forest, Virola, and Vochysia supported greater richness of frogs than Pentaclethra. Frog densities were significantly lower in Pentaclethra and Vochysia than in nearby primary forest. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we found Pentaclethra to support significantly different assemblages of frogs and lizards than primary forest reference sites, while Vochysia supported a unique assemblage of frogs. Our results suggest that some tree species plantations can support herpetofaunal assemblages comparable to primary forest in richness, community assembly, and abundance. While herpetofaunal community ecology varies among plantation species, our study provides a compelling example of how plantation landscapes can facilitate the restoration of native fauna on degraded landscapes. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","10.1007/s10531-013-0526-0","2-s2.0-84881029094",2,0.343379076,0

The apparent mechanism of collapse was warm ocean temperatures causing an inadequate food supply. Eudyptes penguin population declines are ongoing at some breeding sites, highlighting the need to investigate the population trend on Campbell Island since 1984. We estimated the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin breeding population size through physical and photo-counts of birds and nests in 2012, and changes in colony area relative to 1984 and 1996 photographs. We estimated the 2012 population size at 33,239 breeding pairs, a 21.8¬†% decrease from an (adjusted) estimate of 42,528 pairs in 1984. Although substantial, the recent 1984‚Äì2012 decline occurred at a much slower rate (Œª¬†=¬†0.991) than the 1942‚Äì1984 decline (Œª¬†=¬†0.940).

A 100-year time series of extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures (ERSST) confirmed that the population declined during warm periods and increased during cool periods, but that the initial decline began before increases in regional ERSST. Population growth after 1996 appears related to the current global warming hiatus, lower ERSST, and increased abundance of a key prey species. We predict a continuation of the long-term population decline after warming resumes. ¬© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-014-1575-x","2-s2.0-84921743627",19,0.937334547,1

During an intensive survey between 1993 and 1995, breeding success was similar to that reported from other sites, although the first egg (A-egg) loss rate was lower on Amsterdam Island than at other localities. The mean age of first return to the breeding site and of first reproduction were respectively X = 4.2 ¬± SD of 2.1 years and X = 4.7 ¬± SD of 1.7 years. The adult survival rate, calculated between 1988 and 1993, was significantly lower one year after banding [X = 72.2 ¬± SD of 1.6%] than in subsequent years [X = 84.0 ¬± SD of 1.1%] due to the effect of banding. Immature survival rate was estimated at 39% during the first year after banding. Two birds banded as chicks have been found in Australia, suggesting that immatures winter off Southern Australia. The population on Amsterdam Island decreased at a rate of 2.7% per year between 1971 and 1993. Using the demographic parameters measured, we calculated a modelled rate of increase of 0.940 between 1988 and 1993, a value close to the observed rate of 0.943. Between 1982 to 1993, mean sea surface temperature near Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands decreased significantly, and this change was significantly related to the decline of Amsterdam Island population during the same period. Mean sea surface temperature decline could affect the Rockhopper Penguin population through changes of distribution and abundance of prey. Other factors such as the large increase of the Sub-Antarctic Fur Seal population at Amsterdam Island between 1971 and 1993 could have reduced the penguin population. Between 1971 and 1993, the Saint Paul population of penguins increased by 5.5% per year, but this is not significantly related to the mean sea surface temperature decrease. This small Rockhopper Penguin population may still be recovering to its level before exploitation in the 1930s.",NA,"2-s2.0-0032315436",73,0.910503882,1
"310","bird_antarctic","Albatross populations in peril: A population trajectory for Black-browed Albatrosses at South Georgia","Simulation modeling was used to reconstruct Black-browed Albatross (Diomedea melanophris) population trends. Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from ""Vulnerable"" to ""Endangered."" Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years. For this population to recover to a status under which it could be ""delisted,"" a 10% increase in survival of all age classes would be needed. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/03-5340","2-s2.0-33645099456",34,0.886828932,1

The species breeds widely throughout the Antarctic and on peri-Antarctic islands. From breeding population data collated from 73 of these localities, we estimated the minimum global population to be about 400,000 breeding pairs. After adjusting for seasonal variation in numbers of breeding pairs based on studies at Ardery Island, East Antarctica, the total global population is estimated to be at least one million breeding pairs. Of this, 72% nest on islands of the Scotia Sea arc and the South Atlantic Ocean. The precision of the estimate on the total number of breeding pairs is low, as several colony estimates were only available as orders of magnitude. Furthermore, different timing of the surveys and the difficulties of censusing colonial cliff-nesting birds reduced the count accuracy.

At that time a detailed colony map based on the GIS system was made. Results of this study showed different trends for each investigated species. In the last three decades Ad√©lie penguin breeding populations showed strong declining tendencies (69.61%). In contrast, the population of gentoo penguins represents the reverse trend, increasing 171.85% over the same period. Observed changes in both penguin population sizes are reflected in the different spatial and geographic distribution of their nests. The population changes observed at the Lions Rump colony are consistent with the relevant pygoscelid penguin tendencies in the western Antarctic Peninsula region. Breeding penguin population dynamics at Lions Rump area with a minimal disturbance by human activity may well illustrate a natural response of those birds to environmental changes in the Antarctic.","10.2478/popore-2013-0002","2-s2.0-84878021792",55,0.872713273,1

The breeding aggregation on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia is believed to be larger than all others combined. We estimated the size of this population by calculating the area of suitable habitat and the density of occupied burrows within it. Some 670,000 occupied nests were estimated for the island at mid-incubation, representing 0.9 million pairs of breeding-age birds associated with South Georgia in the survey seasons (2005/06 and 06/07). This is 40-45% of the previous estimate, but still represents well over half of the global population. If the population is declining due to fishery bycatch, as is likely, the scale of annual mortality in this population alone is at least in the high tens of thousands, and plausibly hundreds of thousands. ¬© 2009 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00300-008-0570-5","2-s2.0-62949087869",8,0.868969016,1

It addresses correspondence between long-term population trends of inshore demersal fish and inshore-feeding Antarctic shags of this area, where an intensive commercial fishery for shag prey once operated. The analysis also includes comparable information on diet (by examination of regurgitated pellets), foraging patterns, and breeding output of shags from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, an area where no commercial finfish fishery has ever existed. Integral study of these parameters there showed that, in Antarctic shags, low breeding success and high foraging effort might imply low recruitment and high adult mortality, respectively, with both factors adversely affecting the population trends of this bird. In line with these premises, the declining trend observed in shag colonies on the South Shetland Islands appears to have been influenced by the concomitant decrease in abundance of two of their main prey, the nototheniids Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons, due to intensive industrial fishing in the area in the late 1970s. In comparison, no such pattern occurred for the Danco Coast colonies. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-015-1850-5","2-s2.0-84949517452",21,0.847924953,1

The mean laying date of M. halli was in early October, five to six weeks ahead of M. giganteus. In both species males take the larger share (c. 54%) of incubation. The eggs of the two species are of the same size but in M. halli the egg formed a significantly higher proportion of the female body weight. On hatching M. giganteus chicks are 5% heavier than M. halli chicks but there are no sexual differences in weight. Brooding and guarding in M. halli is 11 days longer than in M giganteus and males undertake 60‚Äì68% of the duties during this time. Males of both species take five to six days longer to fledge than females and M. halli chicks have a seven to nine day shorter fledging period. The sex ratio amongst chicks is 1: 1. Chick growth (weight, culmen length and wing length) is summarized. Males reach higher peak and fledging weights than females in both species and have significantly larger bills through most of the fledging period. The increase in wing length was similar in both sexes until near the end of the fledging period. Adult M. halli tend to be shorter‚Äêwinged, larger‚Äêbilled and lighter in weight than M. giganteus at Bird Island. Chick mortality was on average c. 10% higher in M. giganteus than in M. halli leading to a lower overall breeding success in the former. Whilst the breeding population of M. giganteus seems to have stayed relatively stable M. halli has increased in numbers over the last 20 years. However 26‚Äê9‚Äê57‚Äì5% of birds colour‚Äêringed in 1978 did not breed in the subsequent two breeding seasons. Mean annual survival of breeding adults was c. 0‚Äì90. Breeding commenced between age 6 and 9 years with males possibly starting earlier than females. The increased population of M. halli and the better survival of their chicks is attributed to the considerable increase in breeding Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella which provide an abundance of carrion for M. halli nestlings during the first 30 days after hatching.

The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding population trends were stable. Given that seabird populations can provide valuable information on the conditions of their feeding and nesting environments, this study highlights the need to maintain basics monitoring studies. ¬© 2013 D.

"111","bird_antarctic","Population abundance, structure and turnover estimates for leopard seals during winter dispersal combining tagging and photo-identification data","Winter dispersal in leopard seals is poorly understood because of its low density in most of its range. By combining photo-identification and tagging data from Bird Island, South Georgia, in mark-recapture models, leopard seal abundance over the winter of 2005 was estimated as 118 (95% CI: 78-179). Seasonal residents arrived earlier and stayed longer around the island (27 days; 95% CI: 23-32) and their numbers were low and stable over the winter (xÃÑ = 12; 95%CI: 5-28). Most of the seals (81; 95% CI: 31-130) were young transients, stayed only 1-7 days, and arrived later in the season. This suggests (1) very low predatory pressure upon the locally abundant prey populations; (2) two different patterns of winter movements: a winter migration in adult seals with long-term site fidelity, and large numbers of juveniles in dispersal possibly attracted by locally abundant prey colonies, and potentially influenced by increased environmental stress. ¬© 2006 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00300-006-0149-y","2-s2.0-33749858440",10,0.822431295,0

Yet, contrary to the knowledge of bird biology along the maritime West coasts of the AP, there is a remarkable lack of data from the more continental East coast. We report on the distribution, abundance, and breeding of the Antarctic Tern at the James Ross and Seymour islands, the two largest snow-free areas in the NE part of the AP, where this species breeds under harsh climate conditions probably close to its limits. Terns were found breeding in most ice-free areas, with nests located up to 2. 9 km from coastlines at altitudes up to 180 m a. s. l. While the large-scale density was relatively low (c. 450 pairs per 127 km2 of surveyed ice-free area), the local density (total colony area: 3 nests per ha; nest clusters: 100-140 nests per ha) was as high as elsewhere. Mean clutch size (1. 21, n = 196) was smaller than in the west AP or in the maritime Antarctic. Daily nest survival rate during incubation varied between years and locations (mean = 0. 977; 95 % CI: 0. 966-0. 985). While both predation and weather-caused mortality were locally important, the impact of skua predation might be lower in areas with alternative prey (penguin colonies).

In contrast, blue and fin whales appeared to be less abundant. A single blue whale mother-calf pair was observed off the Shag Rocks in February 1997. Extirpation of animals from this particular feeding ground is the most likely reason for ongoing low numbers of all species. Other factors may include competition for krill by traditional predators such as penguins and seals and more recently by humans, an unusually high rate of natural mortality, habitat change such as alteration in sea ice coverage, and/or the impact of ongoing whaling.

"181","bird_antarctic","Re-constructing historical Ad√©lie penguin abundance estimates by retrospectively accounting for detection bias","Seabirds and other land-breeding marine predators are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because of their dependence on marine prey and the accessibility of their populations at breeding colonies. Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Ad√©lie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Ad√©lie penguin population change.

In addition, the rapid spread of tourism and the activities of researchers since the early 1960s have raised questions related to their real and potential impact on bird populations. Our data sets start in 1952 for several species of Antarctic seabirds and this study documents the trends over a 14-year period (1985-1999) in seven species breeding on Pointe G√©ologie archipelago (Terre Ad√©lie, Antarctica). This is the first study where the direct impact of destruction of breeding sites (for building of an airstrip) is examined and where such long-term populations trends have been assessed in such a number of Antarctic species at one site. Trends from 1985 show that for the whole archipelago and when excluding islands destroyed, Ad√©lie penguins and south polar skuas were the only species to show a significant increase (> 3.5% annual change). The others species showed opposite trends, three increasing slightly (southern fulmars + 0.4%, cape petrels + 2.3%, snow petrels + 0.9%) and two decreasing (emperor penguin - 0.9%, southern giant petrel - 3.9%). Three species particularly affected by the destruction of their breeding habitat (Ad√©lie penguin, cape petrel, snow petrel) showed the capability to restore their populations. The availability of food and nesting sites is discussed in relation to environmental change. Species feeding on krill (Ad√©lie penguins and cape petrels) increased more than other species; however, decrease of ice cover can increase availability of nesting sites. The importance of long-term studies is shown when assessing the role of human activities in Antarctica compared to larger-scale changes.","10.1007/s003000000193","2-s2.0-0035096817",43,0.799428138,1

Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early cr√®che stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years. Oceanographically, the two summers differed; in 2003 the mixed layer was fresher and shallower, indicating a delayed melting of sea-ice in the study area when compared to 2001. Satellite observations indicated that the pack-ice directly offshore from the Mawson coast broke out earlier in 2001 and the perennial fast-ice along the coast persisted later in 2003.

"221","bird_antarctic","Ecological drivers of change at South Georgia: The krill surplus, or climate variability","Macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are thought to be one of the most important mesopredators in the Southern Ocean having a greater impact on prey availability and abundance than any other seabird species. Their population centre has long been held to be South Georgia where populations were thought to comprise many million animals. Here we report the results of a recent census of the macaroni population at South Georgia undertaken using aerial survey methods. We report dramatic declines in numbers (~1.0 million breeding pairs) compared to numbers observed in the late 1970s (~5.4 million pairs), but show that these reductions have occurred principally at sites where numbers had previously been very large. During the breeding season, the main foraging grounds of birds from these sites overlap with the foraging grounds of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, a major competitor for their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We suggest that the redistribution of the macaroni penguin population at South Georgia reflects the recent recovery of fur seal populations and thus the ongoing consequences of human intervention at South Georgia, a process which started more than 2 centuries previously. The implied resource competition and the observed population changes may also be exacerbated by recent reductions in Antarctic krill abundance which have been linked with reductions in seasonal sea ice following recent, rapid, regional warming in the Antarctic; however, the recovery of fur seal populations, and the ongoing recovery of krill-eating whale populations argues that tropho-dynamic interactions may be sufficient to explain the observed changes. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

Seals belonged to an open population, and were sampled outside the breeding season and during their northward winter dispersal (April-October). Seals at Bird Island were highly transient (41-63%) with only a limited number of individuals making repeat visits across years. A minimum yearly survival for resident seals was estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.85. The physical environment played an important role in leopard seal abundance, with observations following an apparent 4-year periodicity consistent with the frequency and timing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. Years of low sea-surface temperature (SST) and extensive pack-ice corresponded to a higher number of seals present, earlier arrivals, and longer periods of residency. Peak leopard seal arrivals at Bird Island corresponded to periods of low SST, which was consistent with the pagophilic nature of this species.","10.1017/S0952836904005102","2-s2.0-3142639196",15,0.772810535,1

Bird Island abuts the northwest tip of South Georgia. The 4 most reported species in both data sets were southern right whale Eubalaena australis, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, minke whale Balaenoptera bonaerensis, and killer whale Orcinus orca. These totally independent data sets showed comparable changes in abundance through time; thus, despite a lack of sighting effort records, inferences could be drawn about changes in relative abundance. The number of reported sightings per 5 yr period from both data sets increased from the 1991 to 1995 period through the 2001 to 2005 period and has since decreased. Species composition of reported sightings has changed over time; southern right whales have become the most sighted species in both data sets, with a peak of reported sightings in the 2001 to 2005 period. Sightings were concentrated around Shag Rocks, at the northwest tip of South Georgia, and along the north/east coastlines of South Georgia; sightings in the bays around South Georgia have increased over time. In an area such as the Antarctic, which poses many difficulties when conducting research, opportunistic data sources such as these, although not ideal, can become invaluable, since such information would otherwise be unattainable. ¬© Inter-Research 2012.","10.3354/esr00471","2-s2.0-84895740260",67,0.766489187,0

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.","10.1017/S0030605308099997","2-s2.0-67349234507",48,0.761818988,0

A total of 22 Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii were recorded during the period 9 December 1996‚Äì16 January 1997 of that 65 day cruise, with 75% of them found in light to heavy pack ice conditions. The highest abundance was in the Riiser‚ÄêLarsen Sea (between 14¬∞E and 35¬∞E longitude). Half of the seals were observed over the shelf zone, while others were over continental slope to deep ocean. Discussion of all sea‚Äêice habitats from all sightings of Ross seals from the 1996/97 summer is presented here, along with opportunistic sightings of Ross seals from the same icebreaker in December 1992‚ÄêJanuary 1993 and in 1997/98 along the coastline from about 57¬∞E to 100¬∞E.

Overall, demersal-benthic fish were the most frequent and important prey at all the colonies, followed by octopods and gastropods. Amongst fish, Notothenia coriiceps was the main prey in all of the sampling sites, followed in similar importance by Gobionotothen gibberifrons at Cape Herschel, Primavera Island and Midas Island and in less importance by Harpagifer antarcticus at Py Point. There were marked differences among colonies in the size of the fish consumed. The largest and the smallest specimens were eaten by shags from Midas Island and Py Point respectively. This was mainly influenced by the number of specimens of the smallest fish species, H. antarcticus, consumed at Py Point. The differences in the diet composition may be related to the different foraging areas used by the shags. Results from this study differ from previous studies around the Antarctic Peninsula. The shags at the Danco Coast preyed markedly more intensively than those at the South Shetland Islands on G. gibberifrons. This finding reflects the low abundance of this fish species in inshore waters (<100 m depth) at the South Shetland Islands and supports the use of the Antarctic shags to monitor trends in local populations of coastal fish species.","10.1017/S095410200200055X","2-s2.0-0036124287",42,0.75501984,0
"291","bird_antarctic","Invasive species and land bird diversity on remote South Atlantic islands","Invasive species pose significant threats to biodiversity, especially on islands. They cause extinctions and population declines, yet little is known about their consequences on the emergent, metacommunity-level patterns of native species in island assemblages. We investigated differences in species-area relationships, nestedness, and occupancy of 9 species of native land birds between island assemblages with and without invasive Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in the Falkland Archipelago. We found that species-area curves, nestedness, and individual species' occurrences differed between island assemblages with and without rats. Rat-free islands had, on average, 2.1 more land bird species than rat-infested islands of similar size. Passerine bird communities on islands with and without rats were significantly nested, but nestedness was significantly higher on rat-free islands than on rat-infested islands. The presence of rats was associated with differences in the incidence of many, but not all bird species. On rat free islands the occurrence of all species increased with island area. The occurrence of most, albeit not all, bird species was lower on islands with than on islands without rats. Two species of conservation concern, Troglodytes aedon cobbi and Cinclodes antarcticus, were abundant on rat-free islands, but absent or found at very low frequencies on islands with rats. The occurrence of three species was not associated with the presence of rats. The patterns presented here can be used to evaluate the consequences of ongoing rat eradications for passerine diversity, distribution, and abundance. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","10.1007/s10530-013-0524-x","2-s2.0-84892438011",39,0.748280673,0

Abundances and distributions of three species of pinnipeds, Arctocephalus gazella (Antarctic fur seals), Leptonychotes weddelli (Weddell seals), and Lobodon carcinophagus (crabeater seals), and 11 species of marine birds were documented within Port Foster. A. gazella was the dominant pinniped within Port Foster; its abundance has increased since the 1986/87 austral summer season. A. gazella were concentrated at the entrance to Port Foster. More pinnipeds were observed during the austral summer than during the spring. The most dominant seabird, Pygoscelis antarctica (chinstrap penguin), was concentrated along the rocky cliffs behind the beaches where A. gazella hauled out. Larus dominicanus (kelp gull) and Daption capense (cape petrel) were the most dominant flying seabirds. All other seabird species were more widely distributed around Port Foster than P. antarctica. There was no clear trend in abundances of seabirds over the study period.

"31","bird_antarctic","King penguin population threatened by Southern Ocean warming","Seabirds are sensitive indicators of changes in marine ecosystems and might integrate and/or amplify the effects of climate forcing on lower levels in food chains. Current knowledge on the impact of climate changes on penguins is primarily based on Antarctic birds identified by using flipper bands. Although flipper bands have helped to answer many questions about penguin biology, they were shown in some penguin species to have a detrimental effect. Here, we present for a Subantarctic species, king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), reliable results on the effect of climate on survival and breeding based on unbanded birds but instead marked by subcutaneous electronic tags. We show that warm events negatively affect both breeding success and adult survival of this seabird. However, the observed effect is complex because it affects penguins at several spatio/temporal levels. Breeding reveals an immediate response to forcing during warm phases of El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation affecting food availability close to the colony. Conversely, adult survival decreases with a remote sea-surface temperature forcing (i.e., a 2-year lag warming taking place at the northern boundary of pack ice, their winter foraging place). We suggest that this time lag may be explained by the delay between the recruitment and abundance of their prey, adjusted to the particular 1-year breeding cycle of the king penguin. The derived population dynamic model suggests a 9% decline in adult survival for a 0.26¬∞C warming. Our findings suggest that king penguin populations are at heavy extinction risk under the current global warming predictions. ¬© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","10.1073/pnas.0712031105","2-s2.0-40649099856",33,0.74427518,0

Five breeding colonies of Pygoscelis penguins from King George Island and Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were examined to (1) compare the responses of sympatric congeners to recent changes in their Antarctic ecosystem and (2) assess underlying causes for such responses. We used linear regression and correlation analyses to compare indices of abundance, recruitment, and summer breeding performance of the Ad√©lie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica). Breeding colonies of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins have declined by roughly 50% since the mid-1970s, and recruitment indices of Ad√©lie penguins have declined by roughly 80%, but no such patterns are evident for gentoo penguins. Fledging success, however, has remained stable at all breeding colonies. The different trends in abundance and recruitment indices for each species, despite generally similar indices of summer performance, suggest that winter conditions contribute to the divergent responses among the penguins. In particular, strong correlations between indices of penguin and krill recruitment suggest that penguins in the South Shetland Islands may live under an increasingly krill-limited system that has disproportionate effects on the survival of juvenile birds. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00442-007-0781-4","2-s2.0-34548590212",25,0.73186728,1
"34","bird_antarctic","Relics: penguin population programs.","What has been responsible for the increase in Chinstrap penguin populations during the past 40 years in maritime Antarctica? One view ascribes it to an increase in availability of their prey brought on by the decrease in baleen whale stocks. The contrary opinion, attributes it to environmental warming. This causes a gradual decrease in the frequency of cold years with extensive winter sea ice cover. A number of penguin monitoring programs are in progress and are expected to provide some answers to these questions. Unfortunately, it is not easy to distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic change since penguins are easily accessible predators of krill and the feeding range of the penguins has almost overlapped with the krill fishery in time and space in the last four decades. Therefore it is important to reconstruct the change of ancient penguin abundance and distribution in the absence of human activity. Many efforts have focused on surveying the abandoned penguin rookeries, but this method has not been able to give a continuous historical record of penguin populations. In several recent studies, ancient penguin excreta was scooped from the penguin relics in the sediments of the lake on penguin rookery, Ardley Island, maritime Antarctica. In these studies, penguin droppings or guano soil deposited in the lake and changes in sediment geochemistry have been used to calculate penguin population changes based upon the geochemical composition of the sediment core. The results suggest that climate change has a significant impact on penguin populations.","10.3184/003685001783239078","2-s2.0-0035222712",74,0.728037947,0

Opposite movements are very rare. In the Southern Ocean, the abundance of 13C declines markedly with more southern latitude, providing a characteristic 13C isoscape. This can be used as a tracer for the movement of seabirds between breeding and inter-breeding areas, by comparing stable isotope ratios of feathers grown at different times of the year.Results: We studied seasonal movements of Thin-billed prions (Aves, Procellariiformes), breeding at the Subantarctic Falkland/Malvinas Islands, compared with those of Wilson's storm-petrels breeding in the Antarctic South Shetland Islands. The two species showed opposite migratory movements. While Wilson's storm-petrels moved to warmer waters north of the Drake Passage in winter, Thin-billed prions showed a reversed movement towards more polar waters. Carbon stable isotope ratios in recent and historical feathers indicated that poleward winter movements of Thin-billed prions were less common historically (45% in 1913-1915), and have only recently become dominant (92% in 2003-2005), apparently in response to warming sea temperatures.Conclusions: This study shows that pelagic seabirds can rapidly change migration strategies within populations, including migration towards more poleward waters in winter. ¬© 2010 Quillfeldt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","10.1186/1742-9994-7-15","2-s2.0-77952318707",13,0.702034278,0

We performed supervised classification of 12 panchromatic satellite images of the seven known Ross Sea colonies. We used regression to predict adult bird counts at the inaccessible colonies by relating the number of pixels classified as ""penguin"" in the satellite images of the accessible colonies to corresponding known adult bird counts from aerial photographs or ground counts. While our analysis was hampered by excessive guano and shadows, we used satellite imagery to differentiate between relatively small (<3,000 adult birds) and larger colonies (>5,000 adult birds). Remote sensing technology is logistically less intense and less costly than aerial or ground censuses when the objective is to document penguin presence and/or large emperor penguin population changes (e.g., catastrophic changes).

There are several studies reporting statistical relationships between climate, krill and Penguin population size. The Ad√©lie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap (P. antarctica) and Gentoo (P. papua) penguins appear to be influenced by interannual variability in sea-ice extent and krill biomass. In this paper we developed simple conceptual models to decipher the role of climate and krill fluctuations on the population dynamics of these three Pygoscelis penguin species inhabiting the Antarctic Peninsula region. Our results suggest that the relevant processes underlying the population dynamics of these penguin species at King George Island (South Shetland Islands) are intra-specific competition and the combined effects of krill abundance and sea-ice cover. Our results using population theoretical models appear to support that climate change, specifically regional warming on the western Antarctic Peninsula, represents a major driver. At our study site, penguins showed species-specific responses to climate change. While Chinstrap penguins were only influenced by krill abundance, the contrasting population trends of Ad√©lie and Gentoo penguins appear to be better explained by the ""sea-ice hypothesis"". We think that proper population dynamic modeling and theory are essential for deciphering and proposing the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of these penguin populations. ¬© 2013 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.","10.1007/s10144-013-0386-1","2-s2.0-84884906334",16,0.678613147,1

On Marion Island, larvae of the moth Pringleophaga marioni are one of the key decomposers. Abundance of these caterpillars is higher in newly abandoned Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans) nests than other habitats, and this observation has been explained by hypotheses regarding the thermal and nutrient advantages of nests. These hypotheses require a mechanism for increasing the abundance of caterpillars, since nests are an ephemeral resource, and here, we determine whether caterpillars respond to chemosensory and thermal cues using a laboratory choice chamber approach. Caterpillars show no significant preference for newly abandoned nest material over no other choice, old nest material, and the common mire moss Sanionia uncinata. Caterpillars that are acclimated to warm (15 ¬∞C) conditions do prefer lower (5 ¬∞C) to higher (15 ¬∞C) temperatures, perhaps reflecting negative effects of prolonged exposure to warm temperatures on growth. Caterpillars also show significant avoidance of conspecifics, possibly because of incidental cannibalism previously reported in this species. Thus, we find no empirical support for nest-finding ability in caterpillars based on chemosensory or thermal cues. It is possible that adult females or very early instar caterpillars show such ability, or high caterpillar density and biomass in nests are an incidental consequence of better conditions in the nests or deposition by the birds during nest construction. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-014-1457-2","2-s2.0-84895810574",26,0.539957042,0

Here, the temporal and spatial dynamics of Profilicollis antarcticus and Profilicollis novaezelandensis (Acanthocephala) infections in three species of shore crabs (Macrophthalmus hirtipes, Hemigrapsus edwardsii, and Hemigrapsus crenulatus) are examined in relation to the distribution and abundance of shorebird definitive hosts. Temporal patterns of infection were observed in M. hirtipes but not the other two species. Spatial heterogeneity in recruitment of acanthocephalan larvae to M. hirtipes and H. edwardsii populations was found both within and between locations. Weak evidence is found that infection levels in crab populations are related to the distribution and abundance of shorebird hosts both temporally and spatially. In this system, abiotic factors seem to be at least as important in determining how infection levels vary in time and space as the input of parasite eggs from bird definitive hosts.","10.1139/z03-118","2-s2.0-0344496143",9,0.419152579,1
"112","bird_australasia","Population status, breeding and ecology of Chatham Island tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae chathamensis)","Status, breeding, and foraging of Chatham Island tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae chathamensis) were studied on Rangatira Island, Chatham Islands between January 1995 and May 1999, with short visits made to adjacent Pitt Island throughout this period. The total population was estimated at ‚âà260 adults. Most birds were resident on Rangatira Island in spring, summer and autumn but moved to Pitt Island during the winter. In spring birds commuted between the two islands but became resident on Rangatira when breeding commenced. Radio transmitters were attached to adult tui to monitor breeding. No radio-tagged female bred (n = 13) but at least two of three radio-tagged males raised young. Adult tui were intolerant of disturbance during nesting so estimation of productivity was made by mapping the number of fledgling groups. Flax (Phormium tenax) nectar appeared to be the most important food for breeding tui and birds travelled long distances to visit flowering plants. Fruits of ngaio (Myoporum laetum), matipo (Myrsine chathamica), karamu (Coprosma chathamica), mahoe (Melicytus chathamicus) and muehlenbeckia (Muehlenbeekia australis) were also important foods. Invertebrates were most important when females were feeding their young. The amount of breeding that occurred each season was directly related to the abundance of flax flowers in spring, and in good flax flowering years tui were able to rear two broods. In poor flax flowering years many birds did not breed. Control of feral cats on Pitt Island would most likely result in a significant increase in this breeding population; however planting of flax adjacent to the the forest areas on Chatham Island along with predator control may be necessary before tui can re-establish there. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc. 2004.",NA,"2-s2.0-11344252452",83,0.865944672,1

In winter (June/early July), 163 000 New Zealand breeding and 21 000 Arctic migrant waders were recorded, and in summer (November/early December) 37 000 New Zealand breeding and 166 000 Arctic migrant waders were recorded. Species accounts, including seasonal totals for each year 1983-1994, average counts at favoured sites, and distribution maps are presented for the most abundant New Zealand breeding and Arctic migrant waders. The Pied Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus was the most abundant New Zealand breeding wader; the estimated winter total of over 112 000 birds showed that the population had increased by about 128% since 1970-71. Counts of Pied Stilt Himantopus bimantopus (estimated winter total c. 28 000 birds) and Banded Dotterel Charadrius bicinctus (c. 11 000 birds) provided the first population estimates for these species during winter in New Zealand. However, both are significantly underestimated because many overwinter inland in sites not counted. Also, most of the Banded Dotterel population migrates to Australia following the breeding season. Wrybill Anarhychus frontalis (c. 3900 birds) was next most abundant native species counted in winter, with most birds recorded in the North Island. Counts of Spur-winged Plover Vanellus miles, Variable Oystercatcher Haematopus unicolor, New Zealand Dotterel Charadrius obscurus, Black-fronted Dotterel Charadrius melanops, and Black Stilt H. novaezelandiae also substantially underestimated population sizes because most birds of these species do not use estuarine sites during winter. During summer, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Lesser Knot Calidris canutus, and Turnstone Arenaria interpres were the most abundant of the Northern Hemisphere migrants with estimated populations of c. 102 000, 59 000 and 5100 birds, respectively, representing significant proportions of the East Asian-Australasian flyway populations of these species. Less than 700 birds were recorded during summer for each of the other Northern Hemisphere migrants, including (in decreasing order of abundance) Pacific Golden Plover Pluvialis fulva, Red-necked Stint Calidris rufcollis, Whimbrel Numentus phaeopus, Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea, Sharp-tailed Sandpiper C. acuminata, and Eastern Curlew N. madagascariensis.

Sixty-eight colonies were found of which 51 contained 5-20 nests, 12 21-50 nests, and 5 >50 nests. Altogether there were 2112 nests which equates to a population of c. 5870 birds. Adding the estimated 1650 nests on Motunau Island gave a total population for the subspecies of c. 10,460 birds. The colonies were distributed right around the peninsula with their occurrence increasing from west to east. Most were situated either on the peripheral coast (47%) or inside bays within 1 km of their entrance (38%). All but three of the colonies were on debris slopes below coastal bluffs with the nests concentrated mainly in rock piles. One colony was on an islet, and the other two were on farmland around the heads of bays. Thirty-four of the colonies were considered accessible to introduced mammalian predators, and 14 contained evidence predators had been present. If predator numbers remain high it seems inevitable that many of the surviving penguin colonies will be lost and others reduced in size. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc. 2004.",NA,"2-s2.0-2142829624",17,0.844955978,1

A total of 178 transects was conducted in six major vegetation zones, with 777 individuals of 16 species of birds recorded. The six most common species, in order of their abundance, were Spinifexbird (Eremiornis carteri), White-winged Fairy-wren (Malurus leucopterus), Singing Honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), White-breasted Woodswallow (Artamus leucorynchus), Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and Welcome Swallow (Hirundo neoxena). Our total population estimates for these species were generally comparable to those of a survey of Barrow Island in 1976 (Sedgwick 1978), but some differences existed for these and other species. In an analysis of habitat preferences, more complex vegetation zones supported more species. The density of both Spinifexbirds and Singing Honeyeaters was significantly correlated with the number of emergent shrubs. Also, across vegetation zones, the number of different bird species was correlated with the maximum height of vegetation in a habitat. Species richness and numbers of individuals were compared between natural areas, areas surrounding oil pads, and along roadsides. There was no significant difference in species richness across these three areas, but there was a significant increase in number of individuals along road sides. This latter result occurred because disturbed areas along roadsides were colonized by a large species of spinifex, Triodia angusta, which supported greater numbers of birds than other species of spinifex away from roads. The oil-field development on Barrow Island occupies approximately 4% of the land area on the island and appears, at present, to have had a relatively minor impact on the populations of land birds. This conclusion is qualified in that several species of insectivorous birds have declined in numbers over the last 25 years, and the reasons for these declines are not yet known. ¬© Royal Society of Western Australia 2004.",NA,"2-s2.0-23844458192",84,0.839548995,1

Declines have been reported from nearly all monitored sites along the coastline of Australia and at some, local extinction is predicted within the next thirty years. In contrast, numbers recorded at two sites in the Darwin region appear to have increased in the same period. Since 1980 numbers at Lee Point have increased by 9% per year (SE = 2%); at East Arm Wharf in Darwin Harbour, the annual population increase was 17% per year (SE = 9%) for the period of 2009-2015. This local increase over time may reflect changes in bird roosting behaviour and an increase in suitable high tide roosting habitat. The consistent use of an artificial site at East Arm Wharf is promising for adaptive management of the species and other shorebirds that are threatened by the effects of habitat loss along coastlines. ¬© 2015, Australasian Wader Studies Group.

We also measured flowering in eucalypts, which support large numbers of nectarivores characteristic of the region. Location A 30,000-km2 region of northern Victoria, Australia, consisting of limited amounts of remnant native woodlands embedded in largely agricultural landscapes. Methods There were three sets of monitoring studies, pitched at regional (survey programmes in 1995-97, 2004-05 and 2006-08), landscape (2002-03 and 2006-07) and site (1997-2008 continuously) scales. Bird survey techniques used a standard 2-ha, 20-min count method. We used Bayesian analyses of reporting rates to document statistically changes in the avifauna through time at each spatial scale. Results Bird populations in the largest remnants of native vegetation (up to 40,000 ha), some of which have been declared as national parks in the past decade, experienced similar declines to those in heavily cleared landscapes. All categories of birds (guilds based on foraging substrate, diet, nest site; relative mobility; geographical distributions) were affected similarly. We detected virtually no bird breeding in the latest survey periods. Eucalypt flowering has declined significantly over the past 12 years of drought. Main conclusions Declines in the largest woodland remnants commensurate with those in cleared landscapes suggest that reserve systems may not be relied upon to sustain species under climate change. We attribute population declines to low breeding success due to reduced food. Resilience of bird populations in this woodland system might be increased by active management to enhance habitat quality in existing vegetation and restoration of woodland in the more fertile parts of landscapes. ¬© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00578.x","2-s2.0-67149090802",53,0.81841238,1

In addition, several annotated bird lists have been published since 1905. Over the period 1905 to 2007, 101 species have been recorded from the island, including 41 species of vagrant (species rarely seen with no pattern of occurrence) that have not changed in status over the 102 years. Of the 60 species recorded as part of the island's avifauna, 24 have apparently not changed in status over that period. Thirty-five species have changed in status and/or abundance, including nine species of transequatorial migrant; all Charadriiformes. Seven of these species were formerly absent or vagrants but now are regular visitors, several possibly as a result of range extensions. Two species of transequatorial migrant, formerly regarded as members of the island's avifauna, have become vagrants. Six passerine and one non-passerine species have resident populations that are isolated on the island with no populations on the adjacent mainland. Populations of three of these species are sufficiently different from mainland populations to constitute conservation management units. Rottnest Island is managed as a holiday resort.

"83","bird_australasia","Cyclonic and anthropogenic influences on tern populations","Organisms can be strongly affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic stressors in conjunction, making comprehensive assessments of multiple potential drivers of population dynamics essential. An 18-year dataset obtained for Michaelmas Cay in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, was used to assess population trends for three tern species relative to two potential threatening processes, namely human impacts (as either commercial fishing or tourism) and cyclone activity. We found a positive, 2-year lagged relationship between long-line catch per unit effort in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery in the vicinity of Michaelmas Cay and breeding participation in the two pelagic foraging terns, but not in the inshore foraging tern. The abundance of large pelagic fish may influence recruitment into the breeding populations of the two pelagic terns in the following years through impacts on prey availability. Long-term population trends for all seabirds were not related to localised direct disturbance from cyclones or associated changes in cay size and/or nesting habitat. Current management protocols in place for the tourism industry at the cay appear to be minimising direct human impacts. Other evidence from this breeding location suggesting that climate variation may be driving foraging success and breeding-population dynamics in the two pelagic terns implies that a precautionary approach is warranted to the management of any potential stressors to birds in this system. ¬© CSIRO 2009.","10.1071/WR08142","2-s2.0-68549105998",32,0.812048741,1

The estimated number of Brant, corrected for birds not seen by observers, was 2756 ¬± 413 (standard error) (0.56 ¬± 0.08 birds/km2 on 4930 km2) at the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula - Mackenzie Delta and 3176 ¬± 588 (37.81 ¬± 7.00 birds/km2 on 84 km2) at Campbell Island - Smoke-Moose Delta in Liverpool Bay. Another 76-225 Brant were found on small islands in western Liverpool Bay just outside the survey strata. Thus, the total population estimate for the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, Mackenzie Delta, and western Liverpool Bay was 6100 birds. Numbers of Brant at western Liverpool Bay have apparently increased since the 1970s or 1980s. Several hundred Black Brant also nest at the Anderson River delta (just east of our survey area), where numbers appear to have declined substantially since the 1970s or earlier. Recaptures of banded Brant suggest that some breeding individuals may have shifted from Anderson River to western Liverpool Bay (approximately 70 km west). Significant numbers of previously marked Black Brant were recaptured during banding drives in 1990-1998, and this information provided a Jolly-Seber estimate, which included both survey strata and Anderson River, of 6211 ¬± 868 Brant.

Here we redress this situation by describing the breeding activities of brown songlarks over three years (1998-2000) in the semi-arid grasslands of south-western New South Wales. Study populations of this nomadic species were selected in late August of each year on the basis of high adult abundance. Adult males at these sites were, on average, 2.3 times heavier than females. Over the three seasons, nesting activities started in early to late August and continued until early November or December. Males were highly polygynous and, on average, occupied territories of about 4.0 ha. Nests were well concealed at the base of small shrubs and grass tussocks or in thick herbage. Clutches ranged in size from 2 to 5 eggs (mean 3.2) and were incubated exclusively by the female for 11-13 days (mean 12.1). Nestlings received a range of invertebrate prey, mainly from the female, for 10-14 days (mean 11.5) before leaving the nest. Only 17% of nesting attempts were estimated to be successful, and each of these nests produced an average of 2.7 fledglings. Predators, including foxes, Vulpes vulpes, and brown snakes, Pseudonaja textilis, were the main cause of nest failure. Some females produced replacement clutches following nest failure, while others laid second clutches after the success of an earlier brood. We speculate that extreme size dimorphism has evolved in this species because (i) males compete physically for breeding territories, and (ii) habitat heterogeneity and excellent visibility of their surroundings allow some males to defend territories of sufficient size to support nesting by multiple females.","10.1071/ZO03034","2-s2.0-1042302427",80,0.79665272,0

"132","bird_australasia","The importance of eastern China for shorebirds during the non-breeding season","China is located centrally in the East AsianAustralasian Flyway, and a large proportion of the migratory shorebird population of the Flyway uses its extensive wetlands during migration. However, little is known about the abundance and distribution of shorebirds in China during the non-breeding season. In the non-breeding seasons of 200203 to 200607 we surveyed shorebirds in coastal and inland areas of eastern China, covering an estimated 2500km of inland waterways and 3500km of coastline. We document the abundance and distribution of the main species of shorebirds occurring in the region during the non-breeding season, and present the first population estimates for this period, discuss the accuracy of published population estimates of the Flyway, and describe extensions of range of some species. The total shorebird population in eastern China during the non-breeding season is likely to exceed 1million birds. There were sufficient data for satisfactory population estimates to be made for six of the 27 different species encountered during the surveys (Pied Avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta; Grey Plover, Pluvialis squatarola; Kentish Plover, Charadrius alexandrinus; Eurasian Curlew, Numenius arquata; Spotted Redshank, Tringa erythropus; and Dunlin, Calidris alpina), and suggestions are made for reviews of the population estimates in the Flyway of four of these species and of the Eurasian Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), one of the less common species encountered.

This region is an important stopover site for shorebirds along the East Asian-Australasian flyway and is extensively used by waterfowl. A net loss of 11% of the wetland area was estimated during study periods at Chongming Dongtan. The change was dependent on wetland types: while the area of artificial habitats such as paddy fields and aquacultural ponds more than doubled, more than 65% of natural habitats including sea bulrush (Scirpus mariqueter) and common reed (Phragmites australis) marshes were lost over the two decades. An exotic plant species introduced from North America, smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), occupied 30% of the vegetated intertidal zone by the 2000s. Although waterbird species richness did not change between the 1980s (110) and the 2000s (111), 13 species found in 1980s were replaced by 14 newly recorded species. Moreover, there were more species with declining trends (58) than with increasing trends (19). The population trends of species were affected by residential status and habitat types. Transients, wintering migrants, and habitat specialists were more likely to show declining trends compared to those breeding at Dongtan (including year-round and summer residents) and habitat generalists. Furthermore, species associated mainly with natural wetlands were more likely to decline than those associated mainly with artificial wetlands. These patterns suggest that the loss and change of wetland habitats at Chongming Dongtan adversely affected local population dynamics and might have contributed to the global decline of some waterbird species. Because Chongming Dongtan provides stopover and wintering habitats for many migratory waterbirds, protection and restoration of natural wetlands at Chongming Dongtan are urgently needed. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","10.1007/s00267-008-9247-7","2-s2.0-67349220382",111,0.786291044,1

Reasons for the increase in the Australasian gannet population are poorly understood; here we consider the possible effects of recent fluctuations in climatic and oceanographic conditions, and changes in major local commercial fisheries. A significant trend towards more frequent, and stronger, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation events, warmer summer sea surface temperatures in Bass Strait, increased annual catches and catch per unit effort in the Victorian pilchard (Sardinops sagax) fishery and potential increased discarding of fisheries by catch may account for at least some of the observed increase in the Australasian gannet population.

"162","bird_australasia","Probable consequences of high female mortality for speckled warblers living in habitat remnants","The effects of habitat fragmentation on the Australian avifauna have been widespread with species richness and abundance declining with reduced remnant size and habitat quality and increased habitat isolation. The speckled warbler, Chthonicola sagittata is one species from the highly fragmented temperate woodlands of eastern Australia that has declined across its range and populations that remain appear to be patchily distributed in habitat remnants. Specific causes of decline are unknown but several aspects of its biology make the species particularly vulnerable to decline in fragmented landscapes. Here, we analyse survey data (presence/absence) of speckled warblers in a large sample of habitat remnants from three regions to identify patterns of occupancy. We explore the effects of patch size on extinction risk using population viability analyses (PVA) and detailed demographic data from a behavioural study of individuals in the Australian Capital Territory, south-eastern Australia. Patch size was a strong predictor of the persistence of speckled warblers in habitat remnants. High density populations had higher probabilities of persisting, and inclusion of an Allee effect during drought decreased the probability of persistence. In the absence of an Allee effect, only high density populations in patches greater than 300 ha and low density populations in patches greater than700 ha had more than an 80% probability of persisting over 100 years. The accelerating decrease in population persistence below approximately 200-400 ha suggests that small populations were particularly vulnerable to stochastic demographic and environmental events. Adult female mortality was the single most important factor in driving population extinction. Our PVA model predictions matched the survey data for the Australian Capital Territory region remarkably well, but failed to predict occupancy rates in remnants in other regions. Differences in occupancy patterns between regions may, however, have resulted from inbreeding depression. This study demonstrates both the strengths and limitations of PVA analysis. PVA can predict occupancy patterns with reasonable accuracy, given good demographic data, but data for one region cannot be used universally for all regions. We highlight the need for studies of demography in different regions to interpret regional patterns of occupancy and to identify mechanisms of decline in remnant habitat. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To gain a better understanding of the impacts that this reclamation has had on the long-distance migratory shorebirds that use the EAA Flyway, we examined the number of shorebirds visiting Saemangeum and three adjacent sites in the Geum Estuary (Yubu Island, the Janghang coastline, and the Geum River Channel) during the spring and fall prior to, and after, completion of the reclamation (2004-2013). A total of 48 shorebird species, including one Critically Endangered, three Endangered, and nine Near Threatened species, were observed over this period. Peak numbers of shorebirds recorded at sites in Saemangeum and the Geum Estuary following completion of the project were 74% below those recorded in 2004 and 2005, the years prior to reclamation activity. In Saemangeum, shorebird abundance declined by approximately 95% and 97.3% during the northward and southward migrations, respectively, as a result of reclamation. Although shorebird populations in the Geum Estuary increased by 5% and 20% during the northwards and southward migrations, respectively, these increases failed to offset the reduction in shorebird abundance in Saemangeum; overall, shorebird abundance at Saemangeum and the three adjacent sites in the Geum Estuary markedly declined over the reclamation period. Given the more favourable conditions of adjacent areas, sites in Saemangeum and the Geum Estuary no longer provide the habitat conditions necessary for long-distance migratory shorebirds. In order to improve habitat for staging migratory birds, we suggest that measures such as the conversion of an abandoned salt farm for use as roosting sites, the construction of artificial barriers to prevent human disturbance, and re-opening of the river-banks to facilitate water flow be implemented. ¬© 2017 BirdLife International.","10.1017/S0959270916000605","2-s2.0-85012294412",43,0.759114952,1

Multi-scale investigatory approaches are increasingly encouraged, as the patchy distribution of suitable habitats in fragmented landscapes often determines species presence and survival. Habitat models applied to a threatened New Zealand forest passerine, the South Island saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus carunculatus), reintroduced to Ulva Island (Stewart Island) found that at landscape scale breeding pairs' preferences for sites near the coast were driven by micro-scale vegetation structure. We tested these results by examining models of breeding site selection by a reintroduced saddleback population on Motuara Island (Marlborough Sounds) at two scales: (1) micro-scale, for habitat characteristics that may drive breeding site selection, and (2) landscape scale, for variations in micro-scale habitat characteristics that may influence site colonisation in breeding pairs. Results indicated that birds on Motuara Island responded similarly to those on Ulva Island, i.e. birds primarily settled at the margins of coastal scrub and forest and later cohorts moved into larger stands of coastal forest where they established breeding territories. Plant species composition was also important in providing breeding saddleback pairs with adequate food supply and nesting support. However, Motuara Island birds differed in their partitioning of habitat use: preferred habitats were used for nesting while birds were foraging outside territorial boundaries or in shared sites. These differences may be explained because Motuara has a more homogeneous distribution of microscale habitats throughout the landscape and a highly bird-populated environment. These results show that resource distribution and abundance across the landscape needs to be accounted for in the modelling of density-bird-habitat relationships. In the search for future release sites, food (invertebrates and fruiting tree species) should be abundant close to available nesting sites, or evenly spread and available throughout the landscape. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",NA,"2-s2.0-46849098963",91,0.750988787,0

We measured the extent and pattern of change in range and relative abundance over 25 years of the White-fronted Chat, a small passerine that is predominantly found in saltmarsh. A particular focus of the study was the population in the Sydney region, which is now restricted to two locations in which we measured the response of birds to human disturbance. A significant decline of 65% in the reporting rate of White-fronted Chats was observed over the 25 years, with a decline of 44% over the last 10 years in New South Wales. Historical analysis of the White-fronted Chat in the Sydney region revealed a change in geographical distribution, with the current population now confined to only two of 56 former locations. Surveys of these locations concluded that in 2008, nine White-fronted Chats remained at Newington Nature Reserve and ‚àº20 at Towra Point Nature Reserve. Measurements of the distance at which foraging birds flushed from an approaching observer suggest that this species is more sensitive to human disturbance than other co-occurring species. This study documents the decline of a species listed in 2010 as vulnerable under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, and confirms the need for recovery planning to prevent the further loss of populations, particularly those in the highly urbanised coastal zone. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2011.","10.1071/MU10038","2-s2.0-79955451026",27,0.749100951,1

We conducted censuses over 3 years on terns in an increasingly popular recreational waterway at the northern end of Moreton Bay, known as Caloundra sandbanks, to provide the first overview of the relative abundance of non-breeding tern species on estuary-type sandbanks in Australia. The maximum number of birds counted was &gt; 43,000, of which over 90% belonged to six species of terns. The most abundant tern species was the common tern Sterna hirundo longipennis which reached &gt; 38,000 in one Austral summer. Other northern-breeding migrant terns were the white-winged black tern Chlidonias leucopterus ( &gt; 17,000) and the little tern S. albifrons sinensis ( &gt;11,000), which also breeds in Australia. These migrant terns arrived at Caloundra sandbanks at around late-October and a vast majority had departed by mid-April. Numbers were generally highest from late-December through to early-April. An additional three Australian-breeding terns of smaller population sizes frequented the sandbanks. Density of terns using the habitats could reach a peak of 600 ha-1 during the warmer months of the year, coinciding with peak human recreational activities. In light of the results, Caloundra sandbanks should be regarded as an Area of International Importance based on criteria contained in the Ramsar Convention. The situation at Caloundra sandbanks presents challenges to recreational and tourism issues, requiring review of traditional government priorities in the conservation of wetlands based primarily on waders. ¬© 2006 Springer.","10.1007/s10531-005-6197-8","2-s2.0-33846864898",42,0.746256318,1

However, the conservation effectiveness is often poorly studied. Here, using twelve years' census data collected from 78 wetlands in the Yangtze River floodplain, we aimed to understand the effect of these variables on five Anatidae species, and evaluate the effectiveness of the conservation measures by comparing population trends of these species among wetlands that differ in conservations status. We showed that the slope angle of a wetland and the variation thereof best explain the differences in densities of four species. We also found that the population abundances of the Anatidae species generally declined in wetlands along the Yangtze River floodplain over time, with a steeper decline in wetlands with a lower protection status, indicating that current conservation policies might deliver benefits for wintering Anatidae species in China, as population sizes of the species were buffered to some extent against decline in numbers in wetlands with a higher level protection status. We recommend several protection measures to stop the decline of these Anatidae species in wetlands along the Yangtze River floodplain, which are of great importance for the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. ¬© 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

It is even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots, monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south-western Australia. Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000. Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown. Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change in frequency of calling of ‚àº13%. The number of listening posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual change of 10%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect an annual change of 5%. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2007.","10.1071/MU06016","2-s2.0-34250882813",51,0.744602411,1
"232","bird_australasia","Analyzing Variability and the Rate of Decline of Migratory Shorebirds in Moreton Bay, Australia","Estimating the abundance of migratory species is difficult because sources of variability differ substantially among species and populations. Recently developed state-space models address this variability issue by directly modeling both environmental and measurement error, although their efficacy in detecting declines is relatively untested for empirical data. We applied state-space modeling, generalized least squares (with autoregression error structure), and standard linear regression to data on abundance of wetland birds (shorebirds and terns) at Moreton Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia. There are internationally significant numbers of 8 species of waterbirds in the bay, and it is a major terminus of the large East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In our analyses, we considered 22 migrant and 8 resident species. State-space models identified abundances of 7 species of migrants as significantly declining and abundance of one species as significantly increasing. Declines in migrant abundance over 15 years were 43-79%. Generalized least squares with an autoregressive error structure showed abundance changes in 11 species, and standard linear regression showed abundance changes in 15 species. The higher power of the regression models meant they detected more declines, but they also were associated with a higher rate of false detections. If the declines in Moreton Bay are consistent with trends from other sites across the flyway as a whole, then a large number of species are in significant decline. ¬©2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01670.x","2-s2.0-79960557286",7,0.743603816,1

Determination of the diet over the year and between breeding and non-breeding seasons is important in understanding the food sources and their potential relationship with seabird population dynamics. We studied seasonality in the diet of the Rock Shag (Phalacrocorax magellanicus), a seabird endemic to southern Argentina and Chile, at a colony at Punta Loma, Chubut, by analysis of pellets (regurgitated casts) collected weekly during two consecutive non-breeding and breeding seasons in 2002 and 2003. We identified 19 prey-types in the diet. Polychaetes were the most common item, being present in 80-90% of the samples. Fish were also dominant in both non-breeding and breeding seasons (present in 60-80% of the pellets), especially species of Patagonotothen, Ribeiroclinus and Helcogrammoides. Crustaceans and cephalopods were also present in the diet, but to a lesser extent. There was a high overlap in dietary composition between non-breeding and breeding seasons, although more crustaceans and cephalopods were consumed during the non-breeding season in 2002. Results indicate that the food sources of Rock Shags are present in their feeding areas throughout the year, although many of these species are restricted in their availability, are of small size and have low energy content. ¬© Royal Australasian Orinthologists Union 2009.","10.1071/MU07061","2-s2.0-62249146130",41,0.741631988,0

Eleven mammal and 14 bird species were recorded, but Australian possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) predominated, and pukekos (Porphyrio porphyrio), mynas (Acridotheres tristis), and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibiceri) were the most common birds. Counts of possums, hedgehogs and rabbits ranged between 0.7 and 89 corpses/100 km, and changed dramatically over six decades. The possum count rose 80% between 1984 and 1994, but declined 60% by 2005. A possible irruption of hedgehogs is reported in 1988-89, followed by an 82% decline in their numbers between 1994 and 2005. Although rabbit hemorrhagic disease was introduced to New Zealand in 1997,rabbit road-kill increased 59% between 1994 and 2005. The relationship between road-kill and traffic volume indicates that roads carrying more than 3000 vehicles per day act as barriers to larger mammals, while vehicles on less busy roads are more dangerous for crossing animals. We suggest that regular counts taken at annual intervals over the same roads is a useful method for gathering information about the changing distribution and relative abundance of certain animals on a provincial or national scale and over long periods of time. Regular counts at seasonal, monthly or weekly intervals are also a rich source of information. ¬© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.","10.1080/03014220909510147","2-s2.0-70249097744",73,0.740304997,0

We report on a co-operative project between Maori landowners, the Department of Conservation, and Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research researchers to restore a Northland kukupa population and to examine kukupa nesting success in relation to pest abundance. Ship rats and possums were targeted by trapping and poisoning throughout Motatau Forest (350 ha) from 1997 to 1999; only possums were targeted in 2000. All 13 kukupa nests located before pest control started in late 1997 failed at the egg stage, but all seven nests located in 1998-99 successfully fledged young when trapping and tracking indices of possums and ship rats were less than 4%. After pest control, counts of kukupa and some other bird species increased at Motatau compared with counts in a nearby non-treatment block, suggesting numbers of adult kukupa can be increased in small forest areas by intensive pest control. This increase is due at least partly to increased nest success. Evidence from time-lapse video cameras, sign remaining at nests, and nest success rates under different pest control regimes suggest both ship rats and possums are important predators at kukupa nests. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",NA,"2-s2.0-4344689239",70,0.736122311,0
"272","bird_australasia","Drivers of waterbird communities and their declines on Yangtze River floodplain lakes","The seasonally flooded Yangtze Valley Floodplain wetlands of China are globally important for wintering waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. These birds have declined in the last 60 years, so understanding factors shaping waterbird distribution and abundance patterns is critical for their conservation. We applied linear mixed models to investigate the effects of climate, winter water area and inundation area (the difference between maximum flooded and winter dry season water area) on waterbird abundance and diversity at 72 lakes in 2005 and 2016. Neither winter water area nor climate featured in the best models, rather inundation area was the key determinant of waterbird abundance and diversity. Future water abstraction and land claim will therefore have greater impacts on waterbird abundance and diversity than likely climate change effects. Significant declines in waterbird abundance and diversity between 2005 and 2016 were not explained by modelled variables and there was no reduction in wetland inundation areas to explain these declines, confirming other factors were responsible. These potentially include declining wetland quality affecting carrying capacity (e.g. flooding phenology, disturbance, habitat loss and degradation, declining water quality caused by eutrophication and pollution) and/or factors limiting migratory waterbird populations at other stages in their life cycle elsewhere. The studied Yangtze lakes are amongst the best for wintering waterbirds and many are protected for their biodiversity, suggesting such protection cannot fully safeguard these internationally shared populations when threatened by other, currently unknown factors. This confirms the urgent need for more research to safeguard these ephemeral lake systems for their global biodiversity significance. ¬© 2017","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.12.029","2-s2.0-85039986278",13,0.735013117,1

Systematic searches were made in four forest patches in Northland where many Brown Kiwi Apteryx mantelli had been fitted with bands, wing tags, transponders or radio-transmitters over a 12-year period of experimental management. The percentage of subadult birds found by dogs increased in line with predictions from population models of the changing age structure of the population. The dogs independently found radio-tagged adults and subadults in close proportion to their known abundance. Dogs proved to be an excellent tool to determine the age structure of a kiwi population. With knowledge of the life history of the species involved, this information was used to make an accurate assessment of the conservation status of the study population of Brown Kiwi in Northland. Our results also support the recent downgrading of Little Spotted Kiwi Apteryx owenii from 'Vulnerable' to 'Near Threatened', which was based partly on healthy age ratios found during dog searches on Kapiti Island, rather than on results from a study of their breeding biology on the island which showed unsustainably low chick recruitment. ¬© 2009 BirdLife International.","10.1017/S0959270908007673","2-s2.0-67749111585",23,0.729905821,0

Ornithologists have reported on wintering waterbirds in the floodplain since the 1950s. However, an integrated analysis of the long-term changes in waterbird diversity is not available. Here, we synthesise existing information on changes in wintering waterbird abundance and distribution in the floodplain, summarise possible influencing factors and propose some priorities for further research. Waterbird richness and abundance have declined over the past 60 years. Declining trends have been observed in a number of areas and species. Nevertheless, a few areas and species showed different trends. In addition, waterbirds have become more concentrated in a few suitable areas such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. Land reclamation, hunting, dam operation and extensive aquaculture are probably the four major threats to wintering waterbirds, while establishment of nature reserves is beneficial to waterbird conservation. Our study suggests that waterbirds in the floodplain are vulnerable, and that effective conservation measures are needed to protect and restore the waterbird diversity of this area.

This is the 1st comprehensive study of the responses of both the kite and introduced carnivores to a rodent outbreak. The 3.5-year study period included a population outbreak of about 24 months duration involving 3 native rodent species. Mammalian predators and kites exhibited similar population responses. Kites immigrated into the area within 6 months of the outbreak commencing, and remained while rodent abundance was high; however, all birds left the area after rodent populations crashed within a 6-week period. Dingoes and foxes were more abundant than cats and both species increased during the outbreak. All carnivores were resident. The letter-winged kite fed almost entirely on rodents. Rodents were the main prey of the 3 mammalian predators during the outbreak; however, all species had intermediate niche breadths. Dietary overlap between the kite and each carnivore was high during the rodent outbreak. During a nonoutbreak period, predation on rodents by the red fox remained high, whereas that by the dingo declined. We estimated the number of average-sized rodents (body mass 32.65 g) eaten daily by a nonreproducing individual to range from 1 (letter-winged kite) to 6 (red fox). We also estimated that the 3 mammalian predators (combined) captured 11 times as many rodents per day as letter-winged kites. There is considerable potential for food-based competition between the kite and introduced mammalian predators, particularly the red fox and house cat, in arid Australia. ¬© 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1644/07-MAMM-A-168R.1","2-s2.0-45249120385",54,0.723016122,1

On Stewart Island, when the abundance of feral cats' primary prey, rats (Rattus spp.), was very low, significantly more cats died or left the study area than when rats were abundant. Cats preferentially preyed on rats regardless of rat abundance. Birds were the main alternative prey but cats did not prey-switch to birds when rat abundance was low, possibly owing to the difficulty of capture, and small mass, of birds compared with rats. On Stewart Island numbers of feral cats are restricted by seasonal depressions in abundance of their primary prey, coupled with limited alternative prey biomass. ¬© CSIRO 2005.","10.1071/WR04057","2-s2.0-28244432802",4,0.719264434,0

Predation rates were examined at two sites, Kakadu National Park (which supported a relatively high density of partridge pigeons) and Berry Springs (which had greater habitat fragmentation and comparatively low partridge pigeon density). The effects of distance from road, understorey structure, topography and nest-microsite concealment on nest predation rates were examined. Artificial-nest predation rates were greater at 150 m from roads than <1 m from the roadside. Predation rates did not vary with understorey structure, topography, or level of nest concealment. There was marked variation between sites, with predation levels at Kakadu more than double those recorded for Berry Springs. Discerning predator identity, or even the size of a predator, from marks left in clay eggs proved difficult and was possible for ‚àº35% of predation events. Of these, 42% of predation events involved predators of a size we considered too small to take a natural partridge pigeon nest. We suggest that extrapolation from artificial to natural ground-nest predation rates be undertaken with caution for landscapes such as Australia's tropical savanna, which supports a high diversity and abundance of small potential predators of artificial nests. There was no evidence of predation by birds, and the methodology proved inadequate for identifying predation by feral cats (Felis catus). ¬© CSIRO 2005.","10.1071/WR04021","2-s2.0-23744476409",77,0.713177154,0

In recent years, these habitats have suffered severe shrinkage as a result of wetland loss and degradation. Identifying critical areas for waterbirds and assessing conservation status has become an urgent priority for biological conservation. Based on the criteria used to designate Ramsar sites and East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) Flyway Network sites, a general framework is proposed and applied to identify priority sites in China's coastal wetlands using a comprehensive waterbird survey dataset. Sites priority were evaluated by using appearance of globally threatened bird species, and bid species exceeding 1% of their global or flyway population, and population abundance. Sites priorities were ranked using an ‚Äúirreplaceability index‚Äù. Totally, 110 sites are proposed as priority sites. Considering the strategic importance of China's coastal wetlands for migratory waterbirds, the conservation status of China's coastal wetlands is inadequate to protect these waterbirds. Currently, 67 of the 110 priority sites lie outside protected areas. Some critical habitats for waterbirds are not included in individual protected areas, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces. Improved protection of these areas is urgently needed. However, conservation efforts in China's coastal wetlands face numerous challenges. Many important intertidal areas are increasingly threatened by ongoing and future reclamation plans. There is an urgent need to re-consider and limit the reclamation, particularly at critical sites, and put in place conservation measures to protect migratory waterbirds and their habitats. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.07.025","2-s2.0-84995639267",68,0.70424514,0

We use extensive abundance data and expected range shifts across altitudinal gradients to predict changes in total population size of rainforest birds of Australian tropical rainforests in response to climate warming. According to our most conservative model scenario, 74% of rainforest birds of north-eastern Australia are predicted to become threatened (including 26 critically endangered species) as a result of projected mid-range warming expected within the next 100 years. Extinction risk varies according to where along the altitudinal gradient a species is currently most abundant. Upland birds are most affected and are likely to be immediately threatened by even small increases in temperature. In contrast, there is a capacity for the population size of lowland species to increase, at least in the short term. We conclude that abundance data collected across climatic gradients will be fundamental to gaining an understanding of population size change associated with climate warming. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we sampled 60 sites in northern Queensland, four times from 2004 to 2008. We investigated how the bird richness and abundance, and species turnover changed over the sample years and how this differed with vegetation structure. The mean abundance per site was highest in 2005 (92.1 ¬± 12.0 individuals ha -1) and lowest in 2008 (46.6¬±3.3), whereas species richness per site was highest in 2004 (19.6 ¬± 0.9 species ha -1) and lowest again in 2008 (14.7¬±0.8). Nine species were most abundant in 2004 coincident with extremely high rainfall preceding the survey in that year. Species turnover increased across all sites from 2004 to 2008 and the abundance of 13 species was best accounted for by differences in vegetation structure. Our study demonstrates that local bird communities in the semi-arid fringe of savannas can change rapidly, and mostly where vegetation is modified. This suggests that increased land-use and climate change in northern Australia could have significant effects on the avifauna over fairly short periods. ¬© 2012 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.","10.1071/MU11054","2-s2.0-84857773948",14,0.669373782,1

Identification and protection of these habitats is essential for the conservation of the birds. The endangered Swift Parrot (Psittacidae:Lathamus discolor) migrates north from Tasmania to south-eastern mainland Australia in search of suitable winter food resources. This 5-year study examines the use of known winter foraging habitats by Swift Parrots on a state-wide scale not previously attempted. Swift Parrots used a diversity of winter foraging habitats in regions of the coast and western slopes of New South Wales each year, including several habitats that occur in endangered ecological communities. The abundance of Swift Parrots in New South Wales fluctuated significantly between years and regions, with coastal areas providing important drought-refuge habitats for a large proportion of the population.

Landscapes containing winter foraging habitat included scattered trees, remnant vegetation and continuous forests, and Swift Parrots foraged extensively on lerp and nectar from a diversity of tree species within these. The occurrence of Swift Parrots at foraging sites was primarily associated with the abundance of lerp, nectar and non-aggressive competitors. ¬© Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2008.","10.1071/MU07033","2-s2.0-40749102906",19,0.663953338,1
"47","bird_australasia","Climatic seasonality, resource bottlenecks, and abundance of rainforest birds: Implications for global climate change","We demonstrate that within-year climatic variability, particularly rainfall seasonality, is the most significant variable explaining spatial patterns of bird abundance in Australian tropical rainforest. The likely mechanism causing this pattern is a resource bottleneck (insects, nectar, and fruit) during the dry season that limits the population size of many species. The patterns support both the diversity-climatic-stability hypothesis and the species-energy hypothesis but clearly show that seasonality in energy availability may be a more significant factor than annual totals or means. An index of dry season severity is proposed that quantifies the combined effect of the degree of dryness and the duration of the dry season. We suggest that the predicted increases in seasonality due to global climate change could produce significant declines in bird abundance, further exacerbating the impacts of decreased range size, increased fragmentation, and decreased population size likely to occur as a result of increasing temperature. We suggest that increasing climatic seasonality due to global climate change has the potential to have significant negative impacts on tropical biodiversity. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00418.x","2-s2.0-37149021964",10,0.659869649,0

An experimental test in New South Wales","From 1993 to 2001, we conducted a series of experiments in a mixed grassland-woodland system in central New South Wales (NSW) to quantify the interactions between red foxes and their prey and competitors. Foxes were removed from two areas around the perimeter of Lake Burrendong, and data were collected from these areas and a nearby untreated area before, during, and after the period of fox control. The arrival of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1996 provided an opportunity to examine the interactive effects of controlling foxes and rabbits. In this landscape, typical of central NSW, (a) the fox population was not affected by a large reduction in the abundance of rabbits, or vice versa; (b) the cat population declined in areas where foxes were removed after the large RHD-induced reduction in rabbit numbers, but there was no consistent response to the removal of foxes; (c) the abundance of some macropod species increased in response only to the combined removal of rabbits and foxes; (d) there were no consistent changes in the abundances of bird species in response to the removal of either foxes or rabbits, but there were clear habitat differences in bird species richness; and (e) there was likely to be an increase in woody plant species after the large reduction in rabbit populations by RHD. We conclude that (a) long-term field experiments (more than 3 years) are required to quantify the indirect consequences of controlling foxes and rabbits, and (b) single manipulations, such as fox control or rabbit control, are not necessarily sufficient for the conservation of remnant woodland communities in southeastern Australia. ¬© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","10.1007/s10021-004-0173-0","2-s2.0-33750273032",21,0.659311436,1

Stoat and ship rat (Rattus rattus) captures were used as a measure of relative abundance over time, and rat and mouse (Mus musculus) abundance was indexed using tracking tunnels between spring 2002 and winter 2004. There were major increases in rat captures in spring of 2002 and again in spring of 2003. Stoat captures peaked in the following summers, as rat captures declined. Rats and invertebrates were major components of stoat diet, occurring in 41% and 52% of guts respectively; birds were found in 19%. Changes in these percentages with time indicated that stoats shifted their diet from rats to birds and invertebrates as rat abundance (as indexed by tracking tunnels) decreased. The greatest impact on native species is therefore likely to be when rat abundance is declining after major irruptions, as the increased consumption of birds and invertebrates overlaps with the periods of highest stoat abundance. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",NA,"2-s2.0-46849112595",8,0.651540198,1
"56","bird_australasia","Setting conservation priorities for migratory networks under uncertainty","Conserving migratory species requires protecting connected habitat along the pathways they travel. Despite recent improvements in tracking animal movements, migratory connectivity remains poorly resolved at a population level for the vast majority of species, thus conservation prioritization is hampered. To address this data limitation, we developed a novel approach to spatial prioritization based on a model of potential connectivity derived from empirical data on species abundance and distance traveled between sites during migration. We applied the approach to migratory shorebirds of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Conservation strategies that prioritized sites based on connectivity and abundance metrics together maintained larger populations of birds than strategies that prioritized sites based only on abundance metrics. The conservation value of a site therefore depended on both its capacity to support migratory animals and its position within the migratory pathway; the loss of crucial sites led to partial or total population collapse. We suggest that conservation approaches that prioritize sites supporting large populations of migrants should, where possible, also include data on the spatial arrangement of sites. ¬© 2016 Society for Conservation Biology","10.1111/cobi.12842","2-s2.0-85011305975",2,0.644726207,0
"61","bird_australasia","Large-scale spatial and temporal dynamics of the vulnerable and highly mobile superb parrot","Aim: To investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the vulnerable and highly mobile superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii) across its range in south-eastern mainland Australia. Location: South-eastern Australia (27¬∞-37¬∞S latitude and 141¬∞-151¬∞E longitude). Methods: We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to model time-specific bird atlas occurrence data against time-specific plant productivity data, plus a range of environmental predictor variables. We then examined the effects of environmental variables on the temporal and spatial patterns of predicted abundance and distribution of the superb parrot using a correlative mapping approach. Results: Key findings from GAM analysis were: (1) there was a strong positive relationship between abundance and plant productivity in all regions, but (2) the response of abundance to other predictor variables often differed between regions. Correlative mapping predictions of the abundance and distribution of the superb parrot also indicated that: (1) predicted abundance varied through time and space, (2) predicted abundance sometimes decreased in all regions, but at other times some regions had high abundance when others had low, and (3) changes in plant productivity (and therefore climate) were associated with this variation. Main conclusion: The superb parrot favours productive landscapes that are also favoured for agriculture. Movements appear to be associated with seasonal and year to year climate variability. Thus, variation in the recorded abundance of the superb parrot may mask population trends, suggesting that existing population estimates are unreliable. Also, high abundances in some areas, and at some times, may reflect deteriorating habitat conditions elsewhere rather than species recovery. Temporal variability in the distribution of the superb parrot makes it difficult to identify specific drought refugia. Consequently, through time, as key habitat continues to deteriorate, the species will become increasingly vulnerable and threatened. Whole-landscape habitat conservation and restoration strategies are therefore needed to sustain superb parrot populations in the long-term. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01603.x","2-s2.0-33846450258",16,0.632853398,1
"64","bird_australasia","Impacts of grazing, selective logging and hyper-aggressors on diurnal bird fauna in intact forest landscapes of the Brigalow Belt, Queensland","The impact of forest management on diurnal bird assemblages and abundance was investigated in contiguous tracts of eucalypt forest in the Brigalow Belt Bioregion, south central Queensland. Sites were located across three levels of livestock grazing intensity and three levels of selective logging intensity within the most extensive habitat type, Corymbia citriodora-dominant forest. We recorded a high rate of incidence and large numbers of the hyper-aggressive noisy miner Manorina melanocephala (Passeriformes: Meliphagidae) at the majority of our survey sites, a phenomenon rarely reported in non-cleared landscapes. As shown by numerous studies in fragmented landscapes, the distribution of this species in our study had a substantial negative effect upon the distribution of small passerine species. Noisy miners exerted the strongest influence upon small passerine abundance, and masked any forest management effects. However, key habitat features important for small passerines were identified, including a relatively high density of large trees and stems in the midstorey. Selective logging appeared to exert a minimal effect upon noisy miner abundance, whereas grazing intensity had a profound, positive influence. Noisy miners were most abundant in intensively grazed forest with minimal midstorey and a low volume of coarse woody debris. Higher road density in the forest landscape also corresponded with increased numbers of noisy miners. Reduction in grazing pressure in Brigalow Belt forests has the potential to benefit small passerine assemblages across large areas through moderating noisy miner abundance. The strong relationship between noisy miners and small passerines suggests that noisy miner abundance could act as an easily measured indicator of forest condition, potentially contributing to monitoring of forest management outcomes. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01979.x","2-s2.0-69549103166",18,0.629720442,0
"74","bird_australasia","Determinants of local abundance in a major radiation of Australian passerines (Aves: Meliphagoidea)","Aim: To identify the factors that contribute to variation in abundance (population density), and to investigate whether habitat breadth and diet breadth predict macroecological patterns in a suborder of passerine birds (Meliphagoidea). Location: Australia (including Tasmania). Methods: Mean abundance data were collated from site surveys of bird abundance (the Australian Bird Count); range size and latitudinal position data from published distribution maps; and body mass and diet breadth information from published accounts. A diversity index of habitats used (habitat breadth) was calculated from the bird census data. We used bivariate correlation and multiple regression techniques, employing two phylogenetic comparative methods: phylogenetic generalized least squares and independent contrasts. Results: Body mass and latitude were the only strong predictors of abundance, with larger-bodied and lower-latitude species existing at lower densities. Together, however, body mass and latitude explained only 11.1% of the variation in mean abundance. Range size and habitat breadth were positively correlated, as were diet breadth and body mass. However, neither range size, nor habitat breadth and diet breadth, explained patterns in abundance either directly or indirectly. Main conclusions: Levels of abundance (population density) in meliphagoid birds are most closely linked to body mass and latitudinal position, but not range size. As with many other macroecological analyses, we find little evidence for aspects of niche breadth having an effect on patterns of abundance. We hypothesize that evolutionary age may also have a determining effect on why species tend to be rarer (less abundant) in the tropics. ¬© 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01432.x","2-s2.0-33645997682",3,0.610155132,0
"77","bird_australasia","Latitudinal gradients in abundance, and the causes of rarity in the tropics: A test using Australian honeyeaters (Aves: Meliphagidae)","Several studies have uncovered interspecific latitudinal gradients in abundance (population density) such that tropical species tend to be, on average, less abundant than species at higher latitudes. The causes of this relationship remain poorly studied, in contrast to the relative wealth of literature examining the relationship to latitude of other variables such as range size and body mass. We used a cross-species phylogenetic comparative approach and a spatial approach to examine three potential determining factors (distribution, reproductive output and climate) that might explain why abundance correlates with latitude, using data from 54 species of honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) in woodland environments in eastern Australia. There is a strong positive correlation between mean abundance and latitude in these birds. Reproductive output (clutch size) was positively linked to both abundance and latitude, but partial correlation analysis revealed that clutch size is not related to abundance once the effects of latitude are removed. A subsequent multiple regression model that also considered range size, clutch size and body mass showed that latitude is the only strong predictor of abundance in honeyeaters. In the separate spatial analysis, the climatic variables that we considered (temperature, rainfall and seasonality) were all strongly linked to latitude, but none served as a better predictor of abundance than latitude per se, either individually or collectively. The most intriguing result of our analyses was that the cross-species latitudinal pattern in abundance was not evident within species. This suggests an intrinsic cause of the pattern of 'rarity in the tropics' in Australian honeyeaters. We suggest that evolutionary age may provide a key to understanding patterns of abundance in these birds. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.","10.1007/s00442-006-0456-6","2-s2.0-33748040772",6,0.590658567,0

In October 2007, we conducted systematic surveys of Lord Howe Island to estimate the abundance and distribution of grey ducks, mallards, and their hybrids. Hybrids were common in areas of high public use, particularly where there was mown or grazed grass. Phenotypic characteristics suggest that mallards are now dominant and have supplanted the native grey duck, with 81% of birds classified as mallard or mallard-like hybrids, 17% as intermediate hybrids and only 2% as grey duck-like hybrids. No pure grey duck were observed. These hybrids pose direct and indirect economic, social and environmental impacts to Lord Howe Island. A management program to remove mallards using trapping, shooting and opportunistic capture by hand was conducted in October 2007. Standardised indices of duck abundance before and after management indicates that the total population was reduced by 71.7%. Eradication of mallard and hybrids from Lord Howe Island is considered achievable with a program of education, monitoring, and continued control to prevent re-establishment. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",NA,"2-s2.0-58149216174",12,0.511806189,0

"114","bird_nearctic","Long-term demography of the Northern Goshawk in a variable environment","The Nearctic northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillis) is a resident of conifer, broadleaf, and mixed forests from the boreal to the southwestern montane regions of North America. We report on a 20-year mark-recapture investigation (1991‚Äì2010) of the distribution and density of breeders, temporal and spatial variability in breeding, nestling sex ratios, local versus immigrant recruitment of breeders, breeding age structure, age-specific survival rates, and rate of population change (Œª) of this species on the Kaibab Plateau, a forested sky island in northern Arizona, USA. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of annual fluctuations in precipitation on the annual frequency of goshawk breeding and fledgling production. We studied 125 goshawk breeding territories, representing approximately 87% of an estimated 144 total territories based on a mean distance of 3.8 km between territory centers in a 1,728-km2 study area. The salient demographic feature of the population was extensive annual variation in breeding, which manifested as large inter-annual variation in proportions of pairs laying eggs, brood sizes, nest failure rates, and fledgling production. The percent of territories known in a prior year in which eggs were laid in a current year ranged from 8% to 86% (x = 37%, SE = 4.51), annual mean nest failure rate (active nests that failed) ranged from 12% to 48% (overall (x) = 23%, SE = 2.48), and mean annual brood size of successful nests (fledged ‚â•1 fledgling) ranged from 1.5 young to 2.5 young (overall x = 2.0 young, SE = 0.03). Inter-annual variation in reproduction closely tracked inter-annual variation in precipitation, which we hypothesize influenced primary forest productivity and bird and mammal prey abundance. The best breeding years (1992‚Äì1993, 77‚Äì87% of pairs laid eggs) were coincident with a record-long El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) wet period and the worst breeding year (2003; 8% of pairs laid eggs) was the last of a 3-year record drought. Overall breeding success was 83% with most failures occurring during incubation; once eggs hatched, goshawks tended to fledge young. The pooled 20-year nestling sex ratio did not differ from unity (53% M; n = 410 M, 366 F) but was significantly male-biased in 2 years and female-biased in 1 year. Nonetheless, the overall greater production of male fledglings followed a strong trend of greater male production in other goshawk populations, suggesting that breeders might have been adaptively adjusting their offspring sex ratio, perhaps to produce more of the rarer (male) sex. Annual recruitment of new individuals into the breeding population averaged 43% during the study. Study area recruitment rate of hawks locally born (in situ) and banded was 0.12. Both sexes had equal tendencies to return to the Kaibab Plateau to breed (no differences in philopatry) and there were no differences in natal dispersal distances (natal to first breeding site) between the sexes. During the final years of study (1999‚Äì2010), an estimated 46% of breeding recruits were locally born and 54% were immigrants from distant forests. Minimum age at first breeding was 2 years and mean age at first breeding by known-age hawks (banded as nestlings or aged on plumage at first breeding) was 3.7 years for males and 3.5 years for females. Mean lifespan (yr from first banding as nestling to last resighting) of known-age goshawks was 6.9 years for both sexes. Mean minimum apparent lifespan of breeders aged ‚â•4 years based on plumage at first capture was 6.5 years for both sexes. Average age of goshawks at their first detection was 3.9 years old, at which time apparent survival was estimated at 0.77 for both sexes, which was just slightly less than the peak survival of 0.78 as a function of age. Age-specific survival estimates showed a steady decline after 9 years old and approached 0 at 20 years of age. Estimates of Œª for breeding adults (M, 0.94, SE = 0.037; F, 0.98, SE = 0.038) provided only weak evidence for a population decline during the study. Although sex was not in the top survival model, models including age + sex were competitive, evidencing lower male than female survival, a finding corroborated by the occurrence of sex effects in the top Œª model. Lower male survival may result from higher mortality associated with hunting agile prey in vegetation-filled environments during long breeding seasons when they are the primary forager. Lower survival may be compensated by the more frequent production (53%) of male fledglings. High-severity crown fire was an existential threat to the population. In addition to 4 large high-severity fires that burned roughly 3,770 ha (equal to 3 goshawk territories) in the 30 years preceding 1991, 6 high-severity fires burned another 30,945 ha during our study and killed most (&gt;64%) of the forests in 8 known territories and possibly another 2 that were burned before we completed surveys. Based on a lack of any recent demographic perturbations in age structure, a relatively high and time-constant annual adult survival rate, confidence intervals around adult Œª estimates overlapping 1.0, and a study area saturated with territories, we surmise that the goshawk population on the Kaibab Plateau was stable during the 20-year study. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains regarding the population's future status because of a declining trend in breeding frequency, uncertain status (dead, alive, emigrated) of non-breeding adults, extensive temporal and spatial variation in breeding, and high frequency of immigrant recruits to the breeding population on the Kaibab Plateau. If the century-long decline in precipitation persists, especially at the increased rate seen since 1980, and manifests as deeper droughts, diminished wet periods, and weaker pulses in forest productivity, then the Kaibab Plateau goshawk population would be expected to show unambiguous evidence of decline. Evidence would include reduced local and regional goshawk reproduction and survival, reduced frequency of immigration, and further habitat loss to catastrophic fire. ¬© 2017 The Wildlife Society. ¬© The Wildlife Society, 2017","10.1002/wmon.1023","2-s2.0-85018347937",43,0.929213176,1

In this study, long-term data are presented on the occurrence of shorebirds at one such site on the coast of the state of Sergipe in northeastem Brazil. A 5-km long stretch of Atalaia Beach was surveyed each month between July 2003 and May 2006 (1-6 surveys per month, total = 101). The surveys resulted in records of three resident shorebird species (Vanellus chilensis, Charadrius collaris and Charadrius wilsonia) and ten Nearctic migrants (Charadriidae and Scolopacidae). The local abundance of these migrants followed a predictable pattern, with the main influx starting at the end of September, during the boreal autumn (with Charadrius semipalmatus arriving slightly earlier). The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and the Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) were the most abundant species throughout the study period, peaking at 1200 and 700 birds, respectively, in November-February. Some sanderlings (Calidris alba). Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), and Semipalmated plovers (C. semipalmatus) almost certainly overwinter at the site, and remained in the study area throughout the year, whereas the bimodal distribution of the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) indicates the use of the beach as a stopover during migration to wintering sites further south. Whilst more species were recorded during the first year, counts were lower than in subsequent years, possibly reflecting natural fluctuations in abundance or migration patterns. Overall, the data indicate that the site may be an important stopover or wintering site for populations of at least five species of Nearctic migrants, while it may be visited periodically by a number of other species. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",NA,"2-s2.0-79952126419",11,0.857401897,1

Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ¬± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ¬± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ¬± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ¬± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ¬± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ¬± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ¬± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ¬± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6. Additional data from multiple species, especially measures of habitat-specific demography and dispersal, will improve our understanding of the relative impacts of the breeding, migratory, and winter periods on population dynamics of migratory birds and thus enhance future conservation efforts.","10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00599.x","2-s2.0-0036107393",30,0.84251267,0

The Avanersuaq District in northwest Greenland is home to an assemblage of waterfowl from both geographic areas; however, minimal historic or current information is available on species abundance. In 2008 and 2009, we conducted field surveys in Greenland from 76.00¬∞ to 77.35¬∞N for breeding and non-breeding waterfowl and have collected anecdotal field notes of avian observations over a 20-year period (1993-2012). During these periods, we documented the first observation of a Ross's goose (Chen rossii) and the first confirmed breeding by lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in Greenland. Northern pintails (Anas acuta) were observed for the first time in northwest Greenland, and a previously unknown breeding location for brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) was also identified. Local populations of greater snow (C. c.) and Canada geese (B. canadensis) have increased in size. The Booth Sound and Drown Bay wetland areas and many islands throughout the Avanersuaq District were identified as critical habitat for both breeding and non-breeding waterfowl. Further increases in waterfowl abundance, including more frequent rare and new visitors, are likely in the study area as breeding populations further south continue to increase and an ameliorating climate allows for a longer breeding season. These results will prove useful as a baseline for comparisons with future surveys. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-014-1520-z","2-s2.0-84905243565",6,0.819291984,1
"63","bird_nearctic","Habitat quality and habitat selection of golden-winged warblers in Costa Rica: An application of hierarchical models for open populations","Identifying high-quality habitat is integral to effective species conservation efforts and requires information about habitat-specific abundance and demographics. This information is lacking for many species of conservation concern because of the inherent difficulties associated with implementing mark-recapture studies at large spatial scales. The golden-winged warbler Vermivora chrysoptera is a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird experiencing a long-term population decline; yet no information about non-breeding season habitat quality or habitat selection exists to inform conservation efforts. We used a novel hierarchical model that requires only spatially and temporally replicated count data to estimate habitat-specific abundance, apparent survival, recruitment and detection probability of golden-winged warblers wintering in Costa Rica. We quantified habitat selection at the home-range level using radiotelemetry. Golden-winged warblers were absent from tropical dry forest and were most abundant in premontane evergreen forest. Within their home ranges, golden-winged warblers selected microhabitat features associated with intermediate disturbance that reflected their preference for foraging in hanging dead leaves. Consistent with other evidence of a declining population, local population size decreased over the duration of the study. The rate of decrease was higher during the non-breeding season than among seasons. We found no differences in apparent survival or recruitment among habitat types; however, our estimates of these parameters were imprecise. Synthesis and applications. Golden-winged warblers are forest-dependent species during the non-breeding season and have specialized microhabitat requirements that make them vulnerable to ongoing tropical deforestation. However, advanced secondary forests can provide the requisite microhabitat features, and because we found no evidence of reduced survival in this habitat type, regenerating forest on degraded lands may be an effective component of a conservation strategy for this species. Our study also demonstrates that information on population dynamics and habitat quality can be obtained using repeated counts instead of mark-recapture methods. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

Compared to other sites within the region, this area showed high species richness, reflected by a total of 22 species recorded within a relatively short time frame. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by the use of estuarine mudflats and oceanic sandy beaches as feeding habitats. During low tide, more species used estuarine environments, achieving the highest total densities. Abundance patterns and assemblage composition also changed seasonally. Maximum total abundance occurred during the austral summer, and minimum total abundance during the austral winter. During the austral summer, the assemblage was dominated by Nearctic migrants such as American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica) and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). In addition, Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus) and American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) were abundant during the austral autumn. The Red Knot (Calidris canutus), a shorebird that dominated the austral autumn assemblage 25 years ago, was recorded in relatively small numbers during this study, probably reflecting the global population trend of a subspecies of the Red Knot (C. c. rufa) in the past two decades. During the austral winter, resident birds largely dominated the assemblage. However, it is noteworthy that some individuals of nine Nearctic migrant species remained in the area.

We analyzed stable hydrogen isotopic compositions in tail feathers (Œ¥Dw) collected from 26 sites in 11 countries throughout the wintering range of the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), a Nearctic- Neotropical migratory passerine bird. Feathers were assumed to have molted on the breeding grounds, and Œ¥Dw was used to estimate breeding origin. Values of Œ¥Dw were highly correlated with longitude of sampling location, indicating that breeding populations were generally distributed along the east-west axis of the wintering grounds. Within the Caribbean region, Florida, and Bahamas, Œ¥Dw values were negatively correlated with winter latitude, which suggests that American Redstarts exhibit a pattern of chain migration in which individuals wintering at northern latitudes are also the most northern breeders. To identify the most probable breeding regions, we used a likelihood-assignment test incorporated with a prior probability of breeding abundance using Bayes's rule. Expected Œ¥D values of feathers from five breeding regions were based on interpolated Œ¥D values from a model of continent-wide growing-season Œ¥D values in precipitation (Œ¥Dp) and were adjusted to account for a discrimination factor between precipitation and feathers. At most wintering locations, breeding assignments were significantly different from expected frequencies based on relative breeding abundance. Birds wintering in eastern and western Mexico had a high probability of breeding in northwest and midwest North America, whereas birds in the Greater and Lesser Antilles were likely to have originated from breeding regions in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Migratory connectivity, such as we report here, implies that the dynamics of breeding and nonbreeding populations may be linked at a regional scale. These results provide a key opportunity for studying the year-round ecology and evolution of spatially connected populations in a migratory species. ¬© The American Ornithologists' Union 2006.","10.1642/0078-6594(2006)61[14:MCOAWD]2.0.CO;2","2-s2.0-67449166603",14,0.735613152,0
"93","bird_nearctic","Use of semi-intensive shrimp farms as alternative foraging areas by migratory shorebird populations in tropical areas","Evaluating the ability of anthropogenic habitats to serve as surrogates for natural habitats is an increasingly relevant issue in conservation biology. This issue is especially urgent in tropical coastal wetlands that support large concentrations of migratory shorebird populations and are under pressure from development. Here we evaluated the species composition, abundance, and habitat use of Nearctic migratory shorebirds using recently harvested aquaculture ponds during two non-breeding seasons at shrimp farms surrounding Bah√≠a Santa Mar√≠a (BSM), northwestern Mexico. We also estimated shorebird densities at intertidal units in BSM during and after the harvesting season to explore the connectivity with shrimp farms. Over 25,000 individuals of 25 shorebird species used the surveyed farms (1/413% of shrimp-farm development in BSM; 2014-2015: 10 farms, 994 ha; 2015-2016: 8 farms, 924 ha) during the harvest season. The most abundant species were: Western Sandpiper Calidris mauri, Willet Tringa semipalmata, Marbled Godwit Limosa fedoa, dowitchers Limnodromus spp., Black-necked Stilt Himantopus mexicanus and American Avocet Recurvirostra americana. Numbers of birds decreased as the harvest cycle progressed. Most birds (> 70%) were foraging on the ponds, regardless of tidal stage, while numbers increased during high tide for the most abundant species. At surveyed intertidal areas, shorebird densities were overall similar within and between non-breeding seasons. These results indicate that shrimp farms offer ephemeral but consistent foraging habitats used by non-breeding shorebirds, even in vast coastal wetlands offering a high availability of natural intertidal mudflats. Assuming a similar shorebird use in other shrimp ponds not surveyed within BSM, a significant proportion (> 1% of the biogeographic population) of Willet, Marbled Godwit, and Western Sandpiper, as well as imperilled Red Knot Calidris canutus, might use shrimp farms throughout the harvesting season. Before including current semi-intensive shrimp farms within management plans of BSM, further research is mandatory to assess their utility as alternative foraging habitats for shorebird conservation at tropical areas.

"102","bird_nearctic","Experimentally reducing neighbor density affects reproduction and behavior of a migratory songbird","Because populations of territorial birds are relatively stable compared to those of other animal taxa, they are often considered to be tightly regulated. However, the mechanisms that produce density-dependent feedbacks on demographic rates and thus regulate these populations are poorly understood, particularly for migratory species. We conducted a three-year density-reduction experiment to investigate the behavioral mechanisms that regulate the abundance of a Nearctic-Neotropical migrant passerine, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), during the breeding season. We found that the number of young fledged per territory, territory size, and the proportion of time males spent foraging were significantly greater on territories around which neighbor density was experimentally reduced compared to control territories. Territory quality, proportion of nests depredated per territory, and male countersinging rates were not statistically different between treatments. These results indicate that individuals with more neighbors (i.e., in neighborhoods with greater conspecific density) have reduced breeding productivity. The results also suggest that a crowding mechanism that mediates interactions among territory-holders could generate the density dependence needed to regulate local abundance, at least in areas of homogeneous, high-quality habitat. The effect of the neighbor-density reduction on warbler fecundity and behavior varied with annual fluctuations in weather and food availability, and was strongest in 1997, an El Ni√±o year, when conditions for breeding were least favorable. This variation in our experimental results among years implies that density dependence due to crowding may have its strongest impact on local abundance when environmental conditions are relatively poor.","10.1890/03-0272","2-s2.0-5344234508",9,0.723639417,0

This study evaluated the hypothesis that fragments of mature forest in a managed-forest landscape in southern New Brunswick were suboptimal habitat for Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) compared to large tracts of similar forest. There were no significant differences in pairing success or territorial density of male Ovenbirds between fragments and contiguous forest sites in 1992 and 1993. However, when only smallest fragments were considered mating success and density were lower but differences were not significant. Potential food abundance for Ovenbirds did not differ between fragment and large forest sites, nor between mated and unmated male territories. This study suggests that fragmentation of mature forest in a largely forested landscape may not cause the adverse effects reported for Ovenbirds elsewhere.",NA,"2-s2.0-0030299380",39,0.702939754,1
"123","bird_nearctic","Seasonal abundance of migrant birds and food resources in panamanian mangrove forests","We studied temporal variation in abundance of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants, particularly the Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea), and American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) in two black mangrove sites of central Panama from September 1993 through May 1995. The two sites, on the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts, differ importantly in annual rainfall, tide amplitude, and seasonal invertebrate abundance. Most migrant species varied temporally in abundance with the opposite pattern at each site, suggesting mid-winter movements correlated with abundance of food resources. Because of their wide geographic distribution and their particular response to hydrographic factors, mangroves are likely to have a temporally complementary role in sustaining migrant populations throughout the Neptropics. However, variations in migrant numbers reported in other Neotropical habitats could also reflect large-scale movements by migrants. Occurrence of mid-winter (facultative) migration has been documented mostly for the Palearctic-African migratory system, and needs to be investigated in the Nearctic-Neotropical realm for proper conservation of migratory species.",NA,"2-s2.0-0030449631",2,0.694401608,1
"133","bird_nearctic","North American Brant: Effects of changes in habitat and climate on population dynamics","We describe the importance of key habitats used by four nesting populations of nearctic brant (Branta bernicla) and discuss the potential relationship between changes in these habitats and population dynamics of brant. Nearctic brant, in contrast to most geese, rely on marine habitats and native intertidal plants during the non-breeding season, particularly the seagrass, Zostera, and the macroalgae, Ulva. Atlantic and Eastern High Arctic brant have experienced the greatest degradation of their winter habitats (northeastern United States and Ireland, respectively) and have also shown the most plasticity in feeding behavior. Black and Western High Arctic brant of the Pacific Flyway are the most dependent on Zostera, and are undergoing a shift in winter distribution that is likely related to climate change and its associated effects on Zostera dynamics. Variation in breeding propensity of Black Brant associated with winter location and climate strongly suggests that food abundance on the wintering grounds directly affects reproductive performance in these geese. In summer, salt marshes, especially those containing Carex and Puccinellia, are key habitats for raising young, while lake shorelines with fine freshwater grasses and sedges are important for molting birds. Availability and abundance of salt marshes has a direct effect on growth and recruitment of goslings and ultimately, plays an important role in regulating size of local brant populations. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00942.x","2-s2.0-20844434333",10,0.693381625,0

The fate of migratory birds has been a concern stimulating research over the past 40 years in response to population declines documented in long-term studies including those of the IITF and collaborators in Puerto Rico's Gu√°nica dry forest. Various studies indicate that in addition to forest loss or fragmentation, some migrant declines may be due to rainfall variation, the consequences of which may carry over from one stage of a migrant's annual cycle to another. For example, the Gu√°nica studies indicate that rainfall extremes on either the temperate breeding or tropical wintering grounds affect migrant abundance and survival differently depending on the species. In contrast, IITF's collaborative studies of the migrant Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) in the Bahamas found that late winter droughts affect its annual survival and breeding success in Michigan. We review these IITF migrant studies and relate them to other studies, which have improved our understanding of migrant ecology of relevance to conservation. Particularly important is the advent of the full annual cycle (FAC) approach. The FAC will facilitate future identification and mitigation of limiting factors contributing to migrant population declines, which for some species, may be exacerbated by global climate change. ¬© 2017 by the authors.","10.3390/f8040115","2-s2.0-85017371653",24,0.684734863,1

Food availability has been considered one of the most important factors limiting bird populations, yet the effects of food abundance on non-breeding insectivores has rarely been investigated. We studied the effects of food abundance on the body condition of ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus L.), a sexually monomorphic, ground-foraging, Neotropical-Nearctic migrant warbler during two winters in three habitats on their wintering grounds in Jamaica. 2. Prey biomass decreased from early to late winter in all habitats. Concurrently, ovenbird body mass, corrected for differences in structural size, decreased significantly in five of six habitat-year combinations. Only in second growth scrub habitat in the 1995-96 winter did ovenbirds show no decrease in corrected body mass, and during this period there was no significant decrease in ant biomass, the dominant prey item of ovenbirds in all habitats. 3. Significant positive correlations were found between ovenbirds' rate of feather regrowth and the biomass of ants on their home ranges in early winter, and between overwinter change in ovenbird body mass and the biomass of ants on their home ranges in late winter. 4. The results of both the habitat- and home-range-based analyses suggest a similar threshold of ant biomass (2.5-3.0 mg m-2), below which ovenbirds did not maintain their body mass. 5. The results suggest that late winter rainfall mediates the biomass of prey abundance, which in turn affects the ovenbirds' overwinter body condition.","10.1046/j.1365-2656.2000.00447.x","2-s2.0-0033799710",12,0.684104065,0

We evaluated non-breeding shorebird distribution and abundance patterns along the Buenos Aires coastal zone and determined shorebird use of different coastal landscapes. Surveys were conducted in December 2000, and January and February 2001, using line-transect methods. The data were classified based on five previously defined coastal landscapes. Fifty four localities were surveyed covering 93 kilometers of coastline. A total of 44 waterbird species corresponding to 13 families were recorded. Shorebirds (Scolopacidae, Charadriidae, Haematopodidae and Recurvirostridae) accounted for approximately 45% of recorded waterbirds, including 14 nearctic species. Shorebird species recorded per locality varied from one to eleven, with 61% of the localities having one to four species. The most common were the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis), Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus), American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica) and the Sanderling (Calidris alba). Shorebird species richness and abundance varied significantly among coastal landscapes, with the highest values recorded in estuarine saltmarshes of Bah√≠a Samboromb√≥n and Bah√≠a Blanca. Among marine landscapes, the highest abundance and number of species were recorded in sandy beaches with ""restinga"" patches. This study confirms that shorebirds are an important component of the birdlife in the Buenos Aires coastal zone during the austral summer months, and that their distribution is not homogeneous along the coast, with species richness and abundances varying among localities depending on coastal landscapes.","10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[381:DAAONS]2.0.CO;2","2-s2.0-33749425422",31,0.668125125,0
"173","bird_nearctic","Winter habitat quality, population limitation, and conservation of neotropical-nearctic migrant birds","Recent declines in Neotropical-Nearctic migrant songbird populations are often attributed to events during the nonbreeding season, such as tropical habitat conversion and drought. Support for this hypothesis in most species, however, is largely anecdotal or conjectural. There is a dearth of demographic information about migrants on their Neotropical winter grounds. Such data are needed to identify specific ecological factors influencing survival, dispersal, and, ultimately, population abundances aggregated over multiple habitats at regional spatial scales. In this paper, we review several lines of evidence, emphasizing results of our research on paruline warblers in Jamaica, which indicate that migrant passerines often compete intraspecifically in winter for preferred quality habitats and that their populations may be limited at least in part by ecological conditions in winter. The demographic and ecological evidence supporting this hypothesis for migrant passerines includes: (1) differing densities among habitats, suggesting variation in habitat suitability; (2) strong territoriality, site attachment, and site fidelity; (3) experimental demonstrations of habitat saturation; (4) nonrandom distributions of sex and age classes among habitats; (5) overwinter decline of body mass by individuals occupying the most drought-stressed habitats; and (6) different residence times among habitats, suggesting differences in survival or dispersal. We review ecological and behavioral explanations for these demographic patterns, and make conservation recommendations based on our understanding of how local demographic circumstances affect broader scale population processes.","10.2307/2265652","2-s2.0-0030417218",17,0.659641336,0

We studied these issues on intertidal flats of Ba√≠a de Todos os Santos (Bahia), the second largest bay in Brazil. During a full year cycle we carried out weekly bird counts in an intertidal area of 280 ha divided in sectors, where we also measured environmental parameters. The analyses of weekly counts resulted in a detailed phenology of use of the area by shorebirds. Five species were resident and ten were Nearctic migrants. Several of the latter had clear peaks in numbers in March and October, revealing the use of the bay as a stopover during both the north-bound and south-bound migration flows. A canonical correspondence analysis of the relationship between environmental parameters and bird numbers indicated that the foraging bird assemblage could be divided into five main groups, occupying distinct ecological gradients in the study area. The most important factors driving this structure were invertebrate prey abundance, percentage of fine sediments, area of mangrove cover and distance to channels. Our findings imply that maintenance of the diversity of intertidal habitats in this bay is crucial to satisfy the particular habitat requirements of resident and migrant shorebirds using the northeastern coastal regions of Brazil. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.001","2-s2.0-84655169241",25,0.641394631,0

The strategic location of the Sierra suggests that other South American wintering migrants may stopover there, but no information is available on the migrant community during spring or how they distribute themselves between habitats and across the broad elevational gradient. Here, we present species richness and densities of migratory landbirds obtained through standardized census and captures along an elevation gradient (100-2,100 m) covering two habitats, forest and shade coffee, during two consecutive spring migrations. The migrant community (~39 species) showed a peak in species richness and abundance at mid elevations (700-1,700 m), mirroring the pattern often observed in communities of resident Neotropical birds. However, individually the abundance of the commonest species peaked at different elevations and showed high annual variability. We also found within-species differences in density between shade-coffee and forest at the same elevation, possibly reflecting differences in habitat quality for some species. Factors such as food availability and predation risk are expected to be critical in shaping the distribution of migrants during stopover, and further research is required to identify the drivers of the observed elevational patterns. This study contributes to our knowledge of the life histories of migrants during stopover and highlights the habitats and elevations where conservation measures would protect the highest number of species and individuals at a South American stopover site. ¬© 2015 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.","10.1676/14-017.1","2-s2.0-84925016635",13,0.637205206,0

During the course of floral and faunal inventories in a proposed Multiple Use Area in this region from 1987 through 1991, FIIT researchers collected or observed 254 avian species, of which 44 are regarded as Nearctic migrants and 26 are known or suspected to have both resident and long-distance migrant populations. Study sites included climax and selectively logged lower montane forest fragments, as well as subtropical agroecosystems. Data are presented to support the conclusion that a significantly higher percentage of resident avian species reported from this region in the literature continue to occupy these habitats than do species known to undertake cyclical longdistance migrations. Non-quantitative, historical reports of relative abundance of all Nearctic avian migrants in the region during the early and mid-twentieth century are compared with current status of these species. Threats to Nearctic avian migrants in the western Guatemalan highlands are discussed, and areas of future research for ornithologists working with this community in the region are proposed.

"215","bird_nearctic","Optimal conservation of migratory species","Background. Migratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea-regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range. Conclusions/Significance. We demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms. ¬© 2007 Martin et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0000751","2-s2.0-40749094008",28,0.631360257,0
"223","bird_nearctic","Avian response to timber harvesting applied experimentally to manage Cerulean Warbler breeding populations","Timber harvesting has been proposed as a management tool to enhance breeding habitat for the Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea), a declining Neotropical-Nearctic migratory songbird that nests in the canopy of mature eastern deciduous forests. To evaluate how this single-species management focus might fit within an ecologically based management approach for multiple forest birds, we performed a manipulative experiment using four treatments (three intensities of timber harvests and an unharvested control) at each of seven study areas within the core Cerulean Warbler breeding range. We collected pre-harvest (one year) and post-harvest (four years) data on the territory density of Cerulean Warblers and six additional focal species, avian community relative abundance, and several key habitat variables. We evaluated the avian and habitat responses across the 3-32m2ha-1 residual basal area (RBA) range of the treatments. Cerulean Warbler territory density peaked with medium RBA (~16m2ha-1). In contrast, territory densities of the other focal species were negatively related to RBA (e.g., Hooded Warbler [Setophaga citrina]), were positively related to RBA (e.g., Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]), or were not sensitive to this measure (Scarlet Tanager [Piranga olivacea]). Some species (e.g., Hooded Warbler) increased with time post-treatment and were likely tied to a developing understory, whereas declines (e.g., Ovenbird) were immediate. Relative abundance responses of additional species were consistent with the territory density responses of the focal species. Across the RBA gradient, greatest separation in the avian community was between early successional forest species (e.g., Yellow-breasted Chat [Icteria virens]) and closed-canopy mature forest species (e.g., Ovenbird), with the Cerulean Warbler and other species located intermediate to these two extremes. Overall, our results suggest that harvests within 10-20m2ha-1 RBA yield the largest increases in Cerulean Warblers, benefit additional disturbance-dependent species, and may retain closed-canopy species but at reduced levels. Harvests outside the optimum RBA range for Cerulean Warblers can support bird assemblages specifically associated with early or late (closed-canopy) successional stages. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2013.07.037","2-s2.0-84899053373",7,0.620047639,1

Using three canopy towers located in primary terra firme forests, I conducted 117 censuses over a 13 month period, recording 160 bird species. The three study sites had similar species richness (between 126 and 128 species), sharing 95 species in common, which accounted for >90% of all individual records. Most species recorded in the canopy (110) belonged to the core canopy avifauna. The other 50 species included migrants (13), species that feed overhead (8), species from lower strata (15), night birds (3), and vagrants or visitors from open areas and second-growth forests (11). Most of those species, however, appeared in very low numbers in the forest canopy, except understory frugivores, which regularly fed on canopy fruits. Among the migratory species were some Nearctic (6), Austral (3), and species probably holding both migratory and resident populations in the area (4). Additionally, I found evidence that two species of parrots perform seasonal movements, leaving the forest canopy around Manaus during the dry season. Frugivores dominated the canopy avifauna in abundance, but contradicting results reported from other Neotropical forest canopies, insectivores and frugivores had equal species richness. The canopy avifauna was highly homogeneous among sites in terms of species richness, distribution among abundance classes, and number of species in each feeding guild, habitat, and microhabitat. As in Costa Rica, the canopy avifauna of Manaus was mostly composed by typical canopy bird species, and not by edge-living species as reported from Panama. I suggest that habitat fragmentation may affect the bird community composition in the forest canopy, allowing a higher influx of opportunistic species.",NA,"2-s2.0-1242310487",23,0.617967752,1
"243","bird_nearctic","Coding sequence polymorphism in avian mitochondrial genomes reflects population histories","Nucleotide sequence diversity at mitochondrial protein-coding loci from 72 species of birds from different geographical regions was analysed in order to test the hypothesis that temperate zone species show population genetic effects of past glaciation. Temperate zone species showed reduced nucleotide diversity in comparison to tropical mainland species, suggesting that the latter have long-term effective population sizes due to population bottleneck effects during the most recent glaciation. This hypothesis was further supported by evidence of an unusually high estimated rate of population growth in species breeding in North America and wintering in the New World tropics (Nearctic migrants), consistent with population expansion after a bottleneck. Nearctic migrants also showed evidence of an abundance of rare nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) polymorphisms, a pattern suggesting that slightly deleterious polymorphisms drifted to high frequencies during a bottleneck and are now being eliminated by selection. Because the shape of the North American land mass limited the area available for refugia during glaciation, the bottleneck effects are predicted to have been particularly strong in Nearctic migrants, and this prediction was supported. The reduced genetic diversity of Nearctic migrants provides an additional basis for concern for the survival of these species, which are threatened by loss of habitat in the winter range and by introduced disease. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03242.x","2-s2.0-33947507808",8,0.615138295,0

The purpose of this study was to assess the geographic pattern in the abundance, species richness, and importance of different migration patterns of the boreal forest avifauna of Eurasia from Europe to East Asia as well as their relationship to climate and forest productivity. We further examine data from two widely separated sites in the New World to see how these conform to the patterns found in the Eurasian system. Location: Boreal forest sites in Russia and Canada. Methods: Point counts were conducted in two to four boreal forest habitats at each of 14 sites in the Russian boreal forest from near to the Finnish border to the Far East, as well as at two sites in boreal Canada. We examined the abundance and species richness of all birds, and specific migratory classes, against four gradients (climate, primary productivity, latitude, and longitude). We tested for spatial autocorrelation in both dependent and independent variables using Moran's I to develop spatial correlograms. For each migratory class we used maximum likelihood to fit models, first assuming uncorrelated residuals and then assuming spatially autocorrelated residuals. For models assuming unstructured residuals we again generated correlograms on model residuals to determine whether model fitting removed spatial autocorrelation. Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion, adjusted for small sample size. Results: Overall abundance was highest at the eastern and western extremes of the survey region and lowest at the continent centre, whereas the abundance of tropical and short-distance migrants displayed an east-west gradient, with tropical migrants increasing in abundance in the east (and south), and short-distance migrants in the west. Although overall species richness showed no geographic pattern, richness within migratory classes showed patterns weaker than, but similar to, their abundance patterns described above. Overall abundance was correlated with climate variables that relate to continentality. The abundances of birds within different migration strategies were correlated with a second climatic gradient - increasing precipitation from west to east. Models using descriptors of location generally had greater explanatory value for the abundance and species-richness response variables than did those based on climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Main conclusions: The distribution patterns for migrant types were related to both climatic and locational variables, and thus the patterns could be explained by either climatic regime or the accessibility of winter habitats, both historically and currently.

Declines in black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) populations result in loss of habitat for birds and other species associated with their colonies. We measured abundance, diversity, and species composition of avian communities on prairie dog colonies and noncolony sites in the Texas Panhandle. More resident species (P < 0.001) occurred on prairie dog colonies than on noncolony areas whereas, more nearctic-neoptropical migrants (P = 0.003) and nearctic-temperate migrants (P < 0.001) occurred on noncolony sites. Total avian abundance was greater (P < 0.001) on noncolony sites than at prairie dog colonies, and differed by season (P < 0.001). Barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), and chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina) were more abundant on noncolony sites than on prairie dog colonies. Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), Cassin's sparrow (Peucaea cassinnii), and lark bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys) abundances were greater on prairie dog colonies.

Outcomes of this intersexual competition can vary by species and habitat, but information has been collected for only a small subset of migrant species. We investigated the available food resources, sex ratios, and body condition of territorial Bicknell's Thrushes (Catharus bicknelli) wintering in the Dominican Republic between 1999 and 2008 at two ecologically distinct wet-forest sites, one in high-elevation cloud forest and the other in mid-elevation rainforest. Arthropod abundance was greater in cloud forest habitat, which was occupied by proportionally more males, the larger-bodied sex (74% male). By contrast, both sexes occurred at parity in rainforest habitat (53% male), where soft-bodied fruit was the predominant dietary resource. Body condition of cloud forest males was comparable to that of rainforest males, but cloud forest females were in poorer body condition than rainforest females. Females at the cloud forest site may face a greater likelihood of agonistic interactions with larger-bodied males and the thermoregulatory demands of roosting in colder night temperatures (0-12¬∞C). We suggest that there are sex-specific advantages of wintering in these two habitats and that both are critical to supporting the full demographic structure of Bicknell's Thrush populations. Rainforest habitats, which are highly vulnerable to agricultural development in the Dominican Republic, may be particularly important to female survival during the winter period. ¬© The American Ornithologists' Union, 2012.","10.1525/auk.2012.12043","2-s2.0-84978974485",22,0.574590996,1

The main purpose of this paper was to advance into the knowledge of the ecological features that allow those species to survive in urban environments and to identify which sets of characters enhance the risk of local extinction. Location: Puebla-Cholula Conurbation (PCC), in M√©xico, a developing country between the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions. Methods: First, 355 qualitative point counts (Echantillonnage Frecuentiels Progressifs) were performed in 21 green areas of the PCC to determine the regional distribution and local abundance of 51 species. Then, groups of species were formed through multivariate cluster analysis as a function of their similarity in distribution and abundance. Finally, bird species were characterized (body length, body mass, type of diet and migration status) and multivariate clusters were analyzed to look for differences between groups (through Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA), and also with the avifauna from evergreen oak forest communities described in the literature. Results: Regional distribution of great-tailed grackle, house finch and house sparrow were maximal, since they were found in all the 21 study areas; local abundances of these species, plus those of inca dove and rock dove, were also high (incidence > 50 %). Regional distribution of seven species (like acorn woodpecker, townsend's warbler or rose-breasted grosbeak) was minimal, since they were located in just one site; and six species exhibited very low local abundances (incidence < 5 %). Cluster analysis formed 3 groups. The abovementioned 5 species with the largest distribution and abundance were included in Group #1, typically urban: thus, the most common species, urban exploiters, were mainly granivorous, resident and had a body size larger than all the remaining species. Urban avoiders (Group #3: ""rare"" species, with a small regional distribution and local abundance) were mainly insectivorous, included resident, wintering and transient species, and had the smallest body size. Conclusions: Classification analysis formed three groups of species, similar to those described in the literature of developed countries in temperate latitudes. Ecological features of urban exploiters are not the same than those of ""rare"" species, neither than those of the bird fauna from natural forest communities. If urban growth keeps provoking the conversion of natural forest habitats into urban environments, green urban areas most likely could not maintain viable populations of many of these bird species.",NA,"2-s2.0-53249140669",16,0.544789559,0

We detected on average ‚àº50 Cerulean Warbler males (total) in three disjunct populations during each breeding season. Areas used by Cerulean Warblers were characterized by avian communities with significantly higher species richness, diversity, and abundance compared to areas where they were not detected.

Between them, the Microphallidae is a common family with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nevertheless, only 10 Maritrema species have been recorded previously in South America. The aim of the present paper is to describe a new species of Maritrema parasitizing the Nearctic Baird's sandpiper, Calidris bairdii in its wintering areas in Patagonia, Argentina. We also analyze and compare the microphallid diversity in two host species. We collected 44 C. bairdii and 50 Calidris fuscicollis in search of helminths. Trematodes were found only in C. bairdii. A total of 694 trematodes belonging to 4 microphallid species were found parasitizing the intestine and caeca. Four microphallid species were found: Maritrema formicae, Odhneria odhneri, Levinseniella cruzi and Maritrema pichi n. sp.

Abundance declined at an average rate of 4% per year over the period 1978 through 1987, equalling the national decline found by the Breeding Bird Survey for those years, but recovered by 1990 to pre-decline levels. Abundance of previous residents followed a similar pattern, the only population component to do so. Abundance of new immigrants and of returning, locally produced young was generally stable. Throughout the study, reproductive rates were high enough to maintain the population at the return rates observed early and late in the study. However, a sustained episode of reduced production per female and of an increased percentage of adults failing to produce any young generally coincided with the decline in abundance. When the failure rate later dropped, return rate and abundance subsequently increased. [The authors] conclude that a period of elevated, predation-caused failure prompted greater emigration by an ever-young, less-site-faithful population. High emigration coupled with stable immigration, stable recruitment of local young, and even normal mortality of residents would yield a declining population. A regional predation episode could cause a broader decline in abundance through several mechanisms that could reduce the number of available immigrants.",NA,"2-s2.0-0033131244",115,0.897719829,1
"216","bird_neotropic","Thirty-year bird population trends in an unfragmented temperate deciduous forest: Importance of habitat change","Abundances of forest birds in an unfragmented, undisturbed, and relatively mature temperate deciduous forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, changed markedly between 1969 and 1998. Total numbers of birds (all species combined) declined from 210-220 individuals/10 ha in the early 1970s to 70-90/10 ha in the 1990s. Of the 24 regularly occurring species, 12 decreased significantly (four to local extinction), three increased significantly, and nine remained relatively constant in abundance. Nine of the 12 declining species were Neotropical migrants. Most species exhibited similar trends on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in New Hampshire during the same 30 year period and on three replicate study sites in nearby sections of the White Mountains from 1986-1998. Probable causes of trends were diverse and differed among species. Most could be accounted for by individual species' responses to events occurring primarily in the local breeding area. The most important local factor affecting bird abundance was temporal change in forest vegetation structure, resulting from natural forest succession and local disturbances. Four species that declined markedly and in some cases disappeared completely from the study plot (Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus; Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina; Philadelphia Vireo, Vireo philadelphicus; and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) appear to attain peak abundance in early or mid successional forests. Species preferring more mature forests, such as Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), increased significantly in abundance over the 30 year study. Other important factors influencing bird abundances were food availability and events in the migratory and winter periods. Nest-predation rates, although varying among years, showed no long-term pattern that would account for population declines, and brood parasites were absent from this forest. Findings from this study demonstrate that major changes in bird abundances occur over time even in undisturbed and relatively mature forests, and illustrate the need for considering habitat requirements of individual species and how habitat suitability changes over time when trying to assess the causes of their long-term population trends. The results also imply that any conclusions about the effects of other factors affecting forest bird abundances, such as increased nest predation or brood parasitism associated with habitat fragmentation, must also account for successional changes that may be affecting habitat suitability.","10.2307/4089923","2-s2.0-0034789342",33,0.878662638,1
"315","bird_neotropic","Population trends in grassland, shrubland, and forest birds in eastern North America","Many species of terrestrial birds have shown substantial population declines in eastern North America. The results of the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and other long-term surveys show that the populations of most species of grassland and shrubland specialists have declined during the past 25 years. These declines are primarily due to land-use changes, particularly the growth of forest on abandoned farmland and pasture, and the intensification of agriculture on the remaining farmland. Many grassland and shrubland bird species are dependent on ephemeral habitats that quickly become unsuitable due to vegetation change. Only continual disturbance, such as fire, mowing, grazing, or logging, will maintain habitats for these species. Populations of forest migrants have also declined at particular sites, but the evidence for overall population declines throughout eastern North America is not conclusive. Results of the BBS indicate, in fact, that populations of most species of forest migrants have shown an overall increase during the past 25 years. Long-term trends are difficult to discern, however, because the abundance of forest migrants has fluctuated greatly, generally increasing between 1966 and 1979, and decreasing after 1978. Regardless of past trends in populations of forest migrants, there is cause for concern for their future. Both the breeding habitat (large areas of uninterrupted forest) and winter habitat (tropical forests and other natural or seminatural tropical habitats) needed by many species of forest migrants are threatened with degradation or destruction. The future of both early-succession and forest birds depends on careful management of regional landscapes to maintain a diversity of habitat types, with relatively large areas of continuous grassland, shrubland, and forest.",NA,"2-s2.0-0032636265",177,0.85962881,1

In this study, long-term data are presented on the occurrence of shorebirds at one such site on the coast of the state of Sergipe in northeastem Brazil. A 5-km long stretch of Atalaia Beach was surveyed each month between July 2003 and May 2006 (1-6 surveys per month, total = 101). The surveys resulted in records of three resident shorebird species (Vanellus chilensis, Charadrius collaris and Charadrius wilsonia) and ten Nearctic migrants (Charadriidae and Scolopacidae). The local abundance of these migrants followed a predictable pattern, with the main influx starting at the end of September, during the boreal autumn (with Charadrius semipalmatus arriving slightly earlier). The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) and the Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) were the most abundant species throughout the study period, peaking at 1200 and 700 birds, respectively, in November-February. Some sanderlings (Calidris alba). Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), and Semipalmated plovers (C. semipalmatus) almost certainly overwinter at the site, and remained in the study area throughout the year, whereas the bimodal distribution of the White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) indicates the use of the beach as a stopover during migration to wintering sites further south. Whilst more species were recorded during the first year, counts were lower than in subsequent years, possibly reflecting natural fluctuations in abundance or migration patterns. Overall, the data indicate that the site may be an important stopover or wintering site for populations of at least five species of Nearctic migrants, while it may be visited periodically by a number of other species. ¬© The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",NA,"2-s2.0-79952126419",61,0.857401897,1

Cardinal group size and juvenile abundance were also lower in the dense forest than in the open and border forest. The seasonal distribution of Cardinal abundance was different between habitats. The dense forest showed a slight increase during the breeding season, but there were no definite trends in other habitats. Results of this study indicate that habitat characteristics on a small scale are important in determining the abundance of Red-crested Cardinals. Since Cardinals intensively used pastures adjacent to forests, this is likely the cause of the lower abundance in the dense forest.

We examined demographic trends and response to human footprint for Canada warblers (Cardellina canadensis), a threatened Neotropical migrant, using range-wide data (1993-2016) from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program on the breeding grounds. Declines in abundance were steepest in the eastern breeding region, followed by the western region. Breeding productivity did not decline in any region. In contrast, we observed declining recruitment in all regions, low apparent survival in the east and west, and a decline in apparent survival in the east. Abundance declined with increasing disturbance around MAPS stations. Between 1993 and 2009, the human footprint index on the breeding range increased by 0.11% in contrast to a 14% increase on the wintering range.

Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ¬± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ¬± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ¬± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ¬± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ¬± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ¬± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ¬± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ¬± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6.

Seventeen censuses conducted between 1957 and 1974 were also analyzed. Declines or local extinctions occurred in 10 Neotropical migrant species between 1949 and 1980.

Pair-wise comparisons of 20 yearly Shannon diversity indices revealed little significant variation. Wide-ranging raptor species nested regularly over a period totaling 35 years. Observed declines in breeding densities of Neotropical migrants and concurrent increases in resident species can be explained best by patterns of forest successional change affected by land-use history. Land-use history at local and regional scales can have significant effects on patterns of bird distribution and abundance, particularly with respect to the cumulative effects of gap-phase succession resulting from loss of individual canopy trees. To distinguish bird population changes resulting from local successional patterns from other influences, it is essential that vegetation data be collected and analyzed in parallel with bird population data.

The last assessment reported a population as low as 140 individuals. Possible causes for its decline could be habitat loss and degradation, and potentially a lack of nest sites. We conducted a new population assessment using point counts and investigated habitat use patterns during the post-breeding season of 2006 and 2007. We also installed 81 nest boxes (in three areas) to study the species' breeding ecology and to increase potential nest sites. Our estimated mean rayadito abundance for 2006 was 0.54 ¬±0.19 ind/ha (mean ¬± SE, approximately 250 individuals in the southern area). We could not survey all the areas where the rayadito might be found, but extrapolating to a conservative estimate of potential habitat of 1000 ha we estimate a total population size of 500 individuals (148-932, Cl 95%). We found a significant positive relationship between number of rayaditos and canelo (Drymis confertifolia) cover (GLM Poisson, P = 0.045), with canelo coverage approximately 8% of the southern area. A year after establishment, seven out of 42 boxes (southern group) had been occupied: three complete and four incomplete nests. All three complete nests had a supporting structure (1042.99 ¬± 18.16 cm3) of canelo and tree-fern (Dicksonia externa) rootlets and a soft cup (313.68 ¬± 112.08 cm3) of petrel (Pterodroma externa and P. longirostris) feathers. Our results showed rayadito population levels similar to what was found in the late 1980s, although the species still faces considerable threats. The probability of box occupation was not affected by tree diameter or box placement height. These results suggest that canelo trees and nest boxes could be used in the restoration of the rayadito habitat.

Of 31 taxa captured in sufficient numbers, 16 underwent statistically significant declines and none increased. Twice as many species declined from 1989-1999 as compared to 1979-1989. Overall, our results were similar to those of regional Breeding Bird Surveys determined for the same species during the same period. In an attempt to identify possible causes for trends, we grouped species by various life-history categories including nest height, nest type, likelihood of cowbird parasitism, wintering location, winter food preference, and tolerance for human presence on the breeding grounds. All groups underwent significant declines, although high nesters, common cowbird hosts, and Neotropical migrants declined faster than their respective counterparts. While life-history attributes explained differences in trends between groups, there was significant heterogeneity of trends within groups. Capture rates of certain species and groups appeared to be affected by various climate variables, and accelerating declines since 1990 may reflect effects of large-scale climate cycles, particularly on long-distance migrants. We suggest that long-term population trajectories of songbird populations across North America may be better understood in the context of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Interpretation of our results is, in some cases, problematic due to the complex interaction of methodological limitations and environmental variables, especially habitat change on the study site. We recommend the use of multiple methods and multiple sites for monitoring trends in songbird population abundance during fall migration.","10.1650/7131","2-s2.0-0242575066",80,0.828572215,1

We recorded a total of 100 species, including non-breeders. Among all recorded taxa, landbirds (n = 48 spp. or 48 %) exhibit higher species numbers when compared to shore- and seabirds (38), and freshwater birds (14). Within the documented breeding avifauna (n = 54 spp.) landbirds take an even relative higher value, amounting to 88 % (or 42 spp.). Austral and Neotropical species are most numerous within the landbird assemblage, reflecting the closest biogeographical realm. When comparing different Chilean avifaunas, southern mainland ecosystems show the highest landbird richness (90), followed by Chiloe Island (61), Mocha Island (42), and remote Juan Fernandez Islands (11). From line transects surveyed, 884 bird individuals belonging to 18 resident forest landbird species were recorded (averaging 10.3 ind/ha). We calculated the total population size of forest landbirds in the reserve (2300 ha) being 23,681 individuals. Two of the three endemic taxa (Mocha Rayadito and Mocha Chucao) show relatively high population sizes of about 4,100 and 3,700 individuals, respectively.

"143","bird_neotropic","Geostatistics as a tool for examining hypothesized declines in migratory songbirds","Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate significant declines in the populations of several species of songbirds, including several Neotropical migrants. These declines have been attributed to habitat destruction and fragmentation on the breeding grounds, in strategic migratory stopover sites, and on the wintering grounds. Using BBS data from the 1967-1989 period and universal kriging, we produced maps of abundance change for two declining species of wood warblers to test hypothetical spatial scenarios of decline over entire breeding ranges. These species were the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) and the Prairie Warbler (D. discolor). We found considerable variability in the location of areas of decline when comparing successive 5-yr periods. In some comparisons, areas of decline were concentrated in the centers of abundance of these species, and in others, they were scattered throughout their range. We also found that the direction and intensity of population trends was quite sensitive to the methods used for calculating abundance. Our results indicate that, even for species where significant longterm declines have been reported, considerable variation exists in the direction of abundance change, both geographically and temporally. Although most of the long-term declines reported in particular species at local and regional scales are undeniable, gaps in our knowledge still prevent us from incorporating these trends into a global model of the annual cycle of Neotropical migrants.","10.2307/2265654","2-s2.0-0030422765",38,0.824104064,1

Although the three intensively studied woodlots were small (14-65 ha), they contained several species that are considered area-sensitive elsewhere in their range, including the worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). Populations of six Neotropical migrants declined by at least 50% and none increased by more than 10% during the five years (1985-1989) of the study. Mist-net data suggest very low (ca. 15%) return rates of adults between years with only a small core of adults returning year after year. Data on nesting success indicate that most nests fail because of high predation rates (ca. 80% of open cup nests) and brood parasitism (ca. 76% of nests of Neotropical migrants) by the omnipresent, abundant brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Parasitized nests with more than one cowbird egg were the rule rather than the exception, and contained an average of 3.3 cowbird eggs for Neotropical migrants. Wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nests averaged nearly four times as many cowbird eggs as host eggs (4.6 vs. 1.2). Ground-nesting species such as the ovenbird and Kentucky warbler (Oporornis formosus) appear to be less susceptible to brood parasitism than shrub-nesting species. Midsummer mist-net data also showed little evidence of reproduction by Neotropical migrants as hatching year:adult ratios averaged 0.1 compared with ratios of >1.0 for many year-round residents and short-distance migrants.

"164","bird_neotropic","Range-wide effects of breeding- and nonbreeding-season climate on the abundance of a Neotropical migrant songbird","Geographic variation in the population dynamics of a species can result from regional variability in climate and how it affects reproduction and survival. Identifying such effects for migratory birds requires the integration of population models with knowledge of migratory connectivity between breeding and nonbreeding areas. We used Bayesian hierarchical models with 26 years of Breeding Bird Survey data (1982-2007) to investigate the impacts of breeding- and nonbreeding-season climate on abundance of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) across the species range. We focused on 15 populations defined by Bird Conservation Regions, and we included variation across routes and observers as well as temporal trends and climate effects. American Redstart populations that breed in eastern North America showed increased abundance following winters with higher plant productivity in the Caribbean where they are expected to overwinter. In contrast, western breeding populations showed little response to conditions in their expected wintering areas in west Mexico, perhaps reflecting lower migratory connectivity or differential effects of winter rainfall on individuals across the species range. Unlike the case with winter climate, we found few effects of temperature prior to arrival in spring (March-April) or during the nesting period (May-June) on abundance the following year. Eight populations showed significant changes in abundance, with the steepest declines in the Atlantic Northern Forest (3.4%/yr) and the greatest increases in the Prairie Hardwood Transition (4%/yr). This study emphasizes how the effects of climate on populations of migratory birds are context dependent and can vary depending on geographic location and the period of the annual cycle. Such knowledge is essential for predicting regional variation in how populations of a species might vary in their response to climate change. ¬© 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/10-1757.1","2-s2.0-80051875975",21,0.816065649,1
"174","bird_neotropic","Demographic response of a neotropical migrant songbird to forest management and climate change scenarios","Demographic models for species sensitive to human activities that are still relatively common are of particular interest to compare the relative influence of human land use and climate on population trends. Yet, data limitations often restrict our ability to interpret the numerical response of species to habitat alteration and climatic change adds to this challenge. In this study, we used habitat-specific demographic information from an individually-marked population of Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and a forest timber supply model to project population trends over an 80-year horizon. We modelled changes in Ovenbird abundance, productivity, and population growth rate as a function of harvesting scenarios (no harvest, forestry-as-usual, and increased [10% or 20%] harvesting intensity) and projected impacts of climate change (0%, 10%, and 50% reductions in population size over the 80-year period), as well as contrasting assumptions about population dynamics (i.e. open vs. closed population). Among the many effects of climate change, it has been hypothesized that reductions in annual snow cover will occur, causing deeper and more frequent frost penetration into the soil and, in turn, a reduction in invertebrate (food) abundance during the following breeding season. Our models suggest that the study area currently is a demographic sink (Œª=. 0.920) for Ovenbirds, although some habitat types still act as demographic sources. Over the first 7. years, a large decline in abundance of territorial males (~25%) is projected, unless population levels are maintained through immigration. Interestingly, when we allowed for immigration from outside the study area, population growth rate remained <1 because a larger proportion of the population occupied habitat types acting as sinks. Over an 80-year period, the climate change scenarios we simulated were more likely to have negative impacts (5-49%) than forestry activities, whether we applied the current management plan or more intensive harvesting scenarios. To our knowledge, this study used some of the most detailed habitat-specific demographic information available for a North American forest songbird to model the relative influence of land use, climate, and population dynamics on population trends. Future studies should examine the possibility of synergistic effects between harvesting and climate change, to model their influence on Ovenbird or other species foraging on litter invertebrates. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2015.10.002","2-s2.0-84946212401",79,0.811698981,0

We used capture‚Äìrecapture data for the Grey Pileated Finch from a Neotropical dry forest to evaluate the hypothesis that intra- and inter-annual survival, individuals entrance and population abundance, are related to local rainfall. Sampling occurred across 3¬†years, with individuals captured, tagged and evaluated for age and presence of brood patch every 14¬†days. Using the POPAN formulation, we generated demographic models to evaluate study population temporal dynamics. Best-fit models indicated a low apparent annual survival in the first year (16%) compared to other years (between 47 and 62%), with this low value associated with an extreme drought. The abundance of juveniles at each capture occasion was significantly dependent on the accumulated precipitation in the previous 14¬†days, and the juvenile covariate was a strong predictor of the intra-annual entrance probability (natality). Individuals entrance during the reproductive period corresponded to 53, 52 and 75% of total ingress for each year, respectively. The trend in sampled population size indicated positive exponential growth (Ninitial = 50, Nlast = 600), with intra-annual fluctuations becoming progressively more intense. Low survival was relevant during population decline at study onset, while at study end intense Individuals entrance promoted rapid population growth. Thus, the indirect effects of rainfall and the combined effect of two demographic rates operated synergistically on the immediate population abundance of Grey Pileated Finch, an abundant bird in a Neotropical dry forest. ¬© 2018, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","10.1007/s10144-018-0624-7","2-s2.0-85048255782",1,0.807722749,1

Five species, all tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae) made up SATT, whereas only two of the seven species of SACT were tyrannids. Densities of both SATT and SACT were higher in open woodland than in shrubland. SATT density did not differ among years, but SACT density did, having lower values in 1994 in both habitats. In subsequent years, SACT densities increased but did not reach values similar to those previous to 1994. The decline in 1994 coincided with a two-year drought period that began in 1993, but lower density in the following years did not appear to be related to climatic conditions in the study area, suggesting a low capacity of SACT species to recover population abundance after periods of stress. In contrast, SATT density was not associated with local climatic conditions, possibly because several SATT species used the study area only as a stopover site. During the breeding season, birds of both migratory systems disproportionately use the open woodland, which offers more sites to nest and feed than does the shrubland. Although most SATT and SACT species are abundant and not currently of conservation concern, human activities in the central Monte desert promote the structural simplification of the habitat, which could threaten future populations of Neotropical austral migrant landbirds in this ecosystem. ¬© The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.","10.1525/cond.2008.110.1.70","2-s2.0-57649145717",112,0.805455517,1
"204","bird_neotropic","Recommendations for monitoring avian populations with point counts: A case study in southeastern Brazil","In the northern hemisphere, bird counts have been fundamental in gathering data to understand population trends. Due to the seasonality of the northern hemisphere, counts take place during two clearly defined moments in time: the breeding season (resident birds) and winter (after migration). Depending on location, Neotropical birds may breed at any time of year, may or may not migrate, and those patterns are not necessarily synchronous among species. Also in contrast to the northern hemisphere, population trends and the impact of rapid urbanization and deforestation are unknown and unmonitored. Throughout one year, we used point counts to better understand temporal patterns of bird species richness and relative abundance in the state of S√£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil, to examine how to implement similar bird counts in tropical America. We counted birds twice each day on 10 point transects (20 points day-1), separated by 200 m, with a 100 m limited detection radius in a semideciduous tropical forest. Both species richness and bird abundance were greater in the morning, but accumulation curves suggest that longer-duration afternoon counts would reach the same total species as in morning counts. Species richness and bird abundance did not vary seasonally and unique species were counted every month; relatively few species (20%) were present in all months. Most (84%) known forest species in the area were encountered. We suggest that point counts can work here as they do in the northern hemisphere. We recommend that transects include at least 20 points and that the simplest timing of bird counts would also be seasonal, using timing of migration of austral migrants (and six months later) to coordinate counts. We propose that bird counts in Brazil, and elsewhere in Latin America, would provide data to help understand population trends, but would require greater effort than in temperate latitudes due to greater species richness and different dynamics of reproduction and migration. With collaboration among ornithologists and coordinated bird surveys, we may develop a technique for the tropics that would yield information for population trends and conservation of birds, similar to counts in temperate latitudes.","10.1590/S0031-10492013003200001","2-s2.0-84890308523",179,0.804074392,0

We used the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as a model for evaluating the role Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the largest national park in the eastern United States) may play in maintaining regional songbird populations. We estimated the annual productivity of Wood Thrushes in the park by combining observations on the birds' distribution, abundance, and productivity with estimates of habitat availability. We estimated a breeding population of approximately 10,000 nesting pairs using habitat models developed from over 2500 point-count censuses conducted across the park. Data from 426 nests monitored from 1992 to 1997 produced a daily nest survival rate of 0.96. We estimated an annual fecundity of 2.76 fledglings per breeding pair, based on a model that incorporated the re-nesting behavior of Wood Thrushes. Results indicate that the park is producing approximately 3000 surplus female young each year. Daily nest survival rates were below those reported in other studies of Wood Thrushes in large forest tracts. The relatively high productivity of 3.31 nestlings per successful nest suggests that, in the absence of predation, the park provides high-quality nesting habitat for Wood Thrushes, but that it may also support a more diverse and abundant predator community than more disturbed or less contiguous sites. The difficulties of estimating the size of continental breeding bird populations make assessing the significance of the park within a regional landscape context problematic, but our estimates suggest that, although the park is functioning as a substantial population source on a local scale, its potential to sustain regional or continental Wood Thrush populations is limited. Our findings suggest that species such as the Wood Thrush are capable of moderate levels of surplus productivity in high-quality habitat, but that extensive areas of suitable habitat outside protected areas and other public lands will be required to sustain continental breeding populations.","10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98606.x","2-s2.0-0033864264",201,0.803266981,0

Since 1969, my colleagues and I have been studying migratory songbird populations in their breeding quarters at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire, USA, and since 1986, in their winter quarters in the Greater Antilles (Jamaica). Long-term data on the abundance and demography of these populations, coupled with experimental tests of mechanisms, indicate that processes operating in the breeding area (e.g. density-dependent fecundity, food limitation) are sufficient to limit and regulate the local abundance of these species. At the same time, limiting factors operating in the non-breeding season (e.g. climate-induced food limitation in winter quarters and especially mortality during migration) also have important impacts on migrant populations. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that limiting processes during the winter period can carry over into the breeding season and affect reproductive output. These findings clearly demonstrate that to understand changes in abundance of long-distance migrant species requires knowledge of events operating throughout the annual cycle, which presents a challenge to researchers, managers and others concerned with the welfare of these species. ¬© 2007 The Author.","10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00685.x","2-s2.0-36448986813",16,0.800972076,1

We show that most birds wintering on western Caribbean islands come from the northern portion of the species' North American breeding range, whereas those on more easterly islands are primarily from southern breeding areas. Although segregated by breeding latitude, birds within local wintering areas derive from a wide range of breeding longitudes, indicating considerable population mixing with respect to breeding longitude. These results are useful for assessing the effects of wintering habitat loss on breeding population abundances and for predicting whether the demographic consequences will be concentrated or diffuse.","10.1126/science.1067124","2-s2.0-0037039810",19,0.798340176,0

Of 9 broad habitat categories, clearcuts and mature hardwood forests had the lowest avian diversity, but these 2 habitats each contained many individual species that showed their maximum abundance in those habitats. Greatest avian diversity was found in 2 young forest types (6-20 yr following harvesting). Young, even-aged regeneration had the greatest abundance of individual birds per unit area, whereas mature hardwood had the lowest total abundance. Ten of 37 Neotropical migrant species had their highest abundance in the 2 youngest stages of forest (clearcuts and regeneration) whereas 13 of 37 species had their highest abundance in the 3 mature forest types. Short-distance migrants had highest abundances in early-successional habitats, and mature softwood stands contained the greatest number of resident species. The presence or absence at a point count station of 10 late-successional species (of 37) and 13 early-successional species (of 35) was related to the amount of similar habitat within 1 km of the point count center (homogeneous landscapes). Few species showed highest abundances in heterogeneous landscapes. Spatially consolidating harvesting might enhance both early- and late-successional species simultaneously. Based on species-habitat associations identified in this study, estimated population trends in a ] 270 km2 section of our study area did not correlate well with Breeding Bird Survey results for the state of Maine (1981-1992). This discrepancy probably resulted because few Breeding Bird Survey routes occur in the industrial forest of northern Maine, and because of different trends in habitat abundances inside and outside of he study area. This result indicates there might be important subregional differences in landbird population trends. Current timber harvest rates likely will result in a decrease in abundance of mature forest in Maine's industrial forest. Many early-successional species; including some of conservation concern, will benefit from this trend. Abundances of mature-forest species probably will decrease. The challenge industry and conservation biologists face is how to construct dynamic landscapes that balance the age-class distribution of the forest and maintain mature forest species.","10.2307/3802179","2-s2.0-0030758856",25,0.795974789,1

However, the mechanisms by which local individuals and immigrants interact and the subsequent effects of immigrants on productivity are poorly known. We developed an integrated population model (IPM) to study the extent and consequences of immigration on the dynamics of a neotropical migrant (American redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) over an 11-year period in Ontario, Canada. New immigrants represented the majority of the study population each year with higher immigration rates for males than females and for first-year breeders than breeders in their second year or older. Immigration was negatively density dependent, with immigrants replacing previously established breeders in a compensatory manner following their death or emigration. Because of the tradeoff between immigration and apparent survival, neither had a strong influence on population growth and reproductive output was most strongly correlated with a change in abundance between years. However, if immigration ceased, the study population would become locally extinct within 7¬†years and thus immigrants were essential for local population persistence. We found no evidence for reduced breeding success when immigrants represented a higher proportion of the study population. Our research highlights the importance of movement in the stability of open populations and the strong correlation between the fates of local breeders and the number of immigrants entering the population. We recommend the use of IPMs to address the spatial scale over which immigration occurs and how different scales influence its contribution to population dynamics. ¬© 2017, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.","10.1007/s10144-017-0582-5","2-s2.0-85020067100",11,0.793071706,1

We provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of changes in population density or other abundance estimates for 30 mid-sized to large mammal, bird and reptile species in 101 hunted and nonhunted, but otherwise undisturbed, Neotropical forest sites. The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative. Populations of all species combined declined across greater differences in hunting pressure by up to 74.8 percent from their numeric abundance in less intensively hunted sites, but harvest-sensitive species faired far worse. Of the 30 species examined, 22 declined significantly at high levels of hunting. Body size significantly affected the direction and magnitude of abundance changes, with large-bodied species declining faster in overhunted sites. Frugivorous species showed more marked declines in abundance in heavily hunted sites than seed predators and browsers, regardless of the effects of body size. The implications of hunting for seed dispersal are discussed in terms of community dynamics in semi-defaunated tropical forests. ¬© 2007 The Author(s).","10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00272.x","2-s2.0-34247329805",3,0.787377843,0

Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors","10.2307/3545099","2-s2.0-0027386301",86,0.779302536,1

On the Caja√≠bas Islands and in the Rivers Estrela, Iriri, Suru√≠ and Guara√≠ the constancy index was higher than 90%. On average, the highest concentrations were recorded on the Caja√≠bas Islands and in Estrela River, areas where the bird was very common (> 50%). The peak abundance was recorded in autumn/winter and spring, with a population decrease during the summer. At least during the summer and autumn cormorants breed on Tijucas islands (Alfavaca and Pontuda), off Guanabara Bay.

Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self-sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source-sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism. Lack of data on dispersal is a major gap in understanding the population dynamics of Neotropical migrants and prescribing effective conservation measures.","10.2307/2265649","2-s2.0-0030390252",6,0.77420735,1

The abundance of US and Canadian resident species decreased by 30 percent, and that of migrants within the United States and Canada decreased by 19 percent. By contrast, Neotropical migrants increased by up to 20 percent. Land-cover changes in northern latitudes therefore seem more consequential for bird populations than those occurring in Neotropical habitats. Lower abundances were most marked for resident breeding birds that used open, edge, and wetland habitats, the environments most affected by human disturbances-particularly urban sprawl-in northern latitudes. The abundance of resident and migrant forest-dwelling birds increased (although trends va ried from species to species), with the increases seeming to follow the 20th-century expansion of forest area in northern latitudes, rather than the loss of Neotropical forests. The geographic footprint of changes in bird abundance linked to habitat changes in North America may thus be extending southward, with negative effects on birds that use open habitats and positive effects on forest birds. ¬© 2007 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","10.1641/B570410","2-s2.0-34247201031",9,0.770538466,1

In a tropical dry forest in north-eastern Brazil, we evaluated whether bird abundance is highly seasonal, and associated with time-specific variability in detectability. We mark-recaptured birds with mist nets over three field visits (3487 records from 75 species), and used closed-capture models to estimate detectability and abundance in birds divided into three groups (all, residents, insectivores). In the two dry periods, the best models resulted in capture estimates at least three times larger than recapture, and both estimates were twice that of when rains occurred on the day preceding sampling. Abundance varied between dry and wet periods from 4.0 (from 115 ¬± 34 to 479 ¬± 144) to 13 times (183 ¬± 8 to 2463 ¬± 351). Estimates were 1.5-3.2 times greater in the dry period when behavioural responses of birds were excluded from capture-recapture models. Meanwhile, in the wet period the relative abundance was between 33-76% smaller than best-fit models estimated. This study found variation in avian abundance greater than that observed in other Neotropical dry forests, and indicates that biases may be common when not including detectability.

"401","bird_neotropic","Climate and food synchronize regional forest bird abundances","Analysis of synchrony in population fluctuations can help to identify factors that regulate populations and the scales at which these factors exert their influence. Using 15 years of data on the abundances of songbirds at four replicate forest sites in New Hampshire, USA, we addressed two main questions: (1) Are forest bird populations synchronous at the scale measured (tens of kilometers), and if so, (2) what environmental factors are responsible for the synchrony? Nine of the 10 bird species we examined exhibited significant spatial synchrony across the four sites. Within nesting and foraging species groups, tree nesters and foliage gleaners exhibited the highest spatial synchrony. Long-distance (Neotropical) migrants exhibited higher spatial synchrony than did short-distance migrants or year-round residents. Synchrony within and among six species of long-distance, migratory, insectivorous birds was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in the abundance of lepidopteran larvae, a primary food type during the breeding season, which in turn have been shown to be influenced by El Ni√±o/La Ni√±a global climate patterns. Abundances of year-round resident species were related to another large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Winter weather can have both direct (e.g., via temperature-mediated mortality) and indirect (e.g., via winter food availability) effects on year-round resident species. We do not believe that predation on adults or nests accounted for the observed synchrony. Dispersal among regional populations in this system may have played a role but is likely a product of the influence of regionally synchronous caterpillar fluctuations on bird reproduction. Long-term regional population trends may have contributed to the observed synchrony for some species, but we do not consider these trends to be primary factors. Our findings of population synchrony support the importance of food and climate in influencing forest bird abundances and have broad implications for potential responses of bird and insect populations to climate change.","10.1890/02-0639","2-s2.0-1342288313",15,0.758908893,1
"481","bird_neotropic","Estimating breeding season abundance of golden-cheeked warblers in Texas, USA","Population abundance estimates using predictive models are important for describing habitat use and responses to population-level impacts, evaluating conservation status of a species, and for establishing monitoring programs. The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23 males/ha (95% CI = 0.197-0.252, n = 301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95% CI: 223,927-302,620). Our results provide the first abundance estimate using habitat and count data from a sampling design focused on range-wide inference.

We focus our analysis on 23 large-bodied canopy and terrestrial bird species from 10 families, on the basis of 2,044 bird sightings obtained during line-transect censuses conducted over a two-year period. Large toucans comprised the most numerically abundant large birds in terra firme and iga√≥ forests, whereas macaws were the most abundant in nutrient-rich v√°rzea forests that were seasonally inundated by white-water. The aggregate population density of all bird species in terra firme forest was slightly higher than that in v√°rzea forest.

"741","bird_neotropic","Migrants in Neotropical bird communities: An assessment of the breeding currency hypothesis","1. Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4. Other factors may interact with the availability of food for nestlings to limit the populations of resident birds below carrying capacities set by non-breeding season arthropod abundance, thereby creating a set of resources available to non-breeding migrants. ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00928.x","2-s2.0-16244419776",13,0.696474003,0

The two sites, on the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts, differ importantly in annual rainfall, tide amplitude, and seasonal invertebrate abundance. Most migrant species varied temporally in abundance with the opposite pattern at each site, suggesting mid-winter movements correlated with abundance of food resources. Because of their wide geographic distribution and their particular response to hydrographic factors, mangroves are likely to have a temporally complementary role in sustaining migrant populations throughout the Neptropics. However, variations in migrant numbers reported in other Neotropical habitats could also reflect large-scale movements by migrants.

We studied a population of Tropical Kingbirds (Tyrannus melancholicus), a primarily insectivorous species, in eastern Bolivia to examine relationships between rainfall, food availability, and foraging strategies throughout the year. Our study site in the southern Amazon Basin was characterized by strong seasonal variation in the abundance of the kingbird's main insect prey (coleopterans and hymenopterans), with reduced abundance during the nonbreeding season which largely overlaps the dry season. Overall, mean search times for insect prey by Tropical Kingbirds during the breeding (96.9 ¬± 85.6 [SD] sec) and nonbreeding (83.7 ¬± 91.2 sec) seasons did not differ (P= 0.23). However, during the nonbreeding season, kingbird search times were negatively, but nonsignificantly, correlated with coleopteran abundance (r2= 0.43, P= 0.16) and significantly and negatively correlated with hymenopteran abundance (r2= 0.72, P= 0.03). Although insect abundance differed seasonally, kingbird search times did not, perhaps because kingbirds forage on a greater variety of insects during the nonbreeding season or, during the breeding season, kingbird search times may be influenced by the need to monitor and defend nests as well as constraints on the types of prey that can be fed to nestlings. However, the reduced abundance of their primary insect prey and negative relationships between the abundance of those prey and search times during the dry, nonbreeding season suggest that Tropical Kingbirds in southern Amazonia may be food limited, potentially explaining why some migrate and spend that season elsewhere. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

Whether these changes affect songbirds that nest and forage on the forest floor is unknown. In stands with and without earthworms in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Wisconsin (U.S.A.), we surveyed for, monitored nests of, and measured attributes of habitat of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Hermit Thrushes (Catharus guttatus), both ground-dwelling songbirds, and we sampled earthworms at survey points and nests. Bird surveys indicated significantly lower densities of Ovenbirds and Hermit Thrushes in relation to Lumbricus invasions at survey point and stand extents (3.1 and 15-20 ha, respectively). Modeling of Ovenbird nest survival (i.e., the probability that nestlings successfully fledge) indicated that lower survival probabilities were associated with increased sedge cover and decreased litter depth, factors that are related to Lumbricus invasions, possibly due to reduced nest concealment or arthropod abundance. Our findings provide compelling evidence that earthworm invasions may be associated with local declines of forest songbird populations. ¬© 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01719.x","2-s2.0-80052574165",8,0.674832506,0

However, few of them have considered populations or individual species, and how habitat structure affects their distribution and abundance. In this study, we investigated how the combined effects of some forest structure components affect the occurrence and abundance of a resident bird species, the scale-backed antbird Hylophylax poecilinotus (Cabanis, 1847). We tested the null hypothesis of no difference between the variation in forest structure components at locations where birds occurred and at locations where they did not. In a pristine Terra Firme forest at the Ducke Reserve, Manaus, we recorded bird occurrence and abundance using mist nets in 56 transects (1 km long each) within a 9 √ó 9 km trail grid covering 6400 ha. Also in the same 56 transects, we set 50 √ó 50 m plots and recorded the following seven components of forest structure and landscape: 1) canopy opening, 2) leaf litter, 3) tree abundance, 4) logs, 5) snags, 6) streams, and 7) elevation. We evaluated their effects on avian occurrence and abundance by using models of Multiple Logistic Regression (for bird occurrence) and Multiple Linear Regression (for bird abundance). The results suggested that H. poecilinotus occurred significantly more often in lowland areas, in areas located farther away from streams, and in areas bearing thicker leaf litter. Hylophylax poecilinotus was also more abundant in lowland areas and in areas located further away from streams.

For this, a simultaneous census was undertaken in 24 count stations in Isla de la Juventud (IJ) and 32 stations in Ciego de √Åvila (CA), Cuba, during two consecutive days between 2008 and 2010. Abundance and behavior pattern (instantaneous method) were analyzed by habitat type, to help understand how cranes modify their behavioral pattern when the natural habitat is changed. Flocks in IJ had three individuals, and between 1.9 ¬± 1.5 and 2.8 ¬± 1.5 in CA. Population size in IJ was 164 individuals, and in CA of 137, 141 and 168 individuals for the 2008-2010 period, respectively. The counting efficacy was high (IJ: 91 %; CA: 81-87 %) and the numerical concordance was intermediate (IJ: 45.4 %; CA: 72 %). When comparing the habitat type, the abundance was higher in natural savannahs (83), followed by coastal flats (59), pines (23) and cattle pastures (7) in IJ; while in CA, marsh grasslands hosted the greatest abundance for the three years period (130; 120; 112), followed by grassland with palms (2; 17; 51) and cattle pastures (5; 4; 5). The cranes were fed more in cattle pas¬≠tures and were more alert in natural savannas and marsh grasslands. The frequency of feeding and alert behaviors was different from the natural savannah/coastal flats and natural savannah/cattle pastures combinations in IJ. For CA, differences were found between marsh grasslands and marsh grasslands with palms. The population size increased by management strategies adopted in CA; nevertheless, might be affected by habitat loss associated with invasive alien plants in IJ. We propose the maintenance of prescribed fire in marsh grasslands under protection regime, as a strategy for long-term management to contribute with population growth. ¬© 2016, Universidad de Costa Rica.

"138","bird_neotropic","Endemism and local rarity in birds of neotropical montane rainforest","Species' rarity is expressed and measured at a variety of spatial scales, and rarity at different scales could be correlated. Considerable empirical evidence has supported a positive correlation between spatial distribution and local numerical abundance of species, which could create a syndrome of rarity for species limited in geographic distribution and occurring at low densities even in their primary habitats. We used auditory-count data and range information for birds in the Tilar√°n mountains of Costa Rica to examine the abundance-distribution relationship in cloud forest species and to determine if endemic species (limited to Costa Rican-Panamanian highlands or Central America) are locally rare or restricted in ecological distribution. We found a positive correlation between abundance and distribution at the smallest spatial scale: species occupying few sites in the study area had low abundances where they occur. At larger scales, geographical distribution measured categorically was correlated with local ecological amplitude (zones occupied). Local abundance, however, was not correlated across all species with estimates of range size (km2), although most endemics exhibited below-median abundance. Within families with endemics and cosmopolitan species, 72% of narrow endemics were among the rarest species. For most narrow endemics, we rejected the possibility that they are sufficiently specialized within their habitats to reach relatively high densities. A conclusive test of the abundance-distribution relationship at large spatial scales and evaluation of global population size for endemics will require a comprehensive analysis using abundance data from throughout species' ranges. Such analyses for tropical species will be a long time coming, but it is meanwhile prudent to recognize that many endemics are threatened at several spatial scales, including the risks of small local populations. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted 22 experimental removals and followed six natural disappearances to examine territory switching. Antbirds quickly abandoned territories and mates to move to openings created by experimental removals. Pairing with the resident on a new territory was rapid. Unmated birds attracted new mates by singing a gender-specific song that differed from songs given by mated birds. There were no gender differences in replacement time or rate. Some vacancies, experimental and natural, were not filled, suggesting that floaters were rare. Territory and mate switching were not related to immediate enhancement of reproductive success because the probability of reproducing successfully was equally poor on all territories. Territory switching may be an overlooked but common tropical form of territoriality that increases individual survivorship during periods of low food abundance (dry season). We suggest that switching is favored when low annual reproductive success enhances selection for a long lifespan as the primary means to increase reproductive success.","10.1093/beheco/11.6.648","2-s2.0-0034580859",20,0.601183632,1

We also show that line-transect aural surveys sample curassows over large areas across all forest vertical strata and provide precise estimates of their abundance, but are biased towards detecting males. In contrast, line-transect visual surveys sample only small areas of forest understory and are imprecise, but appear not to be biased towards any sex or age class.

However, information on the tradeoffs between such intensive forestry practices and biodiversity is scant. Here we assess the magnitude and direction of potential impacts of intensive forest management on populations of early seral-associated breeding birds. Observed population declines of several Neotropical migrant bird species are hypothesized to be linked to the loss of early seral habitat on the breeding grounds. We investigated the association between broadleaved hardwood cover and avian abundance and diversity in intensively managed early seral Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands of the Pacific Northwest. Bird species richness decreased across an elevational gradient, but did not vary as a function of either local vegetation composition or structure. In contrast, bird abundance was strongly associated with hardwood cover at local and landscape scales, especially for foliage-gleaning species. We found strong support for the existence of a threshold in relative bird abundance as a function of hardwood at the stand scale; abundance doubled with an increase from 1% to ‚àº6% hardwood and then reached a plateau. Though abundance of leaf-gleaners increased even more strongly across a gradient in hardwood cover, evidence for a distinct threshold was less clear. We conclude that when early seral hardwood forest is scarce, even small increases in hardwood may provide substantial conservation benefits. However, for some species (i.e., foliage gleaners), there may be more direct trade-offs in abundance and juvenile recruitment with hardwood management intensity. ¬© 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2011.01.018","2-s2.0-79952040223",5,0.567913887,0
"118","bird_oceanic","Long-term trends in abundance of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) assessed by non-lethal capture rates in a coastal fishery","Sea turtle populations underwent severe decline in historical times, mainly through harvesting eggs and adults on nesting beaches. With the reduction of this threat in many areas, coupled with other conservation actions, some populations have demonstrated encouraging recovery, although remaining below their previous levels and undergone additional modern threats such as incidental capture in fisheries and pollution. Trends in sea turtle populations have usually been assessed through monitoring of females or nests on nesting beaches. Here we present data from a 22-year monitoring period for a juvenile green sea turtle Chelonia mydas mixed-stock in southeastern Brazil that were incidentally captured in passive non-lethal pound nets. A total of 3639 green turtles were captured in 5323 fishing days.pound‚àí1 with mortality rate of 2%. Captures occurred in all months, but bycatch rates, excluding recapture events, were higher in September and October, probably due to the recruitment of turtles migrating from southern areas, as well as recruits from the oceanic zone. Capture rates increased by 9.2% per year in the period from 1995 to 2016, in line with increasing source populations, particularly the main source contributor at Ascension Island, but also Trindade Island (Brazil) and Aves Island (Venezuela). Mean Curved Carapace Length of green turtles was higher during austral summer/early autumn and decreased markedly in May, probably due to the small-sized individuals that recruited to the study site. We show that the incidental capture of sea turtles in non-lethal fisheries, such as Brazilian pound nets, could also provide data on trends of populations nesting in distant places, and can contribute to the assessment of population status of sea turtles within Regional Management Units throughout the Atlantic Ocean. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.008","2-s2.0-85018655985",14,0.920929569,1

The total population was estimated at ‚âà260 adults. Most birds were resident on Rangatira Island in spring, summer and autumn but moved to Pitt Island during the winter. In spring birds commuted between the two islands but became resident on Rangatira when breeding commenced. Radio transmitters were attached to adult tui to monitor breeding. No radio-tagged female bred (n = 13) but at least two of three radio-tagged males raised young. Adult tui were intolerant of disturbance during nesting so estimation of productivity was made by mapping the number of fledgling groups. Flax (Phormium tenax) nectar appeared to be the most important food for breeding tui and birds travelled long distances to visit flowering plants. Fruits of ngaio (Myoporum laetum), matipo (Myrsine chathamica), karamu (Coprosma chathamica), mahoe (Melicytus chathamicus) and muehlenbeckia (Muehlenbeekia australis) were also important foods. Invertebrates were most important when females were feeding their young. The amount of breeding that occurred each season was directly related to the abundance of flax flowers in spring, and in good flax flowering years tui were able to rear two broods. In poor flax flowering years many birds did not breed. Control of feral cats on Pitt Island would most likely result in a significant increase in this breeding population; however planting of flax adjacent to the the forest areas on Chatham Island along with predator control may be necessary before tui can re-establish there. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc. 2004.",NA,"2-s2.0-11344252452",42,0.865944672,1

This study includes new data on the biological diversity and abundance of the region and research and management recommendations. We conducted surveys and over 300 research SCUBA dives among the remote Phoenix Islands: Nikumaroro (Gardner), McKean, Manra (Sydney), Kanton (Aba-Riringa), Enderbury, Orona (Hull) and Rawaki (Phoenix), only excluding Birnie Island due to time limitations. Corals, benthic and mobile invertebrates, fishes, algae, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals were surveyed at each site. Deep-sea life was sampled during seven deployments of an autonomous digital video camera system to 1,000 m depth at Kanton, Manra, and Orona. Coral reef and fish communities were surveyed using rapid assessment methods, small benthic fishes were collected using rotenone as a stunning agent, marine algae were collected by hand primarily during SCUBA dives, and a deepdrop collecting net was deployed to sample deep-sea animals. The reefs show evidence of the extreme isolation of these islands, pounded on three sides by the large ocean swells of the Pacific with only a narrow protected side to the west providing protection for anchorage. Coral species diversity of the islands was moderately high. While lacking in some corals dominant in other major reef areas, the reefs have interesting species assemblages, with prolific growth of some species normally subdominant in other reef areas. The reefs were in an excellent state of health, at the time of these surveys free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific recently and with no evidence of any coral diseases. Our data include new distribution records for species of algae, coral and fishes. Fish communities were abundant and diverse and included pelagic fishes such as tuna and oceanic mackerels. Significant populations of grey reef, whitetip reef, and blacktip reef sharks were also observed indicating a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Reef macropredators (trevally, Napoleon wrasse) were also abundant. The deep-sea camera recorded images of deep-water sharks including six-gilled and Pacific sleeper sharks. Marine mammal sightings include bottlenose dolphins, Pacific spinner dolphins, beaked whales (Mesoplodon spp.), and unidentified whales. Sea birds observed on Rawaki, McKean, Enderbury, and Orona Islands included tens of thousands of nesting spectacled terns (grey-backed), sooty terns, white fairy-terns, brown noddies, blue-grey noddies, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-footed boobies, red-tailed tropic birds, great frigate birds and lesser frigate birds. Green sea turtle nesting sites were identified on Nikumaroro, McKean and Phoenix Islands.

The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding population trends were stable. Given that seabird populations can provide valuable information on the conditions of their feeding and nesting environments, this study highlights the need to maintain basics monitoring studies. ¬© 2013 D.

Part II: The Bay of Biscay and the English Channel","Seabird distributions and the associated seasonal variations remain challenging to investigate, especially in oceanic areas. Recent advances in telemetry have provided considerable information on seabird ecology, but still exclude small species, non-breeding birds and individuals from inaccessible colonies from any scientific survey. To overcome this issue and investigate seabird distribution and abundance in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA), large-scale aerial surveys were conducted in winter 2011-12 and summer 2012 over a 375,000¬†km2 area encompassing the English Channel (EC) and the Bay of Biscay (BoB). Seabird sightings, from 15 taxonomic groups, added up to 17,506 and 8263 sightings in winter and summer respectively, along 66,307¬†km. Using geostatistical methods, density maps were provided for both seasons. Abundance was estimated by strip transect sampling. Most taxa showed marked seasonal variations in their density and distribution. The highest densities were recorded during winter for most groups except shearwaters, storm-petrels, terns and large-sized gulls. Subsequently, the abundance in winter nearly reached one million individuals and was 2.5 times larger than in summer. The continental shelf and the slope in the BoB and the EC were identified as key areas for seabird conservation, especially during winter, as birds from northern Europe migrate southward after breeding. This large-scale study provided a synoptic view of the seabird community in the ENA, over two contrasting seasons. Our results highlight that oceanic areas harbour an abundant avifauna. Since most of the existing marine protected areas are restricted to the coastal fringe, the importance of oceanic areas in winter should be considered in future conservation plans. Our work will provide a baseline for the monitoring of seabird distribution at sea, and could inform the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.dsr2.2016.11.012","2-s2.0-85007441209",18,0.826886112,0

"86","bird_oceanic","Assessing the impacts of fishing and habitat loss on the Lord Howe Island population of flesh-footed shearwaters","The flesh-footed shearwater Puffinus carneipes is a medium-sized seabird with a single eastern Australian population breeding on Lord Howe Island. Other breeding populations exist in New Zealand, south-western Western Australia and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. Tagging and banding studies indicate that breeding birds of the Lord Howe Island population inhabit waters mainly to the west of the Island during October to May. Birds then migrate north to waters surrounding Japan during the Austral winter. Seabirds are attracted to the baited hooks of longline vessels and can become snagged and drown as the line sinks into the water. Observations of flesh-footed shearwater (FFS) bycatch in Australian waters have been recorded on both Japanese and domestic longline fishing vessels. Increased observer coverage between 2002 and 2004 on Australian longline vessels, in order to monitor the effectiveness of an under-water setting chute and various line-weighting regimes, showed large bycatch rates of seabirds, and in particular flesh-footed shearwaters (Baker and Wise, 2005). In addition, substantial reductions in colony size have occurred on the island due to housing development. As a consequence of these sources of additional mortality, concerns have been expressed about the population's sustainability. Australia has international and national obligations to ensure that fishery interactions with seabird populations are not deleterious to their populations. The ""incidental catch (or by-catch) of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations"" has been listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as a key threatening process for seabirds (Environment Australia, 1998). Flesh-footed shearwaters were nominated as being at risk from longline fishing. This paper presents a quantitative impact assessment that fully integrates information on the biology, foraging distributions, links to oceanography, fishing interactions (Northern and Southern Hemisphere), and potential impacts from housing on Lord Howe Island. A discrete age-, sex- and colony-structured model is developed that accounts for natural and fishing mortality, together with potential consequences from the loss of nesting habitat on Lord Howe Island. The model is able to fit to tagging data on breeding foraging distributions. These data assist the model in predicting where the birds might be when at sea. The birds' position is assumed to be a function of time of year, sea surface temperature and longitude. Using the predicted positions, the model fits to data on the observed bycatch from the Australian domestic longline fishery. These data enable the model to predict the probability of catching a bird, given various operational characteristics (e.g. setting at night). The model also fits to data from the two surveys of breeding abundance that have occurred on Lord Howe Island.",NA,"2-s2.0-80052979401",63,0.806503312,1

Consequently, we studied coastal shorebird distributions and community composition by conducting monthly surveys at 40, 0.5-km linear plots along sandy beaches of coastal northern California from January through April 1996. We recorded 12 species, whose ranked abundances were consistent between winter (January-February) and spring (March-April). However, five of the six commonest species were more abundant in winter than spring. Among beaches, we detected a mean of 2.6 ¬± 2.3 (SD; range: 0-9) species and 12.0 ¬± 14.1 (range: 0-62) individuals. Number of species correlated positively with total shorebird abundance. Most species' abundances varied greatlv among sites; nine taxa had aggregated spatial distributions, one species was hyper-dispersed, and two species were randomly distributed among beaches. Species composition of the shorebird community was highly nested, partly because abundant species were more widespread in their occurrence than less-numerous taxa. More species and individuals occurred at sites near Humboldt Bay, probably because high tides forced birds off their principal feeding areas within the bay to adjacent beaches. Variation in shorebird use of beaches suggests that some areas are more important to wintering and migrating shorebirds than other locations. Although current levels of human activity in coastal northern California do not appear to influence distributions of nonbreeding shorebirds, we suggest that monitoring and management plans be considered to minimize potential negative impacts of recreational activities, which are certain to increase with human population size and recreational use of beaches.","10.1648/0273-8570-71.1.1","2-s2.0-0034391507",7,0.780344381,0

Similarly, during this period, geese used two foraging sites. However, in 2001, the average number of birds decreased by half and the primary foraging sites were used only rarely. This coincided with a decline of about 95% in the biomass of roots and rhizomes of eelgrass (Zostera marina) that occurred between October 2000 and 2001. Eelgrass is the principal food of geese in this estuary. In addition, there was a reduction of around 50% in the numbers of common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), which feed on invertebrates associated with eelgrass. Lower than usual weekly abundances of geese and goldeneye are probably the result of an unusually short residence time in the estuary, rather than a decline in the total number of visiting migrants. We attribute these changes in the distribution and abundance of geese and goldeneyes to the dramatic decline in eelgrass.","10.1007/s101520100075","2-s2.0-0036767802",19,0.777297244,1

Relative abundance and spatial distribution at sea between 1980-1999 and 2000-2002 periods were compared. This study took place in a standardized monitoring at sea carried out with Coast Guard vessels following the line transect method. This work rests on 107 551 standardized counts of one minute before ‚ÄúErika‚Äù and 23 449 after the oil spill. There was not a simple correlation between the number of individuals found oiled and the numerical variation of the populations at sea during the two years following the accident. The guillemot Uria aalge, the most frequently collected species in the north of the Bay of Biscay, showed no decrease in at sea abundance during the two years following the pollution. Conversely, some species found in small numbers on the coast (e.g. divers Gavia sp., razorbill Alca torda, common scoter Melanitta nigra) decreased significantly at sea (20 to 80%). Overall, marine bird populations declined significantly in the northern sector of the Bay of Biscay (48¬∞32' to 46¬∞58' north) and increased in the southern sector (45¬∞13' to 43¬∞15' north), whereas decreases and increases occurred in the central sector (46¬∞57' to 45¬∞14' north). Changes in the spatial distribution of the species after the ‚ÄúErika‚Äù oil spill occurred through disappearance or retraction (Bay of Vilaine, Houat-Hoedic archipelago), or through displacement and reinforcement (Gouf of Capbreton).

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.","10.1017/S0030605308099997","2-s2.0-67349234507",38,0.761818988,0
"156","bird_oceanic","Dietary change in Cape gannets reflects distributional and demographic shifts in two South African commercial fish stocks","Seabirds are upper trophic level predators, and are often highly sensitive to changes in the availability of their prey. Altered prey assemblages resulting from fluctuations in oceanographic conditions may be mirrored by shifts in seabird diet. Long-term studies of dietary change in seabirds therefore provide valuable insight into the nature of environmental shifts within the systems in which they forage. In recent decades, the Agulhas region in South Africa has undergone significant oceanographic change related to warming and intensification of the Agulhas current. Concurrent with this change, the population ofCape gannets Morus capensis at Bird Island, Algoa Bay, has grownrapidly, probably as a result of an increased availability of its dominant prey items, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus.Using one of the longest andmost complete time-series available on diet of a seabird (spanning 34 years), we tested for changes in composition and the abundance of dominant prey species of this population. These observed changeswere also comparedwith acoustic survey estimates of their biomass, and annual catch data. Since 1979, the prey composition has remained similar, but the dietary contribution of sardine and anchovy, which fluctuated inversely to each other, increased over the study period. These shifts seemto be reflective of fluctuations in the stock size of sardine and anchovy. Conversely, a third species, saury Scomberesox saurus, dominant in the non-breedingdiet of the 1980s, decreased significantly in dietary abundance over the following two decades. It is likely that dietary shifts of Cape gannets at Bird Island were related to climate-mediated oceanographic change. The implications of such changes are discussed. ¬© International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014. All rights reserved.","10.1093/icesjms/fsu203","2-s2.0-84925661732",29,0.756822619,1

Cod, once an abundant fish species that had been commercially exploited for many decades, declined precipitously during the mid-1980s onwards. This decline was attributed to climatic changes that affected the entire food chain from zooplankton to fish, sea birds and marine mammals. A monitoring programme was introduced, sampling cod by otter trawling using research vessels. The fish, after capture, were frozen at - 20¬∞C, subsequently thawed and the digestive tract removed and examined for the parasite in 2006. Data from samples taken in 1976, 1980-81, 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2003 were compared statistically with those collected in 2006. The results indicate a decline in the prevalence and mean abundance of E. gadi in 1986 with a minimum in 2000 but increasing gradually in 2003 and 2006. These changes were coincident initially with a decline of oceanic temperature and the entire food web, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), a preferred prey of cod and primary source of E. gadi. The increase in prevalence and mean abundance of the parasite in 2006 were associated with an increase of oceanic temperature and the return of small schools of capelin to offshore areas. Cod older than 4 years harboured a greater abundance of E. gadi than younger fish, while no difference was observed between the sexes. The results suggest that the abundance of E. gadi can be useful as a bioindicator of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic. ¬© 2008 Cambridge University Press.","10.1017/S0022149X0897615X","2-s2.0-55949132378",24,0.754835992,1

Among seven geographical parameters island area was the main determinant of species richness for both the whole bird community and each category of species associated with four habitat types. Species richness decreased most markedly with island size in the smallest islands and in open habitat species. The rarest forest species were the most extinction prone with decreasing island size. Specific habitat selection was the most prominent ecological correlate of inter island species distribution. Observed species distribution patterns did not fit the random species placement or equiprobable occurrence hypotheses. Raptors were primarily forest species, two of them restricted to forest interior, two more tolerant of fragmentation and one naturally associated with mangroves. Unexpectedly, the two rarest and most area sensitive raptors were the two smallest species with a strong active flight, whereas the most abundant and widespread species was the most forest interior and endemic taxon. Both raptor species richness, species frequency of occurrence and abundance indices decreased with island area, which was consistently tile most significant determinant of every species' occurrence and abundance. There was a significant correlation between abundance or frequency of occurrence of every raptor species and the proportion of their preferred habitat type. No relationship was found between habitat niche breadth or local abundance of any species and their distribution range among islands. The hypothesis of random composition of species assemblages on islands was not supported because of species specific habitat selection. Any evidence of interspecific competitive exclusion was limited to the striking habitat segregation of the two congeneric serpent eagles. A metapopulation structure was suggested by small population distribution patterns, observed sea crossing and tile circumstances of an apparent extinction.","10.1111/j.1600-0587.1997.tb00348.x","2-s2.0-0030618891",55,0.754064106,0

"195","bird_oceanic","Avian abundances on yap, federated states of Micronesia, after typhoon sudall","Typhoons can add to chronic threats such as incremental habitat loss and pressure from feral predators to jeopardize the unique biodiversity of Pacific Ocean islands. Typhoon Sudall severely damaged Yap, Federated States of Micronesia, in April 2004. To establish an initial assessment of consequences of the typhoon for the avian community on this poorly studied island, we surveyed birds along line transects in mangroves, savannah, and forest on Yap during the last week of August 2004. We found all expected 22 resident species in abundances whose rank order was very similar to results from surveys in the early 1980s. Most-common species were White Tern, Plain White-eye, Micronesian Starling, Micronesian Myzomela, and Yap Monarch. All five species were common in all three major habitats, mangroves, upland forest, and savannah, although terns nested primarily in forests. Least commonly encountered resident species were Common Cicadabird, Micronesian Pigeon, and White-throated Ground-Dove. We found one to six individuals of each of those species. We also encountered 27 species of migratory birds, including the first record for Yap of Greater Scaup. Populations of birds appeared to be about 50% lower across all resident species than estimates from 1983-1984, suggesting the possibility that Typhoon Sudall caused widespread mortality. However, other possible explanations for reduced abundances exist, which we review briefly. A long-term monitoring plan is needed to track population dynamics of birds on Yap. ¬© 2016 by University of Hawai'i Press.","10.2984/70.4.3","2-s2.0-84994680283",10,0.742851037,1
"205","bird_oceanic","Shorebird seasonal abundance and habitat-use patterns in punta rasa, samboromb√≥n bay, Argentina","Shorebird assemblage composition and habitat-use patterns were characterized at Punta Rasa during the austral summer, autumn and winter. Compared to other sites within the region, this area showed high species richness, reflected by a total of 22 species recorded within a relatively short time frame. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by the use of estuarine mudflats and oceanic sandy beaches as feeding habitats. During low tide, more species used estuarine environments, achieving the highest total densities. Abundance patterns and assemblage composition also changed seasonally. Maximum total abundance occurred during the austral summer, and minimum total abundance during the austral winter. During the austral summer, the assemblage was dominated by Nearctic migrants such as American Golden-Plover (Pluvialis dominica), Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica) and White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis). In addition, Two-banded Plover (Charadrius falklandicus) and American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) were abundant during the austral autumn. The Red Knot (Calidris canutus), a shorebird that dominated the austral autumn assemblage 25 years ago, was recorded in relatively small numbers during this study, probably reflecting the global population trend of a subspecies of the Red Knot (C. c. rufa) in the past two decades. During the austral winter, resident birds largely dominated the assemblage. However, it is noteworthy that some individuals of nine Nearctic migrant species remained in the area. In the case of the endangered Red Knot, Punta Rasa is, along with Lagoa do Peixe in Brazil, one of the sites in South America with the highest known abundances during the austral winter. .","10.1675/063.038.0109","2-s2.0-84926505057",13,0.739160613,1

The catch composition and CPUE values expressed in weight and number showed that the most abundant species were Carcharhinus perezi and C. falciformis for Los Roques Archipelago and La Blanquilla Island, while C perezi and Ginglymostoma cirratum were more common in Las Aves Archipelago. In Los Roques Archipelago, C perezi and C falciformis were most common during the second half of the year; a similar trend was observed for the rest of the shark species caught by the fishery. A positive relationship was observed between CPUE and fishing depth in the case of C. perezi and C falciformis off Los Roques Archipelago: CPUE by weight increases with depth, while CPUE by number decreases with depth.

EN 1982-83 exceeded all these earlier events in strength and duration, and was the first to be investigated in more detail, both on a latitudinal gradient and including, for the first time, the benthic subsystem of the Humboldt Current upwelling area off the west coast of South America. Despite the fact that the coverage of the area of major impact (over 4,000 km of coastline) was by no means complete, and that most of the causes and mechanisms behind the observed changes remained unclear due to the lack of experimental (e.g. tolerance) studies, the observational evidence and the fluctuations observed in the landing statistics have contributed a great deal to our understanding of the way in which a major EN event affects the upwelling system as a whole. In the pelagic subsystem, a surface temperature increase of up to 11¬∞C, the effects of which could be traced down to at least 1,000 m depth, led to a tropicalization of the ecosystem, the disruption of the normal food web, and induced changes in species composition and migrations of a large number of fish and invertebrate species populations. This resulted in a general impoverishment of this system. The consequences for some commercially important species, which had already been damaged by former EN events and the impact of overfishing, were severe off Peru and Ecuador although there were certain positive effects due to the inshore migration of various oceanic mackerels and the southward migration of (sub)tropical fish species such as dolphinfish and skipjack tuna. These beneficial effects were, however, only of minor importance for the fisheries, which were not equipped to deal with the new target species. In the benthic subsystem, a factor of major importance, besides the increase in temperature, was the marked increase of dissolved oxygen at the seafloor during and after the event. Despite mass mortalities of many of the cold-water adapted invertebrate species on sandy beaches, shallow soft bottoms and in the rocky intertidal zone, the overall effect on fisheries was rather positive. In the case of commercially exploited shellfish (‚Äúmariscos‚Äù), this was due to an increased immigration of subtropical species, mostly crustaceans, as well as increases in abundance of some local species more tolerant of warm water such as the Peruvian scallop. This led to an unprecedented boom of some fisheries on the northern and central Peruvian coast. For the demersal fisheries and the artisanal finfish fishery, the immediate effects of EN were detrimental due to a general dispersal and downslope migration of many species, but the long-term effects appeared to have been beneficial: improved feeding conditions at the seafloor and decreased fishing pressure caused a major recruitment success of some species such as Pacific hake, and this may provide increased catches several years after EN. The primary EN effects described in this review apparently induced many secondary effects. The disruption of the pelagic food web caused mortalities and reproductive failures of guano birds and seals; mortalities (including marine algae) and increases in population abundance in shallow water led to temporary changes in species composition and successional processes that remain to be studied in more detail. On the whole, however, recovery of most species occurred rapidly, and relatively few long-term effects have remained, demonstrating the remarkable resilience of the upwelling ecosystem. ¬© 1990, Elsevier B.V.

"254","bird_oceanic","Changes in bird species composition on a remote and well-forested Wallacean Island, South-East Asia","In South-East Asia patterns of forest loss can predict the number of threatened birds. On the oceanic islands of Wallacea, small-scale agriculture, rather than commercial logging, is the main cause of forest loss and conversion, but few studies have directly examined their responses to land use. In 2001, I studied the birds of primary forest and anthropogenic gardens on the well-forested, and remote, Damar Island (198 km2) in the Banda Sea. Furthermore, I examined broad changes to the islands bird fauna by comparing baseline bird lists obtained in the 19th century with 2001 data. The conversion of primary forest to garden resulted in substantial changes in avifaunal composition, and to the abundance of individual bird species, particularly to frugivorous and globally restricted-range species. Of 15 common birds, four were significantly more abundant in primary forest (blue-tailed imperial pigeon Ducula concinna, northern fantail Rhipidura rufiventris, golden whistler Pachycephala pectoralis and red-chested flowerpecker Dicaeum maugei) and one (scaly-breasted honeyeater Lichmera squamata) was more abundant in garden habitat. Incidental observations provided further evidence that many forest specialists (including the island endemic Damar flycatcher Ficedula henrici) rarely, if ever, used garden habitats notwithstanding its relative proximity. The number of resident birds recorded in 2001 (39) was similar to the 1890s (38), but six forest-dependent passerines were extirpated between samples. These losses are associated with the conversion of 25% of the primary forest to modified habitat since the 1890s, but given the sparse species and environmental change data available it is impossible to definitively pinpoint this as the only cause underlying the species losses. This study demonstrates that remote and relatively well-forested islands are not immune to the threatening processes impacting bird populations elsewhere in South-East Asia. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Muttonbirders concerned at ensuring that the hunt remains viable for coming generations have provided catch records to help ascertain historic trends in hunt success. Analysis of eight catch diaries for a 67-year period demonstrates considerable consistency across diaries in the variability of hunt success, as measured by annualized mean daily hunt tallies. A conservative estimate of the overall annual decline in hunt success is-1.89% (95% CI:-1.14% to-2.65%). Birders' observations of a changing relationship between chick quality and hunt success was evidenced across diaries. Reduced hunt success from the 1990s indicates that possible adult ""knockdowns"" and/or sustained substantial reductions in breeding proportions have occurred. Chick size has remained constant, suggesting little change in the provisioning environment. Catch per unit effort data, provided by a single diary, confirms a link between variability in annual hunt success and chick abundance. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are correlated with hunt success and chick size, respectively. Interannual PDO+ (or PDO-) values are correlated with higher (or lower) tallies, whereas SAM+ (or SAM -) values are associated with larger (or smaller) chick size. Uncertainty in the relationship between the breeding Sooty Shearwater population, chick catch, and environmental perturbation in their feeding grounds could be reduced with the inclusion of hunt time in all diary records. Ongoing prolonged decline in a top-trophic-level predator such as the Sooty Shearwater raises serious concern that long-term oceanic changes have been occurring and that long-term sustainability of muttonbirding is in doubt. ¬© 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/09-0813.1","2-s2.0-79958852967",60,0.707019582,1
"274","bird_oceanic","Trends in carbon flux to seabirds in the Peruvian upwelling system: Effects of wind and fisheries on population regulation","We hypothesized that change in the annual population size of guano-producing seabirds (cormorant, Phalacrocorax bougainvillii; booby, Sula variegata; pelican, Pelecanus thagus) is a response to changes in primary and secondary production of the Peruvian upwelling system. We tested this hypothesis by modeling nitrate input through upwelling to the upper layers of the ocean off Peru between 6¬∞ and 14¬∞S using data on wind stress and sea surface temperature. The model predicted the amount of carbon fixed by primary production each year from 1925 to 2000, which was then apportioned to the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass and ultimately to the seabird population and the anchovy fishery, the largest single-species fishery on Earth. The model predicted a marked increase in primary production as a consequence of increasing wind stress. It overestimated the anchovy biomass after the collapse of the fishery in 1972, but closely predicted the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to the mid-1960s, and their decline thereafter, explaining about 94% of the variation in seabird numbers from 1925 to 2000. The model indicates the seabirds consumed 14.4% of the available anchovies and, thus, that seabirds consumed 2.3% of the new production, before the development of the anchovy fishery, and only 2.2% of the available anchovies and 0.3% of the new production after the development of the fishery. The model results clarify the roles that environmental and anthropogenic factors may have had in regulating the guano-producing seabird populations. It indicates that the growth of seabird populations from 1925 to 1955 was likely a response to increased productivity of the Peruvian upwelling system and that the subsequent drastic decline in seabird abundance was likely due to competition for food with the fishery, which caught ‚àº85% of the anchovies, which otherwise would have been available for the seabirds. This model also shows that an increase in oceanic primary production promotes reproductive success and population growth in higher trophic level organisms.","10.1111/j.1365-2419.2004.00283.x","2-s2.0-2442626623",40,0.70641852,1

"295","bird_oceanic","Migrants in Neotropical bird communities: An assessment of the breeding currency hypothesis","1. Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4. Other factors may interact with the availability of food for nestlings to limit the populations of resident birds below carrying capacities set by non-breeding season arthropod abundance, thereby creating a set of resources available to non-breeding migrants. ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00928.x","2-s2.0-16244419776",4,0.696474003,0

"318","bird_oceanic","Sampling mobile oceanic fishes and sharks: Implications for fisheries and conservation planning","Tuna, billfish, and oceanic sharks [hereafter referred to as ‚Äòmobile oceanic fishes and sharks‚Äô (MOFS)] are characterised by conservative life-history strategies and highly migratory behaviour across large, transnational ranges. Intense exploitation over the past 65 years by a rapidly expanding high-seas fishing fleet has left many populations depleted, with consequences at the ecosystem level due to top-down control and trophic cascades. Despite increases in both CITES and IUCN Red Listings, the demographic trajectories of oceanic sharks and billfish are poorly quantified and resolved at geographic and population levels. Amongst MOFS trajectories, those of tunas are generally considered better understood, yet several populations remain either overfished or of unknown status. MOFS population trends and declines therefore remain contentious, partly due to challenges in deriving accurate abundance and biomass indices. Two major management strategies are currently recognised to address conservation issues surrounding MOFS: (i) internationally ratified legal frameworks and their associated regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs); and (ii) spatio-temporal fishery closures, including no-take marine protected areas (MPAs). In this context, we first review fishery-dependent studies relying on data derived from catch records and from material accessible through fishing extraction, under the umbrella of RFMO-administrated management. Challenges in interpreting catch statistics notwithstanding, we find that fishery-dependent studies have enhanced the accuracy of biomass indices and the management strategies they inform, by addressing biases in reporting and non-random effort, and predicting drivers of spatial variability across meso- and oceanic scales in order to inform stock assessments. By contrast and motivated by the increase in global MPA coverage restricting extractive activities, we then detail ways in which fishery-independent methods are increasingly improving and steering management by exploring facets of MOFS ecology thus far poorly grasped. Advances in telemetry are increasingly used to explore ontogenic and seasonal movements, and provide means to consider MOFS migration corridors and residency patterns. The characterisation of trophic relationships and prey distribution through biochemical analysis and hydro-acoustics surveys has enabled the tracking of dietary shifts and mapping of high-quality foraging grounds. We conclude that while a scientific framework is available to inform initial design and subsequent implementation of MPAs, there is a shortage in the capacity to answer basic but critical questions about MOFS ecology (who, when, where?) required to track populations non-extractively, thereby presenting a barrier to assessing empirically the performance of MPA-based management for MOFS. This sampling gap is exacerbated by the increased establishment of large (&gt;10000 km2) and very large MPAs (VLMPAs, &gt;100000 km2) - great expanses of ocean lacking effective monitoring strategies and survey regimes appropriate to those scales. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate the use of a non-extractive protocol to measure MOFS population recovery and MPA efficiency. We further identify technological avenues for monitoring at the VLMPA scale, through the use of spotter planes, drones, satellite technology, and horizontal acoustics, and highlight their relevance to the ecosystem-based framework of MOFS management. ¬© 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","10.1111/brv.12246","2-s2.0-85028973645",61,0.692280096,1

We identified and enumerated seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans along a replicated 1500 km survey path, representing 450 km2 of coastal and 2000 km 2 of oceanic habitat. Near-surface temperature (5 m depth) fluctuated considerably from year to year, in part due to the timing of the survey, with an early survey in 1996 and a late survey in 2002. Many species were observed across the entire gradient, particularly procellariiform (tubenose) seabirds and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). We observed peaks in abundance in the oceanic zone in 1998, 2001, and 2002, owing primarily to influxes of dark shearwaters (Puffinus spp.) and Leach's storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leuchora). Rank correlations indicated similar year-to-year changes in density between species, and species-specific responses to temperature and ocean productivity as indexed by nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations. We developed topographic/bathymetric models of habitat selection for the coastal zone. Although we found some distinct habitat preferences in this zone, overall we observed a continuum in the marine bird and mammal community across the entire eastern GOA. The strength of the coupling between coastal and oceanic environments as provided by variation in top predator dispersion appears related to large-scale variations in oceanography, though we have yet to fully investigate causal mechanisms. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical dominance is often cited as key to the ability of exotic ants to displace native ant species, reduce the abundance of invertebrates and negatively impact upon bird, land crab and other vertebrate populations. On Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, the yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes (Jerdon), forms supercolonies, where extremely high densities of foraging ants have contributed to 'invasional meltdown' in rainforest areas. Densities of up to 2254 foraging ants per m2 and a biomass of 1.85 g per m2 were recorded, and nest densities reached 10.5 nest entrances per m2. Populations of A. gracilipes can overcome and kill red endemic land crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis) over 100 times their own biomass. This is the highest recorded density of foraging ants, and adds another element to the definition of 'supercolony' of unicolonial ants. This paper documents one extreme in a continuum of densities of unicolonial, invasive ant species and highlights the need to incorporate forager densities into invasive ant research. ¬© Birkh√§user Verlag, 2005.","10.1007/s00040-005-0800-6","2-s2.0-23944515511",16,0.653710583,0

This decline is negatively correlated with a concurrent rise in sea-surface temperatures; Sooty Shearwaters have declined while sea temperatures have risen. There is a nine-month lag in the response by shearwaters to changing temperatures. The geographical scale of our study demonstrates that the decline of Sooty Shearwaters is not a localized phenomenon, nor can it be ascribed to a short-term distributional shift. The Sooty Shearwater is the numerically dominant species of the California Current System (CCS) in summer (austral winter), with an estimated population in the late 1970s of 5 million individuals. If the observed warming of the waters of the California Current System is an irreversible manifestation of a changing global climate, then the impact upon Sooty Shearwater populations seems likely to be profound. ¬© 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.","10.1046/j.1365-2486.1997.d01-130.x","2-s2.0-0031005673",6,0.649622936,1

Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Friugilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future post-fire management plans.

Our results corroborate earlier suggestions that Long-tailed Ducks exhibit ecological plasticity in selecting winter habitat and food. The majority of Long-tailed Ducks occurred in hard-bottom habitats where they relied on the bivalve Mytilus edulis; however, some of the population wintered in less productive, soft-bottom habitats where they employed a prey-selective foraging strategy, in which they fed on less abundant, but energy rich, crustaceans. Both strategies were apparently viable, as dissected birds in both habitats were in good body condition and had substantial fat reserves.","10.1676/04-045","2-s2.0-21044447960",8,0.545829496,0
"631","bird_oceanic","Multiple links between species diversity and temporal stability in bird communities across North America","Background: In experimental systems, the temporal stability of entire ecological communities usually increases with the number of species (called 'species richness'). In contrast, ecology has not discovered the pattern of stability with the complement of richness, which is evenness of species abundances. The job has been more difficult because many measures of species diversity combine richness with evenness. Questions: Does the correlation of richness with stability occur in natural systems? What is the relationship of evenness to stability? Does diversity increase or decrease the stability of individual species populations? What mechanisms explain the relationships, if any, between diversity and stability? Data: The 1966-2009 results of 1676 North American Breeding Bird (BBS) survey routes across the USA and Canada. Altogether, 617 bird species were registered with an average of 105 species observed per route. Climate variables were taken from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Climate Services Canada databases. Analytical methods: Disentangle richness from evenness and study their separate effects on stability. Perform statistical analysis of biological variables developed from the BBS data. Control for biological and climatic influences. Results: Both the number of bird species and the evenness of their distributions positively affect the stability of entire bird communities. But richness and evenness do so through a contrasting set of mechanisms. Also, richness and evenness both positively affect the stability of individual populations. The link between evenness and mean population stability can be partly, but not completely, explained in terms of a previously established relationship between the mean and variance of abundance known as Taylor's Law. ¬© 2011.",NA,"2-s2.0-84856941914",22,0.513535748,1
"641","bird_oceanic","Bird communities in two oceanic island forests fragmented by roads on Tenerife, Canary Islands","Although most studies on road effects on birds have been conducted on continental grounds, road fragmentation on oceanic islands is often heavier. We assessed variation in bird communities near (‚â§25 m) and far (>100 m) from forest roads dividing laurel and pine forests on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Line transects were used as the census technique. We compared community structure and species responses between both forests, and among forest interior and edges of paved and unpaved roads. We analysed richness and diversity of species in these different situations, and tested for significance in bird community descriptors and species abundance responses to road proximity. The bird community of the laurel forest showed significantly higher average population density, richness, diversity and evenness than that of the pine forest. None of the two forests showed significant differences in community descriptors between edge and interior, except for a higher evenness along unpaved roads in the laurel forest. However, the bird community showed more overall abundances, richness and diversity on unpaved than on asphalt road edges in laurel forest. Excepting two passerines (Turdus merula in laurel forest and Phylloscopus canariensis in pine forest), all species had similar abundances on road edges and forest interior regardless of forest type. Most species might be regarded as forest generalists. Changes detected between edge and interior on road-fragmented forests were, overall, small at the bird community level. Managers should consider the effects of road edge and road type on the more sensitive species in present and future road planning.

Satellite imagery and historical data have identified the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as a site of enhanced biological productivity. Meso-scale surveys off the Antarctic peninsula have related the abundances of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) to inter-annual variations in sea-ice extent. Here we have examined the ecosystem structure and oceanography spanning 3,500 km of the east Antarctic coastline, linking the scales of local surveys and global observations. Between 80¬∞and 150¬∞E there is a threefold variation in the extent of annual sea-ice cover, enabling us to examine the regional effects of sea ice and ocean circulation on biological productivity. Phytoplankton, primary productivity, Antarctic krill, whales and seabirds were concentrated where winter sea-ice extent is maximal, whereas salps were located where the sea-ice extent is minimal. We found enhanced biological activity south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current rather than in association with it. We propose that along this coastline ocean circulation determines both the sea-ice conditions and the level of biological productivity at all trophic levels.","10.1038/35020053","2-s2.0-0034601473",25,0.50788918,0
"69","bird_oceanic","The pelagic distribution of marine birds in a heterogeneous environment","In this paper I review recent, small‚Äêscale, process‚Äêoriented studies of the pelagic distribution of marine birds. I examine the roles played by a variety of hydrographic features, including steep flow gradients (fronts) and water column stratification, in determining the abundance or availability of avian prey. The ice edge/marginal ice zone is a frontal area of particular interest in polar regions. In most oceanic systems we have examples of avian use of a feature, hut only poor information on the importance of the feature for supporting the population as a whole. I review recent studies of the spatial and numerical concordance of marine birds and their prey, and find that these studies have yielded mixed results, with correlations stronger for piscivorous birds, particularly murres foraging on capelin, than for planktivores. Review of investigations of multispecies interactions during foraging shows that flock foraging has both beneficial and negative aspects. Interspecific facilitation of foraging occurs in numerous interactions involving both other species of birds and marine mammals. However, co‚Äêoccurrence of predators may occur because both seek the same prey, and caution must be used in assessing mutualistic interactions between predatory species.

"711","bird_oceanic","What determines the temporal changes of species degree and strength in an oceanic island plant-disperser network?","Network models of frugivory and seed dispersal are usually static. To date, most studies on mutualistic networks assert that interaction properties such as species' degree (k) and strength (s) are strongly influenced by species abundances. We evaluated how species' degree and strength change as a function of temporal variation not only in species abundance, but also in species persistence (i.e., phenology length). In a two-year study, we collected community-wide data on seed dispersal by birds and examined the seasonal dynamics of the above-mentioned interaction properties. Our analyses revealed that species abundance is an important predictor for plant strength within a given sub-network. However, our analyses also reveal that species' degree can often be best explained by the length of fruiting phenology (for plants degree) or by the number of fruiting species (for dispersers degree), which are factors that can be decoupled from the relative abundance of the species participating in the network. Moreover, our results suggest that generalist dispersers (when total study period is considered) act as temporal generalists, with degree constrained by the number of plant species displaying fruits in each span. Along with species identity, our findings underscore the need for a temporal perspective, given that seasonality is an inherent property of many mutualistic networks. ¬© 2012 Gonz√°lez-Castro et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0041385","2-s2.0-84864245897",15,0.381473884,0

One of the best preserved tracts is at Raydah near Abha, where a complete altitudinal floristic zonation persists. Although only about 125 bird species have been recorded in the area, the community is of considerable conservation interest due to high densities of endemic species and resident or breeding Afrotropical forest species, together with a wide range of diurnal raptors, owls and nightjars. The forest does not appear to support many Palearctic-African migrants during periods of passage, although several Palearctic species overwinter in considerable numbers. Scrub and mixed deciduous and riparian forest scattered throughout the junipers hold highest bird diversities but the juniper stands are vitally important to the well-being of Yemen Thrush Turdus menachensis, Yemen Warbler Parisoma buryi and Yemen Linnet Carduelis yemenensis populations.

The two sites, on the Caribbean and the Pacific coasts, differ importantly in annual rainfall, tide amplitude, and seasonal invertebrate abundance. Most migrant species varied temporally in abundance with the opposite pattern at each site, suggesting mid-winter movements correlated with abundance of food resources. Because of their wide geographic distribution and their particular response to hydrographic factors, mangroves are likely to have a temporally complementary role in sustaining migrant populations throughout the Neptropics. However, variations in migrant numbers reported in other Neotropical habitats could also reflect large-scale movements by migrants.

A mid-monthly counting scheme runs from October to March (all species, both geese and swans), additional counts being organised for Greylag Geese in Semptember and Brent Geese in May (Tab. 1). Prior to 1993, only geese were taken into account whereas census work was mainly undertaken during periods of peak-occurrence of the various species. Seven goose and three swan species occur as regular visitors to The Netherlands. Most abundant species are White-fronted, Greylag, Barnacle and Brent Geese. In all species numbers recorded are of international importance (Tab. 13). Occurrence of Bewick's Swan and Pink-footed, White-fronted, Greylag, Barnacle and Brent Geese highlight the important position of the Netherlands in the West-Palearctic network of flyways. The entire Svalbard population of Pinkfooted Goose stages in the Netherlands in autumn (November). Since the 1960s most species have shown a marked increase (Fig. 2). This trend conforms with overal West-Palearctic trends, often attributed to better protection measures (lower hunting pressure), improvement of feeding habitats in winter and/or changes in flyways. Results of Dutch counts suggest that in most species population growth has levelled off during the 1990s. Fluctuations in numbers over the past decades may be due to severe winter conditions, resulting in an influx of species which regularly winter in the Baltic or eastern Europe (e.g. Whooper Swan, Tundra and Taiga Bean Goose), or in an efflux of birds wintering in The Netherlands to the British Isles and Belgium and northern France (e.g. Bewick's Swan, White-fronted Goose). Since there were no severe winters during 1990/91-1994/95 (Fig. 1), goose and swan numbers as well as seasonal patterns and distribution throughout the country refect the situation in mild winters. The series of mild winters from 1986/87 onwards, eventually may have contributed to increasing numbers of wintering Bewick's Swans and Greylag Geese, whereas numbers of Whooper Swan and Taiga and Tundra Bean Geese have dropped to a lower level as compared to the 1980s.",NA,"2-s2.0-0031669248",51,0.740698458554578,1

In the spring and summer of 1992, however, the aerosol cloud resulting from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo (Philippines) had reached the high northern latitudes and caused significant cooling in most of the Arctic, with widespread negative consequences for Arctic-breeding birds. At the same time, low abundance of small rodents and high abundance of predators presented additional problems for breeding birds in parts of the Palearctic. We compiled data on breeding biology of Arctic waterfowl and waders from more than 30 field studies to illuminate in what ways the circumpolar bad weather and predation influenced the breeding season of Arctic birds in 1992. Most projects reported a higher proportion of nonbreeders and a delayed onset of nest initiation compared to other years. Hatching and fledging success of the low number of late breeders was reduced. In addition, some projects reported lower clutch sizes and increased adult mortality. Detailed data from field studies are complemented by data on overall reproductive success of waterfowl and wader populations collected from staging and wintering grounds. In total, there was an almost complete reproductive failure for waders and waterfowl throughout the Arctic in 1992, suggesting a short-term effect on global waterbird populations. This is an example of climatic fluctuations influencing reproductive biology of a group of species on a circumpolar scale.","10.14430/arctic859","2-s2.0-0033675997",39,0.803868275833811,0

Turtle Doves require tall, overgrown bushes for nesting and short weed-rich areas for feeding, but agricultural intensification has markedly reduced the availability and suitability of these habitats. Over the last 40 years, Turtle Doves have switched from foraging in 'natural habitats' to those created by humans, and their diet is now primarily seeds from cultivated plants.

The transect was divided into three geographical zones and between protected and unprotected areas. All diurnal raptors were recorded (22 801 individuals), as well as large game birds. Large vultures suffered a dramatic decline (98%) outside protected areas. The Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus population also collapsed in some regions, but survived in central Burkina Faso. Conversely, their abundance index did not decrease significantly in national parks. Four eagle species decreased by 86-93% and seven were not even recorded in the later study outside protected areas; by contrast, in national parks, only three species had declined marginally. Smaller Accipitridae (kites, goshawks, buzzards) also exhibited significant declines outside but not within national parks where woodland species reached their highest densities. The Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, mostly European migrants, declined sharply everywhere. African falcons decreased only outside protected areas. Among Palearctic migrants, Montagu's Circus pygargus and Pallid Harriers C. macrourus decreased significantly, Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus less markedly, and Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus and Booted Eagle Hieraaetus pennatus not at all. Similar trends had previously been documented in Cameroon. They are associated with human population growth and development, global habitat degradation and ecosystem impoverishment (woodcutting, agricultural intensification, overgrazing, desertification). Heavy use of pesticides, control of locust outbreaks and overhunting have suppressed major food sources. Vultures may suffer from a shortage of carcasses, poisoning for predator control or persecution for trade of meat and body parts.

Migratory T p philomelos moved southwest in autumn on a broad front. Scandinavian and northwest Russian birds moved down the northwest coast of continental Europe arriving in large numbers in southwest France in October; many adults then moved on to winter in west Iberia. Those ringed in central Europe, from Switzerland to Belarus, tended to follow the Rhine‚ÄìRh√¥ne route to the French Mediterranean before dispersing to winter in east Iberia, the Balearics and Algeria. Southeast European birds moved to north and west Italy in the autumn/early winter, many adults moving on to Corsica or Sardinia. Birds breeding in the Netherlands and northwest Germany appear to have two migration patterns. A short-distance group dispersed through Belgium to northwest France in autumn/early winter, moving on to England and Wales in late winter. A long-distance group migrated to southeast Biscay in October, many then moving on in midwinter to west Iberia.

"157","bird_palearctic","Influence of climate change on the abundance, distribution and phenology of woodland bird species in temperate regions","There is now overwhelming evidence that an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere has caused global temperatures to increase by 0.6¬∞C since 1900 and further increases of between 1.4 and 5.8¬∞C are predicted over the next century. Changes in climatic conditions have already influenced the demography, phenology and distribution of a wide range of plant and animal taxa. This review focuses on the impacts, both observed and potential, of climate change on birds breeding in temperate woodlands of the Western Palaearctic, a significant proportion of which are currently declining. Changes in ambient temperatures and patterns of precipitation may have direct and indirect effects on the survival rates and productivity of bird species, thus influencing population sizes. For some species or populations, the timing of events such as egg-laying and return from the wintering grounds is also changing in relation to shifts in the peak of food availability during the breeding season. The degree to which different individuals are able to track these temporal changes will have a significant bearing on population sizes and distributions in the future. Unless active management steps are taken, the relatively low dispersal rates of tree species may lead to a decrease in the total area of some woodland habitat types as losses at the southern edge of the range are likely to occur much more quickly than expansion at the northern edge. In addition, the dispersal rates of many woodland birds are themselves low, which could affect their ability to move to new habitat patches if currently occupied areas become unsuitable. Thus, woodland birds may be particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00729.x","2-s2.0-36448972743",10,0.712234162784413,1

The purpose of this study was to assess the geographic pattern in the abundance, species richness, and importance of different migration patterns of the boreal forest avifauna of Eurasia from Europe to East Asia as well as their relationship to climate and forest productivity. We further examine data from two widely separated sites in the New World to see how these conform to the patterns found in the Eurasian system. Location: Boreal forest sites in Russia and Canada. Methods: Point counts were conducted in two to four boreal forest habitats at each of 14 sites in the Russian boreal forest from near to the Finnish border to the Far East, as well as at two sites in boreal Canada. We examined the abundance and species richness of all birds, and specific migratory classes, against four gradients (climate, primary productivity, latitude, and longitude). We tested for spatial autocorrelation in both dependent and independent variables using Moran's I to develop spatial correlograms. For each migratory class we used maximum likelihood to fit models, first assuming uncorrelated residuals and then assuming spatially autocorrelated residuals. For models assuming unstructured residuals we again generated correlograms on model residuals to determine whether model fitting removed spatial autocorrelation. Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion, adjusted for small sample size. Results: Overall abundance was highest at the eastern and western extremes of the survey region and lowest at the continent centre, whereas the abundance of tropical and short-distance migrants displayed an east-west gradient, with tropical migrants increasing in abundance in the east (and south), and short-distance migrants in the west. Although overall species richness showed no geographic pattern, richness within migratory classes showed patterns weaker than, but similar to, their abundance patterns described above. Overall abundance was correlated with climate variables that relate to continentality. The abundances of birds within different migration strategies were correlated with a second climatic gradient - increasing precipitation from west to east. Models using descriptors of location generally had greater explanatory value for the abundance and species-richness response variables than did those based on climate data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Main conclusions: The distribution patterns for migrant types were related to both climatic and locational variables, and thus the patterns could be explained by either climatic regime or the accessibility of winter habitats, both historically and currently. Non-boreal wintering habitat is more accessible from both the western and eastern ends than from the centre of the boreal forest belt, but the tropics are most accessible from the eastern end of the Palaearctic boreal zone, in terms of distance and the absence of geographical barriers. Based on comparisons with Canadian sites, we recommend that future comparative studies between Palaearctic and Nearctic faunas be focused more on Siberia and the Russian Far East, as well as on central and western Canada.","10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01954.x","2-s2.0-53949112445",15,0.598347449209879,0
"176","bird_palearctic","Elevational range and timing of breeding in the birds of Ladakh: The effects of body mass, status and diet","We studied the effects of body mass, status (resident or migratory) and diet on the breeding elevation range and timing of reproduction of the birds in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh, northwestern India. Most of breeding birds of Ladakh are Palearctic or breed at high elevations in the mountains. There is a small proportion of Oriental species, and no bird is endemic to this region. We found that heavier birds tended to start their egg-laying earlier than lighter ones. Since body mass is related to the length of incubation and nesting periods, it would appear that one result of this phenomenon is that the time of peak demand for food for most birds coincides with peak food abundance in summer. Status affected the elevation of the breeding range, with resident birds tending to breed at higher elevations than summer visitors. Residents and summer breeders also differed significantly in their diet composition, with the former feeding mainly on plants and seeds, and the latter feeding on molluscs, insects and worms. ¬© Dt.

"186","bird_palearctic","Independent colonization of multiple urban centres by a formerly forest specialist bird species","Urban areas are expanding rapidly, but a few native species have successfully colonized them. The processes underlying such colonization events are poorly understood. Using the blackbird Turdus merula, a former forest specialist that is now one of the most common urban birds in its range, we provide the first assessment of two contrasting urban colonization models. First, that urbanization occurred independently. Second, that following initial urbanization, urban-adapted individuals colonized other urban areas in a leapfrog manner. Previous analyses of spatial patterns in the timing of blackbird urbanization, and experimental introductions of urban and rural blackbirds to uncolonized cities, suggest that the leapfrog model is likely to apply. We found that, across the western Palaearctic, urban blackbird populations contain less genetic diversity than rural ones, urban populations are more strongly differentiated from each other than from rural populations and assignment tests support a rural source population for most urban individuals. In combination, these results provide much stronger support for the independent urbanization model than the leapfrog one. If the former model predominates, colonization of multiple urban centres will be particularly difficult when urbanization requires genetic adaptations, having implications for urban species diversity. ¬© 2009 The Royal Society.","10.1098/rspb.2008.1712","2-s2.0-66749116754",12,0.390099992033152,0
"196","bird_palearctic","Marsh management, reserve creation, hunting periods and carrying capacity for wintering ducks and coots","Many wild species, like waterbirds, are exploited for their economic interests. At present, the annual western Palearctic duck bag is at least 17 million birds. From a sustainable management perspective, wetland users and managers request predictions of spatial distribution and abundance variations of these bird populations. The objective of this study was to analyze local factors potentially influencing the diurnal distribution and population size of wintering ducks and coots, the main game species, in Camargue (southern France). First, we showed that marshland surface area, salinity and hunting disturbance were the principal variables explaining the duck and coot distribution. Secondly, we tested the hypothesis that hunting disturbance would reduce the carrying capacity of the Camargue with two analyses: the effect of creating a protected area and the change of the hunting closing date. This hypothesis was not validated. Our study therefore led us to reconsider the research orientations on the carrying capacity in this wetland. The surface of protected day roosts seems presently sufficient in the Rhone delta. Consequently, to increase the population size with the same level of hunting disturbance at the scale of the Camargue, alternative strategies should be envisaged, such as the creation of nature reserves on nocturnal feeding ground or the creation of large management units with limited disturbance. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-008-9562-6","2-s2.0-67649333129",21,0.668614755809502,0

Using GIS and Distance Sampling methodologies, the population on Fuerteventura in 2008 was estimated at 1, 035 birds (832-1, 287) with the species more abundant on hillsides than in gullies. Within the island's three main massifs (i.e. north, west and south) the highest encounter rate was recorded in the northern massif. This study supports the category of 'Endangered' for this species, which does face the obvious threat from development, particularly in the south of the island. The species is also on the endangered list nationally (Spain) and in Europe but has not as yet been evaluated by the Canarian Government. I suggest, based on results of this study, that serious effort should be put in to improving knowledge of the distribution range of this endemic (either by modelling or by systematic visits to sites). An official monitoring programme should be developed and implemented with special attention paid to the three main mountain ranges of this island and particularly to the southern massif which is suffering the highest rate of habitat loss. ¬© 2009 BirdLife International.","10.1017/S0959270908008289","2-s2.0-67749094912",16,0.783206151784332,0

Based on annual waterbird censuses conducted between 2000 and 2007, spatiotemporal analyses revealed that significant differences in waterbird community structure exist along the length of the Coorong. This spatial diversity in community structure was also found to be temporally consistent over this 8-year period. The abundance of the most numerically dominant bird species, such as red-necked stint Calidris ruficollis and grey teal Anas gracilis, explained much of this spatial variation. However, comparisons between data collected for the Coorong south lagoon in 1985 and 2000-2007 show that dramatic changes in these waterbird communities have occurred over longer periods of time, with 23 of the 27 most common species having declined in this period by at least 30%. The Coorong still regularly supports globally important populations (>1% of global population) of nine waterbird taxa, including three Palearctic shorebirds, confirming its Ramsar status. The functional links between the overutilized Murray-Darling basin river system and the Coorong are discussed. ¬© 2009 The Authors.

Aims To determine how change in tree density affects African and Palearctic migrant bird density in already degraded Sahelian woodland. Methods We compared differences in the number of bird species and their abundance with differences in the size and number of woody plants between two seasons separated by five years at 16 degraded woodland sites across 250 km east-west in northern Nigeria. Results Densities of large trees (>5 m) decreased, but densities of smaller trees and shrubs increased, partly as a consequence of growth and because larger trees have been preferentially removed or partly cut down; tree densities were, however, initially low. Of 37 common bird species, 16% had higher densities and 22% had lower densities, in the second study period. The density of Common Whitethroats, Northern Wheatears and Yellow Wagtails was correlated with the number and size of trees, but not that of Lesser Whitethroat and Subalpine Warbler. Overall there was relatively little turnover in species between the two surveys and if (the initially low) tree density was halved, only approximately 2.1% of the average total for number of bird species per 0.2 ha point would be lost. Conclusion Few large changes in bird species' density were found, possibly because: (1) all habitats sampled were already at relatively low tree density - initial reductions from high tree density or near removal of all trees may cause larger changes in local bird densities; (2) reduction in the number of large trees was partially compensated by a more lush development of the vegetation as a whole in the second study period; and (3) the bird species remaining in degraded Sahelian woodland in northern Nigeria are already well adapted to habitat change and low tree density. ¬© 2010 British Trust for Ornithology.","10.1080/00063650903469514","2-s2.0-77953986692",30,0.770485977549933,1
"246","bird_palearctic","Spatial heterogeneity in distribution and ecology of Western Palearctic birds","Species vary in abundance and heterogeneity of spatial distribution, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such variability are poorly known. Evolutionary adaptation to heterogeneously distributed resources may arise from local adaptation with individuals of such locally adapted populations rarely dispersing long distances and hence having small populations and small overall ranges. We quantified mean population density and spatial heterogeneity in population density of 197 bird species across 12 similarly sized regions in the Western Palearctic. Variance in population density among regions differed significantly from a Poisson distribution, suggesting that random processes cannot explain the observed patterns. National estimates of means and variances in population density were positively correlated with continental estimates, suggesting that means and variances were maintained across spatial scales. We used Morisita's index of population abundance as an estimate of heterogeneity in distribution among regions to test a number of predictions. Heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species as reflected, by Morisita's index had small populations, low population densities, and small breeding ranges. Their breeding populations had been consistently maintained at low levels for considerable periods of time, because the degree of genetic variation in a subsample of non-passerines and passerines was significantly negatively related to heterogeneity in distribution. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species were not more often habitat specialists than homogeneously distributed species. Furthermore, heterogeneously distributed passerine species had high annual adult survival rates but did not differ in annual fecundity from homogeneously distributed species. Heterogeneously distributed passerine species rarely colonized urban habitats. Finally, homogeneously distributed bird species were hosts to a greater diversity of blood parasite species than heterogeneously distributed species. In conclusion, small breeding ranges, population sizes, and population densities of heterogeneously distributed passerine bird species, combined with their low degree of genetic variability, and their inability to colonize urban areas may render such species particularly susceptible to human-influenced global climatic changes. ¬© 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/09-1300.1","2-s2.0-77956587575",6,0.700926082866016,0

In the west of France, breeding populations declined by 96% from 1978 to 2008 in cultivated areas where grasslands have been converted into intensively managed annual crops. Little Bustard abundance and nest productivity have been monitored since 1995 in a 450-km2 site in western France. We assessed the proximate causes of the decline of Little Bustards in French farming landscapes and quantified the effectiveness of conservation measures that aimed to reverse the decline. The decline of Little Bustard, from about 65 males in 1995 to just six males in 2003, could be related to a near absence of recruitment over this period. Since 2004, the establishment of more than 1300 ha of specifically targeted agri-environment schemes (AES) in the study site has led to a sharp increase in female productivity, mainly associated with nesting in AES fields. By imposing constraints on mowing dates, AES have prevented nest destruction and female mortality during mowing and, by increasing plant species diversity, provided chicks with a higher abundance of grasshoppers. This has contributed to reversing the trend, and increasing the population to around 30 males in 2009. Conservation strategies involving specifically targeted AES based on the identification of limiting factors can help to reverse the decline of threatened species. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

Here, diversity/dominance diagrams have been used to relate the structural differences in two phenology-based assemblages (i.e. sedentary species and long distance migrants) obtained by an occurrence data set throughout a local breeding bird atlas in an Apennine nature reserve of Central Italy. Among the 58 breeding bird species sampled, 28 % were long distance migrants. On the average, long distance migrants were spatially rarer when compared to sedentary species. In diversity/dominance diagrams, sedentary species show a trend similar to that obtained by the entire community (broken-stick pattern), while long distance migrants have a curve with slope tending to fit geometrically. Geometric species models show steep plots and are typical of assemblages with high relative dominance, low evenness and few species (in our case, the long distance migrants). Moving from geometric series towards a broken-stick model, the assemblages tend to be even more species rich (in our case, the sedentary species). In a Palearctic bird community, long distance migrants are generally rarer in abundance and spatial distribution when compared to sedentary species. A different phenology may imply differences in species evolution, history and ecology with consequences for abundance, distribution and rarity patterns. In our study area, patterns of spatial occurrences evidenced by diversity/dominance curves may be due to the influence of long-term history, short-term competition and local disturbances that differentiated the two phenologic sub-assemblages.",NA,"2-s2.0-79958122750",13,0.491379688363043,0

Whinchats winter in West Africa but there are almost no data on their habitat use and behaviour there that may help to explain the cause of this decline. We measured the density of Whinchats, the habitat characteristics associated with their occurrence on farmland, and the relationships between behavioural and habitat variation on farmland around Jos, central Nigeria, over three winters. Whinchats occurred in many fields harvested in the dry season, the density at three sites varying from 0.03 to 0.43 birds/ha, but they were absent at a fourth site. Whinchats were less likely to be found in farmland without particular crops (e.g. structural stem crops such as maize and millet), with more trees, lower amounts of short vegetation (grass, weeds, crops and crop stubble less than 10 cm in height), and higher amounts of medium vegetation (coverage of vegetation 10-100 cm in height) and litter (dead, unburned, vegetation on the ground). Whinchat abundance in areas of farmland where they were present was independent of most variables considered, but density was higher where there was more short vegetation cover. Foraging behaviour did not vary significantly between farmland habitats. All predictors were consistent between season, years and across sites. The presence/absence model was very poor at predicting presence and there were no strong predictors of abundance or foraging variation. This is consistent with a species well below carrying capacity within its environment so that many suitable areas do not have birds present and there is little aggregation at better sites. Overall, Whinchats were abundant and appeared to have plentiful habitat; densities have probably increased alongside the intensification of agriculture (presence of fallow farmland, short vegetation and structural crops). The results suggest that West African farmland in the dry season can support large numbers of Whinchats and that recent population declines in Europe are unlikely to be caused primarily by lack of suitable wintering habitat. ¬© 2012 The Authors Ibis ¬© 2012 British Ornithologists' Union.","10.1111/j.1474-919X.2012.01258.x","2-s2.0-84866437055",14,0.774588737819955,1

As a consequence it is an area of outstanding importance for waders, not only in the Western Palearctic but also across the entire Arctic region. Until recently, knowledge of the breeding birds of Kolguev was limited to the results of a small number of ornithological expeditions that took place mostly in the early 1900s. During the three summers 2006-2008, a Russian-German team undertook a series of expeditions to investigate the bird populations of the entire island. Here we present the results of these expeditions in respect the breeding status, abundance, distribution and population trends of waders, and report on some aspects of their breeding biology. We found 15 breeding wader species of which Dunlin Calidris alpina, Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres showed a decline between 1994-1995 and 2006-2008 while numbers of Grey Plovers Pluvialis squatarola appeared to be stable.

"353","bird_palearctic","Recent population declines in Afro-Palaearctic migratory birds: The influence of breeding and non-breeding seasons","Aim: Recent, rapid population declines in many Afro-Palaearctic migratory bird species have focussed attention on changing conditions within Africa. However, processes influencing population change can operate throughout the annual cycle and throughout migratory ranges. Here, we explore the evidence for impacts of breeding and non-breeding conditions on population trends of British breeding birds of varying migratory status and wintering ecology. Location: Great Britain (England & Scotland). Methods: Within- and between-species variation in population trends is quantified for 46 bird species with differing migration strategies. Results: Between 1994 and 2007, rates of population change in Scotland and England differed significantly for 19 resident and 15 long-distance migrant species, but were similar for 12 short-distance migrant species. Of the six long-distance migrant species that winter in the arid zone of Africa, five are increasing in abundance throughout Britain. In contrast, the seven species wintering in the humid zone of Africa are all declining in England, but five of these are increasing in Scotland. Consequently, populations of both arid and humid zone species are increasing significantly faster in Scotland than England, and only the English breeding populations of species wintering in the humid zone are declining. Main conclusions: Population declines in long-distance migrants, especially those wintering in the humid zone, but not residents or short-distance migrants suggest an influence of non-breeding season conditions on population trends. However, the consistently less favourable population trends in England than Scotland of long-distance migrant and resident species strongly suggest that variation in the quality of breeding grounds is influencing recent population changes. The declines in humid zone species in England, but not Scotland, may result from poorer breeding conditions in England exacerbating the impacts of non-breeding conditions or the costs associated with a longer migration, while better conditions in Scotland may be buffering these impacts. ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","10.1111/ddi.12084","2-s2.0-84880132206",17,0.81808939910071,1

However, we still have only limited knowledge not only of the wintering destinations of many Iberian breeding migrants but also of aspects as general as the mi-gratory behaviour of the populations of many common avian species that breed in the Iberian highlands. We used bird-ringing data to shed light on the migratory status (migratory, partially-migratory or seden-tary) of the breeding populations of 13 common species occurring year-round in a woodland located on an Iberian plateau (Garaio,Araba, Spain; 574 m.a.s.l.), where ringing activities have been carried out over the last 20 years. To assess the extent to which birds breeding on this site remain in the area during winter and/or are replaced by conspecifics coming from other areas, we analysed: (1) changes in relative abundance of birds between summer and winter, (2) the frequency of sedentary individuals (birds captured both in summer and winter period in the study area) in relation to the number of indi-viduals captured only in summer (summer visitors) or in winter (wintering birds), and (3) variation in wing length among summer, wintering and sedentary birds. Our results revealed great variation among species in the intensity of migratory behaviour, and a general arrival of foreign conspecifics during the winter for most of the species studied.

The Avanersuaq District in northwest Greenland is home to an assemblage of waterfowl from both geographic areas; however, minimal historic or current information is available on species abundance. In 2008 and 2009, we conducted field surveys in Greenland from 76.00¬∞ to 77.35¬∞N for breeding and non-breeding waterfowl and have collected anecdotal field notes of avian observations over a 20-year period (1993-2012). During these periods, we documented the first observation of a Ross's goose (Chen rossii) and the first confirmed breeding by lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in Greenland. Northern pintails (Anas acuta) were observed for the first time in northwest Greenland, and a previously unknown breeding location for brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) was also identified. Local populations of greater snow (C. c.) and Canada geese (B. canadensis) have increased in size. The Booth Sound and Drown Bay wetland areas and many islands throughout the Avanersuaq District were identified as critical habitat for both breeding and non-breeding waterfowl. Further increases in waterfowl abundance, including more frequent rare and new visitors, are likely in the study area as breeding populations further south continue to increase and an ameliorating climate allows for a longer breeding season. These results will prove useful as a baseline for comparisons with future surveys. ¬© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-014-1520-z","2-s2.0-84905243565",7,0.81929198361741,1

We investigated variation in annual productivity 2010‚Äì2012 in the Cyprus Wheatear Oenanthe cypriaca, a small endemic migrant passerine at the National Forest Park (NFP) of Troodos. Clutch size for first nests was usually five, although 0.40 eggs lower in 2011. Nest survival did not vary with year, nesting attempt, or clutch initiation date, but was significantly higher in the chick (0.96; 0.88‚Äì0.98, 95¬†% CI) versus the egg stage (0.74; 0.62‚Äì0.83, 95¬†% CI). The number of chicks fledged from a successful nest varied with nest type‚Äîwith first nests and second nests after failure being similar producing ~3‚Äì4.5 chicks dependent on year, and with second nests after success producing ~2 chicks, independent of year. There were only weak positive or negative effects of clutch initiation date dependent on year, controlling for nest type, and no effects of male age on productivity. After fledging, chicks had a >95¬†% chance of surviving the first month, but with a greater probability of one or rarely two chicks per brood dying if fledged later in the season.

Understanding constraints to the distribution of threatened species may help to ascertain whether there are other suitable sectors for reducing the risks associated with species that are recorded in only one protected locality, and to inform about the suitability of other areas for reintroduction or translocation programs. Methods. We studied the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (Fringilla polatzeki), a habitat specialist endemic of the Canary Islands restricted to the pine forest of Inagua, the only area where the species has been naturally present as a regular breeder in the last 25 years. A suitability distribution model using occurrences with demographic relevance (i.e., nest locations of successful breeding attempts analysed using boosted classification trees) was built considering orographic, climatic and habitat structure predictors. By means of a standardized survey program we monitored the yearly abundance of the species in 100 sectors since the declaration of Inagua as a Strict Nature Reserve in 1994. Results. The variables with the highest relative importance in blue chaffinch habitat preferences were pine height, tree cover, altitude, and rainfall during the driest trimester (July-September). The observed local abundance of the blue chaffinch in Inagua (survey data) was significantly correlated with habitat suitability derived from modelling the location of successful nesting attempts (using linear and quantile regressions). The outcomes of the habitat suitability model were used to quantify the suitability of other natural, historic, pine forests of Gran Canaria. Tamadaba is the forest with most suitable woodland patches for the species. We estimated a population size of 195-430 blue chaffinches in Inagua since 2011 (95% CI), the smallest population size of a woodland passerine in the Western Palearctic. Discussion. Habitat suitability obtained from modelling the location of successful breeding attempts is a good surrogate of the observed local abundance during the reproductive season. The outcomes of these models can be used for the identification of potential areas for the reintroduction of the species in other suitable pine forests and to inform forest management practices. ¬© 2017 Carrascal et al.","10.7717/peerj.3771","2-s2.0-85029231940",37,0.747624151308854,1

Evidence regarding population trends of endangered species in special protection areas and their recovery ability from catastrophic disturbances is scarce. We assessed the population trend of the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (Fringilla polatzeki), a habitat specialist endemic to the pine forest of Inagua in the Canary Islands, following a devastating wildfire in July 2007. Using a standardized census program that accounts for detectability, we have monitored the population trend of the species since Inagua was declared a Strict Nature Reserve in 1994. The breeding population density of the blue chaffinch remained stable in Inagua from the beginning of the monitoring program in 1994 until the year before the wildfire. However, in spring 2008, the population density decreased by half with respect to density in the preceding years. Since 2008, the population has gradually increased, reaching its highest recorded density in 2016 (15.8 birds/km2).This represents an average annual increase of 23.7%, indicating impressive resilience to catastrophic events. The creation of Inagua as a strict nature reserve did not therefore increase the global population or protect the blue chaffinch against a demographic crisis but probably prevented a deepening of the demographic crisis or further declines. Except for the two years immediately after the severe wildfire of 2007, the population density of the blue chaffinch in Inagua has remained relatively stable at around 9‚Äì16 birds/km2, the lowest recorded abundance for a small woodland passerine in the Western Palearctic. ¬©.2018 Museu de Ci√®ncies Naturals de Barcelona.",NA,"2-s2.0-85032886264",8,0.868870649139402,1

However, the importance of the lakes as a temporary site for migrant bird populations has not been adequately studied. The point count method was used to study waterbird species diversity and abundance in Lake Ashenge, in the semi-arid region of northern Ethiopia, with the main aim to underscore the lake's importance as a stop-over site for Palaearctic and other migratory birds. A total of 36 species belonging to 14 waterbird families were encountered. Fifteen of the species were resident birds, including the endemic Wattled Ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), and 14 of the species were Palaearctic migrants, including the globally Near-Threatened Ferruginous Duck (Ayithya nyroca) and Maccoa Duck (Oxyura maccoa). Significant temporal variation in diversity and abundance was observed during the study period; diversity was highest (Shannon-Wiener H‚Ä≤ = 1.98) in the dry season (December/January) and lowest (H‚Ä≤ = 1.11) in the rainy season (August/September), whereas mean abundance was highest (c. 4219 individuals) in the post-rainy season (October/November) and lowest (c. 2631 individuals) in the dry season. Increased abundance of Palaearctic species towards the dry season increased species diversity,but may have caused displacement of resident birds resulting in lower overall abundance in this season. This study provides a new distributional record for Maccoa Duck, highlights the significance of the lake for several waterbird species and calls for its protection.","10.3957/056.047.0001","2-s2.0-85038419336",4,0.74571701980958,0

In this study, counts on waterbirds were conducted in dry and wet season (in years 2001-2008) in a riverine habitat in southern Africa (Shamvura stretch of the Okavango River). In total, 84 waterfowl species were recorded. The birds were assigned to different guilds according to their migration activity, diet and nesting site selection. In overall, the species number was almost the same (74 vs. 73) in the wet and dry season. The abundance of all resident species recorded was lower in wet (N = 5992) than in dry seasons (N = 6965)(œá2 = 73.1, P &lt; 0.01). In both seasons Palearctic migrants were represented by seven species, which comprised 1-2% of all waterbirds. Six species were classified as dominants: African reed cormorant Phalacrocorax africanus, African openbill stork Anastomus lamelligerus, cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, wattled lapwing Vanellus senegallus, African darter Anhinga rufa and white-faced duck Dendrocygna viduata. In the wet season the dominant species comprised 68%, while in dry season-52.5% of all birds recorded. Significant seasonal differences in the numbers of individuals were shown for the following species: African reed cormorant, great egret, squacco heron, wattled lapwing and pied kingfisher. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more abundant in wet season, while piscivorous, carnivorous and plant eating birds in dry season. These differences can be related mainly to seasonal variation in the availability of food as well as to the timing of breeding. ¬© 2018 E-flow BioOne.

Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from ""Vulnerable"" to ""Endangered."" Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years. For this population to recover to a status under which it could be ""delisted,"" a 10% increase in survival of all age classes would be needed. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/03-5340","2-s2.0-33645099456",47,0.886828932,1

Mortality of the population was calculated from length-class abundance of fish sampled by trammel nets, and the population size estimated using a mark and recapture technique. Instantaneous natural mortality in the nearshore population was high (M=0.78) although other author's estimate for the mortality in the offshore population was only 0.35. Therefore it is likely that no single estimate of mortality will apply to fish of all ages. The population density of juvenile N. rossii was about 11 g m-2 nearshore. The size of the offshore population was estimated by calculating survival from the nearshore age classes. The data suggest that the population around South Georgia has been reduced by overfishing to about one tenth of its previous unexploited level. Yield could have been increased by fishing less intensively, and the population maintained at or near its initial level if recruitment remained constant. ¬© 1984 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/BF00265565","2-s2.0-34250141159",117,0.883955661,1

The species breeds widely throughout the Antarctic and on peri-Antarctic islands. From breeding population data collated from 73 of these localities, we estimated the minimum global population to be about 400,000 breeding pairs. After adjusting for seasonal variation in numbers of breeding pairs based on studies at Ardery Island, East Antarctica, the total global population is estimated to be at least one million breeding pairs. Of this, 72% nest on islands of the Scotia Sea arc and the South Atlantic Ocean. The precision of the estimate on the total number of breeding pairs is low, as several colony estimates were only available as orders of magnitude. Furthermore, different timing of the surveys and the difficulties of censusing colonial cliff-nesting birds reduced the count accuracy.

The breeding aggregation on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia is believed to be larger than all others combined. We estimated the size of this population by calculating the area of suitable habitat and the density of occupied burrows within it. Some 670,000 occupied nests were estimated for the island at mid-incubation, representing 0.9 million pairs of breeding-age birds associated with South Georgia in the survey seasons (2005/06 and 06/07). This is 40-45% of the previous estimate, but still represents well over half of the global population.

The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

However, a significant population decline reported at Ross Island after 2006 has been linked to a commercial fishery that began in the Ross Sea in 1996‚Äì1997 and targets large Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni)‚Äîthe presumed primary prey of RSKW. We assessed RSKW population abundance and trends using photo-identification data collected in McM during seven summers from 2001‚Äì2002 to 2014‚Äì2015. We identified 352 individual RSKWs and estimated an average annual population of 470 distinctly marked whales. Using a Bayesian mark‚Äìrecapture model, we identified two population clusters: ‚Äòregulars‚Äô showed strong inter- and intra-annual site fidelity and an average annual abundance of 73 distinctive individuals (95% probability: 57‚Äì88); ‚Äòirregulars‚Äô were less frequently encountered but comprised a larger population with an annual estimate of 397 distinctive individuals (287‚Äì609). The number of seasonally resident regulars appeared to be stable over the period of purported RSKW decline, with the estimated annual number of deaths (6; 95% probability: 1‚Äì22) offset by the number of recruits (6; 2‚Äì19). As an alternative to the decline-due-to-fishery hypothesis, we suggest that the presence of mega-iceberg B-15 at Ross Island during the ‚Äúiceberg years‚Äù (2000‚Äì2001 to 2005‚Äì2006) could have temporarily disrupted normal RSKW movement patterns, resulting in an apparent decline. Continued population monitoring of toothfish and their predators will be important for assessing ecosystem impacts of commercial fishing in the Ross Sea. ¬© 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","10.1007/s00300-017-2239-4","2-s2.0-85040006560",25,0.853061625,1

It addresses correspondence between long-term population trends of inshore demersal fish and inshore-feeding Antarctic shags of this area, where an intensive commercial fishery for shag prey once operated. The analysis also includes comparable information on diet (by examination of regurgitated pellets), foraging patterns, and breeding output of shags from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, an area where no commercial finfish fishery has ever existed. Integral study of these parameters there showed that, in Antarctic shags, low breeding success and high foraging effort might imply low recruitment and high adult mortality, respectively, with both factors adversely affecting the population trends of this bird. In line with these premises, the declining trend observed in shag colonies on the South Shetland Islands appears to have been influenced by the concomitant decrease in abundance of two of their main prey, the nototheniids Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons, due to intensive industrial fishing in the area in the late 1970s. In comparison, no such pattern occurred for the Danco Coast colonies. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-015-1850-5","2-s2.0-84949517452",33,0.847924953,1

Still evident is the decline in trammel-net catches of fjord-dwelling Notothenia rossii and Gobionotothen gibberifrons in relation to the non-commercially fished Notothenia coriiceps, which was previously reported for the period 1983-1990. A trend of increasing N. rossii catches was observed, but the levels of relative abundance of this species and G. gibberifrons are well below those found in the early 1980s. These results are supported by our knowledge about the diet of the piscivorous Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis) in the South Shetland-Antarctic Peninsula area in this decade. The decrease in recruitment to the inshore sub-populations of N. rossii and G. gibberifrons over the last 16 years was most probably caused by the offshore commercial fishery in the area in the late 1970s.

The population at South Georgia is currently exploited by pelagic trawlers fishing close to the seabed. Annual catches peaked at 150,000 t in 1983 and have declined since the mid-to-late 1980s. Bottom-trawl surveys have been conducted since 1987, providing a time series of abundance and size distribution for use in assessing the status of the stock and setting quotas. Food web models suggest that estimates of the biomass from survey data are substantially lower than the amount of icefish required by the local ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the uncertainty around current estimates of density and variance, using alternative nonparametric stratified bootstrapping methods. The stratified rescaling bootstrap estimator was identified as the most appropriate method of those tested: in comparison with the existing method, confidence intervals and the inter-annual variability of the estimates were reduced. Numbers-at-age were estimated from mixture distribution models fitted to length-disaggregated density data in order to determine whether individual cohorts were consistently detected by the surveys. Estimates of numbers-at-age could not consistently delineate cohorts in successive years indicating that survey-based estimates of density were biased. These biases may have arisen because the trawl gear did not select individuals of all sizes equally, or because sampling was restricted to the demersal component of the stock. Estimates of abundance of the pelagic component of the stock should be derived from acoustic data to improve the assessment. ¬© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-015-1810-0","2-s2.0-84944937974",38,0.83601677,1

We present an assessment of recent annual variation and trends in abundance and growth rates of these colonies, adding to the published record not updated for more than two decades. High angle oblique aerial photographic surveys of colonies were acquired and penguins counted for the breeding seasons 1981-2012. In the last four years the numbers of Ad√©lie penguins in the Ross and Beaufort Island colonies (southern Ross Sea metapopulation) reached their highest levels since aerial counts began in 1981. Results indicated that 855,625 pairs of Ad√©lie penguins established breeding territories in the western Ross Sea, with just over a quarter (28%) of those in the southern portion, constituting a semi-isolated metapopulation (three colonies on Ross Island, one on nearby Beaufort Island). The southern population had a negative per capita growth rate of -0.019 during 1981-2000, followed by a positive per capita growth rate of 0.067 for 2001-2012. Colony growth rates for this metapopulation showed striking synchrony through time, indicating that large-scale factors influenced their annual growth. In contrast to the increased colony sizes in the southern population, the patterns of change among colonies of the northern Ross Sea were difficult to characterize. Trends were similar to southern colonies until the mid-1990s, after which the signal was lost owing to significantly reduced frequency of surveys. Both climate factors and recovery of whale populations likely played roles in the trends among southern colonies until 2000, after which depletion of another trophic competitor, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni), may explain the sharp increasing trend evident since then. ¬© 2014 Lyver et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0091188","2-s2.0-84895832094",30,0.835592282,1

Forty radiocarbon dates on penguin bones and eggshells from 13 of these sites indicate a near continuous occupation by breeding penguins in this region for over 9000 years. These dates refine the recent geological record in this region and indicate that deglaciation of the northern islands occurred much earlier than previously suggested. Dietary remains from these sites include at least 23 taxa of cephalopods and teleost fish. Quantification of these remains indicates significant fluctuations in the relative abundance of two of the more common major prey taxa. The Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum Boulenger) was the most common teleost prey during all time periods represented by the ages of the sites, but preservational factors may explain a gradual decrease in the remains of this species in increasingly older sites. The most common cephalopod in the sediments was the squid, Psychroteuthis glacialis Thiele, which occurred in low numbers in most sites except one (Site 75). An unusually high number of squid beaks preserved in Site 75, dating to approximately 5700-6100 cal. yr BP, does not correlate with a decrease in fish prey at that time. The high number of abandoned penguin colonies (> 200) in the Windmill Islands may be due to population cycles in the past in association with low nest-site fidelity and movement by breeding penguins to new sites within this region. ¬© Antarctic Science Ltd.","10.1017/S0954102005002427","2-s2.0-15244342534",156,0.834685344,0

We estimated the population breeding at the Prince Edward Islands, the last breeding site for the nominate subspecies that lacks a recent population estimate. White-chinned petrel burrows are largely confined to deep, muddy soils, usually on slopes below 200 m, but locally up to 420 m. After correcting for count bias, Marion Island has an estimated 29,900 nests (95 % CI 27,700-32,400). Burrow occupancy rates at the start of the incubation period were 65 % during one-off surveys, but repeat surveys found that at least 73 % of burrows were occupied and 87 % of burrows showed signs of occupancy. This suggests that there were roughly 24,000 occupied nests on Marion Island (95 % CI 20,000-28,000). A more cursory survey on Prince Edward Island yielded 14,700 burrows, suggesting that there are 9,000-15,000 occupied nests. The nominate subspecies of white-chinned petrel occupies approximately 974,200 nests (95 % CI 678,000-1,286,000), with the Prince Edward Islands, the third most important breeding site, after South Georgia and Kerguelen. Assuming that populations breeding at islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans winter in different regions, the impact of fishery bycatch is likely to have had a greater impact on the Indian Ocean population.

Signals from this key group of species can indicate broad scale impacts or response to environmental change. Recent studies of penguin populations, the most commonly abundant Antarctic seabirds in the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea, have demonstrated that physical changes in Antarctic marine environments have profound effects on biota at high trophic levels. Large populations of the circumpolar-breeding Ad√©lie penguin occur in East Antarctica, but direct, standardized population data across much of this vast coastline have been more limited than in other Antarctic regions. We combine extensive new population survey data, new population estimation methods, and re-interpreted historical survey data to assess decadal-scale change in East Antarctic Ad√©lie penguin breeding populations. We show that, in contrast to the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea where breeding populations have decreased or shown variable trends over the last 30 years, East Antarctic regional populations have almost doubled in abundance since the 1980's and have been increasing since the earliest counts in the 1960's. The population changes are associated with five-year lagged changes in the physical environment, suggesting that the changing environment impacts primarily on the pre-breeding age classes. East Antarctic marine ecosystems have been subject to a number of changes over the last 50 years which may have influenced Ad√©lie penguin population growth, including decadal-scale climate variation, an inferred mid-20th century sea-ice contraction, and early-to-mid 20th century exploitation of fish and whale populations. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","10.1371/journal.pone.0139877","2-s2.0-84947510058",100,0.822641497,1

Antarctic seabirds are vulnerable to all these threats because they depend on terrestrial and marine environments to breed and forage. We assess the current distribution and total abundance of Ad√©lie penguins in East Antarctica and find there are 3.5 (95% CI 2.9‚Äì4.2) million individuals of breeding age along the East Antarctic coastline and 5.9 (4.2‚Äì7.7) million individuals foraging in the adjacent ocean after the breeding season. One third of the breeding population numbering over 1 million individuals breed within 10 km of research stations, highlighting the potential for human activities to impact Ad√©lie penguin populations despite their current high abundance. The 16 Antarctic Specially Protected Areas currently designated in East Antarctica offer protection to breeding populations close to stations in four of six regional populations. The East Antarctic breeding population consumes an average of 193 500 tonnes of krill and 18 800 tonnes of fish during a breeding season, with consumption peaking at the end of the breeding season. These findings can inform future conservation management decisions in the terrestrial environment under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to develop a systematic network of protected areas, and in the marine environment under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to allow the consumption needs of Ad√©lie penguins to be taken into account when setting fishery catch limits.

"168","fish_antarctic","Abundance, distribution and status of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri","The abundance of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, was estimated using a model that incorporated estimated pup production. Pups are born at only five sites, four of which are at the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, which lie to the south of New Zealand. The remaining breeding site is at Campbell Island in the same region. Pup production was estimated during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons from mark-recapture studies at the two largest sea lion rookeries, at the Auckland Islands (Sandy Bay and Dundas Island), which account for almost 90% of total pup production for the species. Pup production for the other sites was estimated from direct counts or, in the case of Campbell Island, from recent tagging data. Total pup production estimates for all sites during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons are 2640 and 2807 respectively. During the four-week pupping season, pup mortality at most sites was estimated to be about 10%. The estimates of absolute abundance based on pup production for the two breeding seasons were 11 700 (95% confidence interval (CI): 10500-13100) and 12500 (95% CI: 11100-14000) respectively. This population abundance is among the smallest reported for a species within the Otariidae. The highly localised, and historically reduced distribution make this species vulnerable to impact and warrants particular attention from conservation managers. In particular, the potential impact of the annual bycatch of P. hookeri in a trawl fishery requires close monitoring and, ideally, some mitigation action.","10.1071/WR98022","2-s2.0-0032991223",13,0.816400879,1
"177","fish_antarctic","Variability in krill biomass links harvesting and climate warming to penguin population changes in Antarctica","The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and adjacent Scotia Sea support abundant wildlife populations, many of which were nearly extirpated by humans. This region is also among the fastestwarming areas on the planet, with 5-6 ¬∞C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the ""sea-ice hypothesis,"" proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in ""ice-loving"" species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of ""ice-avoiding"" species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Ad√©lie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.","10.1073/pnas.1016560108","2-s2.0-79956298592",98,0.808668603,1
"187","fish_antarctic","Modelling the impact of fishery by-catches on albatross populations","1. Several albatross species, including the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, have shown marked declines in abundance throughout their range. These seabirds are frequently taken as by-catch in longline fisheries and this mortality has been implicated in the population declines. 2. We developed a deterministic, density-dependent, age-structured model for assessing the effects of longlining on wandering albatross populations. We used demographic data from field studies at South Georgia and the Crozet Islands, data on albatross abundance from 1960 to 1995, and reported effort data from the tuna longline fisheries south of 30¬∞S, to model estimated by-catch levels and other population parameters in the model. 3. The model used two alternative assumptions about patterns of at-sea distribution of wandering albatross (uniform between 30¬∞S-60¬∞S; proportional to the distribution of longline fishing effort between these latitudes). 4. Our model was able to predict reasonably closely the observed data from the Crozet Islands wandering albatross population, but the fit to the South Georgia population was substantially poorer. This probably reflects: (i) greater overlap in the Indian Ocean than in the Atlantic Ocean between the main areas of tuna longline fishing and the foraging ranges of wandering albatrosses from the Crozet Islands and South Georgia, respectively; and (ii) greater impact of poorly documented longline fisheries, especially the tuna fisheries in the south Atlantic and the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fishery, within the foraging range of wandering albatrosses from South Georgia. 5. The model results suggest that the marked decline in both populations, and subsequent recovery of the Crozet Islands population (but not the continued decline of the South Georgia population), can be explained by the tuna longline by-catch. They further indicate that populations may be able to sustain some level of incidental take. However, the likely under-reporting of fishing effort (especially in non-tuna longline fisheries) and the delicate balance between a sustainable and unsustainable level of by-catch for these long-lived populations suggest great caution in any application of such findings.","10.1046/j.0021-8901.2001.00661.x","2-s2.0-0035674492",28,0.807519707,1

The species was already heavily fished at the beginning of the 1970s. The closure of the fishery for this species in 1985 was one of the first conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR. Fish biomass within a CCAMLR subarea or part of a subarea is commonly estimated from surveys that target a number of species, including N. rossii, at the same time. These surveys are conducted under the assumption that the target fish species are more or less evenly distributed over the area at the time of the survey. This assumption is violated in the case of N. rossii, which is non-randomly distributed such that a large proportion of the population tends to aggregate in small areas, leaving most of the survey area only thinly populated. In order to provide more accurate estimates of the abundance of the species, it is suggested that an acoustic survey combined with a number of identification hauls might be the most promising approach to estimating the biomass of N. rossii.",NA,"2-s2.0-9644284518",161,0.806992681,0
"207","fish_antarctic","Factors influencing population trends of some abundant vertebrates in sardine-rich coastal ecosystems","Many abundant populations of vertebrates in sardine-rich coastal ecosystems have experienced large changes in population sizes. This has led to wide fluctuations of some fish harvests and concern over the conservation status of some top predators. Research over the past 20 years into the causes of population changes of some abundant fish species, some southern pinnipeds and the most important guano-producing seabirds is briefly reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to populations off south-western Africa. Fish populations have been influenced in a complex manner by a variety of factors, including fishing, biological interactions and environmental change. Climate, operating at a basin scale, is probably an important cause of large and long-term changes in the abundance of some sardine populations. The impact of anticipated climate change on sardine-rich ecosystems is expected to receive emphasis in the future. The populations of some pinnipeds and seabirds were drastically reduced by former excessive harvests. Whereas pinnipeds have tended to recover under regimes of controlled exploitation, the numbers of some seabirds have continued to decrease even in the absence of exploitation. Various factors have contributed to the ongoing decreases, including competition with fisheries for prey resources and competition with pinnipeds for breeding space. The 1980s saw the introduction of legislation specifying conservation of marine ecosystems as a management objective in Antarctica and South Africa. Means of achieving this objective, given the biological interactions at the upper end of the trophic pathway, are expected to provide another focus for future research. ¬© 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","10.2989/02577619109504645","2-s2.0-0008275236",119,0.802352978,1
"2111","fish_antarctic","The importance of the Patagonian Shelf for top predator species breeding at South Georgia","1. The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals. These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf. 2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the east to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle. 3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species. 4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered. 5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators. ¬© 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/aqc.480","2-s2.0-0036117415",174,0.801142872,0
"226","fish_antarctic","Biological characteristics of Antarctic fish stocks in the southern Scotia Arc region","Commercial exploitation of finfish in the southern Scotia Arc took place from 1977/78 to 1989/90, and was in its heyday from 1977/78 to 1981/82. Except for Elephant Island, the state of fish stocks of the southern Scotia Arc region has been accorded little attention until 1998, despite substantial catches in the first four years of the fishery and ample opportunity to sample these catches. The only scientific surveys of these stocks during these years were conducted by Germany in 1985, and by Spain in 1987 and 1991. More recently, the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (US AMLR) Program carried out two extensive surveys around Elephant Island and the lower South Shetland Islands in March 1998 and around the South Orkney Islands in March 1999. In this paper, the authors present new data on species composition, species groups, length compositions, length-weight relationships, length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning, gonadosomatic indices and oocyte diameter. Lesser Antarctic or peri-Antarctic species predominated in the fish fauna. Species groups differed by up to 55-60% from one shelf area to the other, mostly due to differences in the abundance of the predominant species on each shelf area and the increase in the number of high-Antarctic species in the South Orkney Islands. Length compositions and the proportion of large (= old) specimens in the populations provided no evidence of illegal fishing since the closure of the region some 10 years ago. Differences in length-weight relationships between areas were primarily due to differences in length compositions of the fish caught, but did not suggest geographical differences in length-to-weight growth. Differences in estimates of length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning indicate that in some species final maturation of the gonads takes one year or more, whereas in others gonad maturation was completed within one season. Length at sexual maturity and length at first spawning in Champsocephalus gunnari was one year later on the southerly grounds than at South Georgia. The distribution of gonadosomatic indices in March suggested that Lepidonotothen squamifrons was spawning while Trematomus hansoni was already coming to the end of its reproductive season. Chionodraco rastrospinosus and Trematomus eulepidotus were close to spawning. Other species, such as Notothenia rossii and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, spawn at least one to two months later than at South Georgia. Channichthyids (except C. gunnari), Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps have egg diameters of 4.3-5.2 mm at spawning. The Trematomus species investigated have egg diameters of 2.8-3.2 mm while in species of the genera Gobionotothen and Lepidonotothen, egg diameters rarely exceeded 2.0 mm. Measurements of oocyte diameters confirmed the findings on spawning time estimated from gonadosomatic indices.",NA,"2-s2.0-0001927928",163,0.798233295,0

Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early cr√®che stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years. Oceanographically, the two summers differed; in 2003 the mixed layer was fresher and shallower, indicating a delayed melting of sea-ice in the study area when compared to 2001. Satellite observations indicated that the pack-ice directly offshore from the Mawson coast broke out earlier in 2001 and the perennial fast-ice along the coast persisted later in 2003.

Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site.Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii.Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system. ¬© 2015.","10.1016/j.jmarsys.2015.07.005","2-s2.0-84939506886",112,0.791013896,0

The size of the breeding population on the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, New Zealand, is unknown. Disappointment Island is thought to be the main white-chinned petrel breeding site in the Auckland Islands, and maybe also in the New Zealand region, and has never had introduced mammalian predators. We estimated the white-chinned petrel breeding population size taking into account the detection probability of burrows via distance sampling and the burrow occupancy rate. Eighty line transects were distributed over the island, with a total line length of 1600¬†m. Burrows were patchily distributed and most abundant in dense megaherb communities. White-chinned petrel burrow density D^ was 654 burrows/ha (95¬†% CI 528‚Äì809 burrows/ha), with burrow detection probability p^ varying among vegetation communities from 0.28¬†¬±¬†0.02 to 0.43¬†¬±¬†0.02 (¬±SE).

Ichthyoplankton studies in the Southern Ocean have to date been largely constrained to the summer months. We analysed ichthyoplankton data collected from a year round, long term (2002-2008), plankton trawl sampling programme in a large fjord system (Cumberland Bay) at South Georgia, sub-Antarctic (54.25¬∞S, 36.5¬∞W) to assess temporal changes in larval fish diversity and abundance. Larvae of 22 species, representing nine families, were identified although three, Krefftichthys anderssoni (Myctophidae), Lepidonotothen nudifrons/Trematomus hansoni (Nototheniidae) and Champsocephalus gunnari (Channichthyidae), dominated abundance in all years. Significant seasonal and interannual differences in the larval fish assemblage were revealed by multivariate analyses. Estimates of larval growth are provided for five abundant species. Considerable inter-specific differences in relative larval growth rate were recorded but interannual variability within species was small. However, in the commercially important C. gunnari, multiple larval cohorts, representing a protracted spawning season, were observed to grow at different rates, and this may be related to temperature and/or food availability. A comparison with historical growth data from South Georgia suggests there has been little change in growth rate for the main species over the last three decades. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-013-1321-9","2-s2.0-84878749042",10,0.779677338,0

"285","fish_antarctic","Do large whales have an impact on commercial fishing in the South Pacific Ocean?","Although there is evidence that some populations of large whales in the Southern Hemisphere have increased in recent years, differences in feeding behaviour and migration patterns largely precludes direct competition between these and coastal and pelagic fisheries in the South Pacific Ocean. In particular, many of the whales that spend at least part of their year in the South Pacific make feeding migrations in summer to Antarctic waters where some estimates put their food intake at 90% of annual consumption. Others, such as female sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), which do not migrate from tropical/subtropical South Pacific waters, feed at depths greater than that usually occupied by species that are the targets of commercial fisheries, such as the tunas (Thunnus spp.). Thus, even though consumption by whales is high, dietary overlap with commercially fished species is relatively low as much of their feeding is in waters that are not exploited by fisheries. However, there are a number of anecdotal reports that some smaller cetacean species, in particular killer and pilot whales, take fish from longlines set in the region, although more are lost to sharks. However, it should be noted that any assessment of interactions between whales and fisheries is limited by a lack of qualitative and quantitative data. Abundance estimates, particularly for some of the smaller species in the South Pacific region, are only order of magnitude estimates. Furthermore, knowledge of food chains (and their interactions) for many cetaceans in the South Pacific is sketchy making assessment of their impact on local fisheries difficult.","10.1023/A:1015451624024","2-s2.0-0034444754",157,0.758274585,0

Nearly 1 month was devoted to bottom trawling for fishes on the shelf and upper slope (to 1,000 m) areas around Shag Rocks, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet√∏ya. The focus was on the latter two locations, because their faunas are more poorly known. Eight species were collected at Shag Rocks with Patagonotothen guntheri most abundant; 17 at South Georgia with Lepidonotothen nudifrons, L. larseni and Gobionotothen gibberifrons most abundant; 13 at the South Sandwich Islands with L. larseni, L. nudifrons and G. gibberifrons most abundant; and 11 at Bouvet√∏ya with L. larseni, Macrourus holotrachys and L. squamifrons most abundant. Ten new locality records were established: Shag Rocks (1), South Georgia (1), South Sandwich Islands (5), South Sandwich Trench at 5,350 m (1) and Bouvet√∏ya (2). Total known demersal fish diversity on the shelf and upper slope at Shag Rocks/South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet√∏ya is 42, 31 and 17 species, respectively. To examine population structure in the four most abundant notothenioids at Bouvet√∏ya (L. larseni, L. squamifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and Chaenocephalus aceratus), we examined the ND2 portion of mitochondrial DNA. Chaenocephalus aceratus, N. coriiceps and L. larseni exhibited no significant genetic differentiation in comparison with samples from localities in the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, L. squamifrons showed significant genetic differentiation between the South Shetlands and Bouvet√∏ya populations (F ST = 0.189, P = 0.015). Thus, these data combined with previous studies of two other notothenioids suggest that five of the six notothenioid species at Bouvet√∏ya are not genetically differentiated from other localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The location of Bouvet√∏ya within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the long (1-2 years) pelagic stages of the notothenioids at Bouvet√∏ya may be at least partly responsible for this genetic homogeneity. ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00300-008-0489-x","2-s2.0-53949110972",1,0.728592161,0

Two survey areas were sampled focussed on Marguerite Bay in the south, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the north. Data from 177 stations showed that the highest concentrations of krill were found in the southern sampling area. Differences between areas were associated with a few large catches of one year old krill found in anomalously warm and productive waters in Marguerite Bay, and small krill catches in the less-productive, offshore waters in the north. Estimated krill density across the survey area was 3.4krillm-2, and was low compared to the long-term average of 45krillm-2 for the Elephant Island area. Overall recruitment between the two survey regions was similar, but per capita recruitment was about 60% lower than historical mean recruitment levels measured at Elephant Island since the late 1970s. Demographic patterns showed small krill concentrated near the coast, and large krill concentrated offshore on the shelf and slope all along the survey area. The offshore distribution of adult krill was delineated by the warm (~1¬∞C), low salinity (33.8) water at 30m, suggesting that most krill were present shoreward of the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Distributions of larvae indicated that three hotspot areas were important for the production of krill: slope areas outside Marguerite Bay and north of the South Shetland Islands, and near the coast around Antarctic Sound. Successful spawning, as inferred from larval abundance, was roughly coincident with the shelf break and not with inshore waters. Given the rapid changes in climate along the Antarctic Peninsula and the lower per capita recruitment observed in recent years, studies comparing and contrasting production, growth, and recruitment across the Peninsula will be critical to better understand how climate change will impact krill populations and their dependent predators in the Scotia Sea. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.dsr.2013.02.005","2-s2.0-84878417362",3,0.726992971,0
"451","fish_antarctic","Krill population dynamics at South Georgia: Implications for ecosystem-based fisheries management","The South Georgia region supports a large biomass of krill that is subject to high interannual variability. The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change. ¬© 2010 Inter-Research.","10.3354/meps08356","2-s2.0-76249085454",32,0.724651653,0
"483","fish_antarctic","Fish populations of Port Foster, Deception Island, Antarctica and vicinity","The fish populations of Port Foster, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were investigated as part of the Erupt Antarctic ecosystem study. Surveys were conducted on five cruises between March 1999 and November 2000. Samples also were collected off Livingston Island and King George Island of the South Shetland Islands. Specimens were collected or observed using a multiple opening and closing net and environmental sampling system, otter trawls, benthic line-transect photography, and remotely operated vehicle video. Species composition, length, weight, reproductive condition, diet, habitat, and parasitic infestation were examined for the dominant fish species. Eleven species were collected, all in the suborder Notothenioidei. The fishes found in the survey are known to occur in the region and had diets similar to those found in other studies. Abundances of demersal fishes in Port Foster ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 individuals m-2 over the study period. Inshore shallow-water (&lt;30 m) and inshore deep-water (&gt; 30 m) habitats are identified in Port Foster and described. Port Foster may be a refuge for juvenile fishes such as Champsocephalus gunnari. Limited exchange with the surrounding waters also may limit the influence of recruitment and prey abundance fluctuations outside Port Foster. Trematomus scotti had heavy body cavity parasite infestation from Port Foster, possibly due in part to decreased benthic scour from large icebergs, allowing benthic parasites to persist. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

"492","fish_antarctic","Interdecadal changes in at-sea distribution and abundance of subantarctic seabirds along a latitudinal gradient in the Southern Indian Ocean","Long-term demographic studies have recently shown that global climate change together with increasing direct impacts of human activities, such as fisheries, are affecting the population dynamics of marine top predators. However, the effects of these factors on species distribution and abundance at sea are still poorly understood, particularly in marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Using a unique long-term data set of at-sea observations, we tested for interdecadal (1980s vs. 2000s) changes in summer abundance and distribution of 12 species of Albatrosses and Petrels along a 30¬∞ latitudinal gradient between tropical and Antarctic waters of the southern Indian Ocean. There were contrasting effects of climate change on subantarctic seabird distribution and abundance at sea. While subtropical waters showed the highest rate of warming, the species that visited this water mass showed the greatest changes in distribution and abundance. The abundance of Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) and Giant Petrels (Macronectes sp.) declined markedly, whereas the other species showed contrasting trends or did not change. With the exception of the White-chinned Petrel, these decreases were at least partly related to regional increase in sea surface temperature. The southward shift of Wandering Albatross and Prions (Pachyptila spp.) distributions could be ascribed to species redistribution or decrease in abundance due to warming of the subtropical waters. Surprisingly, White-chinned Petrel distribution shifted northward, suggesting more complex mechanisms. This study is the first to document a shift in species range in the Southern Ocean related to climate change and contrasting abundance changes. It suggests that some species might experience more severe impacts from climate change depending on the water masses they visit. As climate changes are predicted to continue in the next decades, understanding species responses to climate change is crucial for conservation management, especially when their conservation status is critical or unknown. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02169.x","2-s2.0-77954160232",11,0.716317044,1

To date there is little known about larvaceans in the Southern Ocean and their ecological role. This paper details a Larvacean survey conducted during the BROKE-West voyage (Jan-Mar 2006) to the southwest Indian Ocean sector of the East Antarctic margin between 30 and 80¬∞E and 60 and 70¬∞S. Larvacean abundances were quantified from three sampling devices: a ring net with 150-Œºm mesh and cross-sectional area of 0.8 m2; a Rectangular Mid-Water Trawl (RMT1) with 300-Œºm mesh and a nominal cross-sectional area of 1 m2; and a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) with a 270-Œºm mesh and a 1.6-cm2 cross-sectional area. The samples collected from the ring net were identified to the species level using stereo dissecting microscopes and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The survey revealed two species: Oikopleura gaussica and Fritillaria drygalski. The abundance of both species increased from &lt;1 ind. m-3 to 5.8 ind. m-3 as the survey progressed from west to east and decreased from 5.8 ind. m-3 in the north to 2 ind. m-3 in the south until the shelf region and marginal sea-ice zone where abundances increased to 4 ind. m-3. Statistically significant relationships were identified between abundance and latitude in samples from the RMT1 and Ring net. There was also a relationship between the larvacean abundance from the RMT1 and longitude. Although larvacean distribution and abundance patterns appeared to agree with the large-scale oceanographic boundaries of the survey area, there were no statistically significant relationships between larvacean abundance and any physical oceanography parameters. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"68","fish_antarctic","Estimating relative abundance of whales from historical Antarctic whaling records","Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is often the only data available from historical fisheries for inferring distribution and abundance of exploited populations. CPUE underestimates variations in relative abundance when gross effort data are only measured in total operating days. Gross effort includes both searching time and handling time, but only searching time is useful for an index of abundance. A method is developed for estimating searching time by subtracting a maximum likelihood estimate of handling time from the gross effort. An expectation maximization (E-M) algorithm is used to combine maximum likelihood estimates of the handling time with the expected additional operating time due to handling the last catch of each day. Simulation tests show that the estimates of catch per unit of searching time (C/CSW) are much closer to proportionally related to local density than gross CPUE. Estimates of handling time are not unbiased, and some nonlinearity between local density and C/CSW may persist. The methods may be useful for other fisheries where historic gross catch and effort data involve both searching and handling.","10.1139/cjfas-2013-0016","2-s2.0-84891697927",26,0.686566498,1

In spite of their abundance and important role in Antarctic food chains, very little is known of many ecological and biological aspects of this species. A combined trawl and acoustic survey of silverfish was carried out on the western Ross Sea shelf during the New Zealand International Polar Year Census of Antarctic Marine Life research voyage on R.V. Tangaroa in February-March 2008. Multi-frequency acoustic data (12, 38, 70, and 120. kHz) allowed discrimination of silverfish marks from those of krill and other associated species. Mark identification was achieved using targeted midwater trawls. Additional midwater and demersal trawls were carried out at randomly selected locations over the shelf as part of the core biodiversity survey. Silverfish were widely distributed over the Ross Sea shelf. Adult silverfish tended to form layers at 100-400. m depth and were sometimes present close to the bottom, where they were frequently caught in demersal trawls shallower than 500. m. A weak layer at about 80. m depth was associated with juvenile silverfish of 50-80. mm standard length. Acoustic backscatter strength from both silverfish and krill marks increased with increasing frequency (i.e., was highest at 120. kHz), which is characteristic of species without an air-filled swimbladder. Acoustic target strengths (TS) for silverfish at 12, 18, 38, 70, and 120. kHz were estimated from anatomically detailed scattering models based on computed tomography (CT) scans of frozen specimens. The relationship between TS and fish length at 38. kHz was sensitive to estimates of density and sound speed contrast within the fish, especially for small specimens (less than 110. mm SL). Our best estimate of the acoustic biomass of silverfish in the study area was 592. 000. t (95% confidence interval 326. 000-866. 000. t). However, the biomass of juvenile silverfish was highly uncertain due to large differences between TS model results. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.05.018","2-s2.0-79851504877",22,0.656260345,0

In some areas, typically associated with bathymetric features such as shelf edges and canyons, they may aggregate densely to form hotspots. Despite the importance of such hotspots, their development over time in demographic composition and spatial distribution is not well understood. A fishing vessel during regular operation was used for collection of krill demographic and acoustic data on the shelf northwest of South Orkney Islands. Results show a decrease in the proportion of subadult males, partly reflected in an increase in mature adult males. Concurrently, there was a change in the proportion of males in the sampled population from 0.8 to 0.3, indicating immigration or emigration of krill through the hotspot. A clear trend was observed in the diurnal vertical distribution with deeper and more vertically compact swarms during the day. However, some days displayed very small differences between the day and night distribution and considerable variability in the daytime depth distribution. It was noted that although fishing was carried out during the entire period of the study, there was no obvious trend in the acoustic backscatter, suggesting that the overall krill density was not changing during this period. Using a fishing vessel as a research platform has advantages for understanding the dynamics of the fishery and in quantifying biological and physical processes during actual exploitation of these resources. ¬© 2015, The Author(s).","10.1007/s00300-015-1735-7","2-s2.0-84940963204",8,0.65556384,0

A nursery ground for eggs of this species was first identified in 2002 in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), where eggs were found trapped in ice platelets under the sea-ice during the spring. As part of a monitoring program aimed at understanding the geographic and temporal characteristics of this nursery ground, the present study reports on surveys carried out in the austral springs of 2005 and 2006 using a simple and effective method for sampling from the sea-ice. These surveys enabled the evaluation of the spatial range of the nursery area of the Antarctic silverfish in the sea-ice of the coastal area of Victoria Land between the Coulman Island and the Drygalski Glacier Tongue. P. antarcticum eggs were concentrated in an area of Terra Nova Bay of about 270 km 2, encompassing two adjacent sites, Gerlache Inlet and Silverfish Bay. The present results add information on life cycle and hatching period of the Antarctic silverfish and confirm the importance of the Terra Nova Bay as a nursery area for this important species. Moreover, the survey points to the sea-ice cover and platelet ice as important environmental features of the nursery area. ¬© 2012 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00300-012-1199-y","2-s2.0-84866035538",24,0.642374078,0
"99","fish_antarctic","Winter distribution and size structure of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba populations in-shore along the West Antarctic Peninsula","Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are a key component of food webs in the maritime West Antarctic Peninsula, and their life history is tied to the seasonal cycles of sea ice and primary production in the region. Previous work has shown a general in-shore migration of krill in winter in this region; however, the very near-shore has not often been sampled as part of these surveys. We investigated distribution, abundance, and size structure of krill in 3 fjordic bays along the peninsula, and in the adjacent Gerlache Strait area using vertically stratified MOCNESS net tows and ADCP acoustic biomass estimates. Krill abundance was high within bays, with net estimated densities exceeding 60 krill m-3, while acoustic estimates were an order of magnitude higher. Krill within bays were larger than krill in the Gerlache Strait. Within bays, krill aggregations were observed near the seafloor during the day with aggregations extending to the sediment interface, and exhibited diel vertical migration higher into the water column at night. We suggest these high winter krill abundances within fjords are indicative of an active seasonal migration by krill in the peninsula region. Potential drivers for such a migration include reduced advective losses and costs, and availability of sediment food resources within fjords. Seasonally near-shore krill may also affect stock and recruitment assessments and may have implications for managing the krill fishery in this area. ¬© 2016 Inter-Research.","10.3354/meps11772","2-s2.0-84976400534",34,0.627041873,0

Opening and closing nets were used to investigate patterns in the distribution and abundance of mesopelagic fish from the surface to 1000. m on a series of transects across the Scotia Sea from the ice-edge to the Antarctic Polar Front. A total of 141 non-target net hauls were undertaken during three cruises (Nov 2006, Jan 2008 and Mar 2009), with 7852 teleost fish captured, representing 43 species in 17 families. A further 1517 fish were caught in targeted net hauls. The dominant families were the Myctophidae (6961 specimens; 21 species) and Bathylagidae (1467 specimens; 4 species). Few fish were caught in the upper 400. m during daylight, which was attributed to a combination of net avoidance and diurnal vertical migration. Species composition was linked to depth and location and was closely associated with oceanographic features. Diversity was lowest in cold water at the most southerly stations, which were dominated by Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Bathylagus antarcticus. Further north, diversity increased with the addition of species such as Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum bolini and Electrona carlsbergi. The depth integrated biomass of myctophids was similar across the latitudinal transect and produced an estimate of 4.5 million tonnes in the Scotia Sea. Bathylagids were patchily distributed, but were abundant in the lower mesopelagic zone (>400. m) and are potentially significant zooplankton consumers. Given the biomass of the myctophids and bathylagids coupled with the vertical migrations of many species, these fish are likely to play a significant role in carbon export from the surface waters to the deep ocean. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.dsr2.2011.07.003","2-s2.0-84855966526",21,0.623902672,1

The upper 200 m of the water column were sampled with an 8 m2 rectangular midwater trawl at 93 stations. The larval species community clustered in a diverse coastal community with high densities of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum larvae and a less diverse offshore community dominated by Antarctic jonasfish Notolepis coatsi and the lanternfish Electrona antarctica. No postlarval fish were caught in coastal areas. The offshore community of postlarval fishes consisted of the deep-sea smelt Bathylagus antarcticus, and the lanternfishes Gymnoscopelus braueri, C. nicholsi and E. antarctica. The latter species clearly dominated, occurring at mean individual and wet mass densities of 0.17 individuals nr2 and 0.26 g m-2, respectively. A generalized additive model significantly related the density of postlarval E. antarctica to the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, ocean depth and sea surface temperature. The diet of E. antarctica was dominated by copepods and euphausiid larvae. Mean energy density of E. antarctica in the upper 200 m was 2.8 kJ m-2, which is equivalent to 36% of the energy stored in Antarctic krill stocks and probably would be considerably higher if a greater depth range were considered. This suggests that E. antarctica is a major energy transmitter in the food web of the Lazarev Sea, challenging the classical krill-dominated food web paradigm of the Southern Ocean. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.","10.3354/meps07530","2-s2.0-53949084457",4,0.617769187,0

Modern krill stocks have been estimated directly by net hauls and acoustic surveys; the historical krill density especially the long-term one in the Southern Ocean, however, is unknown. Here we inferred the relative krill population changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) over the 20th century from the trophic level change of Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella using stable carbon (Œ¥ 13C) and nitrogen (Œ¥ 15N) isotopes of archival seal hairs. Since Antarctic fur seals feed preferentially on krill, the variation of Œ¥ 15N in seal hair indicates a change in the proportion of krill in the seal's diets and thus the krill availability in local seawater. For the past century, enriching fur seal Œ¥ 15N values indicated decreasing krill availability. This is agreement with direct observation for the past ~30 years and suggests that the recently documented decline in krill populations began in the early parts of the 20th century. This novel method makes it possible to infer past krill population changes from ancient tissues of krill predators. ¬© 2011 Huang et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0027331","2-s2.0-80455158338",16,0.610512212,0
"1112","fish_antarctic","Absolute abundance estimates from shallow water baited underwater camera surveys; a stochastic modelling approach tested against field data","Baited underwater cameras are becoming a popular tool to monitor fish and invertebrate populations within protected and inshore environments where trawl surveys are unsuitable. Modelling the arrival times of deep-sea grenadiers using an inverse square relationship has enabled abundance estimates, comparable to those from bottom trawl surveys, to be gathered from deep-sea baited camera surveys. Baited underwater camera systems in the shallow water environments are however, currently limited to relative comparisons of assemblages based on simple metrics such as Max<inf>N</inf> (maximum number of fish seen at any one time). This study describes a stochastic simulation approach used to model the behaviour of fish and invertebrates around a BUC system to enable absolute abundance estimates to be generated from arrival patterns. Species-specific models were developed for the tropical reef fishes the black tip grouper (Epinephelus fasciatus) and moray eel (Gymnothorax spp.) and the Antarctic scavengers; the asteroid (Odontaster validus) and the nemertean worm (Parbolasia corrugatus). A sensitivity analysis explored the impact of input parameters on the arrival patterns (Max<inf>N</inf>, time to the arrival of the first individual and the time to reach Max<inf>N</inf>) for each species generated by the model. Sensitivity analysis showed a particularly strong link between Max<inf>N</inf> and abundance indicating that this model could be used to generate absolute abundances from existing or future Max<inf>N</inf> data. It in effect allows the slope of the Max<inf>N</inf> vs. abundance relationship to be estimated. Arrival patterns generated by each model were used to estimate population abundance for the focal species and these estimates were compared to data from underwater visual census transects. Using a Bland-Altman analysis, baited underwater camera data processed using this model were shown to generate absolute abundance estimates that were comparable to underwater visual census data. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.jembe.2015.07.010","2-s2.0-84938151856",9,0.601670927,0

Overall pteropod densities during SAZ-Sense were lower than those reported for higher-latitude Southern Ocean waters. The four major contributors to the Sub-Antarctic Zone pteropod community during the SAZ-Sense voyage, Clio pyramidata forma antarctica, Clio recurva, Limacina helicina antarctica and Limacina retroversa australis, accounted for 93% of all pteropods observed. The distribution of the two dominant pteropods collected in the Sub-Antarctic Zone, L. retroversa australis and C. pyramidata forma antarctica, is strongly related to latitude and depth. L. retroversa australis is typical of cold southern (50-54¬∞S) polar waters and C. pyramidata forma antarctica is typical of shallow (top 20. m) Sub-Antarctic Zone waters. A moored sediment trap deployed to 2100. m at 47¬∞S, 141¬∞E in 2003/04 showed the pteropod flux in the Sub-Antarctic Zone had late-Spring and mid-summer peaks.

"159","fish_antarctic","Through a glass less darkly-New approaches for studying the distribution, abundance and biology of Euphausiids","Euphausiids are vital components of many oceanic foodwebs. Due to their large size, they are key prey species for many vertebrates, and several species are subject to commercial fisheries. The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises-usually in summer-to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species.

"1621","fish_antarctic","Abundance estimation of diving animals by the double-platform line transect method","In conventional line transect theory, it is assumed that all animals on the line are detected. This article introduces an extended and generalized hazard probability model without the need for such an assumption. The proposed method needs a survey design with independent observers having the same visual region and assumes an explicit distinction of simultaneous and delayed duplicates. It can take account of random heterogeneity caused by surfacing behavior as well as systematic heterogeneity by covariate effects. Furthermore, it can be easily extended to cases in which data from incompletely independent observers are available. The abundance estimate is based on the Horvitz-Thompson estimator in unequal detectability sampling scheme. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed method has good performance.

The abundance of the Ant4D3 subgroup, detected by a new FISH probe, was 10% of the total community and half of the gammaproteobacterial population. The Ant4D3, Polaribacter, and SAR11 subgroups accounted for the majority of the Gammaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteria-Flavobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria, respectively. Approximately 40% of the total microbial community actively incorporated leucine (added at 20 nmol L-1), while a smaller fraction (12-22%) used protein and an amino acid mixture (added at tracer concentrations). The fractions of SAR11, Polaribacter, and Ant4D3 that were active differed from each other and varied among substrates. SAR11 had the largest fraction of active cells incorporating leucine, while Polaribacter dominated the community using protein. The fraction of Ant4D3 using different compounds did not vary, but this group dominated the incorporation of amino acids, and was an abundant and active component of the bacterial community. Bacteria in the WAP region were as active as bacteria in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, even though total bacterial production was lower in the WAP. Though persistently cold (0-1¬∞C) and dominated by different bacterial taxa, the single-cell activity of this summertime Antarctic bacterial community was comparable to that of temperate communities. ¬© 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.","10.4319/lo.2010.55.6.2526","2-s2.0-78649609576",35,0.325824287,0

Repeat counts of photographs had coefficients of variation (CVs) of 6.6% and the main ground count methods had CVs of 3%-5%. Between the 1940s and 1990s there was an apparently continuous 82%-88% decrease (at 1.5%-2.7% p.a.) in nest numbers at three photographed grey-headed mollymawk colonies. Ground counts in 1995-97 recorded 7800 grey-headed mollymawk nests/yr (6200 with eggs during mid-October), representing a population of about 11800 (biennially breeding) pairs. Extrapolating back from these data, there may have been 43 000 grey-headed mollymawk nests/yr in the 1940s. Environmental changes affecting the food supply are the most likely explanation for the long-term decline. One Campbell mollymawk colony showed an increase of 11% in nest numbers between the 1940s and 1966, a decrease of 47% by the 1980s, then a gradual recovery of 3.2% p.a. Extrapolation suggests there were about 31 300 Campbell mollymawk nests in the 1940s. There were 24 600 nests in 1995-97 (21 000 with eggs during mid-October). The large decrease in the late 1960s to early 1980s coincided with the peak in long-line fishing for southern bluefin tuna. Regular monitoring of mollymawk populations (preferably with a suite of species) is recommended; three consecutive years every decade is a minimum requirement. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to test links between environmental change and mollymawk population trends. ¬© July 2004, Department of Conservation.",NA,"2-s2.0-4344683258",2,0.885292778,1
"227","fish_australasia","Estimating the rate of quasi-extinction of the Australian grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus) population using deterministic age- and stage-classified models","Grey nurse sharks off the east coast of Australia are listed nationally as ""critically endangered"" under Schedule 1 of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) and may number no more than 300 in New South Wales and southern Queensland waters. They are an inshore, coastal dwelling species and were severely depleted by spearfishing in the 1960s. The population has continued to decline despite protection since 1984. Their life history (long-lived to 25+ years), late maturation (6-8 years), low fecundity (maximum 2 live young biennially), specific habitat requirements, limited inshore distribution, and small population size render them particularly vulnerable to extinction. We estimated the time to quasi-extinction (years elapsed for the population to consist of ‚â§50 females) for the grey nurse shark population off the east coast of Australia based on current estimates of abundance and known anthropogenic rates of mortality. Estimated minimum population size was 300 as of 2002, and minimum anthropogenic mortality assessed from recovered carcasses was 12/year of which 75% were females. We modelled time to quasi-extinction using deterministic age- and stage-classified models for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios. Population size was estimated at 300 (worst), 1000 (likely) and 3000 (best). Anthropogenic mortality was added to the model assuming either all carcasses are being recovered (best), or conservatively, that only 50% are reported (realistic). Depending on model structure, if all carcasses are being reported, quasi-extinction times for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios range from 13 to 16 years, 84-98 years and 289-324 years, respectively. If under-reporting is occurring, time to quasi-extinction ranges from 6 to 8 years, 45-53 years and 173-200 years, respectively. In all scenarios modelled the grey nurse shark population will decline if no further steps are taken to remove anthropogenic sources of mortality. Because estimates of quasi-extinction rate depend on initial population size, and sensitivity analysis revealed that population rate of change was most sensitive to changes in the survival probability of the smallest length classes, obtaining precise estimates of abundance and annual survival of young females is critical. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Central to this is the use of line transect surveys and estimations of the detection rate of geoduck (show-factor) using counts of siphon holes. Studies were restricted to less than 17 m water depth. Geoduck in Kennedy Bay were found from 4-8 m water depth, whereas geoduck in Wellington Harbour occurred in several separate beds from 4-16 m. In Wellington Harbour, there was a pattern of increasing numbers with depth up to ‚àº15 m. Numbers seemed to decrease thereafter. Analysis of sediment samples indicated that P. zelandica was more prevalent in fine sand to fine silty sand substrates. P. abrupta is found in similar habitats. There was no significant difference in the show-factor (the proportion of geoduck detectable by sight or touch vs. the actual number of geoduck present) of geoduck with respect to season (summer and winter), region (Wellington Harbour and Kennedy Bay), or tidal height (low, mid, and high tide). Hence, a mean show-factor of 0.914 was used to adjust density estimates from all surveyed populations. Estimates of the mean population density (¬±SE) of P. zelandica were much lower than those reported for P. abrupta ranging from 0.058 (¬±0.01) geoduck/m2 in Kennedy Bay to 0.489 (¬±0.08) geoduck/m2 in Shelly Bay, Wellington Harbour. Survey densities, abundance, and biomass estimates were reasonably well determined with coefficients of variation (CVs) generally less than 20%. The results suggest that the methods used to provide population estimates for P. abrupta are readily transferable to P. zelandica. However, further research needs to be conducted on the diver variability on counts of geoduck, the role that geoduck occurring in water depths &gt;17 m play in the population dynamics of local populations, and the density dependence of fertilization success of P. zelandica. Given the low estimates of density in this study, fisheries managers will have to carefully consider the feasibility of sustainably harvesting this species.",NA,"2-s2.0-13544250627",4,0.84991163,0

The present study involved surveys of the Green and Golden Bell Frog locations that were known in 1995, surveys of new locations or potential areas for new locations of this species, and review of management plans and other documented information concerning particular populations. Over the last 12 years extinctions have continued with the loss of almost 50% of those sub-populations and 23% of populations known in 1995. Obviously the species cannot sustain this rate of loss for much longer and continue to exist within New South Wales. Protection for remaining extant populations is very limited and most are under continuing threat. Management plans have been prepared in relation to a number of sub-populations/populations, but these plans have not focused on populations under current threat, and associated management actions designed to benefit this frog have occurred in only a few cases. Hence, decline of this species within NSW is likely to continue. Habitat change, mostly through destruction and disturbance, has been the major factor in population loss with the likelihood of extinction increasing with increases in the extent of habitat loss as measured by the number of habitat variables that have declined. Invasion by exotic predatory fish Gambusia holbrooki, previously linked with declines in this frog species, shows no apparent association with extinction of populations over the last 12 years and poses no apparent current threat to any population, apparently because any impact of this species has been ameliorated through the presence of submerged/floating aquatic vegetation which may provide some protection against predation for eggs and tadpoles. The steps most likely to improve the conservation status of the Green and Golden Bell Frog within the state are habitat enhancement/development and restoration of movement links between nearby populations.","10.7882/AZ.2008.010","2-s2.0-58149333702",28,0.848459096,1
"513","fish_australasia","Decline in whale shark size and abundance at Ningaloo Reef over the past decade: The world's largest fish is getting smaller","Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways.

Samples of foods taken by adults (were collected for identification of major prey species. Banding of chicks and observations of adults previously banded as chicks (particularly at Wedge Light) provided information on the source of breeding adults and age of return to colonies. Wedge Light colony, estab¬≠lished in 1966, has reached some 50 pairs: breeding there is now limited by available space. At Pope‚Äôs Eye, where breeding began before 1985, space also limited breeding but the provision of an additional platform in 1989 led to a dou¬≠bling of adults nesting (to c. 120 in 1991-92). Nest building at the study sites began in August-September, and eggs were laid mainly in September; second, or replacement, eggs from November-December. Most hatching took place October-November, with chicks fledging January-Febru- ary; there was some variation in timing between years. Numbers of clutches laid, as a proportion of nest attempts, were consistently higher at Wedge Light; at Pope‚Äôs Eye some nests were lost presumably as a result of bad weather. Hatching success was similar at both sites (64%), some 89% of chicks hatched left the platforms; mean breeding success (chicks fledged/eggs laid) was 57%. Although relatively few chicks died or were lost (9-14%), about 36% of eggs failed to hatch (mainly through loss). Nest success was influenced, to some extent, by exposure, particularly at Pope‚Äôs Eye where seas may wash over breeding sites and drainage is poor. The extended breeding period may reflect local weath¬≠er conditions and less reliable food availability. In this study, individual prey items were mainly Pilchards Sarclinops sagax (58.4%); other taxa (20 fish, four cephalopods and a shrimp species) were generally represented by a few indi¬≠viduals. On average, prey species weighed 45 g, were 141 mm long, 15 mm wide and 26 mm deep; Pilchards were mostly (72%) < 140 mm long. Most regurgitations collected (mean mass 146 g) contained only one fish species (82%). As in other dietary studies of gannets, prey species were pri¬≠marily inshore, schooling and pelagic. Little is known of factors influencing the distribution or abundance of the prey species; food deliveries at breeding colonies were lighter than those reported elsewhere, which may indicate local for¬≠aging. At both sites, colonies have grown as a consequence, in part at least, of the recruitment of chicks fledged at Wedge Light. Expansion at Wedge Light is now impossible, and at Pope‚Äôs Eye there is little additional area for breeding. The provision of more artificial platforms might further in¬≠crease the local population. ¬© 1995 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.","10.1071/MU9950023","2-s2.0-0028979809",121,0.828257178,1

An 18-year dataset obtained for Michaelmas Cay in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, was used to assess population trends for three tern species relative to two potential threatening processes, namely human impacts (as either commercial fishing or tourism) and cyclone activity. We found a positive, 2-year lagged relationship between long-line catch per unit effort in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery in the vicinity of Michaelmas Cay and breeding participation in the two pelagic foraging terns, but not in the inshore foraging tern. The abundance of large pelagic fish may influence recruitment into the breeding populations of the two pelagic terns in the following years through impacts on prey availability. Long-term population trends for all seabirds were not related to localised direct disturbance from cyclones or associated changes in cay size and/or nesting habitat. Current management protocols in place for the tourism industry at the cay appear to be minimising direct human impacts. Other evidence from this breeding location suggesting that climate variation may be driving foraging success and breeding-population dynamics in the two pelagic terns implies that a precautionary approach is warranted to the management of any potential stressors to birds in this system. ¬© CSIRO 2009.","10.1071/WR08142","2-s2.0-68549105998",32,0.812048741,1

Commercial catch and effort data were used to indicate spatial and temporal abundance. Catch sampling provided fish measurements and estimates of age, sex and reproductive maturity. Catches were from throughout South Australia's gulf region, but three areas separated by hundreds of kilometres produced the highest catches. These relatively protected areas support extensive beds of intertidal and subtidal seagrasses. Statewide commercial fishery catches demonstrated considerable inter-annual variation of 240-320 t year-1. Catches were dominated by 1+ and 2+ fish, with few individuals from the 3+ to 5+ age classes. Females dominated the sex ratios, were the largest individuals, and the largest from each age class. No running ripe fish were sampled. Seasonal variation in the catch and in the lack of spawning fish suggested that adults might move from fishing areas during the spawning season. Length/weight and length/age relationships did not differ between areas separated by hundreds of kilometres, suggesting large-scale movement.

In Patagonia, Argentina, it is the most abundant species of gull. However, population trends have been reported for only a few colonies and there has been no evaluation of population changes at a regional scale. In this study we provide an update on the distribution and size of Kelp Gull colonies along 1800km of coastline of northern Patagonia, and assess population trends over a period of 15 years (1994-2008) at different spatial scales (colony, coastal sector, region). In northern Patagonia, Kelp Gulls currently breed in 68 colonies, which range in size from a few to 11000 breeding pairs. Ten new sites were colonised in the study period.

Tiger shark catch data were gathered over 7 years of tag and release research fishing (1991-2000, 2002-2004) in Shark Bay, Western Australia (25¬∞45‚Ä≤S, 113¬∞44‚Ä≤E). Sharks were caught using drumlines deployed in six permanent zones (‚àº3 km2 in area). Fishing effort was standardized across days and months, and catch rates on hooks were expressed as the number of sharks caught h-1. A total of 449 individual tiger sharks was captured; 29 were recaptured. Tiger shark catch rate showed seasonal periodicity, being higher during the warm season (Sep-May) than during the cold season (Jun-Aug), and was marked by inter-annual variability. The most striking feature of the catch data was a consistent pattern of slow, continuous variation within each year from a peak during the height of the warm season (February) to a trough in the cold season (July). Annual growth rates of recaptured individuals were generally consistent with estimates from other regions, but exceeded those for populations elsewhere for sharks &gt;275 cm fork length (FL), perhaps because mature sharks in the study area rely heavily on large prey. The data suggest that (1) the threat of predation faced by animals consumed by tiger sharks fluctuates dramatically within and between years, and (2) efforts to monitor large shark abundance should be extensive enough to detect inter-annual variation and sufficiently intensive to account for intra-annual trends. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2006.","10.1007/s00227-006-0278-4","2-s2.0-33745591140",23,0.785498784,1

The entrance channel to the Lakes was an important feeding site. Numbers feeding there increased on the flood tide and decreased on the ebb tide. Their dive rates followed the same pattern, suggesting they depended on shoals of juvenile fish entering the estuary during high tide. The number feeding varied from day to day, and dive rates were positively correlated with numbers, suggesting that the abundance of juvenile fish entering the channel also varied from day to day. There was no evidence that breeding success or number of breeding pairs were adversely affected by the 1995 mass mortalities of pilchard in the area. However, breeding success was reduced significantly in 1999 and 2000 following the 1998/1999 pilchard mortality. The 1995 mortality affected mainly larger size classes of pilchard, whereas the 1998/1999 mortality also affected younger age classes.

Ages ranged from 0 to 41 years, and males were on average larger at age than females after age 6 for fish sampled in the southern oceans. This sexual dimorphism in growth contributed to the sex ratio being biased toward males for length classes ‚â•170 cm FL. The estimated age composition of catches, derived from age-length keys applied to length frequency data, showed clear differences between fisheries and fishing grounds that are consistent with seasonal and ontogenetic changes in migration patterns. Specific information that can be gained on the distribution and migration of juveniles from their relative abundance in catches is limited because of unknown targeting or discarding practices on some fishing grounds. However, the occurrence of 2-4-year-old SBT on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean during the austral summer confirms that juveniles are not restricted to the southern coastal waters of Australia, and that a divergent migration path must exist possibly near the southern west coast of Australia. During the winter months, SBT aged 2-4 years were caught on all fishing grounds south of the spawning ground, confirming that they are capable of extensive migrations. By age 5, SBT were rarely caught north of about 35¬∞S, except in waters adjacent to Australia's west coast where adults were caught migrating to/from the spawning ground. The commercial catch of SBT in the southern oceans was dominated by juveniles and sub-adults on most fishing grounds examined. Off north-east New Zealand, however, the majority of fish caught were of spawning age (61% were >10-year old) suggesting that the Tasman Sea may form the eastern boundary for juvenile migration. SBT caught on the spawning ground ranged in age from 8 to 34 years with the majority being between 15- and 25-years old.

A significant trend towards more frequent, and stronger, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation events, warmer summer sea surface temperatures in Bass Strait, increased annual catches and catch per unit effort in the Victorian pilchard (Sardinops sagax) fishery and potential increased discarding of fisheries by catch may account for at least some of the observed increase in the Australasian gannet population.

The atherinid Leptatherina wallacei and the gobiids Pseudogobius olorum and Afurcagobius suppositus dominated the ichthyofauna, ranking, in terms of abundance, first, second and third, respectively, in each of the upstream, middle and downstream regions. These three species and 11 others, which also complete their life cycles within estuaries, constituted 46.4% of the number of species recorded and contributed 93.5% to the total catch of fish. The characteristics of the ichthyofauna in the upper reaches of this microtidal estuary underwent annual cyclical changes and differed between day and night, regions and years. The number of species and density of fish peaked during summer and typically declined to their minima in winter and then rose markedly in spring. The annual cyclical change undergone by the species composition of each region during both the day and night was due to the densities of certain species peaking at different times of the year. The cyclical changes in composition were less conspicuous in the year when, in the summer, highly atypical heavy rainfall led to a sharp rise in freshwater discharge and thus a pronounced decline in salinity. The number of species and density of fish were far greater at night than during the day and the species composition underwent diel changes. These differences were due, in particular, to relatively greater abundances and frequencies of occurrence at night of the estuarine species A. suppositus, P. olorum, L. wallacei and Acanthopagrus butcheri and of the introduced freshwater species Gambusia holbrooki. Overall, marine species were relatively more abundant in the downstream region, whereas the reverse was true for the freshwater and semi-anadromous species. The freshwater species G. holbrooki, the estuarine A. suppositus, the semi-anadromous Nematalosa vlaminghi and the marine species Mugil cephalus were relatively more abundant in the upstream and middle regions, while the opposite was true for the marine species Aldrichetta forsteri and the estuarine species P. olorum, A. butcheri and Amoya bifrenatus, the last of which is also represented by discrete marine populations. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A comparison at three New Zealand fished and protected areas","Across three areas, open-circuit scuba (OC) and rebreather (RB) surveys produced similar results for the density and size distribution of fish species inside and outside marine reserves. At Tonga Island, more Notolabrus celidotus were counted with OC than with RB, independently of reserve status [log-scale response ratio of OC/RB (RR) = 0.7]. At Long Island, differences in abundance of Parapercis colias between sampling methods were small at reserve sites (RR = -0.1), but more were counted with scuba than with RBs at fished sites (RR = 0.5). RRs for Pagrus auratus were -1.0 in fished areas and 0.3 in the reserve at Leigh. We also sampled each site using a baited video system (BUV) to establish whether diver-transects sampled the full size range of target species. Most fish in BUV views were Parapercis colias at Long Island (97%), and Pagrus auratus at Leigh (77%). Size structures of Parapercis colias were similar among all three sampling methods within reserve and fished areas at Long Island (max. chi-squared distance = 0.11). BUV samples for Pagrus auratus at Leigh did not detect a prominent juvenile size class observed by divers, but size-frequency distributions of OC, RB, and BUV corresponded at sizes beyond 15 cm TL (max. chi-squared distance = 0.08). To investigate the effects of diver sound on fish behaviour at Long Island, we also compared fish activity when divers with RBs or scuba were present, when the sound of each breathing apparatus was replayed underwater, when no divers were present and no sound was replayed, and when bait was provided, within the reserve only. The lowest number of fish visits to the focal area (mean of 3.0 per 10 min) for Parapercis colias occurred with RB divers present. Maximum abundances of Parapercis colias in all speaker treatments averaged 4.1 per 10 min, whereas with scuba divers present maximum abundances were 5.7, and with baits the average was 38.0 per 10 min. ¬© 2006 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00227-006-0420-3","2-s2.0-33847284409",90,0.760047567,0

We studied 2 marine reserves in northeastern New Zealand, the Leigh Marine Reserve (established 1975) and Tawharanui Marine Park (established 1982) in order to assess whether changes in protected predator populations had resulted in other indirect changes to grazers and consequently to algal abundance. Estimates of abundance of the most common demersal predatory fish Pagrus auratus indicated that adults of this species (i.e. large enough to prey upon urchins) were at least 5.75 and 8.70 times more abundant inside reserves than in adjacent unprotected areas. Overall, P. auratus were also much larger inside reserves with mean total lengths of 316 mm compared with 186 mm in fished areas. The spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii displayed similar trends, and was approximately 1.6 to 3.7 times more abundant inside the reserves than outside. Lobsters within the reserves had a mean carapace length of 109.9 mm, compared with 93.5 mm outside the reserves. In one of the reserves, densities of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus had declined from 4.9 to 1.4 m-2 since 1978 in areas formerly dominated by it. Consequently, kelp forests were more extensive in 1998 than they were at the time of reserve creation. Urchin-dominated barrens occupied only 14% of available reef substratum in reserves as opposed to 40% in unprotected areas. These changes in community structure, which have persisted since at least 1994, demonstrate not only higher trophic complexity than anticipated in Australasian ecosystems but also increased primary and secondary productivity in marine reserves as a consequence of protection. Trends inside reserves indicate large-scale reduction of benthic primary production as an indirect result of fishing activity in unprotected areas.","10.3354/meps189125","2-s2.0-0033607767",75,0.757427891,0

By making a number of simple assumptions, we use fish sustained swimming speed to calculate the effective area fished by a gillnet in a specified soak time to estimate abundance (fish¬∑km-2) from the number of fish caught. We used catch data from various sampling methods in northern Australia and elicited anecdotal information from experts to build a size distribution of the true population to compensate for size classes that were unlikely to be represented in the catch because of size selectivity of the gear. Our final abundance estimates for various-sized scombrids (0.04-4.17 fish¬∑km-2) and istiophorids (0.004-0.005 fish¬∑km-2) were similar to what has been estimated for similar species in more data-rich situations in tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean. The model is particularly useful in data-limited situations in which abundance or biomass estimates are required for pelagic fish species of low economic importance. These data are often required for ecosystem models (e.g., Ecopath) that are increasingly being considered as potential tools for ecosystem-based fisheries management. ¬© 2007 NRC.","10.1139/F07-073","2-s2.0-35349004762",19,0.757008541,1
"2112","fish_australasia","Is climate change affecting the population dynamics of the endangered Pacific loggerhead sea turtle?","The loggerhead sea turtle is an endangered species exposed to many anthropogenic hazards in the Pacific. It is widely held that pelagic longline fisheries pose the major risk for Pacific loggerheads but the effects of other risk factors such as human-induced global climate change have rarely been considered. So we used generalised additive regression modelling and autoregressive-prewhitened cross-correlation analysis to explore whether regional ocean temperatures affect the long-term nesting population dynamics for the 2 Pacific loggerhead genetic stocks (Japan, Australia). We found that both Pacific stocks have been exposed to slowly increasing trends in mean annual sea surface temperature in their respective core regional foraging habitats over the past 50¬†years. We show that irrespective of whether a population was decreasing or increasing that there was an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature in the core foraging region during the year prior to the summer nesting season. Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperatures are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity. So warming regional ocean temperatures could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment unless Pacific loggerheads adapt by shifting their foraging habitat to cooler regions. So the gradual warming of the Pacific Ocean over the past 50¬†years is a major risk factor that must be considered in any meaningful diagnosis of the long-term declines apparent for some Pacific loggerhead nesting populations. ¬© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This method was used in an estuary and compared with active (beam trawl, Danish seine, SCUBA visual counts) and passive (multi-panel gillnets, pots, Sabiki jigs, baited underwater video) fish sampling methods. The DUV detected a wide snapper size range (2-70 cm), which from around 5 cm and up appear to represent absolute abundance estimates. For snapper 5 cm and below, density estimates were less than those obtained by fine-mesh beam trawl, which sampled snapper down to 17 mm fork length (recent settlers from the plankton). Total DUV estimates of 0+ snapper abundance (3-9 cm) within this estuarine system were 64,000 ¬± 20,000 (standard error), compared to 105,000 ¬± 17,000 by beam trawl. For snapper 10 cm and larger (1+ and older), the DUV population estimate for the harbour was 166,000 ¬± 28,000. These larger snapper were not vulnerable to the beam trawl, while Danish seine sampling returned estimates of 20,000-80,000 (5000-20,000) fish, depending on the swept area assumptions used. None of the passive methods were able to provide relative or absolute estimates of the overall snapper population size, and each returned strongly skewed snapper length frequencies. The DUV was also able to collect detailed imagery of seafloor habitat features, at the spatial scales of both sampling transects, and individual sleeping fish. This combination of new technologies and specific fish behaviour (sleeping inert on the seafloor) offers a significant new sampling tool for assessing absolute fish abundance and associated population size structures. There is now a strong and ongoing focus by the marine science and management community, on seafloor habitat mapping, and associated Geographic Information System (GIS) resource inventorying. The addition of night deployed DUV sampling into such field deployments offers significant additional fish-habitat information gains to be made within these frameworks, at little additional cost. ¬© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Gradual increases in the abundance and average size of putative abalone predators inside the no-take Maria Island Marine Reserve (MIMR) have coincided with increases in the minimum size of the emergent abalone Haliotis rubra. This suggests that the threat of predation may influence the structuring of abalone populations. The abundance of emergent abalone was negatively associated with predator abundance, especially the rock lobster Jasus edwardsii, inside the MPA and in adjacent fished areas. Abalone leave cryptic habitat at smaller sizes in fished areas compared to abalone inside the MPA. Although the patterns in abalone size at emergence (SAE) were strongly correlated with rock lobster abundance and average size, the abundance of other predators (demersal predatory fish and crabs) or competitors (sea urchins) did not influence the patterns in abalone SAE. However, predation mortality in isolation could not account for the differences we observed in abalone size frequency distributions between MPA and adjacent fished locations. We suggest that a combination of factors including predation, intra and interspecific competitive interactions are responsible for patterns in abalone SAE. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.","10.3354/meps07521","2-s2.0-53549126882",46,0.753599365,1

Historically, a wide variety of native fish were abundant in the region, and they were an important component of the diet of the local Aboriginals. The region also quickly became the focus of a large commercial fishing enterprise after European settlement. Media records of the day suggest that the weekly catch varied from one to six tonnes of fish, mainly Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii). Catches of native fish soon began to decline, and combined with the later effects of other factors such as river regulation, native fish populations declined rapidly to present day levels. Today, whilst the Forest's fish fauna has been reduced in abundance and diversity and introduced species are common, the Forest remains an important area for native fish. This paper discusses historical accounts and the current status of fish fauna in the region, and highlights a number of the specific challenges pertaining to the sustainable management and rehabilitation of native fish populations in the region.",NA,"2-s2.0-33644553890",110,0.752753024,1

The species often occurs inshore at steeply shelving coastal and insular locations, and has now been identified by divers at eight widely separated shallow water sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, most O. ferox were caught by trawl on the continental slope, where its bathic range was extended to at least 880 m. Large specimens (>200 cm TL) were found across the whole depth range, but almost all juveniles were caught between 200 and 600 m. The largest recorded male was 344 cm TL, and female 450 cm TL. The few biological data suggest that size at maturity for males is around 200-250 cm TL, and for females 300-350 cm. No pregnant females were recorded but size at birth is probably about 100 cm TL. Nowhere has the species been found in large numbers. Survey and commercial catch data from south-east Australian trawl grounds suggest that numbers of O. ferox there have declined since the advent of deepwater commercial trawling in the 1970s. In areas of steep untrawlable terrain, increased gill-netting and longlining are likely to impact on local populations, with mature individuals being particularly vulnerable. Although O. ferox is not specifically targeted by commercial fishing activities, its likely very low fecundity make it susceptible to local extirpation, even at seemingly small capture rates. This species is protected off New South Wales and is considered "" vulnerable"" globally, by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","10.1007/s10641-007-9193-x","2-s2.0-36849057037",7,0.752444772,1

Streams with high benthic invertebrate abundance and drift of aquatic origin had high fish abundance. However, terrestrial drift was the dominant food for adult banded kokopu over all seasons and streams, on average comprising 75% of their diet by number and 89% by weight. Annual growth rates of tagged individuals ranged from 3 mm to 16.5 mm, with smaller fish growing faster than large fish. Low growth rates of large fish were consistent with the recapture of a fish that had only grown from 195 mm to 215 mm in 7 years. Our observations confirmed the strong association between banded kokopu, pool habitat, and cover, and also indicated that high fish abundance restricted growth rates and movement and increased interaction. ¬© 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","10.1080/00288330.2005.9517362","2-s2.0-22944477698",20,0.751923897,0

Five inshore and two offshore strata around Banks Peninsula, and five strata between the inner fiord and the open coast of Dusky Sound were surveyed. In Banks Peninsula the overall mean catch rate (all fish) was 2.13 kg/pot per h (range 0.04‚Äì4.74) and coefficient of variation (CV) was 10.8%. Blue cod from inshore strata were significantly smaller than those from offshore strata, catch rates were lower, and the sex ratio was skewed towards males (inshore 2.2:1, offshore 0.74:1). In Dusky Sound the overall mean catch rate was 2.69 kg/pot per h (range 1.28‚Äì8.42), CV was 6.3%, highest catch rates were on the open coast, and overall sex ratio was 0.78:1 (male:female). Blue cod in the 1940s from throughout New Zealand were on average larger than blue cod in Banks Peninsula and Dusky Sound during this survey. Low relative abundance and small size of blue cod from the more accessible inshore areas, is consistent with fishing pressure causing a reduction in size and probably abundance, particularly in Banks Peninsula inshore strata. In Banks Peninsula, sex ratios in inshore areas are skewed towards males, possibly a result of fishing pressure. The results support other studies on protogynous fish species in which the removal of the larger final sex fish (males), promotes sex inversion. The plasticity of the sex inversion means that blue cod may be capable of restoring optimal sex ratios in the natural state, but may over-compensate with size specific anthropogenic removal of large numbers of individuals that would otherwise inhibit the sex inversion process. ¬© 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","10.1080/00288330.2005.9517293","2-s2.0-18844437038",3,0.749331842,0

The recovery of the C. porosus population has been accompanied by an increase in the incidence of 'problem crocodiles' that represent a threat to people in freshwater and marine habitats. Despite the implications for human safety, little is known about C. porosus populations in the freshwater reaches of rivers, well upstream of tidal influence. In this study, we examined the density and body-size structure of C. porosus populations in three freshwater rivers using a combination of data from spotlight and helicopter surveys conducted between the 1980s and 2005, and the inland extent of C. porosus using distribution records in the Northern Territory. Since the 1980s, the density of C. porosus in upstream, freshwater reaches of the Daly and Roper rivers has increased, as has the inland extent of C. porosus on the Daly River. Although C. porosus was not detected in spotlight surveys of the Victoria River, helicopter survey and anecdotal records indicate that C. porosus was present after 1989. In all, 52.1% of the crocodiles sighted in spotlight surveys were 2.1-3.4 m long. Distribution records show that C. porosus occurs up to 235 km inland and at elevations of up to 126 m above sea level. The potential distribution of C. porosus is likely to be similar to that of barramundi (Lates calcarifer), a readily identifiable diadromous fish that must spawn in estuarine waters and occurs at elevations of up to 178 m above sea level. Because the density and inland extent of C. porosus in freshwater rivers is likely to increase, it is recommended that: (1) programs communicating crocodile awareness use the linkage between the presence of barramundi and the potential presence of C. porosus; (2) that crocodile warning signs be erected in upstream areas within the potential range of C. porosus; (3) that research be conducted on developing techniques to detect and exclude C. porosus from swimming areas; and (4) that widespread systematic surveys be undertaken to document the inland extent of C. porosus. ¬© CSIRO 2006.","10.1071/WR05090","2-s2.0-33751051692",25,0.739682384,1
"415","fish_australasia","An index-removal abundance estimator that allows for seasonal change in catchability, with application to southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii","The index-removal method provides estimates of abundance, exploitation rate, and catchability coefficient. Estimates from the original method suffer from poor precision. Recent work has improved the precision of model estimates; however, the method still includes the strong assumption of constant survey catchability over years and seasons. This assumption is not tenable in many fisheries. This work introduces a new multiyear model, 2qIR, that allows catchability to differ between surveys of the same year. Simulations were performed to examine the effects of variability in (1) the exploitation rate among years, (2) survey catchability, and (3) the number of years of data on model performance. The 2qIR model estimates were always more accurate and precise than those of the other models examined and other model scenarios in which there was moderate contrast in exploitation among years, regardless of the seasonal difference between survey catchability coefficients. The ratios of survey catchability tested ranged from 0.1 to 10, but the model worked best at catchability ratios greater than 0.3. The 2qIR model performance improved slightly when a third year was added to the data set, but performance was similar with 3 or 5 years of data. In all types of simulations, the 2qIR model estimates were usable (i.e., not negative, infinite, or made with a convergence error) a greater proportion of the time than were annual model estimates. The 2qIR model produced reasonable results when applied to data from a population of southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii in Tasmania, whereas the models that assume constant catchability among surveys sometimes predicted exploitation rates exceeding 100%. The results from both the simulations and the lobster data suggest that the 2qIR model can be reliably applied in more situations than models that assume constant survey catchability. ¬© Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.","10.1577/T06-272.1","2-s2.0-45249120195",24,0.706065543,0

Given a dramatic reduction of more than 50% in landed catch in a decade, there is a clear need to ensure that basic ecological data such as distribution and abundance are available for management use. Opportunistic sightings of wobbegongs collected by recreational scuba-divers were used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of wobbegongs in NSW. From July 2003 until January 2005, 304 dives were undertaken by recreational divers and 454 wobbegongs were reported. Larger numbers of wobbegongs were sighted in northern compared to southern NSW. Spotted and ornate wobbegongs were sighted in similar numbers, but species composition was highly variable across locations. Only a few juvenile and newborn spotted wobbegongs were sighted, whereas small ornate wobbegongs were mostly sighted north of central NSW. The latter were possibly the third, cryptic species, the dwarf ornate wobbegong. The paucity of sightings of small wobbegongs suggests that juveniles and newborns are inconspicuous to divers or that small wobbegongs are found in areas not visited by divers. Potential species and size segregation suggest that closing areas to fishing may enable populations to sustain current levels of commercial exploitation. The cost-effectiveness of using recreational scuba-divers to opportunistically collect distribution and relative abundance data was apparent from this study. However, the lack of spatial and temporal homogeneity in diving effort suggests that future studies should consider incorporating organized surveys and a facilitator, rather than using opportunistic records of sightings. ¬© 2009 EDP Sciences.","10.1051/alr/2009046","2-s2.0-70350349139",8,0.699837729,0

One approach is to estimate the proportion of animals present during each survey, using a model that estimates the dynamics of the survey proportion of the population. However, this can increase the uncertainty of the estimates if the dynamics parameters are not well estimated. Here we approached this problem by developing methods using hierarchical model structures, which allow us to share information on the dynamics parameters across years. We applied this modeling approach to the estimation of residence time and spawning biomass for New Zealand hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) in Cook Strait spawning grounds. By sharing parameters across years, we obtained better parameter estimates than by the traditional assumption that the dynamics in one year are independent of those of other years. By integrating the estimation of residence time into a dynamic model using simulated maximum likelihood methods, we also were able to calibrate acoustic estimates of spawning biomass for the fact that not all individuals are on the grounds at the time of the acoustic survey. We discuss alternative model formulations for the application of hierarchical methods to stage-structured data and the analysis of data from acoustic surveys of spawning fish.","10.1890/03-5078","2-s2.0-6344258746",5,0.684113753,0

Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species (genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by ‚â§100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100-300 km to 500-800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate (the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: (1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances ‚â§100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, (2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales (>800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance (‚â§800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and (3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef. ¬© 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[158:SSICRF]2.0.CO;2","2-s2.0-34247170276",15,0.661185062,1

Using two distinct approaches - a standard non-hierarchical model (NH) and a hierarchical Bayesian model (HB) - abundance and catchability coefficients from a fishery depletion process for banana prawns (Penaeus merguiensis) in northern Australia were estimated. Non-hierarchical models treated each stock and year separately and individually, whereas the hierarchical models assumed some form of common underlying population from which the parameters for the individual cases generated by the combination of stock and year were drawn. Two HBs were considered. In HB1 it was assumed that annual abundance and catchability parameters came from separate populations, or distributions, for each stock. In HB2 it was assumed that these stock region distributions were not separate, but had their parameters drawn from a common distribution. Thus in HB2 all stocks shared information at the regional level. The results for both NH and HB methods were similar in most cases, indicating a fair degree of stability irrespective of the particular form of model chosen. However, the NH method suffered because the data were analysed in generally small sections and in many cases these sections were too small to allow precise estimation of both parameters and confidence intervals. The deviations of point estimates between the HB1, HB2 and NH models were more marked in catchability coefficient estimates than in abundance estimates, and large relative deviations typically occurred in stock regions and years with low fishing efforts, low catch or poor depletion trends over time. We conclude that the combined analysis using HB was superior because it could handle limited data, yielded credible interval estimates for all parameters and was computationally more efficient. ¬© CSIRO 2008.","10.1071/MF07090","2-s2.0-38649110506",22,0.656915177,0
"652","fish_australasia","Fish assemblages of an Australian dryland river: Abundance, assemblage structure and recruitment patterns in the Warrego River, Murray-Darling Basin","Fish in dryland rivers must cope with extreme variability in hydrology, temperature and other environmental factors that ultimately have a major influence on their patterns of distribution and abundance at the landscape scale. Given that fish persist in these systems under conditions of high environmental variability, dryland rivers represent ideal systems to investigate the processes contributing to and sustaining fish biodiversity and recruitment in variable environments. Hence, spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure was examined in 15 waterholes of the Warrego River between October 2001 and May 2003. Fish assemblages in isolated waterholes were differentiated at the end of the dry 2001 winter but were relatively similar following high summer flows in January 2002 as a consequence of high hydrological connectivity among waterholes. Small, shallow waterholes supported more species and higher abundances than large-deep waterholes. Large, deep waterholes provided important refuge for large-bodied fish species such as adult yellowbelly, Macquaria ambigua, and the eel-tailed catfish, Tandanus tandanus. Recruitment patterns of bony bream (Nematalosa erebi), Hyrtl's tandan (Neosilurus hyrtlii) and yellowbelly were associated with high flow events and backwater inundation; however recruitment of yellowbelly and bony bream was also evident following a zero-flow period. Departures from typical flood-induced seasonal spawning patterns may reflect opportunistic spawning behaviours appropriate to the erratic patterns of flooding and dry spells in dryland rivers. ¬© CSIRO 2006.","10.1071/MF06025","2-s2.0-33748515239",11,0.647716999,1

Variation in population data provided by each method, including relative abundance indices, size structure, and habitat preferences, were examined. Aspects of behaviour and activity patterns were also investigated. Night sampling using all methods consistently yielded larger catches than day sampling. The size structure of catches varied, with electrofishing at night and fyke netting during the day having higher proportions of juveniles, whilst snorkelling at night and electrofishing during the day had higher proportions of adults. Fyke netting at night yielded by far the largest catches (~3-fold more than other methods) and also captured balanced proportions of juveniles and adults. Galaxias auratus had a strong diel activity pattern and were most active at night. The majority of the population migrated into the littoral zone during the night and back into deeper water during the day. A small number of juveniles remained in the littoral zone and some adults sheltered in the dense cover of species-rich littoral vegetation during the day. Shores with shallow depth profiles appeared to be preferred due to higher catches in these areas using all methods. Based on the results of this study, fyke netting at night in littoral habitats is recommended for monitoring populations of G. auratus. Fyke netting is likely to be an effective method for monitoring other lacustrine galaxiid species; however, further work is required to investigate the effects of habitat variables and fish community structure on activity patterns of galaxiids, and hence their catchability with various methods, in more extensive lentic environments. ¬© Springer 2006.","10.1007/s10750-005-9509-9","2-s2.0-33645078102",14,0.647142143,0

The model was fitted to: commercial and research samples of proportions at age and length, commercial samples of proportions at age, tag?recapture estimates of numbers at length, a catch per unit effort abundance index, and sea surface temperature data. For each age?length element of the state matrix, the model determines a transition vector that gives a distribution of non-negative growth increments. Mean growth is both length- and age?length-dependent, but also varies between years. Annual mean growth and annual year-class strength were both found to be positively related to sea surface temperature, but during different seasons.

We tested for patterns in abundance (24 reefs) and size (12 reefs) of turbinid gastropods across 4 locations spanning &gt;6¬∞ latitude (‚àº1000 km) in Western Australia, and we tested the effect of density (1 to 5 individuals) and size (38.8 to 747.1 g wet wt) of Turbo torquatus on consumption of macroalgae with different thal-lus structure (Functional Groups 3 to 5). Turbinid gastropods were found at all locations (up to 2.4 ind. m-2); 82.4% of all individuals were T. torquatus. One location (Marmion, Perth) had considerably higher abundances than all other locations. Populations of T. torquatus at the 2 southern locations had a broad range of sizes (9 to 119 mm total shell length [TSL]), although 1 location was dominated by small, and the other, by large, individuals. In contrast, both northern locations were strongly dominated by 1 size class (40 to 60 mm TSL). T. torquatus consumed Ulva lactuca, Hypnea valentiae, Hennedya crispa and juvenile Ecklonia radiata at rates of 150 to 450 mg blotted fresh weight d-1, depending on density of gastropods and species of algae. There was a positive relationship between the rate of consumption and size of T. torquatus when fed U. lactuca and H. valentiae. The present study has produced 3 main insights: (1) densities of turbinids on offshore, wave-exposed, subtidal reefs are similar to those in other coastal habitats; (2) patterns of abundances and sizes are consistent with broad-scale processes, such as ocean climate, fishing pressure and eutrophication; and (3) T. torquatus can consume a variety of macroalgae at rates that suggest it has the potential to exert top-down control of macroalgae, although low densities of gastropods preclude strong effects. ¬© Inter-Research 2008.","10.3354/meps07416","2-s2.0-47949116192",27,0.618478529,0

Cooper Creek, an Australian dryland river, is characterised by extreme flow variability, especially in the magnitude, timing and duration of channel flows and floods, which, if they occur, do so mainly in summer. The present study examined the influence of hydrological variability on fish assemblages and abundance in four waterholes in the Windorah reach of Cooper Creek over eight occasions between 2001 and 2004. Antecedent flows had marked influences on fish species richness and assemblage structure. Following high summer flows, all waterholes supported a rich and abundant fish fauna, whereas fewer species and lower numbers were recorded following periods of zero channel flow. Recruitment of three of the four most common and abundant species was enhanced when intermittent flows inundated backwater and floodplain habitats that provide a food-rich environment. Opportunistic responses to rising channel flows and occasional large floods in Cooper Creek help to explain the prominent 'boom' patterns of fish production in this arid-zone river, whereas low-level recruitment during periods of low or no flow maintains populations of some species through the 'bust'. ¬© CSIRO 2009.","10.1071/MF08118","2-s2.0-60749136080",10,0.612289588,1

The influence of habitat variables on the relative efficiency of each method was also examined. The same seven species of fishes were identified by both methods. Juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta were the only species present in sufficient numbers to allow comparison of abundance estimates using the two methods. A total of 777 brown trout were counted by spotlight and 803 brown trout were caught using electrofishing. Estimates of abundance obtained by spotlighting reflected population estimates obtained by three-pass electrofishing across most habitats. Electrofishing produced higher population estimates relative to spotlighting in fast-flowing turbulent riffle habitats, whereas counts obtained by spotlighting tended to be higher relative to electrofishing in slow-flowing pool habitats. The results suggest that spotlighting is an effective method for assessing fish composition and brown trout abundance in small clear water streams, although the extremes of water velocity may influence efficiency of both spotlighting and electrofishing. ¬© 2006 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1095-8649.2006.01215.x","2-s2.0-33750580089",21,0.574576985,0

At each site, the population parameters, relative abundance, age structure, and individual indices, such as condition factor, organ (gonad, liver, and spleen) to somatic weight ratios, and number and size of follicles per female, were assessed. Physiological (blood), biochemical (hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase [EROD] and plasma steroids), and other indicators (bile chemistry and liver metals) of exposure or response also were measured. No impacts on brown bullhead health were obvious at individual geothermal, municipal sewage, or thermal discharge sites or cumulatively along the river. Brown bullhead from the bleached kraft mill effluent site showed elevated levels of EROD, decreased numbers of red blood cells, increased numbers of white blood cells, and depressed levels of sex steroids. However, growth rates, condition factor, age structure, and gonadosomatic index suggest that discharges with significant heat or nutrients benefit catfish despite physiological impairment at one site. Consideration of brown bullhead population-level responses to discharges in a monitoring framework revealed three different population-level response patterns resulting from the point-source discharges. ¬© 2006 SETAC.","10.1897/05-315R.1","2-s2.0-33750543604",17,0.558974807,0

The lagoon floor community differed from that in the overlying water, it was faunistically more uniform, and it was assembled into statistically distinct seasonal and diel groupings. The lagoon floor community was characterized by reef-associated mysids, gammarids, calanoids, ostracods, harpacticoids, cyclopoids, nematodes, caprellids, and cumaceans. The community was most distinctive in October. The water column community had greater diel than seasonal variability. The nocturnal water column community was characterized by decapod larvae, zoea, larvaceans, fish larvae, gastropod larvae, and nauplii, but was dominated numerically by calanoid copepods (&gt;60%). Catches on the lagoon floor ranged from 750 to 3330 ind. m-3, with peak abundance in October, while water column catches were lower (25 to 2500 ind. m -3), with peak nocturnal abundance in February. Most species in the hyperbenthic community do not migrate into the water column at night, but instead remain concentrated near the lagoon floor. Only the mysid Anisomysis laticauda, the copepod Acartia australis, and the ostracod Cypridina sp. A were consistently captured on the lagoon floor by day and in surface waters at night. The lagoon hyperbenthic community probably contributes to coral reef ecosystems through the remineralization of organic detritus.

A hydroelectric dam was built on the Sinnamary River in French Guiana and closed in January 1994. From December 1991 to December 1996 fish collections were made from the downstream section. The results show a rapid decrease in fish abundance in the middle downstream course immediately after dam closure. This low abundance was observed until the end of the filling phase, when the flow was maintained at a minimum level. Afterwards, abundance returned to a level comparable with that prior to dam closure. Fish collection in different zones showed that the decrease in abundance was probably due to the escape of fish to shelter areas. Another marked effect was the reduction of sample diversity due to a decrease in species richness, as well as in the regularity of the distribution of species' relative abundance. Examination of biological traits of species suggests that under these conditions feeding strategies could have been the most important factor affecting the abundance of populations.","10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199907/08)15:4<339::AID-RRR546>3.0.CO;2-0","2-s2.0-0032733085",30,0.686967694642252,1

Lagoons, secondary channels and river channel was sampled with gillnet of different mesh size and standardized effort. Diversity, evenness indexes and number of species increased with the occurence of floods. The trophic category proportions varied among the periods considered, with a decrease in piscivores participation and an increase of iliophages, herbivores and insectivores (terrestrial) participation in big flood years. The tendencies for piscivores guild were not uniform to every species. The variations on the nutritional condition reveal that the absence of flooding has a negative effect on greater migratory species and positive on sedentary ones.

T. iheringi has been recorded from Mato Grosso (Brazil) to water bodies associated with the R√≠o de la Plata river (Argentina). During an extensive survey in the southern limit of the native area of P. canaliculata the presence of T. iheringi eggs was recorded in several apple snail populations, extending the known distribution of the commensal more than 400 km southwards. The aim of this study was to understand the factors affecting the distribution and abundance of T. iheringi among populations of P. canaliculata. Only 23% of the apple snail populations inhabiting streams harboured temnocephalans while the occurrence among lentic ones was 71%. T. iheringi was found mostly in populations of apple snails living in non-alkaline sites and where snails attaining sizes larger than 4 cm were very common. The prevalence of the temnocephalans in lentic populations was higher than 90%. The number of eggs on the shell (not including the umbilicus) ranged between 0 and 470 and was different among populations of P. canaliculata. The prevalence and number of eggs were lower in the lotic populations, except for a stream population immediately downstream of a lake with commensals. There was no difference between males and females of P. canaliculata neither in the prevalence nor in the number of eggs on the shell. The southernmost population of the world of P. canaliculata harbours commensals that tolerate cold winter water temperatures (4-5¬∞C) as well as its host. On the other hand, T. iheringi was found only in sites with bicarbonate concentrations lower than 6.6 meq l-1, suggesting that the tolerance of the commensal is very much lower than that of the apple snail (up to 9.95 meq l-1). The number of worms inside each snail or the life history variation of P. canaliculata could explain the influence of the size of the snails on the occurrence of T. iheringi. In the big-sized snails, where the number of commensals is higher, the probability of survival of at least one worm is also higher, specially during the hibernation period, when crawling and feeding are null and snails remain buried. On the other hand, P. canaliculata snails from lentic populations are generally bigger and mostly iteroparous, while those inhabiting streams are smaller and semelparous. In these populations the snails have access to mate only with snails of their same cohort, while in iteroparous populations they can copulate with individuals of other cohorts, allowing the inter-generation transmission of worms and the long term persistence of the population of commensals. ¬© Springer 2005.","10.1007/s10750-005-1825-6","2-s2.0-21644434032",3,0.709829377212196,0

In the Orinoco basin, riverine and floodplain habitats, including riparian forests, play key roles in the conservation of biodiversity and support commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries. The basin's three major floodplains regulate the amplitude and duration of floods, maintain fertile agricultural terrain, provide habitat for numerous terrestrial and aquatic species, and support the fishery. The fish fauna, which includes some 1,000 species, encompasses a great deal of ecological diversity in terms of geographic distributions, habitat affinities, functional morphology, and reproductive and feeding strategies. The Orinoco fishery is still multispecific, with around 80 different species found in the fish markets at different times of year. Current estimates indicate that annual sustainable yield is 40,000 - 45,000 metric tons. Fish culture in the region is underdeveloped despite decades of research and promotion. There is no serious commercial trade for ornamental fishes. Large regions of the Orinoco basin are still in a relatively pristine state, but aquatic resources are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction, overharvesting, pollution, and hydrological perturbation. Scientific understanding of diversity hotspots, critical habitats, and conservation status of fishes in the basin is currently insufficient to satisfy management needs. Compliance to fishery regulations is low and fishing is drastically modifying the relative abundance, population structure, and distribution of fish stocks. However, many sectors of the Orinoco basin are unexploited or only lightly exploited, and fish stocks can recover quickly if given the opportunity. Stricter enforcement of current fishery regulations would reduce the likelihood of stock collapses and other, possibly irreversible, changes in the fishery.

The abundance and species richness of Neotropical amphibian communities suggest that losses of this magnitude are likely to have strong effects at the ecosystem level. To improve understanding of the implications of their loss we used stable isotope analysis to examine trophic relationships in an ecosystem in which amphibians are dominant in a second-order forest stream at 750 m asl in Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama. We analysed Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N and C:N ratios of major biotic components (basal resources, invertebrates, amphibians, fish and reptiles) in the stream and of the adjacent riparian food web. Tadpoles (mean Œ¥15N = 4.49‚Ä∞) and adult amphibians (mean Œ¥15N = 5.45‚Ä∞) were intermediate links in the aquatic and terrestrial food web respectively. High Œ¥15N signatures identified fish as top predators in the aquatic food web and snakes and the toad Bufo as top predators in the terrestrial food web. Isotopic signatures clearly distinguished between trophic groups of tadpoles: microbial feeders (Centrolenidae, Œ¥15N range = 0.91-3.05‚Ä∞), herbivores (Rana and Hyla, Œ¥15N range = 4.74-5.15‚Ä∞) and neuston feeders (Colostethus, Œ¥15N range = 5.31-6.40‚Ä∞). Dependence on autotrophic production was indicated by enriched signatures of carbon isotopes in pool dwellers versus those that reside in faster-flowing sections of the stream.

In total, 5,584 remains of prey items from 20 food types were found. Fish composed the bulk of the diet representing 99.9% by mass and 99.7% by number. The main food items were White croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) (73.7% by frequency of occurrence, 48.9% by mass and 41.2% by number), followed by Catfish (Ariidae) and anchovies (Engraulididae). In Lagoa dos Patos estuary the generalist Neotropic cormorant fed mainly on the two most abundant demersal fishes (White croaker and Catfish), which accounted for the low niche breadth calculated. The total length of all fish preyed varied from 27.2 to 318.3 mm (113.5 ¬± 48.0 mm), and preyed White croakers' size differed between months. Neotropic cormorants seem to prey on most abundant class sizes of White croaker instead of selecting similar prey size throughout the time. However, temporary changes in diet in terms of food items, abundance and prey size were detected, revealing a high ecological plasticity of the species. Individual daily food intake of Neotropic cormorants estimated by pellets and metabolic equations corresponded to 23.7 and 27.1% of their body mass, falling in the range of other cormorant species. Annual food consumption of the population estimated by both methods was 73.4 and 81.9 tonnes, comprising mainly immature and subadult White croaker and Catfish which are commercially important. Temporal variations in diet composition and fish size preyed by Neotropics cormorants, a widespread and generalist species, suggest shifts according to fluctuations in the abundance of prey. The plasticity of this cormorant is also revealed by their ability to adjust feeding behaviour in response to temporal or local changes in the environment, from a generalist at the species level to a specialist at the individual or local population level. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00227-007-0824-8","2-s2.0-36849090075",18,0.690362254528709,0

A total of 25 sites were sampled between November 2002 and March 2003 in two seasons (summer/wet versus winter/dry). A thermal gradient separating the upper reaches from the lower reaches was detected. The middle-upper reaches showed higher conductivity and lower dissolved oxygen and pH levels compared with the other reaches. Although some significant associations were found between some fish abundance and environmental variables, the most abundant species (Tilapia rendalli, Geophagus brasiliensis, and Oligosarcus hepsetus) occurred in most sites and under most environmental conditions. Fish community structure varied more in space (longitudinal) than through time (seasonal). The community in the lower reach species was more diverse in comparison with the other reaches. Differences in the fish assemblage structure among the longitudinal river sections appear to have been influenced by the effects of damming, and seem to be partially consistent with the Serial Discontinuity Concept, which views dams as discontinuities within the river continuum. Only the lower river reach showed seasonal differences in the fish community structure, attributable to the influence of flooding. Management plans and biodiversity conservation will benefit by considering the effects of dam disruption and flood increased connectivity to the lotic systems. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10750-008-9551-5","2-s2.0-57649205378",43,0.636442046820137,0

The aim was to assess eventual effects that the industrial complex could have on distribution of two closely related fish species of guppies, Phalloceros caudimaculatus and Poecilia reticulata. The area was divided into three zones: Z1, 40 km upriver of the major urban-industrial complex of Volta Redonda; Z2, just down river of the complex; and Z3, 30 km down river of the complex. Six sites (two in each zone) were sampled monthly between November 1998 and October 1999, using a standardized fishing effort with cast net throws, trays lifts and seine hauls, covering different microhabitats, that is, riffles, pools and the proximity of the river's margins. Poecilia reticulata was widely distributed, peaking at Z2, the most polluted area, while P. caudimaculatus showed the highest abundance at Z3, being almost absent in Z1. Both species occurred in high numbers throughout the year but they were scarce between April and June. Females outnumbered males for both species in most size classes and at all sites. Juveniles were more abundant than adults, with non-pregnant females outnumbering pregnant ones. Condition factor was always higher in males than females but only males P. reticulata showed significant difference among the three zones, with the highest values at Z2. The higher number of females confirms the expectation that these species can use very polluted areas and that availability of food provided by organic loads allowed their distribution all over the area. Although these two species have shown indication of spatial separation in the study area, their similar seasonal patterns of occurrence suggest that they respond in a similar way to changes in environmental conditions.",NA,"2-s2.0-65449145625",35,0.617284616806397,0

Data exhibited the plummeting of waterfowl abundance in this lagoon in 1955, which had no equivalence in other estuarine systems in southern Mexico. The species involved did not exhibit range-wide population reductions either. Most likely, this reduction was caused by man deriving the greatest part of fresh water from the Ayuquila-Armer√≠a watershed for human use, mostly agriculture, causing the loss or deterioration of ecological processes in the lagoon. The role of freshwater supply to Laguna Cuyutl√°n has been neglected by researchers and managers alike, while, conversely, they supported the opening of the lagoon to the sea. The effects of freshwater flow into Laguna Cuyutl√°n, as well as the supposed benefit of artificial connections with the sea, should be examined much more thoroughly, to provide sounder management actions for the conservation or restoration of the lagoon's ecological characteristics.

It aimed to determine the importance of spatial and environmental factors on fish distributions and to assess the use of fish as indicators of the environmental conditions. A longitudinal pattern of chemical water quality was observed, with more disturbed conditions at the urban sites. Several opportunistic or tolerant and omnivorous species such as Astyanax altiparanae, Poecilia reticulata, and Astyanax fasciatus were numerically abundant at these urban sites, which resulted in a consistent increase in species density and biomass along the stream. Redundancy analysis extracted three axes, identifying a nutrient-productivity gradient associated with different species composition patterns, as also detected by the indicator species analysis. No species could be considered a potential indicator of the agricultural area in the dry season, whereas four different species were judged potential indicators of three urban sites. In order to explain species distribution, variation in species abundance was partitioned into spatial and environmental components. The latter was more important, explaining 25.4% of the variation. We concluded that the fish assemblage of the Guamium stream is undergoing the initial stages of disturbance, with pronounced effects at the urbanized area, but no detectable changes at the sugar cane sites. Therefore, fish assemblages might be used as ecological indicators to detect urban impacts in similar rivers. However, the potential use of fish to diagnose stressors in areas of sugar cane plantations should be complementary to more comprehensive studies aimed at understanding the influence of this crop on freshwater resources. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10750-009-0060-y","2-s2.0-76349088056",23,0.521331119959406,0

Besides, they are important predators in these ecosystems. However, studies of factors that determine odonate species richness and distribution in wetlands are scarce in the Neotropical region. The objectives of this study were to: 1) conduct a survey of the diversity of odonate larvae in southern Brazil wetlands, and 2) determine how much variation in odonate richness, abundance and composition is explained by wetland area, altitude, water conductivity and nitrate, hydroperiod, and dominant aquatic vegetation in 140 wetlands in an extensive area of the Neotropical region (‚àº280,000 km2, southern Brazil). A total of 4,039 individuals distributed among five families and 28 genera were collected. Libellulidae, Coenagrionidae and Aeshnidae were the families that showed the greatest richness. Erythrodiplax was observed in more than 70 of the sampled wetlands, and comprised 61 of individuals collected. Richness was negatively associated with wetland area and nitrate concentration. Odonate abundance was negatively associated with water conductivity and nitrate, and it was higher in aquatic beds than in emergent wetlands. Richness and abundance were higher in permanent than in intermittent wetlands. Variation in odonate composition was correlated with wetland altitude, area and water conductivity. Hydroperiod and dominant aquatic vegetation also influenced composition. Our results showed that southern Brazil wetlands are important habitats for 28 odonate genera, and that richness, abundance and composition are influenced mainly by hydroperiod, nitrate, and aquatic vegetation type. These results should be seen as important to determine the environmental factors that shape and maintain odonate diversity in southern Brazil wetlands. ¬© 2010 Kansas Entomological Society.","10.2317/JKES0910.13.1","2-s2.0-77957283700",22,0.488313137270403,0

A species of Neotropical suckermouth armored catfish (family Loricariidae), tentatively identified as the Amazon sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys pardalis Castelnau 1855, is established in Thailand where it is becoming increasingly widespread and abundant. In March 2008, the local and national news reported that thousands of Pterygoplichthys were present in the Nong Yai Canal in eastern Thailand. Their report prompted us to investigate the abundance, diet, and habitat of this invasive species. Field sampling revealed that the average density Pterygoplichthys in the canal was 88 ¬± 93 individuals/100 m2. They were most abundant in the heavily urban downstream region of the canal. Over 70% of the total number of fishes taken in beach seine samples were Pterygoplichthys. The remaining 30% was a mix of native and non-native fish species. Linear regression of the abundance data indicates that native fishes will further decline and may eventually disappear in sites where Pterygoplichthys become established. Pterygoplichthys are known to thrive in disturbed habitats and the corresponding decline of natives in our study area may be the result interactions with the invasive fish or perhaps simply a reflection of their intolerance to a habitat that has become increasingly degraded (hyper-eutrophic). The existing canal has poor water quality as indicated by low dissolved oxygen levels (2.7 ¬± 2.1 mgL-1), and excessive concentrations of total phosphorus (3.8 ¬± 1.9 mgL -1), nitrogen (14 ¬± 2.8 mgL-1) and organic carbon (8.8 ¬± 2.6 mgL-1).

"308","fish_neotropic","Existing and future challenges: The concept of successful fish passage in South America","Most of the large rivers of South America are impounded mainly for hydropower production. The construction of fish passes has been one of the strategies adopted by Brazilian authorities and the energy sector to diminish the effects of these barriers on migratory fish communities. Despite the high investments and efforts involved, most facilities have been considered ineffective for conservation purposes. Decades of poor monitoring and the lack of specific studies have limited our knowledge on the real role of fish passes. Efficiency has been frequently defined as the proportion of fish that ascend a fish passage facility, compared to the shoal size that reaches the dam. Inspired by the notion that fishes accumulated below the dam need to migrate upstream, the quantity of fish passed upstream historically indicated successful management, as generally inferred by the fish abundance inside the fish pass. We propose a new concept for estimating fish pass efficiency for South American rivers, based on the capability of the fish pass to maintain viable populations. This broader approach is necessary because knowledge of fish habitats below and above the pass, plus the feasibility of downstream movements of eggs, larvae and adults through the reservoir and past the dam, is needed for assessing whether a fish pass is working as a conservation tool. ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/rra.1557","2-s2.0-84860716859",54,0.638545026485875,0

Marine-vagrant species were restricted to the sites under the influence of salinity intrusion, whereas estuarine-related and freshwater guilds were found along the entire estuarine-freshwater gradient. Primary- and secondary-freshwater fish guilds had the most widespread spatial distribution and comprised a major fraction of the total abundance and species richness. Abiotic factors correlated with fish abundance and composition along two main environmental axes, one related with variation in salinity, water transparency, and sediment granulometry and the other with the slope gradient. Species richness was significantly higher at the natural channel linking the estuarine- and freshwater-ecosystem, which probably was due to: (a) a steeper slope that favored the confluence of fish from the littoral (<2 m) and limnetic (>2 m) zones and (b) the sporadic inflow of saltwater that carried into this region several marine-related species. Although estuarine-freshwater ecotones are known to support few species, mainly salinity tolerant, our results suggest that habitat features and seasonal fish movement associated with salinity intrusion could lead to more diverse fish assemblages in this transitional zone. ¬© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10750-012-1187-9","2-s2.0-84865441659",2,0.50755477522668,0

We examined variations in the abundance and feeding of A. osteomystax in two environments, one natural (Sinh√° Mariana floodplain lake) and one dammed (Manso Reservoir), during two periods: the first year after the filling phase and three years later. Our goal was to evaluate the occupation of the new habitat (Manso Reservoir), by this species, as well as to test the hypothesis that in the reservoir, unlike the natural environment, there are remarkable changes in diet between the periods. Fish were sampled monthly in the floodplain lake and in the reservoir during two annual periods using gillnets. To evaluate the differences in abundance of A. osteomystax we employed the Kruskal -Wallis test, and the diet analysis was carried out using frequency of occurrence and volumetric methods. Temporal differences in the diet were tested by Kruskal-Wallis test using the scores from a detrended correspondence analysis. A. osteomystax was significantly more abundant in the floodplain lake, where the captures were higher than in the reservoir in almost all months analyzed, and significant variations in abundance between the two periods were not recorded in either the reservoir or the floodplain lake. The diet variation between the two periods, which had a time lag of three years between them, was much less pronounced in the natural environment, where the resource availability is essentially regulated by seasonality. Thus, our hypothesis was accepted; that is, the interannual variations in the diet of A. osteomystax are more relevant in an artificial environment than in a natural one.",NA,"2-s2.0-84866630086",14,0.593132850491681,1

The genus Atlantirivulus includes 11 species distributed along coastal river basins and lagoons of eastern and southern Brazil. Most killifishes are threatened with extinction mostly due to their restricted distribution ranges, small population sizes, and habitat loss. Poor knowledge on ecological- and life history information further increases the threats. Atlantirivulus riograndensis (Costa et Lan√©s, 2009) is a non-annual, small-sized fish endemic in the Laguna dos Patos basin and adjacent coastal areas in southern Brazil. There is no information on the life history and ecology of the species. In this paper, we analyzed population traits of A. riograndensis to support conservation efforts. Materials and methods. The fish were captured with a D-shaped hand net in six sampling surveys carried out between 2008 (June, August, and October) and 2009 (March, August, and October) in the type locality of A. riograndensis. The variation of abundance, body size, and condition factor over time, sex ratio, and length-weight relations were analyzed. Results. The estimated abundance was 1.97 specimens per 1 m 2. The TL means increased along the year, and males were larger than females. Strong differences in proportions of sexes were detected, with high bias for females. The species showed allometric positive growth (b = 3.3), and the general condition factor (CF) was 0.258 ¬± 0.003. Conclusion. Atlantirivulus riograndensis inhabits small water bodies and apparently has a small population size. The population is female biased, and males are typically bigger than females. The species has an allometric positive growth. The body size variation is related to individual growth throughout each study year, and probably affected by high mortality of large individuals in dry season. This study presents new original data on basic traits of the natural history of A. riograndensis. The observed results may be used to assist the development of management strategies and conservation of the species and its habitat, mainly in a region where 90% of wetland systems were lost by agriculture, and the remaining areas are at high risk due to the expansion of exotic pine plantations.","10.3750/AIP2011.42.3.09","2-s2.0-84867607217",16,0.778692839507215,1

Because the study of those changes contributes to a better understanding of trophic interactions in fish populations, the present work describes and evaluates aspects of diet and reproduction of Farlowella vittata in Pringamosal Creek, G√ºejar River drainage, Orinoco River basin, Colombia. Five collecting expeditions were done during both high and low rain seasons of 2008 and 2009. Physical and chemical water parameters were measured, and fish were captured from several points along the total length of the 7km stream, to characterize their biometry and stomach contents. Our results showed that Pringamosal creek is a first order stream, about 3.5m wide and with an average depth of 1m in our study area. Dissolved oxygen values were 6.2mg/L during low water and 2.7mg/L during high water phase. The creek is classified as oligotrophic but with a tendency to eutrophication. A total of 130 fish samples were analyzed. Fishes were assigned to seven size range categories between 86.0 and 175.5mm standard length (SL). Stomach contents revealed that the diet of this species consisted mainly of algae (Bacillariophyceae) (84.6% Abundance Relative), but we observed a variation in the diet according to season; during low rainfall it feeds on phytoplankton (86.47% A.R.) and during high rainfall on zooplankton as well as plant material and organic material (0.685% A.R. and 18.83% A.R., respectively). A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA showed statistically significant differences in food items between sexes. The condition factor (K) indicated that the species was well fed. Size at sexual maturity was 154mm SL for males and 124mm SL for females.

At La Selva Biological Station in the Sarapiqu√≠ region of Costa Rica, shrimp population data were collected between 1988 and 1989, before massive land-use change occurred downstream that could potentially affect shrimp recruitment upstream. Using generalized linear models and a Bayesian inference framework, the relative abundance of Macrobrachium olfersi between recent (2008-2011) and historical time periods (1988-1989) was compared in three stream reaches. Shrimp relative abundance in two stream reaches within the protected area of La Selva was relatively constant yearly and between recent post-disturbance (2008-2011) and historical pre-disturbance (1988-89) time periods. In contrast, a stream reach bordered by pasture accessible to fishermen, showed an 87% decrease in relative abundance between recent and historical time periods suggesting site-level disturbance, possibly from fishing. The lack of change between historical and contemporary sampling periods within interior-forest stream reaches suggests that shrimp populations in protected forested reaches are resistant or resilient to certain land-use changes occurring downstream. ¬© 2012 Cambridge University Press.","10.1017/S0266467412000739","2-s2.0-84873929670",6,0.64761510881297,0

The objective of this study was to characterise the impact of freshwater fish farms on the feeding of five species of Neotropical freshwater fish. Specimens of Astyanax altiparanae, Galeocharax knerii, Iheringicthys labrosus, Pimelodus maculatus and Plagioscion squamosissimus were sampled in areas around two systems of cage fish farming (CF), and two control areas (CT) that were not influenced by this activity. Results show that there were significant changes in the diet of trophic generalist species (A. altiparanae, P. maculatus and I. labrosus) accompanied by a related increase in the condition factor values of these species in cage areas. Trophic specialist species, such as the carnivorous fish species G. knerii and P. squamosissimus, presented small differences between the CF and CT areas with regard to diet and showed no differences in other analyses performed. In conclusion, cage fish farms can affect the natural diet of trophic generalist fish species, directly affecting the nutritional status (condition factor), where food wastes was found to be one of the principal items consumed by this trophic guild. Results indicate that these species are responsible for recycling a great quantity of organic matter transferred by this type of activity, which, along with local fishery activities, contribute to mitigation of associated processes of eutrophication. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.013","2-s2.0-84882523090",9,0.495167246569846,0

However, the empirical validity of this model depends on whether the data do not violate certain assumptions. Here, we test the predictions of MTE evaluating all of its assumptions simultaneously. We used Neotropical freshwater fish and tested whether the logarithm of species richness varied negatively and linearly with temperature, resulting in the slope value specified by the MTE. As we observed that the assumption of the energetic equivalence of populations was not achieved, we also analyzed whether the energetic nonequivalence of populations could be responsible for the possible lack of fit to the MTE predictions. Our results showed that the relationship between richness and the inverse of temperature was linear, negative and significant and included the slope value predicted by the MTE. With respect to the assumptions, we observed that there was no spatial variation in the average energy flux of populations or in the body size and abundance of species. However, the energetic equivalence of populations was not achieved and the violation of this assumption did not affect the predictive power of the model. We conclude that the validity of the assumptions (spatial invariance in the average flux energy of populations and spatial invariance in the body size and abundance, especially) is required for the correct interpretation of richness patterns. Furthermore, we conclude that MTE is robust in its explanation of diversity gradients for freshwater fish, proving to be a valuable tool in describing ecological complexity from individuals to ecosystems. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/13-0483.1","2-s2.0-84897985274",13,0.397106297575718,0

The abundance or richness of most guilds and species did not differ by deer density.

Great crested flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) had 3 times greater odds of being found in low-deer-density areas than in high-deer-density areas. Chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens), and red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus) all had 2 times greater odds of being found in low-deer-density areas than high-deer-density areas.

We evaluated the composition, structure and assemblage descriptors (Shannon-Wiener diversity index and equitability, respectively) and catch per unit effort by the number (CPUEn) and biomass (CPUEb) of the ichthyofauna. The 6,047 individuals (399,211.6 g) captured represented three orders, ten families and 20 species, of which four belonged to introduced species. The family Characidae was the most abundant with a total of 2,772 (45.8%) individuals captured. The species-abundance curve fit the log-normal model. In the spatial analysis of diversity, there were significant differences between sampling sites in the lacustrine and fluvial regions, and the highest values were found in the lacustrine region. In the temporal analysis of diversity, significant differences were also observed between the rainy and dry seasons, and the higher values were found during the dry season. Equitability followed the same spatiotemporal pattern as diversity. The Spearman correlation was significantly negative between diversity and rainfall. A cluster analysis spatially separated the ichthyofauna into two groups: one group formed by sampling sites in the fluvial region and another group formed by the remainder of the points in the lacustrine region. Both the CPUEn and CPUEb values were higher at point 8 (fluvial region) and during the rainy season. A two-way ANOVA showed that the CPUEn and CPUEb values were spatially and temporally significant. We conclude that the spatial and temporal trends of diversity in the Santa Cruz reservoir differ from those of other Brazilian reservoirs but that the fish community composition and spatiotemporal patterns of abundance were similar.","10.1590/1519-6984.14712","2-s2.0-84907373641",7,0.571525289634504,1

The high number of species and lack of basic ecological knowledge provide a major obstacle to understanding the effects of environmental change. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the fish communities of a neotropical river by applying simple descriptions of community organizations: species abundance distribution and abundance biomass comparison curves. Fish data were collected using gillnets during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. A total of 69 343 individuals representing 260 species were recorded. Dam closure was associated with changes in the organization of fish communities at all sites. Species richness tended to increase immediately after dam closure while evenness decreased. Changes in taxonomic structure (richness and evenness) were accompanied by a change in the distribution of biomass with the proportionate contribution by smaller individuals significantly increased relative to larger individuals. Five years on, richness had fallen to below pre-closure levels at all sites, while the comparative stability of assemblages in the transformed habitats was reflected by biomass-abundance distribution patterns that approximated pre-disturbance ratios. This simplistic analysis provided a sensitive and informative assessment of ecological conditions, which highlights the impact to ecosystem process and ecological networks and has particular value in regions where a lack of detailed ecological knowledge precludes the application of traditional bioassessment methods.

To contribute with knowledge on the effects of damming on fish fauna, we assessed the response of fish assemblages to the construction of a run-of-the-river dam in an Amazonian river by selecting eight sampling sites along a longitudinal gradient in the vicinity of a new hydroelectric dam. Sites were sampled monthly through a 1-year period before dam closure (2004‚Äì2005), 1¬†year after closure (2006‚Äì2007), and 5¬†years after closure (2011‚Äì2012). Following dam closure, there was an initial overall increase in fish abundance and richness across sites. However, despite the initial upsurge, after 5¬†years, populations were reduced and communities contracted to a level of diversity below that observed prior to dam closure. Respective sites demonstrated distinct ecological responses that were related to the environmental characteristics of their transformed habitats. Important changes in fish assemblages were visible in a short-term period of 5¬†years after dam closure. Therefore, monitoring fish species assemblages in a longer term is important to assess the consequences of a decrease in diversity. ¬© 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","10.1007/s10750-015-2377-z","2-s2.0-84948576152",31,0.677633147421399,1

All along the stream gradient, the fish assemblage was composed of small-sized, short living species including benthic and water column species. Only four species occurred at the uppermost site (i.e., S1) whereas these four species plus eight species occurred at all other sites. In regards to species presence-absence, all species were temporally persistent at all sites over the study years. Overall, all species were abundant across scales of space and time with only three out of 14 species showing consistently low densities along the stream across years. Nevertheless, as indicated by the temporal variations in the Coefficients of Variation (CV%), the fish assemblages were highly unstable at all sites over time. At all sites the CV% varied widely and increased significantly over the years. No consistent density-dependence was elucidated nor any significant correlation among environmental variables and assemblage attributes were detected. The only consistent relationship elucidated relates the CV% of assemblage variability over time and the CV% of the ratio between stream discharge in the two major seasons, May and November. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","10.1007/s10641-015-0450-0","2-s2.0-84949624933",11,0.662304673639544,1

Anuran larvae are important prey in freshwater communities and spatiotemporal variation in risk can arise from changes in the number and identity of predators; however, our understanding of variation in abundance, identity, and foraging rates for natural predator assemblages in tropical pond communities is limited. We surveyed ponds near Gamboa, Panama in 2004 and 2010 to estimate variation in predator communities of tadpoles over space and time.We also conducted short-term predation trials with the 10 most common predators using hatchling tadpoles of two widespread Neotropical frog species, Red-Eyed Treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas) and Pantless Treefrogs (Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Predator abundance varied nearly threefold across ponds within a single year and as much as 19-fold within a pond across years. Dominant taxa also varied, with backswimmers (Notonectidae), poeciliid fish, or libellulid dragonfly naiads being the most common depending upon pond and year. Predation trials revealed that prey-specific predation rates differed among predator taxa. Some presumed predators did not consume hatchlings, whereas others consumed >90% of prey. The smaller D. ebraccatus hatchlings generally experienced higher predation rates; however, large invertebrate predators like aeshnid dragonfly naiads, giant water bugs, and fishing spiders consumed more A. callidryas. These results suggest that strong but variable larval-stage risk may be an important selective factor shaping tadpole communities and phenotypes in Neotropical ponds. ¬© 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.","10.1670/14-111","2-s2.0-84959866101",15,0.540339601953569,1

The study focused on three aquatic systems (river upstream, transition area, and reservoir) and different drowned habitats (dense/light forests and agricultural soils) associated or not with the presence of villages. The reservoir fish population was expected to follow three distinct phases, which should be respectively a rapid increase in biomass and abundance (trophic upsurge) followed by a decline and a stabilization of the population. This succession appeared to be different to the commonly observed scenario in terms of biomass, abundance and taxonomic richness compared to other temperate and tropical reservoirs. The indicator species (H. macrolepidota and P. carinatus) did not show changes in their size range since impoundment. The presence of structured habitats (e.g. inundated forest) favoured the fish population in terms of biomass and abundance. The fish population in the transition area and the river upstream improved quickly after the impoundment and presented higher taxonomic richness compared to the reservoir. Finally, the transition area appeared to be the most productive area within the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir especially if it remained outside of fishing activities. ¬© EDF, 2015.","10.1051/hydro/2015004","2-s2.0-84962459593",29,0.739258205346137,1

Data on the structure of the small fish fauna assemblage were obtained before and after the introduction of this carnivorous species. Samplings were carried out in February and September of 2004, previously to the register of Cichla kelberi in the reservoir, and after its introduction, November of 2004, January, March, May and August of 2005, February and June of 2006, February and July of 2007, February and October of 2008 and February of 2009. A total of 4,693 fish, belonging to 43 different species was sampled between 2004 and 2009. The order Characiformes was the most abundant, followed by Perciformes and Siluriformes. Comparative analyses, before and after the introduction, could not demonstrate significant changes in composition, richness, abundance, biomass, mean length and diversity of fish. Aquatic insects were the main feeding item of C. kelberi, followed by tetragonopterinae fish. Cannibalism was recorded during the whole study period. The results showed that Cichla cannot deeply affect the ichthyofauna assemblages of a large Neotropical reservoir, at least in a short or medium term period after its introduction. The results also allowed concluding that the introduction of C. kelberi in the reservoir is in the phase 3. In this phase, the specie can survive and reproduce in the new environment; however it is not totally established and disseminated. The reasons for the fact that Cichla is still not dominant in Rosana Reservoir could be related to feeding competition, high rate of cannibalism and the presence of large amount of aquatic macrophytes (refuge zones). In spite of the results, the continuous monitoring of the role of non-native species on the local fish fauna is absolutely necessary because the impacts caused by colonization of this undesirable species can be magnified by complex processes, usually correlated with other environmental disturb, especially the negative effects of damming.","10.1590/1519-6984.05814","2-s2.0-84982833711",44,0.596728913425858,1

Two common annual species (Austrolebias minuano and Cynopoecilus fulgens) exhibited clear seasonal dynamics, with the appearance of young fishes in the austral autumn (May to June) and a decline in abundance over the seasonal cycle. The third annual species, Austrolebias wolterstorffii, was rare. No seasonal dynamics were observed in non-annual fishes. The relative abundance of non-annual fishes compared with annual fishes increased over the seasonal cycle, but they coexisted widely. The size structure of annual fishes suggested the presence of a single age cohort in most pools though a second age cohort was registered in one pool in August, coinciding with a large flooding. Strong sexual dimorphism in body size was found in C. fulgens throughout the seasonal cycle, while no sexual dimorphism in body size was found in A. minuano. Female-biased sex ratios were recorded in both common annual fish species in the last three sampling dates (in spring), but not during the first two sampling dates (in winter). The natural lifespan of annual fishes was <8 months. Annual fishes disappeared before habitat desiccation in half of the pools, while non-annual fishes were still present. ¬© 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles","10.1111/jfb.13122","2-s2.0-84987800304",8,0.739402652147564,0

The food habit of L. Dominicanus was analyzed in the State of Paran√°, Brazil. The food items of the pellets were identified in order to demonstrate the importance of demersal fish in the diet of this species. The pellets were sampled between August 2011 and July 2012 on the seaside of Barrancos. Based on the identification of the otoliths found in the pellets, length and mass of fishes were recalculated. In the 120 pellets collected, 228 fishes from 14 species and 3 families were identified, with emphasis on the Sciaenidae family with 11 species. Cathorops spixii, Larimus breviceps, Paralonchurus brasiliensis, and Stellifer rastrifer were most frequent. In the seasonal analyses, L. breviceps, Micropogonias furnieri, P. brasiliensis, and S. rastrifer were found in the diet of L. Dominicanus in all seasons. The canonical analysis showed significant seasonal differences in abundance, mass, and length of the teleosts identified in the diet of L. Dominicanus.

The potential of native Neotropical piscivores to provide biotic resistance to alien fish invaders and its interaction with water turbidity was investigated through mesocosm experiments. Three invasive and two native fish species were offered as prey to three native piscivores of the Paran√° river in 1000 L tanks. After 48¬†h, prey survival was compared among trials with and without the piscivores and in turbid (~ more preserved systems) versus clear water (~ disturbed systems by damming) treatments. Prey survival, particularly of the invasive species, was significantly lower in turbid water in the presence of predators (~ 45.9% versus ~ 53.7% in clear water). Piscivores preyed more on smaller individuals in clear water and on larger preys in turbid water. Although vulnerability to predation was prey-specific, our results support the potential of native piscivores to provide biotic resistance against alien freshwater species. Water turbidity mediated the predator‚Äìprey interactions and our results confirm the hypothesis that decreased turbidity caused by dams‚Äô construction can affect predation efficiency of native piscivores and increase the abundance of alien fish. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","10.1007/s10750-018-3548-5","2-s2.0-85047209599",17,0.496983021292914,0

Here, we examine size structures of the caddisfly, Phylloicus hansoni, in Trinidadian streams with two distinct fish assemblages: upstream reaches where the predatory killifish, Anablepsoides hartii, is the only fish species (Killifish-Only reaches), and downstream reaches where killifish and the omnivorous guppy, Poecilia reticulata, coexist (Killifish‚ÄìGuppy reaches). We asked: Do P. hansoni larvae exhibit differences in size structure between reaches with differing fish assemblages? We found that size distributions of larvae differed between reaches in the majority of replicate streams, with smaller median body lengths in Killifish-Only reaches. Killifish‚ÄìGuppy reaches had higher proportions of the largest instar, but we did not find differences in body length within an instar. No evidence of size-selective predation was found through analysis of killifish stomach contents, and environmental variables were largely similar between upstream and downstream reaches of the five study streams, aside from higher killifish abundances in upstream reaches. Our results, coupled with previous evidence of guppies altering killifish populations, suggest that the mediating effects of a third-party species (guppies) on predator‚Äìprey (killifish‚Äìcaddisfly) interactions can affect the population size structure of prey populations. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","10.1007/s10750-018-3674-0","2-s2.0-85047980822",12,0.559889720502622,0
"673","fish_neotropic","Comparing species richness, functional diversity and functional composition of waterbird communities along environmental gradients in the neotropics","Waterbirds have a major functional role in wetlands, and understanding how functional traits of waterbirds depend on environmental characteristics can facilitate management of ecosystems and their services. We investigate how the waterbird community in a Neotropical river-floodplain system responds to environmental gradients, identifying how they affect waterbird species richness, functional diversity (measured as functional dispersion) and functional composition (specific functional traits). We sampled 22 lakes in the Upper Paran√° floodplain system in southern Brazil, and modelled avian functional diversity and species richness as a function of environmental variables. Then we used a unified RLQ and fourthcorner analysis to evaluate environment-trait relationships. Waterbird species richness and functional diversity varied according to different environmental variables. Lake area and diversity of aquatic vegetation were associated with avian species richness, while relative abundance of grass and emergent macrophytes and mean and variation of depth were related to functional diversity. Furthermore, changes in functional diversity seemed to be mainly driven by presence of species that depend on perches for foraging (e.g. kingfishers, cormorants, and kites), whose presence was mainly associated with deep water and emergent macrophytes. Nevertheless, changes in functional diversity and functional composition did not depend on exactly the same set of environmental variables, suggesting that trait combinations (e.g. below surface feeders who feed on fish), not only specific traits, are important drivers of the variation in functional diversity between lakes. Given the observed differences in responses of species richness and functional diversity, both these diversity metrics should be used as complementary tools in ecosystem management. Furthermore, our results show that functional diversity and composition are partially coupled, suggesting that although functional diversity is influenced by the environmental filtering of particular traits, it also reflects other ecological mechanisms (e.g. competitive interactions among species). ¬© 2018 Arruda Almeida et al.

The annual copepod population size on all salmonids caught was estimated by combining the calculated number of copepods carrying on each salmonid species. The copepod population fluctuated markedly from year to year, which resulted largely from marked annual changes in abundance of pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). Since pink salmon were most frequently and heavily infected and since their abundance changed every year, the copepod population was high in the years when this salmonid species was abundant, but low when it was rare. On the contrary, chum salmon (O. keta) did not show high prevalence and intensity of infection, but the annual abundance of this host species was consistently high, i.e. chum salmon carried many copepods every year. Copepods on other salmonid species (sockeye salmon O. nerka, coho salmon O. kisutch, chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, and steelhead trout O. mykiss) constantly formed a small percentage of the total copepod population. Both chum and pink salmon are the most important hosts in terms of their substantial contribution to support the copepod population, but the importance as hosts of each species is definitely different between the species. Chum salmon is a stable important host supporting the copepod population at a relatively high level every year, while the number of copepods on pink salmon annually exhibits marked fluctuations, and this salmonid species is regarded as an unstable important host.","10.1023/A:1013154403992","2-s2.0-0035877887",8,0.68693188028115,1

In 1978, the 1-m diameter ring net used by the program was replaced with a bongo net, which consists of two 0.71-m diameter nets on a single frame. This study compares paired zooplankton samples taken with a ring net and a 0.71-m or 0.6-m bongo net to determine the relative performances of the two net types for catching calanoid copepods. Thirty-one species and stages were enumerated, along with the category 'total female calanoids'. Twenty-one categories of calanoid copepods were abundant enough to test for effects of changes in net type. No significant differences between the nets were found after correcting for multiple testing. Statistical power was then estimated for a range of potential net effects equivalent to ratios of copepod densities between the nets of 1.1-3.0. The probability of detecting differences greater than a factor of 1.5-3.0 was high (‚â•80%) for total female calanoids, Metridia pacifica, Pleuromamma abdominalis edentata, P. borealis, Calanus pacificus, Eucalanus californicus and Rhincalanus nasutus. For these categories of copepods, any population changes greater than a factor of 1.5-3.0 that might be found from the CalCOFI data set can be assumed to be the result of factors other than the change in net type. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We used fishing day as the unit of effort, standardized through the principal components analysis. The first three components in the model were significant. The catch-per-unit-effort monthly average as an index of abundance was estimated for one-degree area quadrants for the total fleet operation area and classified into five levels of abundance for graphic presentation. The variation of seasonal relative abundance was meaningful, with its maximum during the second quarter. Variation of annual relative abundance was also significant with a minimum during 1984 and a maximum in 1986. This led us to believe the El Ni√±o (1986-1987) had no relevant effect on the abundance of the resource. The lowest relative abundance (12 t per fishing day) coincided with the greatest percentage of unsuccessful fishing, and it was found in northwest Mexico.

"80","fish_oceanic","An assessment of Greenland walrus populations","Recent abundance estimates were combined with historical catches and an age- and sex-structured population dynamic model to perform Bayesian assessments of the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) populations in West Greenland, the North Water in northern Baffin Bay, and East Greenland. The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

"822","fish_oceanic","Power of monitoring programmes to detect decline and recovery of rare and vulnerable fish","1. Abundance trends provide key guidance when setting conservation priorities, whether indicating population decline, stability or recovery. Knowledge of the power of surveys to detect trends is essential, as the consequences of not detecting a real trend can be profound. 2. Unfortunately, some surveys have been established with no assessment of power, and others are used to study species that were not their original focus. The latter is common in the marine environment, where rare fish are monitored using catch data from surveys that target more abundant commercially fished species. 3. We calculated the power of a large-scale annual monitoring survey (the English North Sea bottom trawl survey) to detect decline and recovery of species that are vulnerable to fishing. As fisheries exploitation invariably precedes scientific investigation, the survey began after many vulnerable species had already been depleted. 4. The power of the survey to detect declines in the abundance of vulnerable species on time scales of < 10 years was low and the survey often failed to detect declines that would lead to listings under the IUCN A1 Red List criteria. Thus conservation prioritization based solely on survey data may fail to identify species at risk of regional extinction. 5. If conservation measures were effective, and vulnerable populations recovered at the maximum potential rate, 5-10 years of monitoring would often be required to detect recovery. 6. Power to detect trends in abundance was increased by developing a composite indicator that reflected trends in abundance of several vulnerable species. This indicator provided an overview of their conservation status. 7. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the precautionary principle, conservation prioritization and management action should not depend on the statistical significance of recent abundance trends when low power is a consequence of historical depletion. If the conservation prioritization and management of rare and/or vulnerable species have to be predicated on evidence of significant declines, then higher type 1 error rates (falsely detecting a decline) should be acceptable. This is because the costs of type 1 errors are lower than those of type 2 (failure to detect a real decline). ¬© 2005 British Ecological Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01000.x","2-s2.0-14844300885",263,0.793212815704934,1
"981","fish_oceanic","Linkages between coastal and open-ocean habitats and dynamics of Japanese stocks of chum salmon and Japanese sardine","Coastal-ocean-open-ocean migrations, prey-predator relations and long-term population dynamics of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) and Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus), associated with large-scale climate and oceanographic conditions, are reviewed. After early marine life in coastal waters in northern Japan, chum salmon of Japanese origin spend their first summer in the Okhotsk Sea, then move to the Western Subarctic Gyre for the first winter at sea. Thereafter, they migrate between summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea and wintering grounds in the Alaskan Gyre for a period of usually up to four years, and finally return to their natal rivers to spawn. Carrying capacity (K) for chum salmon at an unfished equilibrium level was estimated from a Ricker spawner-recruitment curve, and the residual carrying capacity (RCC=(K-abundance)K-1). was positively correlated with body size at age 4, and negatively correlated with age at maturity. Marine survival of Hokkaido chum populations was affected by body size at release, but neither by Aleutian low pressure activity nor sea-surface temperature (SST) around coastal Hokkaido in spring, although there is some correlation between survival rate and coastal SST. Juveniles of the Pacific stock of Japanese sardine become broadly distributed in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) as far east as 180¬∞ longitude during spring. Adults disperse as far as the central Pacific and the southern areas of the Okhotsk Sea and Western Subarctic Gyre in years of high abundance. Somatic growth and age at maturation of sardine are density-dependent. We used catch, biomass and residuals of observed recruitment numbers from a Ricker curve (LNRR) as a measure of sardine population dynamics. LNRR was highly correlated with SST of KE in winter, which shifted in 1970 and 1988. Recent biomass and catch remain at extremely low levels due to a combination of adverse environmental conditions and intensive fishing. We suggest that Japanese populations of chum salmon and Japanese sardine have a broader geographic range than North American populations, perhaps because of differences between western and eastern boundary current systems, and associated larval drift (sardine) or avoidance of intra-species competition (chum salmon). ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"1032","fish_oceanic","The biology and fishery of shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) in Atlantic Canadian waters","Shortfin mako sharks are a high-value bycatch of pelagic longline fisheries off the eastern coast of Canada. Tagging studies indicate that they are highly migratory, seasonal residents of Canadian waters, representing the northern extension of a North Atlantic-wide population centred at more southerly latitudes. Annual catches in Canadian waters average 60-80 mt per year, which represents but a small part of that estimated for the population as a whole. New ageing results indicate that the species grows more slowly than was reported previously, thus making the population less productive and more susceptible to overexploitation than has been reported. Two indices of population abundance did not provide a definitive view of mako shark population status. A standardized catch rate index from the commercial large pelagic fishery suggested stable abundance since 1988. However, the analysis did not have the statistical power to detect anything less than a severe decline. In contrast, the median size of mako sharks in the commercial catch has declined since 1998, suggesting a loss of larger sharks. These results are broadly consistent with a previous report of population decline, although it appears unlikely that current exploitation rates in Canada are having an appreciable impact on the population.

This species was rare in the seventies and is now a dominant one. This is a small bathy-demersal, probably short-lived species with few predators (probably because of the presence of strong spines) and not exploited by fisheries. In the same time, a significant temperature increase in the bottom waters is observed during the breeding season of this population. The boarfish abundance increase is related to the warming, its ability to invade and the absence of predators as well as the absence of fishing. ¬© 2005 Acad√©mie des sciences.

"1062","fish_oceanic","Measuring marine fish biodiversity: Temporal changes in abundance, life history and demography","Patterns in marine fish biodiversity can be assessed by quantifying temporal variation in rate of population change, abundance, life history and demography concomitant with long-term reductions in abundance. Based on data for 177 populations (62 species) from four north-temperate oceanic regions (Northeast Atlantic and Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, North mid-Atlantic), 81% of the populations in decline prior to 1992 experienced reductions in their rate of loss thereafter; species whose rate of population decline accelerated after 1992 were predominantly top predators such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), sole (Solea solea) and pelagic sharks. Combining population data across regions and species, marine fish have declined 35% since 1978 and are currently less than 70% of recorded maxima; demersal species are generally at historic lows, pelagic species are generally stable or increasing in abundance. Declines by demersal species have been associated with substantive increases in pelagic species, a pattern consistent with the hypothesis that increases in the latter may be attributable to reduced predation mortality. There is a need to determine the consequences to population growth effected by the reductions in age (21%) and size (13%) at maturity and in mean age (5%) and size (18%) of spawners, concomitant with population decline. We conclude that reductions in the rate of population decline, in the absence of targets for population increase, will be insufficient to effect a recovery of marine fish biodiversity, and that great care must be exercised when interpreting multi-species patterns in abundance. Of fundamental importance is the need to explain the geographical, species-specific and habitat biases that pervade patterns of marine fish recovery and biodiversity. ¬© 2005 The Royal Society.","10.1098/rstb.2004.1586","2-s2.0-18344378069",50,0.835125841956233,1

During the first 23 months (July, 1999-May, 2001) the Island had a robust population with a tri-modal size frequency distribution curve, very high densities (85.7-95.1 ind./100 m 2 at the sandy habitat), high abundance (3362-3110 individuals) and biomass (46.7-34.3 kg/100 m2). Also, during this period most individuals were at depths between 4 and 6 m and no individuals were recorded deeper than 15 m. The population declined after harvesting began (June, 2001) and by March, 2002 the size frequency distribution showed a bimodal pattern with an obvious decrease in abundance of large individuals. There was also a slight reduction in densities (73.2-60.1 ind./100 m2 at the sandy habitat), abundance (2292-1682 individuals) and biomass (21.6-11.3 kg/100 m2), and a marked shift towards deeper waters. Overfishing reached its maximum during the final 19 months of the study, and by October, 2003, density (30.7-0.4 ind./100 m2 at the sandy habitat), abundance (802-10 individuals) and biomass (6.9-0.1 kg/100 m2) were all greatly reduced. The size frequency distribution of the population became unimodal, large animals disappeared and no recruits were seen. During this period, individuals were found at very deep depths (30 to &gt;40 m). The study also showed that sandy substrate was the preferred habitat for H. scabra, accommodating the largest number of individuals. The population of H. scabra at Abu Rhamada Island was found to spawn biannually from 1999 to 2001, then only once during 2002 when high fishing pressure occurred, and ceased completely in 2003. The sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1 before fishing begun, but shifted to an increasing male bias reaching 93% males by January 2003. None of the small animals remaining after January, 2003 could be sexed. Size at sexual maturity decreased from prefishing (185 mm for females and 160 mm for males) to 155 mm for females and 125 mm for males in January 2003. There was a positive relationship between fecundity and size. And oocyte/female was highest in 1999 (0.73-1.7 million) and 2000 (0.75-1.72 million), decreased during 2001 (0.2-0.85 million) to reach its minimum at 2002 (0.28-0.29 million). ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abundance and trends of these dolphin stocks were assessed from 12 large-scale pelagic surveys carried out between 1979 and 2000. Estimates of abundance were based on a multivariate line-transect analysis, using covariates to model the detection process and group size. Current estimates of abundance are about 640 000 northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (CV = 0.17) and 450 000 eastern spinner dolphins (CV = 0.23). For the whole period from 1979 to 2000, annual estimates of abundance ranged from 494 000 to 954 000 for northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and from 271 000 to 734 000 for eastern spinner dolphins. Management actions by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock is showing clear signs of recovery. Possible reasons include underreporting of dolphin bycatch, effects of chase and encirclement on dolphin survival and reproduction, long-term changes in the ecosystem, and effects of other species on spotted and spinner dolphin population dynamics. ¬© Inter-Research 2005.","10.3354/meps291001","2-s2.0-19944421769",30,0.809441998946307,1

The catch composition and CPUE values expressed in weight and number showed that the most abundant species were Carcharhinus perezi and C. falciformis for Los Roques Archipelago and La Blanquilla Island, while C perezi and Ginglymostoma cirratum were more common in Las Aves Archipelago. In Los Roques Archipelago, C perezi and C falciformis were most common during the second half of the year; a similar trend was observed for the rest of the shark species caught by the fishery. A positive relationship was observed between CPUE and fishing depth in the case of C. perezi and C falciformis off Los Roques Archipelago: CPUE by weight increases with depth, while CPUE by number decreases with depth. The main factors that could be determining shark abundance and their spatial-temporal distribution are the characteristics of the ecosystem, depth, and biological characteristics such as birth, mating season and migratory patterns of the species.","10.7773/cm.v31i2.62","2-s2.0-23044491433",23,0.735361317242637,1
"1281","fish_oceanic","Evidence of recent recruitment in the ocean quahog Arctica islandica in the Mid-Atlantic bight","We report results of a survey explicitly focused on ocean quahog recruitment in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The recruitment survey resampled all NMFS survey sites south of Hudson Canyon and a selection of sites north and east of Hudson Canyon off the Long Island coast over the entire depth range of this species with the exception of the most inshore reaches off Long Island. More ocean quahogs were encountered, on a per tow basis, in the vicinity of and north of Hudson Canyon. The proportion of recruits in the size-frequency distribution was higher in the south and the most recent recruitment events were concentrated there. Analysis of the 104 size-frequency distributions delineated regions of recent recruitment, areas that have not seen significant recruitment for many decades and areas that received heavy recruitment some decades previously but not recently. Overall, the survey suggests that three regionally distinctive processes determine the size-frequency distributions of ocean quahog assemblages and recruitment therein. The area northeast of Hudson Canyon is unique in the regionally extensive uniformity of size-frequency distributions among sampled assemblages, the near absence of recent recruitment and the presence of large numbers of older recruits, 65-80 mm in size. The inshore (by ocean quahog standards) area off New Jersey is unique in the dominant presence of the largest size classes of ocean quahogs and the remarkable absence of significant recruitment over an extraordinary time span. The area south of 39¬∞N is unique in the widespread presence of relatively young recruits, including some animals with ages within the time span of the present fishery. Recruitment events in ocean quahog populations, although rare in the sense of occurring only once in a score or two of years, are frequent in the context of the +200-year life span of this species, yet also rare in the context of stock survey timing and fishery dynamics. This study strongly supports the assumption that long-lived species recruit successfully only rarely when at carrying capacity. This study also suggests that the history of recruitment over the last perhaps two-score years, revealed by this survey, may be a poor measure of the recruitment dynamics to be anticipated over the next two-score years when the population abundance is reduced to what is anticipated to approximate the biomass at maximum sustainable yield. Given the long time span required for ocean quahogs to grow to fishable size, a substantive disequilibrium may exist between the recruitment anticipated from the relationship of adult biomass to carrying capacity and the contemporaneous number of recruits for minimally 20 y after adult abundance is reduced from circa-1980 carrying capacity to biomass, maximum sustainable yield.","10.2983/0730-8000(2005)24[517:EORRIT]2.0.CO;2","2-s2.0-23944506991",377,0.807886668820223,0

This species was previously only caught as bycatch in the Loligo gahi and finfish trawl fishery. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the Falkland Islands population of Dissostichus eleginoides using an age-structured production model (ASPM). Two models were investigated; one using a Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship and another using trawler CPUE based estimates of toothfish abundance to estimate yearly recruitment. A stock recruitment relationship was not included within the model that used abundance estimates, as recruitment to the population was estimated directly from the index of relative recruit abundance calculated from trawler CPUE. The model was fitted to longline standardised CPUE and to the catch-at-length data. The models produced estimates that provided similar declines in the toothfish population although the start and end biomass estimates varied slightly. The models provided estimates of between 13,000 and 26,000 tonnes of current spawning stock biomass and showed current biomass to be between 38 and 46% of virgin biomass. The fit to CPUE was poor between 1994 and 1996, which we hypothesised could have been due to unreported catches or changes in q or M. This was a time when there was considerable IUU fishing in the southwest Atlantic. When the model was allowed to estimate a level of extra catch the fit was improved and 5000 tonnes of extra catch was estimated. Two further models were briefly examined to investigate the possibility of changes in M and q but both required large changes in those parameters in order to fit. Estimates of MSY varied widely, from 912 to almost 3000 tonnes. ¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","10.1016/j.fishres.2005.07.010","2-s2.0-26844495292",78,0.79805241933345,1

A substantial population of the species was studied in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). The population density and the spatial distribution of P. jacobaeus were estimated in the lake with line transect sampling by SCUBA diving, a method not previously used for scallop density estimations. Individuals of the first size class (small) were mainly restricted to shallow waters (4-8 m), while individuals of the second size class (large) were mainly restricted to deeper waters (>12 m). Possible reasons for this size-separation were: (1) the most appropriate settlement substrate for pediveligers was in shallow waters, (2) the strong summer thermocline in the lake may have induced the selection of the shallow and warm bottoms of the lake as settlement areas, (3) intraspecific competition between adults and pediveligers, and (4) the high fishing mortality of large individuals in shallow waters. On the hypothesis that successful recruitment of P. jacobaeus occurred mostly in the shallow areas of the lake, it was deduced that P. jacobaeus gradually migrated, as they grew, from the shallow settlement fields of the lake to the deeper areas. The density of large individuals was associated with depth and the degree of scatter (QDœÜ) of the granule size frequencies. Higher densities of large individuals were found deeper and in poorly sorted sediments (QDœÜ > 1.0). The size of large individuals was positively correlated with depth.

Atka mackerel were found in dense aggregations near the Aleutian Islands where they are a major prey item of endangered Steller sea lions. In 1999, 1375 tagged fish were released and a biomass of 76 679 metric tonnes (t) was estimated outside a trawl exclusion zone using a simple Petersen model. In 2000, 8773 tagged fish were released and the estimated biomasses were 117 900 t inside and 82 057 t outside the trawl exclusion zones using an integrated tagging model. Movement into the open zone was small after 107 days (0.6%), whereas movement from the open area was potentially large but highly uncertain after 107 days (81%). Our model suggests that trawl exclusion zones in Seguam Pass are effective in separating a large biomass of potential prey for Steller sea lions from the immediate effects of local fisheries. Atka mackerel do not appear to move substantially outside their local aggregations (<70 km), and they show strong habitat preferences within their local home ranges. In one instance, fish released in an area of low Atka mackerel abundance returned to their capture location about 2 miles away. Thus individual Atka mackerel may have an affinity for particular areas within their home range, perhaps resulting from adaptations to local oceanic conditions along the Aleutian Island archipelago. ¬© 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1365-2419.2005.00380.x","2-s2.0-28344457564",4,0.674908547290304,1
"160","fish_oceanic","Fishing elevates variability in the abundance of exploited species","The separation of the effects of environmental variability from the impacts of fishing has been elusive, but is essential for sound fisheries management. We distinguish environmental effects from fishing effects by comparing the temporal variability of exploited versus unexploited fish stocks living in the same environments. Using the unique suite of 50-year-long larval fish surveys from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations we analyse fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Here we present evidence from the marine environment that exploited species exhibit higher temporal variability in abundance than unexploited species. This remains true after accounting for life-history effects, abundance, ecological traits and phylogeny. The increased variability of exploited populations is probably caused by fishery-induced truncation of the age structure, which reduces the capacity of populations to buffer environmental events. Therefore, to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain the total viable biomass but also to prevent the significant truncation of age structure. The double jeopardy of fishing to potentially deplete stock sizes and, more immediately, to amplify the peaks and valleys of population variability, calls for a precautionary management approach. ¬©2006 Nature Publishing Group.","10.1038/nature05232","2-s2.0-33750371465",7,0.677200487958815,0

A conductivity, temperature, and depth cast was completed after each tow to record corresponding hydrographic information. Larval Pacific hake, shortbelly rockfish, and other rockfish were enumerated and length measurements were recorded. Time-depth contours of water density showed a clear boundary, defining the mixed layer along the œÉŒ∏ = 25.0 isopycnal, that appeared to fluctuate vertically on a 12-h cycle centered around 50 m depth. Temperature-salinity plots showed a distinctly different pattern in the mixed layer when compared with water below the pycnocline. Length-frequency distributions plotted by survey day indicated a relatively continuous input of small rockfish larvae into the survey area rather than a resident population growing progressively larger each day. Catches of rockfish larvae were much higher in nighttime tows and varied by survey day, but were unaffected by the depth of the 25.0 isopycnal. In contrast, catches of Pacific hake did not vary significantly on a diel basis, but were significantly variable by survey day and were influenced by the depth of the mixed layer. Catches of Pacific hake larvae were significantly higher during warm-saline periods (spicy water), while shortbelly rockfish were significantly less abundant under these conditions. Spectral analysis showed a clear 12-h cycle in the depth of the 25.0 isopycnal and a 24-h cycle in the catches of rockfish larvae, while Pacific hake catches and spiciness of the mixed layer appeared to have lower frequency cycles in excess of 48 h. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00440.x","2-s2.0-34250743723",25,0.624344816843353,0

The prevalence of maturing females and mature males, along with the collection of a single viable egg mop, provide the first evidence of spawning of this species at the northern limit of its geographic range of distribution. Northward expansion of the long-finned squid population may be related to a general warming trend in Newfoundland near-shore waters. However, trends in size and abundance of short-finned squid (Illex illecebrosus) suggest that this expansion may also be related to reduced competition. We hypothesize that these two squid species share, to a large extent, a common niche on the eastern USA shelf and that opposing responses to ecosystem variation affect their relative abundance. We address this hypothesis by applying time-series analysis of species-specific fishery- and survey-based abundance indices with biologic and environmental input variables. Our models indicate that direct competition is not important, but that variation in atmospheric forcing, as well as latitudinal position of the Shelf-Slope Front (SSF), are closely related to direct oceanographic processes that exert opposing effects on these two species. While the direct oceanographic mechanisms that regulate year-class strength remain unknown, we present a hypothesis to account for opposing population responses to oceanographic variation that operates early in the life history of both species. For the oceanic and highly migratory short-finned squid, variation in the latitudinal position of the SSF is related to efficiency of downstream dispersal by the Gulf Stream and survival of young stages. For the neritic long-finned squid, variation in local inshore temperature affects the time exposed to intense predation through its effect on rates of embryonic development and growth. The expansion of long-finned squid population abundance in 2000 was associated with both warm local water temperatures and an unusual eastward displacement of the atmospheric features associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). These conditions may have resulted in an unfavorable oceanic regime for short-finned squid but a favorable regime for long-finned squid on the continental shelf as far north as southern Newfoundland. ¬© 2007 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00431.x","2-s2.0-34250773407",28,0.570049610734021,0
"1751","fish_oceanic","Distribution, abundance and biology of the smalltooth sandtiger shark Odontaspis ferox (Risso, 1810) (Lamniformes: Odontaspididae)","The smalltooth sandtiger shark, Odontaspis ferox, has a cosmopolitan distribution across warm temperate and tropical waters, and although essentially demersal, it has also been captured pelagically in mid-ocean. The species often occurs inshore at steeply shelving coastal and insular locations, and has now been identified by divers at eight widely separated shallow water sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, most O. ferox were caught by trawl on the continental slope, where its bathic range was extended to at least 880 m. Large specimens (>200 cm TL) were found across the whole depth range, but almost all juveniles were caught between 200 and 600 m. The largest recorded male was 344 cm TL, and female 450 cm TL. The few biological data suggest that size at maturity for males is around 200-250 cm TL, and for females 300-350 cm. No pregnant females were recorded but size at birth is probably about 100 cm TL. Nowhere has the species been found in large numbers. Survey and commercial catch data from south-east Australian trawl grounds suggest that numbers of O. ferox there have declined since the advent of deepwater commercial trawling in the 1970s. In areas of steep untrawlable terrain, increased gill-netting and longlining are likely to impact on local populations, with mature individuals being particularly vulnerable. Although O. ferox is not specifically targeted by commercial fishing activities, its likely very low fecundity make it susceptible to local extirpation, even at seemingly small capture rates. This species is protected off New South Wales and is considered "" vulnerable"" globally, by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). ¬© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","10.1007/s10641-007-9193-x","2-s2.0-36849057037",15,0.752444771704538,1
"1791","fish_oceanic","Why fishing magnifies fluctuations in fish abundance","It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels. ¬©2008 Nature Publishing Group.","10.1038/nature06851","2-s2.0-42249087307",1,0.73524031294097,0
"1911","fish_oceanic","Year-to-year and inter-decadal fluctuations in abundance of Pelagic fish populations in relation to climate-induced oceanic conditions","Ocean climate variables (1900-2005), time series of catches (1910-2005) and body size data were used to assess the year-to-year and decadal scale fluctuations in abundance of the fish populations (Japanese sardine, anchovy, jack mackerel, chub mackerel, Pacific saury and common squid) that have spawning grounds in the East China Sea and its adjacent regions. A negative correlation between the abundance of pelagic fishes (e.g. jack mackerel) in the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) region and the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) region was attributed to the climatic modulation of larval transport and recruitment, which depends on the winter monsoon-induced drift, current systems, and spawning season and site. The changes in abundance and alternation of dominant fish populations in the two regions in the 1930s, 1970s, and late 1980s mirrored changes in the climate indices (ALPI, AOI and MOI). Oscillations in the decadal climate shifts between the two regions led to zonal differences in larval transport and recruitment, and hence differences in the abundance of the pelagic fish populations. During deep Aleutian Lows, as in the 1980s, larval transport from the East China Sea to the KOC region increases in association with the strong winter Asian monsoon, cool regime and increased volume transport of the Kuroshio Current systems, whereas during a weak Aleutian Low (as in the 1990s), larval transport to the TWC region increased in association with a weak winter Asian monsoon, a warm regime, and increased volume transport of the Tsushima current system. We postulate that the increased chub mackerel abundance in the TWC region and the decreased abundance in the KOC region in the 1990s are partly attributed to changes in recruitment and availability to the fishing fleets under the warm regime in the spawning and nursery grounds in the East China Sea in association with the quasi-steady state of mild winter monsoon in the 1990s. The fluctuations in chub mackerel and jack mackerel abundance are under the environment-dependant growth form, although the tropicalization was identified in the TWC region. The density-dependant growth form was found in Japanese sardine populations, but no tropicalization by fishing was identified in the long (10-15 year) periods of abundance despite their short (3-4 year) generation time, suggesting that the environment-dependant growth form drove the changes in abundance. Year-to-year and decadal scale variations in abundance and population structure of the Pacific saury responded to climate regime shifts (1976/1977, 1988/1989), suggesting that the fish is a key bio-indicators for changes in the ecosystem.",NA,"2-s2.0-52949097262",2,0.817513548822187,1
"1921","fish_oceanic","The effects of environmental factors on daytime sandeel distribution and abundance on the Dogger Bank","Spring distribution and abundance of lesser sandeels during the day were linked to zooplankton densities, seabed substrate and various hydrographic factors using small scale empirical data collected in two areas on the Dogger Bank in 2004, 2005 and 2006. The results of a two-step generalized additive model (GAM) suggested that suitable seabed substrate and temperature best explain sandeel distribution (presence/absence) and that sandeel abundance (given presence) was best described by a model that included bottom temperature, difference between surface and bottom temperature and surface salinity. The current study suggests that suitable seabed substrate explains sandeel distribution in the water column. Bottom temperature and surface salinity also played an important role in explaining distribution and abundance, and we speculate that sandeels favour hydrographically dynamic areas. Contrary to our hypothesis sandeels were not strongly associated with areas of high zooplankton density. We speculate that in early spring on the western Dogger Bank plankton is still patchily distributed and that sandeels only emerge from the seabed when feeding conditions near their night-time burrowing habitat are optimal. The results also suggested that when abundance is over a threshold level, the number of sandeel schools increased rather than the schools becoming bigger. This relationship between patchiness and abundance has implications for mortality rates and hence fisheries management.

"1971","fish_oceanic","Patterns of jellyfish abundance in the North Atlantic","A number of explanations have been advanced to account for the increased frequency and intensity at which jellyfish (pelagic cnidarians and ctenophores) blooms are being observed, most of which have been locally directed. Here, we investigate seasonal and inter-annual patterns in abundance and distribution of jellyfish in the North Atlantic Ocean to determine if there have been any system-wide changes over the period 1946-2005, by analysing records of the presence of coelenterates from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. Peaks in jellyfish abundance are strongly seasonal in both oceanic and shelf areas: oceanic populations have a mid-year peak that is more closely related to peaks in phyto- and zooplankton, whilst the later peak of shelf populations mirrors changes in SST and reflects processes of advection and aggregation. There have been large amplitude cycles in the abundance of oceanic and shelf jellyfish (although not synchronous) over the last 60 years, with a pronounced synchronous increase in abundance in both areas over the last 10 years. Inter-annual variations in jellyfish abundance in oceanic areas are related to zooplankton abundance and temperature changes, but not to the North Atlantic Oscillation or to a chlorophyll index. The long-term inter-annual abundance of jellyfish on the shelf could not be explained by any environmental variables investigated. As multi-decadal cycles and more recent increase in jellyfish were obvious in both oceanic and shelf areas, we conclude that these are likely to reflect an underlying climatic signal (and bottom-up control) rather than any change in fishing pressure (top-down control). Our results also highlight the role of the CPR data in investigating long-term changes in jellyfish, and suggest that the cnidarians sampled by the CPR are more likely to be holoplanktic hydrozoans and not the much larger meroplanktic scyphozoans as has been suggested previously. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10750-008-9593-8","2-s2.0-57449119709",9,0.769069230425729,0

Three techniques were used: visual censuses in fixed quadrants and in roving-diver and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of the commercial fishery. We had two hypotheses, that the species had a nonrandom distribution, related to substrate and body size, and that relative abundance outside the national park would be lower than within, possibly due to fishery pressure. We found a patchy distribution over all, with octopuses almost confined to substrates with a large proportion of hard surfaces. There were seasonal and depth effects on distribution of the very small octopuses found mainly in shallow water (intertidal to 5 m depth) during the dry season. Abundance was similar inside and outside of the national park, which suggests that the octopus fishery is not a threat to the abundance of O. insularis at this present level. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"2021","fish_oceanic","Cascading top-down effects of changing oceanic predator abundances","1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. ¬© 2009 British Ecological Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01531.x","2-s2.0-66749121926",21,0.534185877448544,1
"2181","fish_oceanic","Krill population dynamics at South Georgia: Implications for ecosystem-based fisheries management","The South Georgia region supports a large biomass of krill that is subject to high interannual variability. The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change. ¬© 2010 Inter-Research.","10.3354/meps08356","2-s2.0-76249085454",33,0.724651652932162,0
"2231","fish_oceanic","Through a glass less darkly-New approaches for studying the distribution, abundance and biology of Euphausiids","Euphausiids are vital components of many oceanic foodwebs. Due to their large size, they are key prey species for many vertebrates, and several species are subject to commercial fisheries. The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises-usually in summer-to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species.

"2341","fish_oceanic","Preliminary forecasts of Pacific bigeye tuna population trends under the A2 IPCC scenario","An improved version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model SEAPODYM was used to investigate the potential impacts of global warming on tuna populations. The model included an enhanced definition of habitat indices, movements, and accessibility of tuna predators to different vertically migrant and non-migrant micronekton functional groups. The simulations covered the Pacific basin (model domain) at a 2¬∞√ó2¬∞ geographic resolution. The structure of the model allows an evaluation from multiple data sources, and parameterization can be optimized by adjoint techniques and maximum likelihood using fishing data. A first such optimized parameterization was obtained for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Pacific Ocean using historical catch data for the last 50years and a hindcast from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model driven by the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. The parameterization provided very plausible biological parameter values and a good fit to fishing data from the different fisheries, both within and outside the time period used for optimization. We then employed this model to forecast the future of bigeye tuna populations in the Pacific Ocean. The simulation was driven by the physical-biogeochemical fields predicted from a global marine biogeochemistry - climate simulation. This global simulation was performed with the IPSL climate model version 4 (IPSL-CM4) coupled to the oceanic biogeochemical model PISCES and forced by atmospheric CO2, from historical records over 1860-2000, and under the SRES A2 IPCC scenario for the 21st century (i.e. atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 850ppm in the year 2100). Potential future changes in distribution and abundance under the IPCC scenario are presented but without taking into account any fishing effort. The simulation showed an improvement in bigeye tuna spawning habitat both in subtropical latitudes and in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) where the surface temperature becomes optimal for bigeye tuna spawning. The adult feeding habitat also improved in the ETP due to the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration in the sub-surface allowing adults to access deeper forage. Conversely, in the Western Central Pacific the temperature becomes too warm for bigeye tuna spawning. The decrease in spawning is compensated by an increase of larvae biomass in subtropical regions. However, natural mortality of older stages increased due to lower habitat values (too warm surface temperatures, decreasing oxygen concentration in the sub-surface and less food). This increased mortality and the displacement of surviving fish to the eastern region led to stable then declining adult biomass at the end of the century. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.pocean.2010.04.021","2-s2.0-77957117601",31,0.619826891221436,1
"2491","fish_oceanic","Abundance of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Cetacea: Delphinidae), inhabiting the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil: Implications for conservation","A new mark-recapture abundance estimate and a photographic census were carried out to investigate the possible decline in the abundance of the bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821), in the Patos Lagoon estuary due to the high levels of bycatch mortality which occurred between 2002 and 2006 in oceanic coastal areas close to the estuary. Fourteen systematic boat surveys were conducted between August and early December 2005 to photo-identify the bottlenose dolphins. The estimated number of animals, with long-lasting marks, in the population obtained from Chapman's and Mth models were 51 (95% CI = 49-53) and 52 (95% CI = 51-60), respectively. Taking into account the proportion of dolphins with long-lasting marks in the population, the total estimated population size ranged between 84 (95% CI = 76-93) and 86 (95% CI = 78-95) individuals, respectively, which was very similar to the 84 individuals revealed by the population census. Our results did not differ from the abundance estimate carried out in 1998, prior to the high fishing-related mortality event, suggesting that the population is stable. Plausible argument to explain the stability of the population is that some carcasses found on the oceanic coastal beaches near Patos Lagoon estuary come from animals that do not belong to the estuary community. Future studies should investigate fine-scale habitat partition between estuarine and adjacent coastal dolphins. If the existence of different communities living in close proximity (estuarine and coastal areas near to the estuary) is confirmed, a new abundance estimate is needed to access the conservation status of bottlenose dolphins in this region. ¬© 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.","10.1590/S1984-46702011000100004","2-s2.0-79954986951",112,0.843195431802915,1

We conducted surveys and over 300 research SCUBA dives among the remote Phoenix Islands: Nikumaroro (Gardner), McKean, Manra (Sydney), Kanton (Aba-Riringa), Enderbury, Orona (Hull) and Rawaki (Phoenix), only excluding Birnie Island due to time limitations. Corals, benthic and mobile invertebrates, fishes, algae, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals were surveyed at each site. Deep-sea life was sampled during seven deployments of an autonomous digital video camera system to 1,000 m depth at Kanton, Manra, and Orona. Coral reef and fish communities were surveyed using rapid assessment methods, small benthic fishes were collected using rotenone as a stunning agent, marine algae were collected by hand primarily during SCUBA dives, and a deepdrop collecting net was deployed to sample deep-sea animals. The reefs show evidence of the extreme isolation of these islands, pounded on three sides by the large ocean swells of the Pacific with only a narrow protected side to the west providing protection for anchorage. Coral species diversity of the islands was moderately high. While lacking in some corals dominant in other major reef areas, the reefs have interesting species assemblages, with prolific growth of some species normally subdominant in other reef areas. The reefs were in an excellent state of health, at the time of these surveys free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific recently and with no evidence of any coral diseases. Our data include new distribution records for species of algae, coral and fishes. Fish communities were abundant and diverse and included pelagic fishes such as tuna and oceanic mackerels. Significant populations of grey reef, whitetip reef, and blacktip reef sharks were also observed indicating a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Reef macropredators (trevally, Napoleon wrasse) were also abundant. The deep-sea camera recorded images of deep-water sharks including six-gilled and Pacific sleeper sharks. Marine mammal sightings include bottlenose dolphins, Pacific spinner dolphins, beaked whales (Mesoplodon spp.), and unidentified whales. Sea birds observed on Rawaki, McKean, Enderbury, and Orona Islands included tens of thousands of nesting spectacled terns (grey-backed), sooty terns, white fairy-terns, brown noddies, blue-grey noddies, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-footed boobies, red-tailed tropic birds, great frigate birds and lesser frigate birds.

"258","fish_oceanic","Assessing the impacts of fishing and habitat loss on the Lord Howe Island population of flesh-footed shearwaters","The flesh-footed shearwater Puffinus carneipes is a medium-sized seabird with a single eastern Australian population breeding on Lord Howe Island. Other breeding populations exist in New Zealand, south-western Western Australia and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. Tagging and banding studies indicate that breeding birds of the Lord Howe Island population inhabit waters mainly to the west of the Island during October to May. Birds then migrate north to waters surrounding Japan during the Austral winter. Seabirds are attracted to the baited hooks of longline vessels and can become snagged and drown as the line sinks into the water. Observations of flesh-footed shearwater (FFS) bycatch in Australian waters have been recorded on both Japanese and domestic longline fishing vessels. Increased observer coverage between 2002 and 2004 on Australian longline vessels, in order to monitor the effectiveness of an under-water setting chute and various line-weighting regimes, showed large bycatch rates of seabirds, and in particular flesh-footed shearwaters (Baker and Wise, 2005). In addition, substantial reductions in colony size have occurred on the island due to housing development. As a consequence of these sources of additional mortality, concerns have been expressed about the population's sustainability. Australia has international and national obligations to ensure that fishery interactions with seabird populations are not deleterious to their populations. The ""incidental catch (or by-catch) of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations"" has been listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as a key threatening process for seabirds (Environment Australia, 1998). Flesh-footed shearwaters were nominated as being at risk from longline fishing. This paper presents a quantitative impact assessment that fully integrates information on the biology, foraging distributions, links to oceanography, fishing interactions (Northern and Southern Hemisphere), and potential impacts from housing on Lord Howe Island. A discrete age-, sex- and colony-structured model is developed that accounts for natural and fishing mortality, together with potential consequences from the loss of nesting habitat on Lord Howe Island. The model is able to fit to tagging data on breeding foraging distributions. These data assist the model in predicting where the birds might be when at sea. The birds' position is assumed to be a function of time of year, sea surface temperature and longitude. Using the predicted positions, the model fits to data on the observed bycatch from the Australian domestic longline fishery. These data enable the model to predict the probability of catching a bird, given various operational characteristics (e.g. setting at night). The model also fits to data from the two surveys of breeding abundance that have occurred on Lord Howe Island.",NA,"2-s2.0-80052979401",199,0.806503311678462,1
"2731","fish_oceanic","Re-Creating Missing Population Baselines for Pacific Reef Sharks","Sharks and other large predators are scarce on most coral reefs, but studies of their historical ecology provide qualitative evidence that predators were once numerous in these ecosystems. Quantifying density of sharks in the absence of humans (baseline) is, however, hindered by a paucity of pertinent time-series data. Recently researchers have used underwater visual surveys, primarily of limited spatial extent or nonstandard design, to infer negative associations between reef shark abundance and human populations. We analyzed data from 1607 towed-diver surveys (>1 ha transects surveyed by observers towed behind a boat) conducted at 46 reefs in the central-western Pacific Ocean, reefs that included some of the world's most pristine coral reefs. Estimates of shark density from towed-diver surveys were substantially lower (<10%) than published estimates from surveys along small transects (<0.02 ha), which is not consistent with inverted biomass pyramids (predator biomass greater than prey biomass) reported by other researchers for pristine reefs. We examined the relation between the density of reef sharks observed in towed-diver surveys and human population in models that accounted for the influence of oceanic primary productivity, sea surface temperature, reef area, and reef physical complexity. We used these models to estimate the density of sharks in the absence of humans. Densities of gray reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), whitetip reef sharks (Triaenodon obesus), and the group ""all reef sharks"" increased substantially as human population decreased and as primary productivity and minimum sea surface temperature (or reef area, which was highly correlated with temperature) increased. Simulated baseline densities of reef sharks under the absence of humans were 1.1-2.4/ha for the main Hawaiian Islands, 1.2-2.4/ha for inhabited islands of American Samoa, and 0.9-2.1/ha for inhabited islands in the Mariana Archipelago, which suggests that density of reef sharks has declined to 3-10% of baseline levels in these areas. ¬© 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01835.x","2-s2.0-84861183339",32,0.728346162124784,0

Itis suggested that oceanicregime shifts in the early 1970s, late 1980s and late 1990s occurred in the TWC region in winter, but the regime shifts in the mid-1970s and in the late 1980s were not evidentin the springSST anomaly series. The abundance and body size of Pacific saury fluctuated in association with the winter oceanic changes in the TWC region. The catch rates and abundance of large size saury were far bellow average during their northward migrations in the TWC region in the years with abnormally cool winters (e.g., 1963,1970, 1977, 1981-1989 and 2006) and above average in the years with warm winters.

"289","fish_oceanic","Structure, abundance and biomass size spectra of copepods and other zooplankton communities in upper waters of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean during summer","Little attention has been paid to small copepods and other zooplankton inhabiting pelagic ecosystems of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean under the influence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current circulation, despite their important role in the trophic chain and fisheries. This study gives a synoptic view (January 2001) of the micro and mesoplankton size fractions and normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) in upper waters of five different ecological domains (shelf and oceanic Subantarctic and Antarctic waters) including the Brazil-Malvinas confluence (BMC). Copepods were always the main component of the zooplankton; the <300-Œºm fraction represented between 70 and 99% in terms of numbers and from 20 to 88% in terms of biomass. Other zooplankton contributed with <40% to total zooplankton densities, though showing some biomass peaks (>50%). Chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature and salinity were the environmental variables that best explained the distribution trend of zooplankton, mainly that of the <300-Œºm fraction. For all the domains, NBSS revealed flat slopes (-0.6 to-1), suggesting a higher proportion of large organisms than expected at equilibrium. A dome-shape feature was detected in the BMC. Total biomass and trophic levels of the system were related to the composition of the community and the hydrological conditions of the domains covered. ¬© 2013 The Author.","10.1093/plankt/fbt014","2-s2.0-84877343894",17,0.507724883442852,0

Since empirical determination of self-recruitment vs. external recruitment is difficult, we used a modeling approach to examine the sensitivity of fishery management priorities to recruitment assumptions (self [closed], external [open]) in a local population of harvested giant clams (Tridacna maxima) on Mo'orea, French Polynesia. From 2006 to 2010, we measured growth, fecundity, recruitment, and survival (resulting from natural and fishing mortality). We used these data to parameterize both a closed (complete self-recruitment) and an open (no selfrecruitment) integral projection model (IPM), and then calculated elasticities of demographic rates (growth, survival, recruitment) to future population abundance in 20 years. The models' lowest projected abundance was 93.4% (95% CI, [86.5%, 101.8%]) of present abundance, if the local population is entirely open and the present level of fishing mortality persists. The population will exhibit self-sustaining dynamics. 1 k 1.07. as for a closed population if the ratio of self-recruits per gram of dry gonad is .0.775 (equivalent to 52.85% selfrecruitment under present conditions). Elasticity analysis of demographic parameters indicated that future abundance can most effectively be influenced by increasing survival of mid-sized clams (;80-120 mm) if the population is self-sustaining, and by increasing survival of juvenile clams (;40-70 mm) if the population is non-self-sustaining (as for an open population). Our results illustrate that management priorities can vary depending on the amount of self-recruitment in a local population. ¬© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/13-1201.1","2-s2.0-84907016100",19,0.794659879189787,0

From sightings of the six most commonly encountered cetacean species, seasonal, annual and overall density estimates were calculated. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted baleen whales with overall densities of 0.91/1000km2 (CV=0.27), 2.73/1000km2 (CV=0.19), and 1.17/1000km2 (CV=0.21) respectively. Species specific density estimates, stratified by cruise, were analyzed using a generalized additive model to estimate long-term trends and correct for seasonal imbalances. Variances were estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap with one day of effort as the sampling unit. Blue whales were primarily observed during summer and fall while fin and humpback whales were observed year-round with peaks in density during summer and spring respectively. Short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoidesdalli) were the most frequently encountered small cetaceans with overall densities of 705.83/1000km2 (CV=0.22), 51.98/1000km2 (CV=0.27), and 21.37/1000km2 (CV=0.19) respectively. Seasonally, short-beaked common dolphins were most abundant in winter whereas Pacific white-sided dolphins and Dall's porpoise were most abundant during spring. There were no significant long-term changes in blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, short-beaked common dolphin or Dall's porpoise densities while Pacific white-sided dolphins exhibited a significant decrease in density across the ten-year study. The results from this study were fundamentally consistent with earlier studies, but provide greater temporal and seasonal resolution. ¬© 2014 The Authors.","10.1016/j.dsr2.2014.10.008","2-s2.0-84921495236",27,0.866645744236966,1

Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site.Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii.Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system. ¬© 2015.","10.1016/j.jmarsys.2015.07.005","2-s2.0-84939506886",219,0.791013895723758,0
"348","fish_oceanic","Recent collapse of northern anchovy biomass off California","New estimates of abundance of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) are developed from California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) data on egg and larval densities for the period 1951-2011. Previous estimates utilizing mean density over the CalCOFI area show a hyperstability bias because of the nearshore concentration of CalCOFI stations and the tendency of the anchovy population to contract into this area when abundances are low. New abundance estimates weight sample egg and larval densities to the local area represented by that sample, and then sum contributions to obtain total abundance. We develop total egg and larval abundance estimates for January and April, form a combined index, and calibrate it to the absolute biomass estimates produced by the Daily Egg Production Method in the early 1980s. Anchovy spawning biomass was very low, 10,000-20,000 Metric Tons (MT), in the early 1950s when CalCOFI sampling began. Abundance increased and fluctuated between 0.5 and 2 million metric tons from 1960 through 1990. After 1990, spawning biomass fluctuated around 200,000 tons, briefly increased during 2005-2006, then declined substantially over four years to below 20,000 tons from 2009 to 2011. CalCOFI ichthyoplankton data collected after 2011 are not yet available for analysis, but continuous underway egg sampling conducted during CalCOFI cruises indicates continued low abundance and very limited spawning through 2015 in both southern and central California. The recent collapse of anchovy abundance occurred in the absence of a significant fishery. Present annual catches of a few thousand tons are small by historical comparison, but the exploitation rate may now be relatively high given the low stock abundance. The decline in anchovy abundance coincides with recent die-offs and reproductive failures of anchovy-dependent predators in the ecosystem (e.g., sea lions and pelicans). ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.11.013","2-s2.0-84949266443",322,0.830817364457117,0
"3511","fish_oceanic","The role of environmental controls in determining sardine and anchovy population cycles in the California Current: Analysis of an end-to-end model","Sardine and anchovy are two forage species of particular interest because of their low-frequency cycles in adult abundance in boundary current regions, combined with a commercially relevant contribution to the global marine food catch. While several hypotheses have been put forth to explain decadal shifts in sardine and anchovy populations, a mechanistic basis for how the physics, biogeochemistry, and biology combine to produce patterns of synchronous variability across widely separated systems has remained elusive. The present study uses a 50-year (1959-2008) simulation of a fully coupled end-to-end ecosystem model configured for sardine and anchovy in the California Current System to investigate how environmental processes control their population dynamics. The results illustrate that slightly different temperature and diet preferences can lead to significantly different responses to environmental variability. Simulated adult population fluctuations are associated with age-1 growth (via age-2 egg production) and prey availability for anchovy, while they depend primarily on age-0 survival and temperature for sardine. The analysis also hints at potential linkages to known modes of climate variability, whereby changes in adult abundance are related to ENSO for anchovy and to the PDO for sardine. The connection to the PDO and ENSO is consistent with modes of interannual and decadal variability that would alternatively favor anchovy during years of cooler temperatures and higher prey availability, and sardine during years of warmer temperatures and lower prey availability. While the end-to-end ecosystem model provides valuable insight on potential relationships between environmental conditions and sardine and anchovy population dynamics, understanding the complex interplay, and potential lags, between the full array of processes controlling their abundances in the California Current System remains an on-going challenge. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.pocean.2014.11.013","2-s2.0-84951570019",29,0.55074290757179,0

We used transect to study Diadema mexicanum, Echinometra mathaei oblonga, Eucidaris thouarsii and Tripneustes depressus at three bays in Socorro Island, Revillagigedo Archipelago, Mexico (1989 and 1990). The most abundant species in the island was E. mathaei oblonga (3.96 + 0.83 ind m-2; average and standard error), followed by D. mexicanum (2.13 + 0.59 ind m-2), T. depressus and E. thouarsii (between 0.50 and 0.11 ind m-2, respectively). Binners Bay had the highest density with 15.98 + 0.43 ind m-2, mostly due to the high incidence of E. mathaei oblonga at the site. Seasonally, T. depressus and E. thouarsii did not significantly varied its abundance during the year, while D. mexicanum was more abundant in winter-spring, and E. mathaei oblonga in the fall. Two species (D. mexicanum and E. mathaei oblonga) had an aggregated distribution along the year and in the three study locations, but the other two echinoids followed a random distribution. This may be a defense against the abundant predatory fishes. In contrast, the species that do not aggregate inhabit in refuges during the day (E. thouarsii), or their shape and size makes them difficult to capture by fishes (T. depressus). ¬© 2015, Universidad de Costa Rica.

"375","fish_oceanic","Whale shark (Rhincodon typus) seasonal occurrence, abundance and demographic structure in the mid-equatorialatlantic ocean","Whale sharks are generally associated with environmental factors that drive their movements to specific locations where food availability is high. Consequently, foraging is believed to be the main reason for the formation of whale shark aggregations. Feeding aggregations occur mainly in nearshore areas and are composed primarily of immature individuals. Conversely, aggregations of mature adults are rarely observed, and their occurrence is correlated with oceanic environments. Despite an increase in the number of whale shark studies, information on mating and parturition grounds is still lacking. In the present work, we assessed the ecological and behavioural aspects of the whale sharks that visit the archipelago of S√£o Pedro and S√£o Paulo (ASPSP), located ‚àº1,000 km off the coast of Brazil in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Forty-nine whale sharks were recorded from February 2005 to May 2014. The estimated mean - SD size was 8.27-2.52 m (range: 2.5-14.0 m) with no significant differences in size across the year. The maturational stages were classified by size as immature (<8.0 m; 32.56%) and mature (>9.0 m; 46.51%); with almost half of the observed animals being mature specimens. The majority of sightings occurred between February and June. During this period, the ocean current weakens and the waters are enriched by eggs and larvae of fishes and invertebrates that attract marine life to forage. At the same time, evidence of reproductive activity in adult females (i.e. swollen abdomen and bite marks on the pectoral fins), and the potential mating behaviour exhibited by one male, suggest that the ASPSP area might also have a role in whale shark reproduction. Irrespective of its use for feeding or reproduction, this insular habitat serves as a meeting point for both juvenile and adult whale sharks, and may play an important ecological role for the species. ¬© 2016 Macena, Hazin.

"379","fish_oceanic","Under pressure: Cetaceans and fisheries co-occurrence off the coasts of Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire (Gulf of Guinea)","Within the Gulf of Guinea high levels of fisheries-related cetacean mortality (bycatch and direct-capture) has been documented. For locally rare species such removals could potentially lead to significant population level effects. However, information on the cetacean abundance and distribution is scarce. Similarly, it remains largely unreported where fishing fleets operate offshore. A cetacean survey took place during geophysical surveys (2013-2014) along the coasts of Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire. This provided a unique opportunity to study both offshore cetacean and fishing communities. Due to large group-sizes, melon-headed whales were the most abundant (0.34 animals km-1) followed by Fraser's dolphins and short-finned pilot whales. Range state records were confirmed for melon-headed whale and Fraser's dolphin in Ivoirian waters and ten further species represented first at-sea sightings. The artisanal fishing canoe was most abundant (92% of all vessels) and recorded up to 99.5 km from the Ghanaian coast. Asian trawlers operated over shelf areas and tuna purse-seine vessels in deep oceanic and slope waters. Fraser's dolphins, melon-headed whales, pantropical spotted dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and pilot whales were recorded in areas with the highest fishing densities. Melon-headed whales, pilot whales, and rough-toothed dolphins were observed in vicinity of trawlers; bottlenose dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, and pilot whales in vicinity of canoes. Some notable differences were found in the species composition between the present surveys and port-based surveys of landed cetaceans (bycatch/direct-captures). These may be explained by (1) feeding strategies (nocturnal vs. diurnal; surface vs. deep water); (2) different attractions to vessels/fishing gear; (3) variable body sizes; and (4) difficulty to positively identify species. Despite these differences, both cetaceans and fishing vessels predominantly occurred in shelf and slope waters (&lt; 1000 m depth contour), making fishery-related mortality likely. The poor knowledge on population trends of cetaceans in this unique upwelling region, together with a high demand for cetacean products for human consumption (as ""marine bushmeat"") may lead to a potential decline of some species that may go unnoticed. These new insights can provide a foundation for the urgently required risk assessments of cetacean mortality in fisheries within the northern Gulf of Guinea. ¬© 2016 de Boer, Saulino, Van Waerebeek and Aarts.","10.3389/fmars.2016.00178","2-s2.0-85008627056",285,0.798760164041183,1

However, owing to their anti-predator behavior and habitats, their ecology, abundance, and distributions are only partially known. From September 20 to October 6, 2011, we conducted a series of surveys over a large area (approximately 75,000 km2) of the northern Gulf of Mexico (87¬∞W-90.5¬∞W, 28¬∞N-30¬∞N). Te surveys used an airborne lidar and vessel-based sampling, supported by near real time satellite observations of oceanic conditions. Te aerial survey was conducted from a fxed wing aircraft that few repeated surveys day and night, enabling data collection that was both broad-scale and synoptic. Vessel-based sampling included quantitative visual observations, trawl sampling, and qualitative dip-netting for species identifcations. Te combined surveys identifed large aggregations of epipelagic organisms dominated by flying fshes. Large numbers of jellyfsh (Aurelia sp.) and low numbers of numerous other species were also observed. Te putative flying fsh aggregations had an average length scale of 6.1 km and an average population estimated at 10,000 individuals. While always near the surface, flying fsh aggregations were slightly deeper at night than during the day and found most often off the continental shelf in warm water with low chlorophyll concentrations. At least three species were present: Hirundichthys rondeletii (Valenciennes, 1847), Cheilopogon melanurus (Valenciennes, 1847), and Prognichthys occidentalis Parin, 1999.

With the reduction of this threat in many areas, coupled with other conservation actions, some populations have demonstrated encouraging recovery, although remaining below their previous levels and undergone additional modern threats such as incidental capture in fisheries and pollution. Trends in sea turtle populations have usually been assessed through monitoring of females or nests on nesting beaches. Here we present data from a 22-year monitoring period for a juvenile green sea turtle Chelonia mydas mixed-stock in southeastern Brazil that were incidentally captured in passive non-lethal pound nets. A total of 3639 green turtles were captured in 5323 fishing days.pound‚àí1 with mortality rate of 2%. Captures occurred in all months, but bycatch rates, excluding recapture events, were higher in September and October, probably due to the recruitment of turtles migrating from southern areas, as well as recruits from the oceanic zone. Capture rates increased by 9.2% per year in the period from 1995 to 2016, in line with increasing source populations, particularly the main source contributor at Ascension Island, but also Trindade Island (Brazil) and Aves Island (Venezuela). Mean Curved Carapace Length of green turtles was higher during austral summer/early autumn and decreased markedly in May, probably due to the small-sized individuals that recruited to the study site. We show that the incidental capture of sea turtles in non-lethal fisheries, such as Brazilian pound nets, could also provide data on trends of populations nesting in distant places, and can contribute to the assessment of population status of sea turtles within Regional Management Units throughout the Atlantic Ocean. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd","10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.008","2-s2.0-85018655985",5,0.920929568693568,1

In this study, we analyzed a 10¬†year database of incidental catches of the tuna purse seine fleet in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico with the aim to understand the environmental determinants of the spatial distribution and seasonal migration patterns of dolphinfish. We modeled the probability of occurrence of dolphinfish as a function of spatial (geographical coordinates), temporal (month/year) and environmental variables (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll [CHL] and sea surface height [SSH], inferred from satellites) using logistic Generalized Additive Models. Dolphinfish preferred waters with SST values from 23 to 28¬∞C, low (&lt;0.2¬†mg/m3) CHL values, and primarily positive SSH values. Two dolphinfish hot spots were found in the study area: one in an oceanic zone (10¬∞‚Äì15¬∞N, 120¬∞‚Äì125¬∞W), which was more defined during spring, and one on the Pacific side of the Baja California Peninsula, which became important during summer. Models suggested that dolphinfish migrated through the study area following a ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù that ran from the Gulf of Tehuantepec along the Equatorial Upwelling zone to the oceanic hot spot zone, which in turn connected with the hot spot off the BCP. This ‚Äúmigratory corridor‚Äù went around the Eastern Pacific Warm Pool, which suggested that dolphinfish avoided this high temperature-low production zone. Dolphinfish occupied zones close to certain oceanic features, such as eddies and thermal fronts. Results suggested that the primary cause of the biological hot spots was wind-driven upwelling, because the hot spots became more important 3‚Äì4¬†months after the peak in upwelling activity. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","10.1111/fog.12231","2-s2.0-85030094357",16,0.554422436051295,1

The mean abundance in the area was 4.21 tonnes/km2 and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated as 0.63 million tonnes.

The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933.

"230","mammal_antarctic","Abundance, distribution and status of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri","The abundance of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, was estimated using a model that incorporated estimated pup production. Pups are born at only five sites, four of which are at the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, which lie to the south of New Zealand. The remaining breeding site is at Campbell Island in the same region. Pup production was estimated during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons from mark-recapture studies at the two largest sea lion rookeries, at the Auckland Islands (Sandy Bay and Dundas Island), which account for almost 90% of total pup production for the species. Pup production for the other sites was estimated from direct counts or, in the case of Campbell Island, from recent tagging data. Total pup production estimates for all sites during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons are 2640 and 2807 respectively. During the four-week pupping season, pup mortality at most sites was estimated to be about 10%. The estimates of absolute abundance based on pup production for the two breeding seasons were 11 700 (95% confidence interval (CI): 10500-13100) and 12500 (95% CI: 11100-14000) respectively. This population abundance is among the smallest reported for a species within the Otariidae. The highly localised, and historically reduced distribution make this species vulnerable to impact and warrants particular attention from conservation managers. In particular, the potential impact of the annual bycatch of P. hookeri in a trawl fishery requires close monitoring and, ideally, some mitigation action.","10.1071/WR98022","2-s2.0-0032991223",4,0.816400879,1
"324","mammal_antarctic","The importance of the Patagonian Shelf for top predator species breeding at South Georgia","1. The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals. These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf. 2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the east to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle. 3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species. 4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered. 5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators. ¬© 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/aqc.480","2-s2.0-0036117415",49,0.801142872,0
"417","mammal_antarctic","Re-constructing historical Ad√©lie penguin abundance estimates by retrospectively accounting for detection bias","Seabirds and other land-breeding marine predators are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because of their dependence on marine prey and the accessibility of their populations at breeding colonies. Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Ad√©lie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Ad√©lie penguin population change. Our approach is applicable to abundance data for a wide range of colonial, land-breeding marine species including other penguin species, flying seabirds and marine mammals. ¬© 2015 Southwell et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0123540","2-s2.0-84929379144",2,0.800014998,1

We identified 295 individuals using photo-identification of dorsal fins, including 58 calves, and the population estimate for a single season was 100-300 solitary adults plus 25-50 mothers with calves; the estimated population of animals across all seasons using a mark and recapture model was over 1,000. Eight of the 139 fluke identifications were matched to whales in photograph catalogues from the Antarctic Peninsula and a ninth was matched to a whale sighted in Chilean waters; four of these nine individuals have also been sighted in Colombia. We conclude that Panama (Las Perlas Archipelago in particular) is an important calving area for humpback whales in the Southern Hemisphere. These data should provide a foundation for monitoring of population change and to increase awareness in Panama about the need to manage vessel traffic and tourism related to the whales at Las Perlas. ¬© 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy.","10.1111/mms.12136","2-s2.0-84919624930",28,0.799841986,1

Little is known about humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) dispersal and migration in the western Indian Ocean. In October 2011 and 2012, eleven satellite transmitters were deployed on wintering humpback whales from the south-western Indian Ocean breeding stock at the Comoros islands (Moh√©li, n = 6 and Mayotte, n = 5). Eight individuals were successfully tracked for 24.3 ¬± 12.4. days (range = 8-49. days) and travelled between 146. km and 5804. km in total. Whales either remained at their wintering site for several weeks (n = 3) or dispersed along the west coast (n = 4) or east (n = 1) coast of Madagascar where two main stop-over sites were identified. In addition, two individuals travelled along straight paths to distant, potential, foraging areas. One whale reached the French sub-Antarctic islands while the other travelled to one of the supposed Antarctic foraging areas for humpback whales of this breeding stock. This is the first time movements of humpback whales from this area are being described and their potential foraging areas in the Southern Ocean identified. Identification of these dispersal patterns is important for delineation of breeding regions and for allocating abundance estimates to stocks. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.jembe.2013.10.014","2-s2.0-84889606621",34,0.792272905,0

The size of the breeding population on the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, New Zealand, is unknown. Disappointment Island is thought to be the main white-chinned petrel breeding site in the Auckland Islands, and maybe also in the New Zealand region, and has never had introduced mammalian predators. We estimated the white-chinned petrel breeding population size taking into account the detection probability of burrows via distance sampling and the burrow occupancy rate. Eighty line transects were distributed over the island, with a total line length of 1600¬†m. Burrows were patchily distributed and most abundant in dense megaherb communities. White-chinned petrel burrow density D^ was 654 burrows/ha (95¬†% CI 528‚Äì809 burrows/ha), with burrow detection probability p^ varying among vegetation communities from 0.28¬†¬±¬†0.02 to 0.43¬†¬±¬†0.02 (¬±SE).

We document an estimated total of 155,500 (125,600‚Äì192,500) breeding pairs of white-chinned petrels on Disappointment Island during mid incubation in early January 2015. The relatively high occupancy and density of burrows suggest that Disappointment Island is a key breeding site for white-chinned petrels. ¬© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00300-016-2031-x","2-s2.0-84984917470",7,0.780608573,0

This, in turn, might be affected by climatically driven change in the abundance of the species main prey, krill (Euphausia superba), on the feeding grounds. Annual data on southern right whale number of calves were obtained from aerial surveys carried out between 1997 and 2013 in southern Brazil, where the species concentrate during their breeding season. The number of calves recorded each year varied from 7 to 43 (= 21.11 ¬± 11.88). Using cross-correlation analysis we examined the response of the species to climate anomalies and krill densities. Significant correlations were found with krill densities (r = 0.69, p = 0.002, lag 0 years), Oceanic Ni√±o Index (r = '0.65, p = 0.03, lag 6 years), Antarctic Oscillation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01, lag 7 years) and Antarctic sea ice area (r = '0.68, p = 0.002, lag 0 years). Our results suggest that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success in southern Brazil by determining variation in food (krill) availability for the species. Therefore, increased frequency of years with reduced krill abundance, due to global warming, is likely to reduce the current rate of recovery of southern right whales from historical overexploitation.","10.1038/srep28205","2-s2.0-84975045802",43,0.775146741,0

Seals belonged to an open population, and were sampled outside the breeding season and during their northward winter dispersal (April-October). Seals at Bird Island were highly transient (41-63%) with only a limited number of individuals making repeat visits across years. A minimum yearly survival for resident seals was estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.85. The physical environment played an important role in leopard seal abundance, with observations following an apparent 4-year periodicity consistent with the frequency and timing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. Years of low sea-surface temperature (SST) and extensive pack-ice corresponded to a higher number of seals present, earlier arrivals, and longer periods of residency. Peak leopard seal arrivals at Bird Island corresponded to periods of low SST, which was consistent with the pagophilic nature of this species.","10.1017/S0952836904005102","2-s2.0-3142639196",10,0.772810535,1

Mark-recapture analyses and model selection trials using Akaike's Information Criterion indicate that sex, cohort, and year affect juvenile (ages 1 and 2) survival. In contrast, year and perhaps sex and cohort are less important factors for adult survival. Average annual survival is higher among adults (0.93) than juveniles (0.55-0.59) and there is little evidence for senescence to at least age 17. The oldest known-aged female and male in the study were 27 and 24 years old, respectively. Data suggest that the abundance of a resident population of Weddell seals remains relatively stable over time despite annual fluctuations in Jolly-Seber abundance estimates for the entire population. We argue that this annual variability is likely the result of temporary immigration of animals born outside the study area; mean rates are estimated from a simulation model and tagging data to be between 16.8% and 39.7% for females and between -13.1% and 31.6% for males. Sea ice extent appears to affect immigration where, during times of reduced fast-ice, immigrants are forced, or allowed easier access, into the ice-covered areas of Erebus Bay from surrounding locations. Our findings contradict previous studies reporting lower survival and higher immigration. Model choice is shown to be the most likely cause of these discrepancies and we provide evidence that our models are more appropriate than those used elsewhere.","10.1139/z04-025","2-s2.0-4043098396",3,0.766331811,1
"1114","mammal_antarctic","Shifting trends: Detecting environmentally mediated regulation in long-lived marine vertebrates using time-series data","Assessing the status and trends in animal populations is essential for effective species conservation and management practices. However, unless time-series abundance data demonstrate rapid and reliable fluctuations, objective appraisal of directionality of trends is problematic. We adopted a multiple-working hypotheses approach based on information-theoretic and Bayesian multi-model inference to examine the population trends and form of intrinsic regulation demonstrated by a long-lived species, the southern elephant seal. We also determined the evidence for density dependence in 11 other well-studied marine mammal species. (1) We tested the type of population regulation for elephant seals from Marion Island (1986-2004) and from 11 other marine mammal species, and (2) we described the trends and behavior of the 19-year population time series at Marion Island to identify changes in population trends. We contrasted five plausible trend models using information-theoretic and Bayesian-inference estimates of model parsimony. Our analyses identified two distinct phases of population growth for this population with the inflexion occurring in 1998. Thus, the population decreased between 1986 and 1997 (-3.7% per annum) and increased between 1997 and 2004 (1.9% per annum). An index of environmental stochasticity, the Southern Oscillation Index, explained some of the variance in r and N. We determined analytically that there was good evidence for density dependence in the Marion Island population and that density dependence was widespread among marine mammal species (67% of species showed evidence for population regulation). This approach demonstrates the potential functionality of a relatively simple technique that can be applied to short time series to identify the type of regulation, and the uncertainty associated with the phenomenon, operating in populations of large mammals. ¬© 2008 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00442-008-1205-9","2-s2.0-58549119004",30,0.765170487,1

We used line transect methods to survey 23,671km by helicopter and 3,694km by ship accounting for a total coverage of 53,217km2. We detected and identified 11,308 seals in 7,104 groups and estimated their abundance from estimates of densities using distance sampling methods and corrections for probability of haul out of seals derived from satellite telemetry of tagged seals. Crabeater seals were most abundant (ca 1.7 million) followed by Weddell seals (330,000), Ross seals (22,600), and leopard seals (15,000). Our estimates of abundance are difficult to directly compare with earlier estimates because of geographic areas covered and by our improvements in survey and analytical methods. Notwithstanding these limitations and with some adjustments for differences in methods, we found that our estimates of abundance for crabeater seals are similar to those from the most recent surveys in the Ross and Amundsen Seas and along the George-Oates Coast. Our estimates for Weddell seals are the first for the broad areas of pack ice that we surveyed in the Ross and Amundsen Seas but indicate that these habitats are ecologically important to this species.

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.","10.1017/S0030605308099997","2-s2.0-67349234507",47,0.761818988,0

Logistic regression and an information-theoretic approach related the occurrence of Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis (the most abundant species) to whether we were in open- or pack-ice-covered pelagic or neritic waters, in or out of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), and north or south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current southern boundary. Other variables included date and distance to the MIZ and shelfbreak front. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of sighting a minke, as well as killer whale - but not the case for an index to whale density - was related to the proximity of coastal polynyas in early autumn, switching offshore to the MIZ once waters within the pack began to freeze persistently later in the season. Probability of detection was higher with distance into the MIZ. Supporting these findings, the density index was strongly related to ice concentration in an inverse relationship. The strong relationship to polynyas and the MIZ indicate that sea-ice divergence altered by decadal or longer-term climate change, as described in the recent literature, could well affect any apparent, long-term trends evident in this species' abundance if surveyed only in open or near-to-ice waters. We speculate on how the minke whale's pagophilic nature (1) could have been encouraged by large-scale industrial whaling and by competition with species more characteristic of open waters and the outer MIZ, and (2) may have protected the population somewhat during industrial whaling resulting in the much greater abundance of this species now compared to other targeted species. ¬© 2007 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.00109.x","2-s2.0-33947621183",29,0.758929523,0

Blue whale locations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean were obtained from catches (303239), sightings (4383 records of ‚â•8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries (95), and acoustic recordings. 2. Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14676 days with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales (65.2%) or pairs (24.6%); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest in the waters of Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar. 3. Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering. 4. Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic ('true') subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic. 5. Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales. 6. South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and highsighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics, acoustics and length frequencies. 7. Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95% Bayesian interval 860-2900) in 1996 (less than 1% of original levels), but are increasing at 7.3% per annum (95% Bayesian interval 1.4-11.6%). The status of other populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue whales. ¬© 2007 The Authors.

Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km2) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with the autumn-winter krill fishery. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00227-013-2190-z","2-s2.0-84878173678",14,0.745451224,0
"2010","mammal_antarctic","Modelling predation by transient leopard seals for an ecosystem-based management of Southern Ocean fisheries","Correctly quantifying the impacts of rare apex marine predators is essential to ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, where harvesting must be sustainable for targeted species and their dependent predators. This requires modelling the uncertainty in such processes as predator life history, seasonal abundance and movement, size-based predation, energetic requirements, and prey vulnerability. We combined these uncertainties to evaluate the predatory impact of transient leopard seals on a community of mesopredators (seals and penguins) and their prey at South Georgia, and assess the implications for an ecosystem-based management. The mesopredators are highly dependent on Antarctic krill and icefish, which are targeted by regional fisheries. We used a state-space formulation to combine (1) a mark-recapture open-population model and individual identification data to assess seasonally variable leopard seal arrival and departure dates, numbers, and residency times; (2) a size-based bioenergetic model; and (3) a size-based prey choice model from a diet analysis. Our models indicated that prey choice and consumption reflected seasonal changes in leopard seal population size and structure, size-selective predation and prey vulnerability. A population of 104 (90-125) leopard seals, of which 64% were juveniles, consumed less than 2% of the Antarctic fur seal pup production of the area (50% of total ingested energy, IE), but ca. 12-16% of the local gentoo penguin population (20% IE). Antarctic krill (28% IE) were the only observed food of leopard seal pups and supplemented the diet of older individuals. Direct impacts on krill and fish were negligible, but the ""escapement"" due to leopard seal predation on fur seal pups and penguins could be significant for the mackerel icefish fishery at South Georgia. These results suggest that: (1) rare apex predators like leopard seals may control, and may depend on, populations of mesopredators dependent on prey species targeted by fisheries; and (2) predatory impacts and community control may vary throughout the predator's geographic range, and differ across ecosystems and management areas, depending on the seasonal abundance of the prey and the predator's dispersal movements. This understanding is important to integrate the predator needs as natural mortality of its prey in models to set prey catch limits for fisheries. Reliable estimates of the variability of these needs are essential for a precautionary interpretation in the context of an ecosystem-based management. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.03.020","2-s2.0-65149098909",24,0.736209327,0
"2114","mammal_antarctic","Satellite imagery can be used to detect variation in abundance of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Erebus Bay, Antarctica","The Weddell seal population in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, represents one of the best-studied marine mammal populations in the world, providing an ideal test for the efficacy of satellite imagery to inform about seal abundance and population trends. Using high-resolution (0. 6m) satellite imagery, we compared counts from imagery to ground counts of adult Weddell seals and determined temporal trends in Erebus Bay during November 2004-2006 and 2009, and December 2007. Seals were counted from QuickBird-2 and WorldView-1 images, and these counts were compared with ground counts at overlapping locations within Erebus Bay during the same time. Counts were compared across years and within individual haul-out locations. We counted a total of 1,000 adult Weddell seals from five images across all years (for a total of 21 satellite-to-ground count comparisons), approximately 72% of the total counted on the ground at overlapping locations. We accurately detected an increase in abundance during 2004-2009. There was a strong, positive correlation (r=0. 98, df=3, P<0. 003) between ground counts and counts derived from the imagery. The correlation between counts at individual haul-out locations was also strong (r=0. 80, df=19, P>0. 001). Detection rates ranged from 30 to 88%. Overall, our results showed the utility of high-resolution imagery to provide an accurate way to detect the presence and variation in abundance of Weddell seals. Our methods may be applied to other species in polar regions, such as walruses or polar bears, particularly in areas where little is known about population status. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00300-011-1023-0","2-s2.0-80053976566",8,0.730877465,1
"2210","mammal_antarctic","Population status, trends and a re-examination of the hypotheses explaining the recent declines of the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina","1. Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Vald√©s, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. ¬© 2005 Mammal Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2907.2005.00055.x","2-s2.0-13844250597",15,0.726245649,1
"2310","mammal_antarctic","First demographic insights on historically harvested and poorly known male sperm whale populations off the Crozet and Kerguelen Islands (Southern Ocean)","Age and sex dependent spatial segregation has resulted in limited knowledge of the ecology and demography of sperm whale adult males feeding seasonally in high latitudes. This study focused on adult males interacting with the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery operating off the Kerguelen and Crozet Archipelagos. Demographic parameters were estimated using a 10-yr-long photo-identification data set paired with multistate closed robust design capture-mark-recapture models. The examination of a set of 29,078 photographs taken from fishing vessels during sperm whale depredation events resulted in identification of 295 individuals with nine visiting both study areas. Dispersal between both study regions was estimated to be 1% per year. The mean annual number of interacting sperm whales was estimated to n = 82 (95% CI 58‚Äì141) in Crozet and n = 106 (95% CI 76‚Äì174) in Kerguelen. Transient proportions were 13% in Crozet and 26% in Kerguelen. Corrected for transience, apparent survival estimates were 0.953 (95% CI 0.890‚Äì0.993) in Crozet, and 0.911 (95% CI 0.804‚Äì0.986) in Kerguelen. These survival and population size estimates are the first for depredating adult males in high latitudes, and can be used in evaluating the current conservation status of this historically harvested stock and to investigate depredation trends in 35 both Crozet and Kerguelen Islands. ¬© 2018 Society for Marine Mammalogy","10.1111/mms.12469","2-s2.0-85046720983",11,0.724488433,1
"2410","mammal_antarctic","Penguins, fur seals, and fishing: Prey requirements and potential competition in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica","Antarctic and sub-Antarctic seabirds, marine mammals, and human fisheries concentrate their foraging efforts on a single species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Because these predators may have a significant effect on krill abundance, we estimated the energy and prey requirements of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins and female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica and compared these estimates with catch statistics from the Antarctic krill fishery. Published data on field metabolic rate, population size, diet, prey energy content, and metabolic efficiency were used to estimate prey requirements of these breeding, adult, land-based predators and their dependent offspring. Due to their large population size, chinstrap penguins were the most significant krill predators during the period examined, consuming an estimated 7.8 x 108 kg krill, followed by Adelie penguins (3.1 x 107 kg), gentoo penguins (1.2 x 107 kg), and Antarctic fur seals (3.6 x 106 kg). Total consumption of all land-based predators on the South Shetland Islands was estimated at 8.3 x 108 kg krill. The commercial krill fishery harvest in the South Shetland Island region (1.0 x 108 kg) was approximately 12% of this. Commercial harvest coincides seasonally and spatially with peak penguin and fur seal prey demands, and may affect prey availability to penguins and fur seals. This differs from the conclusions of Ichii et al. who asserted that the potential for competition between South Shetland predators and the commercial krill fishery is low.","10.1007/s003000050261","2-s2.0-0031841939",45,0.724343624,0
"278","mammal_antarctic","New Zealand king shag (Leucocarbo carunculatus) foraging distribution and use of mussel farms in Admiralty Bay, Marlborough Sounds","To date there has been no published information describing the relative abundance, behaviour or distribution of the New Zealand king shag (Leucocarbo carunculatus) within mussel farm areas, despite the sensitivity of the species to human disturbance and the potential overlap of its range with proposed development of marine aquaculture. Four survey methods were employed as part of a multi-species research programme to develop methods for surveying marine mammals and seabird populations in aquaculture management areas. Two of the techniques, involving continuous timelapse photography of mussel farms and boat-based surveys through coastal farms were developed for this study. Timelapse cameras showed that mussel farms buoys were used by king shags as temporary resting sites only. King shags were recorded on 36% of the farms (n = 44) from 13 surveys within inner Admiralty Bay. The low number of sightings within mussel farms suggests that farms are not important foraging or resting areas for king shags, at least in Admiralty Bay. The foraging range and density of king shags was not known before farms were developed, so no direct comparison or impact assessment can be made. Boat-based surveys were used to estimate the density of foraging shags, which showed that daily locations of foraging birds at sea can vary considerably on consecutive days and over the season. Previous environmental surveys to assess impacts of mussel farms on foraging areas are therefore unlikely to adequately represent the entire foraging range or most important feeding areas. The number of breeding pairs, chicks and nests was also found to vary considerably at colonies, dependent on when counts were undertaken during their protracted breeding season. Open water mid-bay aquaculture (shellfish and finfish) potentially poses a greater threat to king shags than 'coastal ribbon development', in terms of loss of open water habitat from farm structures, and loss of foraging habitat through modification to the water column (e.g., turbidity) and seabed. Given the lack of knowledge about the king shag population dynamics, diet and prey availability, there is an urgent requirement for more research to fill these gaps and also understand how we can conserve important shag feeding areas and associated marine environment through sustainable management of aquaculture. ¬© The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.",NA,"2-s2.0-84875418658",18,0.696126615,0
"3112","mammal_antarctic","The zooplankton of Marguerite Bay, Western Antarctic Peninsula-Part I: Abundance, distribution, and population response to variability in environmental conditions","The zooplankton community of Marguerite Bay was studied during austral fall of 2001 and 2002 using net and concurrent environmental data. Interannual differences were observed in zooplankton species composition, developmental stages, and abundances, which were linked to unusually high chlorophyll concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay during spring-summer 2000/2001. Copepod abundance was significantly higher in 2001 than in 2002 (46.3 and 28.3indm-3 in 2001 and 2002, respectively). During 2001, the copepod community was dominated by two species. Calanoides acutus, a herbivore, and Metridia gerlachei, an omnivore, accounted for 46% and 45% of the community, respectively. During 2002, however, several species were relatively abundant, including M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. acutus, Oithona spp., and Paraeuchaeta spp. Euphausiids also showed a rapid population response to high chlorophyll levels in 2001. Even though average total euphausiid (juvenile/adult) abundances were similar during both years (0.20 and 0.15indm-3 for 2001 and 2002, respectively), species composition showed marked interannual differences due to varying life history strategies among species. Thysanoessa macrura, which has a relatively rapid development from larval to juvenile stages between spring and fall of the same year, was the most abundant euphausiid in 2001. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba juvenile/adult populations increased in 2002, owing to a slower development in which larval stages overwinter and recruit to juveniles during the following spring/summer. Other zooplankton groups those were abundant in Marguerite Bay, but showed little variability between years, included ostracods, pteropods, chaetognaths, medusae, amphipods, and mysids. Summer phytoplankton concentrations strongly influenced copepods and euphausiids; however, there were no clear associations between zooplankton distributions and fall environmental conditions (i.e., pigment concentrations and surface salinity) or bottom depth. It is notable that ostracods and pteropods had the highest abundances of non-copepod zooplankton. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.12.007","2-s2.0-79957990658",1,0.67721474,0
"361","mammal_antarctic","The impact of predation by marine mammals on Patagonian toothfish longline fisheries","Predatory interaction of marine mammals with longline fisheries is observed globally, leading to partial or complete loss of the catch and in some parts of the world to considerable financial loss. Depredation can also create additional unrecorded fishing mortality of a stock and has the potential to introduce bias to stock assessments. Here we aim to characterise depredation in the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery around South Georgia focusing on the spatio-temporal component of these interactions. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and orcas (Orcinus orca ) frequently feed on fish hooked on longlines around South Georgia. A third of longlines encounter sperm whales, but loss of catch due to sperm whales is insignificant when compared to that due to orcas, which interact with only 5% of longlines but can take more than half of the catch in some cases. Orca depredation around South Georgia is spatially limited and focused in areas of putative migration routes, and the impact is compounded as a result of the fishery also concentrating in those areas at those times. Understanding the seasonal behaviour of orcas and the spatial and temporal distribution of ""depredation hot spots"" can reduce marine mammal interactions, will improve assessment and management of the stock and contribute to increased operational efficiency of the fishery. Such information is valuable in the effort to resolve the human-mammal conflict for resources. ¬© 2015 S√∂ffker et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0118113","2-s2.0-84928966778",20,0.628680309,0
"386","mammal_antarctic","Spatio-temporal persistence of top predator hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula","We quantified species richness and abundance of seabirds and marine mammals in order to identify marine areas that are persistently attractive to top predators. Shipboard surveys across a 150 000 km2 grid off the Antarctic Peninsula were conducted once or twice each year from 2003 to 2011 during which the distribution and abundance of top predators were mapped. We hypothesized that spatial organization of species richness and abundance hotspots reflect persistent habitat use and are regionalized according to distance from land and oceanographic boundaries. To test this, we used a new hotspot variance metric based on the percentage of time that the species richness or abundance estimate at any one location is greater than 1 standard deviation above the long term means for the entire survey grid. Species richness hotspots were based on all species sighted, while abundance hotspots were based on concentrations of 16 species: 13 seabirds (penguins, petrels and albatrosses), 1 pinniped and 2 baleen whales. Species abundance hotspots reflected 2 major groupings-those with oceanic and coastal origins. We identified 15 richness hotspots, 9 of which were in proximity to the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front; the 6 others were associated with major breeding colonies and the location of 2 submarine canyon systems. Our approach integrates temporal and spatial variances over 14 individual surveys and provides useful reference points for identifying ecologically important areas, refining food web models and developing spatial management of and conservation strategies for marine ecosystems. ¬© Inter-Research 2013.","10.3354/meps10350","2-s2.0-84881067357",22,0.620112223,1

Measurement of the perpendicular distance of seal groups from the ship with an electronic inclinometer fitted to a rifle stock was unbiased. Crabeater seals showed little movement in response to the approaching ship. Movement away from the ship by seals close to the ship's track was partially responsible for a relative lack of sightings close to the transect-line, but otherwise had little effect on the sighting histogram. Minor deviations from the transect direction to avoid running over seals violated the assumption of uniform distribution of groups, and contributed to a relative lack in sightings close to (<40 m) the transect-line. We estimate that 5%-10% of seal groups close to the transect-line were not sighted by bridge observers prior to passing abeam of the ship, but most of these missed groups were likely to have been sighted some distance behind-abeam. Shipboard transects provided a biased sample of four environmental features known to be related to crabeater seal abundance because of logistical difficulties in the ship traversing along straight transects through thick ice. Calculation of transect length L from successive GPS locations was mildly sensitive to the frequency of locations. We provide analytical recommendations to reduce or eliminate the effect of assumption violation when present and hence minimize bias in abundance estimation.","10.1111/j.1748-7692.2004.tb01182.x","2-s2.0-3943082808",6,0.579635476,0
"453","mammal_antarctic","Climatically driven fluctuations in Southern Ocean ecosystems","Determining how climate fluctuations affect ocean ecosystems requires an understanding of how biological and physical processes interact across a wide range of scales. Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of 1¬∞C over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century. ¬© 2007 The Royal Society.","10.1098/rspb.2007.1180","2-s2.0-36849007105",21,0.568473559,0
"462","mammal_antarctic","Contrasted structuring effects of mesoscale features on the seabird community in the Mozambique Channel","The Mozambique Channel (western Indian Ocean) is a dynamic environment characterised by strong mesoscale features, which influence all biological components of the pelagic ecosystem. We investigated the distribution, abundance and feeding behaviour of seabirds in the Mozambique Channel in relation to physical and biological environmental variables, with a specific interest in mesoscale features. Seabird censuses were conducted in summer and winter during 7 cruises in the southern and northern Mozambique Channel. Tropical species accounted for 49% of the 37 species identified and 97% of the individuals, and species from the sub-Antarctic region constituted 30% of the identifications. The typically tropical sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscata) was the dominant species during all cruises, and overall accounted for 74% of the species observations and 85% of counted birds. Outputs of Generalised Linear Models at the scale of the Mozambique Channel suggested that higher densities of flying and feeding birds occurred in areas with lower sea surface temperatures and lower surface chlorophyll a concentrations. Most of the flocks of feeding birds did not associate with surface schools of fish or marine mammals, but when they did, these flocks were larger, especially when associated with tuna. While tropical species seemed to favour cyclonic eddies, frontal and divergence zones, non-tropical species were more frequently recorded over shelf waters. Sooty terns foraged preferentially in cyclonic eddies where zooplankton, micronekton and tuna schools were abundant. Among other major tropical species, frigatebirds (Fregata spp.) predominated in frontal zones between eddies, where tuna schools also frequently occurred and where geostrophic currents were the strongest. Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) concentrated in divergence zones characterised by low sea level anomalies, low geostrophic currents, and high zooplankton biomass close to the surface. Our results highlight the importance of mescoscale features in structuring the tropical seabird community in the Mozambique Channel, in addition to segregating tropical and non-tropical species. The mechanisms underlying the segregation of tropical seabirds seem to partially differ from that of other tropical regions, and this may be a consequence of the strong local mesoscale activity, affecting prey size and availability schemes. Beyond characterising the foraging habitats of the seabird community of the Mozambique Channel, this study highlights the importance of this region as a hot spot for seabirds; especially the southern part, where several endangered sub-Antarctic species over-winter. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.10.027","2-s2.0-84897612658",19,0.566237441,0

Using data from a shipboard survey during August 2012, I test the hypothesis that relative abundance of seabird and marine mammals reflects environmental variability associated with the dynamic pack ice zone. Using environmental data and observations of sea ice concentration, I quantified an environmental gradient that describes the spatial organization of the dynamic pack ice zone. The relationship of top predators to this environmental gradient revealed three important aspects: (1) an open water and pack ice community is present with some top predator species exhibiting higher abundance associated with moderate sea ice concentration (40‚Äì60¬†%) as opposed to the pack ice edge (10¬†%), (2) Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were the most abundant pinniped and they were observed resting on ice floes and foraging within leads and polynyas, and (3) for the most abundant species, spatial regression models indicate that latitude and sea ice concentration (a principal north/south gradient) are the most important environmental determinants.

Three shipboard surveys were conducted (February 2005-2007), and an echosounder was used to measure the distribution and abundance of krill while simultaneously conducting visual surveys to map seabird and marine mammals. Using a multispecies approach, we test the hypothesis that spatial organization of krill and top predators co-vary according to fine-scale changes in bathymetry in the nearshore marine environment. GAMs are used to examine the effect of sea depth, slope and distance to isobaths on the spatial distribution and abundance of krill and predators. Spatial distribution patterns of krill and predators relate to fine-scale (1-10 km) changes in bathymetry and exhibit cross-shelf gradients in abundance. Krill were concentrated along the shelf-break and abundant within both submarine canyons. Predators exhibited different preferences for locations within the submarine canyon system that relates to their foraging behavior. Penguins concentrated closer to shore and within the head of the east submarine canyon immediately adjacent to a breeding colony. Whales were also concentrated over the head of the east canyon (overlapping with penguins), whereas albatrosses and fur seals were concentrated in the west canyon. Fur seals also showed preference for steep slopes and were concentrated along the shelf-break. Petrels exhibited peaks in abundance throughout both submarine canyons. Owing to their orientation, size and proximity to the coastline, submarine canyons provide important habitat heterogeneity for krill and a variety of predators. This study highlights the multispecies approach for studying spatial ecology of top predators and krill and has implications for marine spatial management of the Scotia Sea. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s00227-011-1753-0","2-s2.0-80255132115",17,0.540603843,1
"150","mammal_australasia","Pests controlling pests: Does predator control lead to greater European rabbit abundance in Australasia?","In New Zealand and Australia, rural landowners believe that local predator control to protect indigenous biota exacerbates European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus problems on their land. We assess the validity of their concerns by reviewing the published literature on effects of predators on rabbit abundance. In New Zealand, where rabbits and their predators are introduced, predators appear to have relatively little effect on rabbit numbers compared with other factors leading to mortality, such as disease, flooding of burrows and burrow collapse. Similarly, in Australia, rabbit numbers are driven primarily by climate and its effects on food abundance and quality, and by disease. However, where rabbit numbers are low following drought or major epizootics, predation can limit population recovery. In the Iberian Peninsula, where rabbits and their predators are indigenous, the effects of predators are unknown, as they are often confounded by other factors. Rabbit numbers are influenced mostly by habitat, food, disease and rainfall. Elsewhere in Europe, predators have their strongest effect when rabbit numbers have been reduced by other factors, but have little effect on high-density rabbit populations. In Australasia, abundance of predators (especially rabbit specialists) can usually be predicted from rabbit abundance, not vice versa. Although predation effects can be limiting under certain conditions, they are minor compared to the roles of climate, food, disease and habitat. A key unresolved question is whether those circumstances where predator control might lead to increases in rabbit populations can be identified with enough certainty to allow reliable predictions to be generated. One approach is to implement robust rabbit, predator and disease monitoring programmes at sites with predator control operations. Data on changes in rabbits, predators, and disease prevalence could be combined with local data on other key factors to facilitate reasonable inference about effects of predators on rabbits. The inclusion of carefully matched non-treatment areas is crucial if such programmes are to succeed. ¬© 2015 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","10.1111/mam.12034","2-s2.0-84925303222",1,0.551293457,1
"240","mammal_australasia","Influence of contrasting urban edges on the abundance of arboreal mammals: A study of squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) in southeast Queensland, Australia","The primary impacts of urban development on biodiversity are loss and fragmentation of habitat, and changes in the structure, composition and function of remnant native ecosystems. Forest dependent species, including arboreal mammals, are particularly sensitive to these changes due to their highly specific habitat requirements and inability or reluctance to cross the urban matrix. We addressed this problem using a case study of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in fragmented urban landscapes of southeast Queensland, Australia. We applied a mixed effect modeling approach clustered by patch to quantify the importance of site-level habitat factors relative to edge contrast and habitat patch size on squirrel glider abundance. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in glider age and sex in interior habitats compared to road and residential edges. We found that edge contrast had a strong negative effect on the abundance of squirrel gliders but is conditional on the presence of a low numbers of unreliable flowering overstorey trees and the availability of critical resources such as nest hollows at a site. We also found that older male gliders prefer forest fragment interiors over road and residential edge habitats. We conclude that although interior habitats are ideal to maintain large stable populations, the conservation value of low contrast edges containing key site-level resources should not be underestimated for arboreal mammals such as the squirrel glider. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"325","mammal_australasia","Underestimated and severe: Small mammal decline from the forests of south-eastern Australia since European settlement, as revealed by a top-order predator","In Australia, numerous small mammal species have suffered extinction or severe declines in distribution and abundance following European settlement. The extent of these declines from forested areas of south-eastern Australia, however, remains poorly understood. In this paper we use sub-fossil deposits of the sooty owl (Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa) as a tool for understanding the diversity of the small mammal palaeocommunity. These results are compared to the contemporary sooty owl diet from the same geographical region to investigate the degree of small mammal decline following European settlement. Of 28 mammal species detected in sub-fossil deposits and considered prey items of the sooty owl at the time of European settlement, only 10 species were detected in the contemporary sooty owl diet. Numerous small mammal species have not only recently suffered severe declines in distribution and abundance but have also recently undergone niche contraction, as they occupied a greater diversity of regions and habitats at the time of European settlement. For some species our understanding of their true ecological niche and ecological potential is therefore limited. The species that underwent the greatest declines occupied open habitat types or were terrestrial. The severity of decline is also likely to have resulted in severe disruption of ecosystem functions, with wide scale ecosystem consequences. There is an urgent need to improve small mammal conservation, to maintain crucial ecosystem functions performed by small mammals. It is recommended that broad-scale exotic predator control programs are conducted which may also provide suitable conditions for the re-introduction of locally extinct species. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The arrival of Polynesians in 13th C heralded the end of this era, with the introduction of kiore, (Rattus exulans, or Pacific rat), which had far-reaching effects on plant regeneration, survival of small ground vertebrates, larger invertebrates, and seabird breeding colonies. This paper reviews the evidence available from raptor nest sites and Quaternary beetle fossils to summarise extinctions thought to be caused by kiore in New Zealand. It also utilises invertebrate comparisons between islands with and without rats, or where rats have been eradicated, in order to document the impacts of rats (R. exulans, R. norvegicus) on invertebrate abundance, body mass, and the behavioural responses of some large New Zealand insects to the presence of rats. The role of a 'mammal-free' evolutionary history is discussed. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","10.1007/s10530-008-9408-x","2-s2.0-70350633718",4,0.539029417,0
"516","mammal_australasia","Evidence that dingoes limit abundance of a mesopredator in eastern Australian forests","1. Aggressive behaviour of top predators may have strong effects on the distribution and abundance of mesopredator species. Such interactions between predator species can reduce the intensity of predation on vulnerable prey. Suppression of mesopredators by top predators is a potentially important process that could protect small prey species from unsustainable predation. 2. There is some evidence that in Australia, the dingo Canis lupus suppresses populations of the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This interaction could be significant to biodiversity conservation because while dingoes have been in Australia for several thousand years and coexist with a wide range of small mammals, the fox is a recent arrival which has caused declines and extinctions, and continues to threaten many prey species. 3. However the strength of the effect of dingoes on foxes is unclear, and some published data have been interpreted as demonstrating no relationship between abundance of the two species. These data come from forested habitats in eastern Australia, and may suggest that negative relationships of dingoes and foxes do not occur in complex habitats. 4. We re-analyse published data on fox vs. wild dog (i.e. dingoes plus, potentially, feral dogs and hybrids) abundance in eastern forests. These data reveal a triangular relationship of fox to wild dog density: when wild dogs are abundant, foxes are consistently rare, while when wild dogs are rare, foxes may be abundant but are not always so. This suggests that the abundance of wild dogs sets an upper limit on the abundance of foxes, but does not fully determine fox abundance. 5. Standard regression and correlation methods are not appropriate for analysing such triangular relationships. We apply two statistical methods that can be used to characterize the edges of data distributions, and use these to demonstrate a negative relationship of maximum fox abundance to the abundance of wild dogs. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis adds to evidence that dingoes may have negative effects on red foxes in a wide range of habitats, and therefore, that dingoes may be significant to conservation of mammal biodiversity in Australia. It also illustrates problems and solutions in the statistical analysis of abundance of one species as a function of the abundance of another species with which it has a strong interaction. ¬© 2008 British Ecological Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01650.x","2-s2.0-65349126035",5,0.673253808,1
"615","mammal_australasia","Invasion by Rattus rattus into native coastal forests of south-eastern Australia: Are native small mammals at risk?","The black rat, Rattus rattus, is an alien rodent in Australian ecosystems where niche overlap with native small mammals may lead to competition for resources and displacement of native species. In coastal habitats surrounding Jervis Bay in south-eastern Australia, R. rattus co-occurs with the native bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, and brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii. Relative distributions and abundances, and fine-scale space use suggest invasive and native rodents compete for use of space and habitat. Such competitive interactions were not evident between R. rattus and native A. stuartii, which was negatively influenced more by disturbance to habitat. Differences in rodent communities between spatially separate forests forming the northern and southern peninsulas of Jervis Bay potentially reflect symmetrical competition and differences in competitive outcomes. In southern forests, R. rattus was largely restricted to patches of disturbed forest associated with campgrounds. Competitive interference by native rodent populations inhabiting surrounding intact forests may have so far limited R. rattus colonization of these areas. In northern forests, R. rattus was the predominant rodent irrespective of disturbance, while populations of R. fuscipes were unusually low seemingly due to poor juvenile recruitment. Native individuals avoided areas frequented by adult R. rattus and given that species did not partition use of microhabitats, R. rattus most likely precluded R. fuscipes from suitable habitat and in doing so limited native populations. We discuss how natural disturbance of habitat and human activity have potentially facilitated successful invasion by R. rattus of the northern forests. Studies that manipulate rodent populations are required to support these interpretations of observed patterns. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01941.x","2-s2.0-66249129388",6,0.61742874,0

Eleven mammal and 14 bird species were recorded, but Australian possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) predominated, and pukekos (Porphyrio porphyrio), mynas (Acridotheres tristis), and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibiceri) were the most common birds. Counts of possums, hedgehogs and rabbits ranged between 0.7 and 89 corpses/100 km, and changed dramatically over six decades. The possum count rose 80% between 1984 and 1994, but declined 60% by 2005. A possible irruption of hedgehogs is reported in 1988-89, followed by an 82% decline in their numbers between 1994 and 2005. Although rabbit hemorrhagic disease was introduced to New Zealand in 1997,rabbit road-kill increased 59% between 1994 and 2005. The relationship between road-kill and traffic volume indicates that roads carrying more than 3000 vehicles per day act as barriers to larger mammals, while vehicles on less busy roads are more dangerous for crossing animals. We suggest that regular counts taken at annual intervals over the same roads is a useful method for gathering information about the changing distribution and relative abundance of certain animals on a provincial or national scale and over long periods of time. Regular counts at seasonal, monthly or weekly intervals are also a rich source of information. ¬© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.","10.1080/03014220909510147","2-s2.0-70249097744",7,0.740304997,0
"813","mammal_australasia","The impact of fox control on the relative abundance of forest mammals in East Gippsland, Victoria","Predation by European red foxes is believed to be the major cause of the extinction and decline of a large number of native medium-sized terrestrial mammals in Australia. We examined the impact of poisoning of foxes on the relative abundance of a group of medium-sized mammals in an experiment conducted in three large forest blocks in south-eastern Australia. The blocks consisted of paired sites, as follows: one site where poison baiting was used to control foxes (treatment site) and one where foxes were not controlled (non-treatment site). At all six sites, the population responses of a range of mammals were measured, and compared between treatment and non-treatment sites. The relative fox abundance, as indexed by bait-take, declined during the course of the study at treatment sites and to a lesser extent at non-treatment sites. The decline in bait-take at non-treatment sites was most likely due to treatment sites acting as ecological traps, so that reduced intra-specific competition attracted foxes from non-treatment to treatment sites, where they were subsequently poisoned. There was a significant treatment effect for the abundances of total mammals, long-nosed potoroos, southern brown bandicoots and common brushtail possums, with higher abundances at treatment sites than at non-treatment sites. Common ringtail possums increased in abundance during the course of the study, with no significant difference between treatment and non-treatment sites. There was no significant effect of time or treatment on the abundance of long-nosed bandicoots. The increase in the abundance of native mammals at treatment sites was most likely due to a lower predation pressure by foxes brought about by fox control, and the smaller increase in abundance in non-treatment blocks was likely due to the ecological-trap effect because of fox baiting at treatment sites. The present study demonstrated that broad-scale fox control can lead to increases in the abundance of native mammals in forested habitats, without recourse to aerial baiting or fences. The study also demonstrated that the influence of fox control on the fox abundance can extend well beyond the perimeter of the area baited. ¬© 2009 CSIRO.","10.1071/WR08135","2-s2.0-65249129041",8,0.677840327,1
"911","mammal_australasia","Arid Recovery - A comparison of reptile and small mammal populations inside and outside a large rabbit, cat and fox-proof exclosure in arid South Australia","Australian arid zone mammal species within the Critical Weight Range (CWR) of 35 g-5.5 kg have suffered disproportionately in the global epidemic of contemporary faunal extinctions. CWR extinctions have been attributed largely to the effects of introduced or invasive mammals; however, the impact of these threatening processes on smaller mammals and reptiles is less clear. The change in small mammal and reptile assemblages after the removal of rabbits, cats and foxes was studied over a 6-year period in a landscape-scale exclosure in the Australian arid zone. Rodents, particularly Notomys alexis and Pseudomys bolami, increased to 15 times higher inside the feral-proof Arid Recovery Reserve compared with outside sites, where rabbits, cats and foxes were still present. Predation by cats was thought to exert the greatest influence on rodent numbers owing to the maintenance of the disparity in rodent responses through dry years and the differences in dietary preferences between rabbits and P. bolami. The presence of introduced Mus domesticus or medium-sized re-introduced mammal species did not significantly affect resident small mammal or reptile abundance. Abundance of most dasyurids and small lizards did not change significantly after the removal of feral animals although reductions in gecko populations inside the reserve may be attributable to second order trophic interactions or subtle changes in vegetation structure and cover. This study suggests that populations of rodent species in northern South Australia below the CWR may also be significantly affected by introduced cats, foxes and/or rabbits and that a taxa specific model of Australian mammal decline may be more accurate than one based on body weight. ¬© 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01916.x","2-s2.0-62749108425",9,0.727372184,1

Long-term patterns in an era of climate change","This paper reports a study of ground-dwelling, small mammals in coastal eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia from 1970 through 2005. During this time, the study area burnt in an intense fire in December 1972 and was partially burnt in November 1980. Both fires were associated with prolonged drought. The mammals studied comprised two dasyurid marsupials, Antechinus agilis and A. swainsonii, two native murid rodents, Rattus fuscipes and R. lutreolus, and the introduced house mouse Mus musculus. After intensive sampling throughout the year from 1970 through 1972 to establish basic ecological and population parameters of the small mammal community, populations were sampled annually during late autumn and early winter before the onset of breeding. There were marked differences in the annual (autumn/winter) abundances of all species; numbers of A. agilis ranged from 4 to 142 individuals; A. swainsonii 0 to 43; R. fuscipes 4 to 54; R. lutreolus 0 to 11; M. musculus 0 to 23. Following the 1972 fire, numbers fell to the lowest level recorded during the study and each population subsequently disappeared from the plot between the 1973 and 1974 winter censuses. The less intense 1980 fire did not lead to extirpation, but numbers of A. agilis, A. swainsonii and R. fuscipes declined as drought conditions persisted through 1983. R. lutreolus occurred consistently only following the fires, when a grassy ground vegetation favoured by this species developed. Similarly, M. musculus colonised within two years of the fires and persisted on the plot for 3-4 years before disappearing. Following the fires, populations of the omnivorous R. fuscipes recovered first followed by the scansorial, insectivorous A. agilis and last by the fossorial, insectivorous A. swainsonii. Two primary conclusions emerged from this study. First, the intense fire of 1972 did not kill all the animals immediately, but led to the disappearance of each species from the plot over 18 months. Thus, intense fire had a delayed but catastrophic impact on small ground-dwelling mammals. The fluctuations in population levels, covering more than an order of magnitude, demonstrate that factors other than fire, such as rainfall and drought, drive the population dynamics of these small mammals. As stability and recovery are not features of local populations, long-term studies of benchmark populations are necessary to manage forest biodiversity. ¬© CSIRO 2009.","10.1071/WR08086","2-s2.0-60749084174",10,0.778838719,1

These habitats may also sustain populations of introduced mammalian pests, although relatively little is known about the composition or distributions of these species in urban environments. We made a preliminary survey of the distribution and relative abundance of pest mammals across three urban habitat types (gully, amenity park, residential) in Hamilton, New Zealand. Tracking tunnel and WaxTag¬Æ surveys showed that: (1) rats (Rattus rattus or R. norvegicus), mice (Mus musculus) and brushtail possums (Tricho‚Äêsurus vulpecula) were detected most often and in highest abundances in gullies, were relatively rare in amenity parks, and were not detected in residential areas; (2) hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were regularly detected in all habitats; and (3) mustelids were not detected in any habitat. Live trapping in areas where rats were detected captured 21 rats, of which 19 were R. rattus. Scat and animal sign surveys found evidence of lagomorphs in amenity parks and gullies but not in residential areas. Cats (Felis catus) were detected in all habitats. These data suggest that important mammalian pests other than cats are either absent (mustelids) or comparatively rare (rats) in urban Hamilton and largely confined to gully habitats. Further research is needed to determine whether detection probabilities of target species vary significantly between the species and habitats we sampled, and to quantify the impact that mammalian pests might have in limiting populations of other animals, especially avifauna. ¬© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2009.","10.1080/03014220909510136","2-s2.0-66149100595",11,0.646581346,0

Common dolphins are gregarious animals with high vagility and are expected to display limited genetic differentiation over large spatial scales. Here, we investigate population genetic structure of southern Australian common dolphins using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and seven microsatellite markers. We found unexpected levels of genetic differentiation for short-beaked common dolphins over a distance of ‚àº1500 km. Although no genetic structure was observed in common dolphins along the coast of SA, we detected marked differentiation between dolphins from SA and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting a minimum of two genetic populations in southern Australia. We hypothesize that the ephemeral distribution of small pelagic fish enhances movement and dispersal between dolphin groups at a local level. However, clear differences in water temperature, habitat features and fish abundance between SA and Tasmania may contribute to the contemporary isolation observed between dolphin populations. Our findings have important consequences for developing conservation management strategies, because SA has the largest purse-seine fishery by weight in Australia, and substantial numbers of fatal common dolphin interactions have occurred. In 2004/2005 alone, an estimated 1728 common dolphins were encircled and 377 died over a 7-month period. If these impacts lead to a reduction in population size, it is unlikely that dolphins from the adjacent south-eastern Tasmanian population will replace the lost individuals. Recommendations for assessing the impacts of the fishery are presented. The information herein may also have implications for fisheries-marine mammal interactions in coastal and neritic habitats in other areas of the world. Moreover, we demonstrate that a species commonly thought to be wide ranging can show an unexpected degree of genetic differentiation. ¬© Journal compilation ¬© 2008 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00213.x","2-s2.0-58049092708",12,0.63289453,0

To determine the cause of this spatial variation in impact I investigated the abundance and condition (crown dieback and extent of possum browse cover) of two mistletoes (Alepis flavida, Peraxilla tetrapetala) and abundance and diet of possums in two mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forests in the central-eastern South Island of New Zealand. Mistletoe is common and there are long-established uncontrolled possum populations in both forests. Mistletoes were abundant (216-1359 per hectare) and important in possum diet (41-59% of total diet), but possum density was low (c. 2 per hectare) in both areas. Possum impacts were slight with low browse frequencies and intensities over much of the study sites. However, impacts were significantly greater at a forest margin, where possum abundance was highest, and at a high-altitude site where mistletoe density was lowest. Mistletoe crown dieback was inversely proportional to intensity of possum browsing. These results suggest that the persistence of abundant mistletoe populations at these sites is due to mistletoe productivity matching or exceeding consumption by possums in these forests of low possum-carrying capacity, rather than low possum preference for the local mistletoe populations. ¬© New Zealand Ecological Society.",NA,"2-s2.0-58149171746",13,0.630228114,0

An endemic of arid/semi-arid Australia, the kite is sympatric with the barn owl, Tyto alba, throughout most of its range. Although the letter-winged kite is nocturnal, it seems to possess intermediate degrees of adaptation for nocturnal hunting, whereas the barn owl is specialized for nocturnal activity. We studied sympatric populations of both species during a rodent population outbreak in the north-west Simpson Desert to understand how their different nocturnal adaptations influenced diet and prey selection. The commonest rodents, in order of abundance, were Pseudomys australis (body mass: 40-75 g), P. hermannsburgensis (9-17 g), and Notomys alexis (27-45 g). Rodents dominated the diets of kites (96% of 225 prey items) and owls (98% of 303 prey items). Dietary niche breadth was relatively low for both kites (BA=0.16) and owls (BA=0.13), whereas niche overlap was extremely high (O=0.98). Barn owls exhibited greater prey choice, specifically; they selected the larger P. australis and avoided the small P. hermannsburgensis, whereas kites captured Pseudomys species in proportion to their availability. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore examined the effects of a typical road in an and ecosystem on kangaroo populations and communities, threatened small mammal species (Sminthopsis macroura and Leggadina forresti), and small mammal and lizard communities over two years. We determined which vertebrate populations and communities were negatively affected by the road, thereby informing management priorities for mitigating road effects. The study was conducted along the Silver City Highway on the UNSW Arid Zone Research Station, Fowlers Gap, in north-western New South Wales. We found that the road influenced the spatial distribution of kangaroos relative to the road, particularly those of Macropus rufus, and was associated with increased kangaroo mortality. Further, the road altered the composition of small mammal and lizard communities and reduced the abundance of S. macroura. However, roadkill of kangaroos did not significantly affect the population demographics or community composition of kangaroos. There were no changes in sex ratios (female dominance) which would threaten the sustainability of S. macroura and L. forresti populations near the road. Further, changes in the species composition of small mammal and lizard communities were likely to be localised near the road, rather than altered at larger scales, because the differences in resource availability driving community differences were restricted to a narrow band immediately adjacent to the road. Thus, none of the vertebrate taxa studied were significantly threatened by the presence of the road and its associated vehicle traffic. Even so, we recommend that management efforts focus on reducing the frequency of kangaroo roadkill (the most serious animal and human welfare issue) through encouraging the growth of shrubs and low vegetation unpalatable to kangaroos adjacent to arid-zone roads. Such a management strategy could also have positive flow-on effects for other vertebrate taxa, and could restore the natural integrity of and landscapes near roads.",NA,"2-s2.0-58149284188",15,0.542398754,1

In Tasmania, this impact is perceived as relatively greater than in other Australian states, and is often noted by visitors and locals alike, such that calls for management action are common in the popular press. The goal of this three-year study was to assess the frequency and distribution of species killed on Tasmanian roads. Seasonal surveys were completed along five major routes, for a total of 154 trips. Over 15000km of road were surveyed and 5691 individuals in 54 taxa were recorded for an average roadkill density of 0.372km-1. Over 50% of encountered roadkill could be identified to species, with common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) the most common species identified, both in overall numbers and frequency of trips encountered. The 10 most common taxa accounted for 99% of the items observed. The seasonal occurrence, relationship with vehicle speed, and clustering in local hotspots for particular taxa all suggest that mitigation measures, such as vehicle speed reduction in specific areas, may be effective in reducing the number of animals killed. Mitigation measures, however, will not apply equally to all species and, in particular, success will depend on changing human behaviours. ¬© CSIRO 2008.","10.1071/WR08067","2-s2.0-56649114487",16,0.643521719,0

An initial observer program revealed high rates of encirclement and mortality (1.78 and 0.39 dolphins per net-set, respectively) of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). This equated to an estimate of 1728 encirclements and 377 mortalities across the entire fleet over the same period. The average time taken for fishers to respond to encirclements was 135.93 ¬± 3.72 min and 21.3% of encircled animals subsequently died. During that time, fishers only reported 3.6% of encirclements and 1.9% of mortalities recorded by observers. A code of practice (CoP) was subsequently introduced aimed at mitigating operational interactions. A second observer program revealed a significant reductions in the observed rates of dolphin encirclement (0.22; down 87.3%) and mortality (0.01; down 97.1%) with an estimate of 169 and eight, respectively. The average time taken for fishers to respond to dolphin encirclements also reduced to 16.33 ¬± 4.67 min (down 76.9%) and the proportion of encircled animals that subsequently died reduced to 5.0%. Agreement between industry reports and observer records improved, with the fishery reporting 57.9% and 58.9% of the rate of encirclements and mortalities, respectively, recorded by observers. A number of avoidance and release strategies in the CoP may have been responsible for these improvements. In particular, fishers were required to delay or relocate their activities if dolphins were observed prior to fishing and to release encircled dolphins immediately or abort the fishing event if release procedures were unsuccessful. Future improvements to the CoP include: (i) improved response times when an encircled dolphin is detected; (ii) better use of behavioural cues for deciding when to abort a net-set; (iii) ceasing fishing during rough weather; and (iv) continuing to increase reporting accuracy by fishers. It is also recommended that the abundance, movements and boundaries of the common dolphin population in the region be determined, so that the impact of fishing activities on their status can be established.

Further changes were evident 20 years later. Mammal species richness fell significantly in fragments, and the abundances of 4 species, coppery brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula johnstoni), green ringtail possums (Pseudochirops archeri), red-legged pademelons (Thylogale stigmatica), and tree-kangaroos, declined significantly. The most surprising finding was that the lemuroid ringtail, a strict rainforest specialist, apparently recolonized one fragment, despite a 99.98% decrease in abundance in fragments and corridors. A combination of factors, including long-term fragmentation effects, shifts in the surrounding matrix vegetation, and recurring cyclone disturbances, appear to underlie these dynamic changes in mammal assemblages.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00981.x","2-s2.0-43449115242",18,0.658266219,1

These large-bodied flightless insects are ""flagship species"" for insect conservation in New Zealand and many are rare or threatened. The declining abundance of most weta species, particularly giant weta, can be attributed to the introduction of mammalian predators, habitat destruction, and habitat modification by introduced mammalian browsers. New populations of some weta have been established in locations, particularly on islands, where these threats have been eliminated or severely reduced in order to reduce the risk of extinction. Some populations were established to provide food for endemic vertebrates, ecosystem restoration and ready access for the general public. We illustrate how methods for both transferring weta and monitoring them have become more sophisticated by using a series of case studies. Other transfers of weta not included in the case studies are also summarised. We conclude by re-iterating the importance of documenting the transfer and post-release monitoring for all insect transfers, both for biogeographical reasons and to provide information to improve future transfers. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","10.1007/s10841-008-9154-5","2-s2.0-44949202446",19,0.592767331,0

This is the 1st comprehensive study of the responses of both the kite and introduced carnivores to a rodent outbreak. The 3.5-year study period included a population outbreak of about 24 months duration involving 3 native rodent species. Mammalian predators and kites exhibited similar population responses. Kites immigrated into the area within 6 months of the outbreak commencing, and remained while rodent abundance was high; however, all birds left the area after rodent populations crashed within a 6-week period. Dingoes and foxes were more abundant than cats and both species increased during the outbreak. All carnivores were resident. The letter-winged kite fed almost entirely on rodents. Rodents were the main prey of the 3 mammalian predators during the outbreak; however, all species had intermediate niche breadths. Dietary overlap between the kite and each carnivore was high during the rodent outbreak. During a nonoutbreak period, predation on rodents by the red fox remained high, whereas that by the dingo declined. We estimated the number of average-sized rodents (body mass 32.65 g) eaten daily by a nonreproducing individual to range from 1 (letter-winged kite) to 6 (red fox). We also estimated that the 3 mammalian predators (combined) captured 11 times as many rodents per day as letter-winged kites. There is considerable potential for food-based competition between the kite and introduced mammalian predators, particularly the red fox and house cat, in arid Australia. ¬© 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1644/07-MAMM-A-168R.1","2-s2.0-45249120385",20,0.723016122,1
"2311","mammal_australasia","Predictors of clutch predation of a globally significant avifauna in New Zealand's braided river ecosystems","Predation by introduced mammals is decimating New Zealand's indigenous fauna. Understanding factors that influence this process allows resources for predator control to be applied with maximum effect. This study examines how predation of a secondary prey species (a relatively common but declining native plover, the banded dotterel Charadrius bicinctus) varied with reductions in abundance of a major prey source (rabbits), kill-trapping of predators, nest density and habitat complexity. Banded dotterels mostly nest in open braided riverbeds alongside a number of endemic threatened species. We measured the fate of 753 dotterel clutches exposed to predation by cats, ferrets and hedgehogs. We found key times and places of high predation risk. Immediately after widespread reduction in rabbit populations by rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), clutch predation rates were almost as high (mean, 50%) as those recorded during past rabbit poisoning programmes (mean, 57%). Both rates were significantly higher than the mean predation rate of 22% without rabbit control, suggesting a shift in predator diet immediately after rabbit population declines. Unlike after rabbit poisoning, clutch predation rate remained high in the years after RHD. Other patterns observed included higher clutch predation rate where nest density was lower, suggesting that predation can potentially cause local extinction. Clutch predation was also higher along riverbed margins where vegetation was dense. There was equivocal evidence for an effect of predator kill-trapping on clutch predation rate. Management strategies that could potentially reduce clutch predation risks include focusing predator mitigation measures during periods of rabbit decline, maintaining them for more than one breeding season if the rabbit declines are widespread (e.g. RHD epidemics), and applying greater effort at sites with relatively low nest density and along riverbed margins where predator use is more frequent. ¬© Journal compilation ¬© 2007 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2007.00142.x","2-s2.0-38949157734",23,0.73623222,0
"298","mammal_australasia","Attempting to manage complex predator-prey interactions fails to avert imminent extinction of a threatened New Zealand skink population","The current primary threats to biodiversity on a global scale are species invasions and habitat modification. Management of vulnerable populations often involves a lengthy sequence of 1) research to identify threats and recommend management strategies, 2) active management, and 3) results monitoring to assess effectiveness of management. The last mainland population of the large, endemic New Zealand skink (Whitaker's skink [Cyclodina whitakeri]) provides an opportunity to test this process in a system where the synergistic effects between invasive species (introduced rodents and grasses) have predicted outcomes. A low abundance of Whitaker's skink at the Pukerua Bay Scientific Reserve in the 1980s prompted management recommendations to remove grazing stock and revegetate the site to simultaneously restore habitat and provide protection against introduced mammalian predators. Since Whitaker's skink have low detectability, it was recommended that sympatric copper skink (C. aenea) be used an indicator species of management effectiveness. Grazing stock were removed in 1987, but efforts to revegetate the site were ineffective. Long-term monitoring (1984-2006) of the Whitaker's skink population and 4 other sympatric lizard species within a 336-m area at the site resulted in 1,693 lizard captures over 7,597 trap days. Whitaker's skink represented 2.8% of all captures in 1984-1988, but declined relative to other species to represent only 0.2% of captures in 2000-2006 (representing 2 individuals). Congeneric copper skink showed a similar decline with capture rates also approaching zero by 2006. Removing grazing stock did not result in an increased abundance of Whitaker's skink or copper skink through improved habitat quality, as was intended by the management recommendation. Instead, reduced grazing has allowed introduced seeding grasses to proliferate, which may have led to periodic rodent irruptions, supporting a guild of introduced mammalian predators and depleting populations of Whitaker's skink and copper skink. In this instance, attempted protection may have driven a vulnerable population towards extinction. We recommend investigating the feasibility of constructing a mammal-proof fence around the core Whitaker's skink habitat, as the last remaining management option to salvage the population.","10.2193/2006-488","2-s2.0-48249140174",29,0.783080545,1

At the time of European settlement the quokka was widespread and abundant and its distribution encompassed an area of approximately 41 200 km2 of south-west Western Australia inclusive of two offshore islands, Bald Island and Rottnest Island. Historical reports indicated an extensive population decline occurred in the 1930s. The decline continued, with a previously undocumented decline apparent in the period from 1980 to 1992. However, this decline may be an artefact of the time scales used for mapping and may well equate with a previously reported decline for a suite of south-west mammals in the 1970s. By 1992 the quokka's distribution had been reduced to an area of approximately 17 800 km2. An increased awareness of the presence of the quokka on the mainland has resulted in numerous rcportings of quokka presence since 1992, has confirmed the existence of several populations at the northern extent of the quokka's known geographic range and indicated the current, 2005, distribution to be similar to that in 1992. However, survey and population estimates at six of these mainland locations from the northern jarrah forest indicated low abundance. There have been no population estimates elsewhere on the mainland. Two populations have been reported from the Swan Coastal Plain, but neither has been confirmed extant. Predation by the introduced fox, Vulpes vulpes, is implicated as a major cause of the quokka's initial decline, while ongoing predation, habitat destruction and modification through altered fire regimes have contributed to the continued decline. Specific conservation management actions are recommended, namely: (i) Implementing an active adaptive management program in the northern jarrah forest to determine quokka population response to habitat manipulation through the use of fire, fox baiting and pig control; (ii) Surveying the Stirling Range and Green Range populations with emphasis placed on determining population size and population genetic structure; (iii) Surveying the reported occurrences from the Swan Coastal Plain, with emphasis on unambiguously determining presence. If confirmed, priority should be directed to assessing population size and determining the management requirements to ensure persistence of the population; (iv) Surveying southern forest and south coast populations to assess quokka population size, the extent of movement between subpopulations and assessment of the range of habitat types used by quokkas. The latter should be combined with spatial analyses of known extant populations and suitable and potentially suitable habitat; (v) Determining the role of fire in establishing and maintaining preferred habitat of southern forest and south coast populations; and (vi) Establishing a program to assess the potential effects from management operations.",NA,"2-s2.0-36248949718",30,0.898420484,1

As an integral component of the BWR plan, monitoring terrestrial and arboreal mammals has been carried out and demonstrated a significant increase in the abundance of Common Ringtail Possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus, Long-nosed Bandicoot Perameles nasuta, and Bush Rat Raffus fuscipes. There was no significant change in the abundance of Brown Antechinus Antechinus stuartii, Sugar Glider Petaurus breviceps or Black Rat (R. rattus). At BNP changes in population abundance of mammals were not monitored, but a comparison of the abundance of terrestrial mammals between the fox baited BNP and the adjacent un-baited Jervis Bay National Park (JBNP) showed Long-nosed Bandicoots, Bush Rat and Brown Antechinus to be in higher abundance in BNP than JBNP. Seat analysis further supported this finding (Roberts et al. 2006). We assert that these combined findings are evidence that terrestrial native fauna have responded positively to continued fox control on both peninsulas, thus proving that measuring prey responses are a positive measure of success for strategic pest control programmes.","10.1071/PC070283","2-s2.0-42249108669",33,0.761404822,1
"355","mammal_australasia","Habitat factors related to wild rabbit population trends after the initial impact of rabbit haemorrhagic disease","The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is an introduced pest species in Australia and New Zealand. Rabbits have a devastating negative impact on agricultural production and biodiversity in these countries, and Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD) is currently included in control strategies for rabbit populations. On the other hand, the European wild rabbit is a key native prey species in the Iberian Peninsula. Since the arrival of RHD, however, rabbit populations have undergone dramatic decreases and several predator species at risk of extinction are currently dependent on the rabbit population density. Therefore, from the point of view of biodiversity conservation, evaluating habitat correlates and trends of rabbit populations after the first RHD epizootic is of great interest to improve the long-term control or promotion of wild rabbit populations. We estimated the relationship between habitat factors and long-term population trends as well as the relationships between habitat factors and rabbit abundance 2 and 14 years after the arrival of RHD in several Iberian rabbit populations. We observed that only 26% of surveyed populations seemed to experience an increase in rabbit abundance over the last 12 years and that this increase was higher in the low-rabbit-abundance areas of l992, leading to high rabbit abundance in 2004. Our results suggested that short- and long-term impacts of RHD were related to habitat quality. The initial impact of RHD was higher in more suitable habitats, but increasing long-term population trends were positively related to good habitat quality. ¬© CSIRO 2006.","10.1071/WR05107","2-s2.0-33749373839",35,0.732902355,1

An aerial survey using a helicopter was considered more efficient than ground survey because of the size of the area, relatively high relief and dense tree cover, and the need for regular monitoring. Tree cover and landscape relief was used to stratify the five RLPB districts into areas of probable high, medium and low kangaroo density. Kangaroo density estimated from helicopter surveys conducted in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales was used to suggest densities and thereby allocate survey effort in each stratum.

"463","mammal_australasia","Should managed populations be monitored every year?","We often need to estimate the size of wild populations to determine the appropriate management action, for example, to set a harvest quota. Monitoring is usually planned under the assumption that it must be carried out at fixed intervals in time, typically annually, before the harvest quota is set. However, monitoring can be very expensive, and we should weigh the cost of monitoring against the improvement that it makes in decision making. A less costly alternative to monitoring annually is to predict the population size using a population model and information from previous surveys. In this paper, the problem of monitoring frequency is posed within a decision-theory framework. We discover that a monitoring regime that varies according to the state of the system can outperform fixed-interval monitoring. This idea is illustrated using data for a red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) population in South Australia. Whether or not one should monitor in a given year is dependent on the estimated population density in the previous year, the uncertainty in that population estimate, and past rainfall. We discover that monitoring is important when a model-based prediction of population density is very uncertain. This may occur if monitoring has not taken place for several years, or if rainfall has been above average. Monitoring is also important when prior information suggests that the population is near a critical threshold in population abundance. However, monitoring is less important when the optimal management action would not be altered by new information. ¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[0807:SMPBME]2.0.CO;2","2-s2.0-33646142072",46,0.783828687,1

We used photo-identification data collected between 1999 and 2002 in Cleveland Bay, northeast Queensland, to estimate abundance, site fidelity and residence patterns of these species in order to make recommendations for their effective conservation and management. Our abundance estimates indicate that less than a hundred individuals of each species inhabit this coastal area. Even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size are very high (>20% p.a.). Though both species are not permanent residents in Cleveland Bay, they both used the area regularly from year to year following a model of emigration and reimmigration. Individuals of both species spend periods of days to a month or more in coastal waters of Cleveland Bay before leaving, and periods of over a month outside the study area before entering the bay again. Because of their small population sizes and movement patterns, snubfin and humpback dolphins are particularly vulnerable to local extinction. Our results illustrate that: (1) detection of population trends should not be a necessary criterion for enacting conservation measures of both species in this region, and (2) efforts to maintain viable populations of both species in Cleveland Bay must include management strategies that integrate anthropogenic activities in surrounding areas. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The dugong case study","Recent studies have estimated the historical abundance of large marine vertebrates to determine potential targets for conservation. We evaluated this approach using 1990s aerial survey estimates of dugong abundance and an estimate of the decline in dugong numbers since the 1960s based on changes in the catch per unit effort of dugong bycatch in a government shark control program on the east coast of Queensland, Australia. This analysis indicated that the catch rate of dugongs caught in shark nets, at six locations between latitudes 16.5¬∞ S and 28¬∞ S, declined at an average of 8.7% per year between 1962 and 1999. This represents a decline to 3.1% of initial catch rates over the sampling period. If the changes in the populations sampled by the shark nets and aerial surveys were equivalent, this result suggests that the region supported 72 000 dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4220 dugongs in the mid-1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region is currently insufficient to support 72 000 dugongs, suggesting that our hindcast estimate may be an unrealistic target for recovery. Nonetheless, the evidence of serious dugong decline from the shark-net data and other sources has triggered significant conservation initiatives. This case study indicates that comparisons between historical and contemporary estimates of the abundance of large marine vertebrates can be powerful qualitative triggers for conservation action, but that quantitative targets for recovery require systematic testing of the assumptions underlying hindcast estimates, scientific evaluation of the current carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the target species, and consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. For some species, it may be more productive to set anthropogenic mortality targets that are designed to enable the population to recover to its optimum sustainable population than to set recovery targets per se. ¬© 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/04-0673","2-s2.0-15944418980",58,0.834357209,1

The first two surveys provided evidence of an apparently stable population of dugongs, with ‚àº1000 animals in each of Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef, and 10000 in Shark Bay. We report estimates of less than 200 for each of Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef and ‚àº14000 for Shark Bay. This is an apparent overall increase in the dugong population over this whole region, but with a distributional shift of animals to the south. The most plausible hypothesis to account for a large component of this apparent population shift is that animals in Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef moved to Shark Bay, most likely after Tropical Cyclone Vance impacted available dugong forage in the northern habitat. Bias associated with survey estimate methodology, and normal changes in population demographics may also have contributed to the change. The movement of large numbers of dugongs over the scale we suggest has important management implications. First, such habitat-driven shifts in regional abundance will need to be incorporated in assessing the effectiveness of marine protected areas that aim to protect dugongs and their habitat. Second, in circumstances where aerial surveys are used to estimate relative trends in abundance of dugongs, animal movements of the type we propose could lead to errors in interpretation.","10.1071/WR02073","2-s2.0-4344674757",64,0.775613346,1

Ship rats and possums were targeted by trapping and poisoning throughout Motatau Forest (350 ha) from 1997 to 1999; only possums were targeted in 2000. All 13 kukupa nests located before pest control started in late 1997 failed at the egg stage, but all seven nests located in 1998-99 successfully fledged young when trapping and tracking indices of possums and ship rats were less than 4%. After pest control, counts of kukupa and some other bird species increased at Motatau compared with counts in a nearby non-treatment block, suggesting numbers of adult kukupa can be increased in small forest areas by intensive pest control. This increase is due at least partly to increased nest success.

Aerial surveys often are the only practical way of obtaining these estimates for large mammals ranging over a large area. Different aerial survey techniques are available. This paper reports on a study that estimated abundance and population density of wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Australian Alps using helicopter aerial surveys. Three frequently used techniques were compared simultaneously: strip counts, mark-recapture, and line transect. Using data on horse groups over a strip width of 200 m, estimates of horse abundance from mark-recapture analyses were higher (NÃÇ = 3,045 modified Petersen and NÃÇ = 3,298 Huggins estimators, respectively) than from strip counts (NÃÇ = 1,814 and NÃÇ = 2,242 for observers 1 and 2, respectively). Use of line-transect analysis yielded the highest estimates of abundance (NÃÇ = 5,200-5,830, population density DÃÇ = 1.86-2.09 km -2). The coefficient of variation (CV) of estimates varied from 22% for strip counts (0-50 m) to 28% for mark-recapture analysis (0-50 m) and 31-32% for line-transect analysis (0-200 m). Mark-recapture estimates of horse abundance from the modified Petersen estimator were substantially lower when the strip width was 200 m (NÃÇ = 2,061) compared with a strip width of 50 m (NÃÇ = 4,345). These results suggested that in aerial surveys using strip or mark-recapture analyses, the effect of wide strip width should be examined; otherwise estimates may be strongly negatively biased. Observer 1 estimated mean group size of 4.91¬±0.61 SE horses and observer 2 estimated mean group size as 3.79¬±0.57 SE horses. Mean group size observed from the ground was 5.65¬±0.51 SE.

"250","mammal_neotropic","Numerical and functional response of predators to a long-term decline in mammalian prey at a semi-arid Neotropical site","Occurrence and diet of ten carnivorous predators (four falconiforms, four owls, and two foxes), and population levels of their mammalian prey, were monitored over 45 months at a semi-arid site in north-central Chile. Early in this period, small mammals irrupted and then declined markedly to a density 7% of that at peak. All four falconiforms (Buteo polyosoma, Falco sparverius, Geranoaetus melanoleucus, Parabuteo unicinctus) and one owl (Tyto alba) responded numerically to the decline in mammalian prey by virtually abandoning the study site. The three other owls (Athene cunicularia, Bubo virginianus, Glaucidium nanum) and the two foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus and P. griseus) remained. With few exceptions, throughout the study predators maintained species-specific preferences among small mammal species regardless of the absolute and proportional abundance of these prev. At no time did the two prey species most responsible for the irruption (the rodents Phyllotis darwini and Akodon olivaceus) occur in predators' diets out of proportion to their estimated relative abundance in the field. Predators were clearly unable to prevent the irruption from occurring. Given the absence of a clear functional response to the most irruptive species, predators seemed unlikely to have been responsible for the observed crash. At present, however, predators may be prolonging the crash and delaying the return of small-mammal populations to typical densities. ¬© 1992 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/BF00319020","2-s2.0-0027075279",62,0.770228328845948,1
"326","mammal_neotropic","A long-term study on the dynamics of guild structure among predatory vertebrates at a semi-arid Neotropical site","Diets and populations of 10 species of predatory vertebrates (two foxes, four falconiforms, four owls) were monitored in semi-desert scrub at Auco, Chile. Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation. Availability of the eight species of small mammals varied relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by diverging in diet during ""lean' times and converging opportunistically during ""fat' times, predators responded in idiosyncratic ways. Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently ended up temporarily in unique positions in ""diet hyperspace' or else joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously in the study area throughout the period. -from Authors","10.2307/3545099","2-s2.0-0027386301",61,0.779302535819012,1

Trapping was carried out every other month from June 1991 to July 1996, for five trapping nights on seven transects along the valley, totaling 12250 trap nights. The roles of habitat complexity (vegetation density in vertical strata) and heterogeneity (horizontal physiognomy) on structuring the small mammal community were investigated correlating heterogeneity and complexity with mammal abundance and richness. Heterogeneity variables were related to small mammal species and habitats, simultaneously, by a Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Marsupials were more related to the forest transects and to the presence of trees. Rodents were most related to the herbaceous stratum near the ground. Abundance of mammals was influenced mostly by complexity. The study area presented low habitat complexity, and it suffered frequent anthropogenic disturbances. These factors provided low species richness by neotropical standards.

"1012","mammal_neotropic","Forest bird community structure in central Panama: Influence of spatial scale and biogeography","Historical and biogeographic contexts can play important, yet sometimes overlooked, roles in determining structure of local communities. In particular, few examinations of historical influences on patterns of species richness and relative abundances in tropical communities have been conducted. In part, that gap in our knowledge has been caused by a paucity of data on tropical communities, even for relatively well-studied taxa such as birds. In the Neotropics, only two sites, a 97-ha plot in lowland Peru and a 100-ha plot in French Guiana, have been inventoried on a spatial scale sufficient to estimate population densities for a majority of resident bird species. Results from those studies revealed extremely similar species richness, community biomass, and patterns of relative abundance. A third site in lowland Panama was originally censused in 1968-1969 and has often been compared with many other tropical and temperate sites. Results from Panama suggested an exceptionally different community structure from that observed at the Amazonian sites. Informative comparisons among sites have been hampered, however, by differences in sampling protocols. The Panama site was sampled on a much smaller spatial scale (2 ha) than the two Amazonian sites. To improve comparisons, we censused a 104-ha area (the Limbo plot) encompassing the original 2-ha Panama study area and used several census methods, including those used at the Amazonian sites. As expected, spatial scale had a strong effect on estimates of species richness. We detected 252 species on the Limbo plot, compared with 161 detected on the original 2-ha area. Estimates of total individual birds per 100 ha were similar, but estimates from the original study were based on densities measured for one-third fewer species than we measured on our larger study area. Of the 53 species for which both Panama studies estimated population densities, a significant number of estimates were higher in the original study. Thus, the small spatial scale of the original study apparently led to inflated density estimates. The primary cause of disparities appeared to result from undersampling in the smaller plot of many species with patchy distributions and large territory sizes. Compared with Amazonian communities, the Panama community had far fewer rare species. Although 33% of species in Amazonian sites had densities of ‚â§1 pair/100 ha, only 17% were equally rare in Panama. Furthermore, eight species in Panama were, by tropical standards, 'superabundant,' attaining densities as high as 212 breeding individuals/100 ha; the most abundant species in Amazonia barely reached one-third of that number. In total, those eight species accounted for 36% of all individuals at Limbo. The median abundance at Limbo was 7 pairs/100 ha, vs. 2.5 pairs/100 ha in Amazonia. Consequently, the total number of birds on the Limbo study area was nearly twice that found in Amazonia, despite species richness being only three-fourths as great. We conclude, first, that spatial scale has indeed had an important effect on the characterization of the Panama bird community. The intrinsically patchy distributions of most forest-dwelling bird species raise the need for large-scale censuses. Second, the Panama community, compared with the two Amazonian sites, has a fundamentally different organization; it hosts nearly twice as many individual birds and is distinctly less dominated by rarity. Similar patterns of community structure appear to be present within tree and mammal communities as well. Therefore, results from the Amazonian studies cannot be generalized to all lowland Neotropical communities. We attribute differences in community structure primarily to differing biogeographic histories. The lower species richness and the greater number of total birds present in Panama appear to derive, at least in part, from two important factors: an area effect linked to the location of Panama on a narrow isthmus, and the repeated history of disturbance on multiple temporal scales in Panama.","10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0209:FBCSIC]2.0.CO;2","2-s2.0-0033820819",53,0.658913540994902,0

The Peruvian booby Sula variegata was the most abundant seabird with a breeding population of ca. 18,000 pairs concentrated in two islands, followed by the Humboldt penguin Spheniscus humboldti with ca. 9,000 pairs, the largest colony being at Cha√±aral Island with ca. 7,000 pairs. Kelp gulls Larus dominicanus bred at all the surveyed sites in colonies of variable size, ranging from 40 to 2, 000 pairs. Peruvian diving-petrels Pelecanoides garnotii and Peruvian pelicans Pelecanus occidentalis bred at restricted sites, but generally in large colonies.

Two new breeding sites are reported for the Peruvian diving-petrel and nesting of the wedge-rumped storm-petrel is confirmed on the Chilean coast for the first time. Despite protective status, most of the islands showed human disturbance, derived mainly from guano harvesting, egging and tourism. On at least five of these islands we were able to confirm introduced mammals including rats, rabbits and cats. These factors are likely to be detrimental to seabirds and thus demand detailed assessment. Further comprehensive ornithological surveys in other areas are needed so as to improve the scarce knowledge that we currently have on the seabird populations along the Chilean coast.","10.4067/S0716-078X2003000200016","2-s2.0-1042279367",51,0.828436315185398,1
"1713","mammal_neotropic","Basin-wide effects of game harvest on vertebrate population densities in Amazonian forests: implications for animal-mediated seed dispersal","Vertebrate responses to hunting are widely variable for target and nontarget species depending on the history of hunting and productivity of any given site and the life history traits of game species. We provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of changes in population density or other abundance estimates for 30 mid-sized to large mammal, bird and reptile species in 101 hunted and nonhunted, but otherwise undisturbed, Neotropical forest sites. The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative. Populations of all species combined declined across greater differences in hunting pressure by up to 74.8 percent from their numeric abundance in less intensively hunted sites, but harvest-sensitive species faired far worse. Of the 30 species examined, 22 declined significantly at high levels of hunting. Body size significantly affected the direction and magnitude of abundance changes, with large-bodied species declining faster in overhunted sites. Frugivorous species showed more marked declines in abundance in heavily hunted sites than seed predators and browsers, regardless of the effects of body size. The implications of hunting for seed dispersal are discussed in terms of community dynamics in semi-defaunated tropical forests. ¬© 2007 The Author(s).","10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00272.x","2-s2.0-34247329805",44,0.78737784269578,0

We examined effects of both forest-patch metrics and forest disturbance in determining richness and abundance of midsized to large-bodied mammal species in a highly fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. Twenty-one forest fragments, ranging from 2 to 14,480 ha, and two continuous forest sites were sampled based on sightings, tracks, line-transect censuses, armadillo burrow censuses, and camera trapping. Patch occupancy of 37 species recorded ranged from 4% to all forest sites surveyed. Forest fragment size was the strongest predictor of species persistence, explaining 90% of the variation in species richness. Information-theoretic analysis confirmed that fragment area was the most important explanatory variable for the overall species richness and abundance of mammal species, followed by surface fires, which affected the abundance of seven species. Large mammal species were typically absent from fragments <100 ha, whereas some ubiquitous species were favored by fragmentation, exhibiting hyperabundance in small patches. Our findings highlight the importance of large (>10,000 ha), relatively undisturbed forest patches to maximize persistence and maintain baseline abundances of Neotropical forest mammal species. ¬© 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00797.x","2-s2.0-37349074468",39,0.657740815662782,0

We estimated density of pumas using remote cameras across study sites in Bolivia, Argentina, and Belize. We used obvious and subtle markings to identify individual pumas in photographs and conducted double-blind identifications to examine the degree of agreement among investigators. Average agreement on identification between pairs of investigators was nearly 80.0% and 3-way agreement was 72.9%. Identification of pumas as different individuals was uncommon (7.8% pairwise, 0.69% 3-way disagreement) with the remainder described as unidentifiable. Densities of pumas varied consistently from site to site regardless of investigator. Bolivian pumas moved the shortest distances between camera stations and Argentinean pumas the longest, but distances among cameras and area covered by surveys varied among sites. We applied a correction factor to the Bolivian data to account for the small area surveyed and found that, averaged across investigator, Bolivia had significantly more pumas per 100 km2 (mean ¬± SD; 6.80 ¬± 1.5) than Belize (3.42 ¬± 1.3) or Argentina (0.67 ¬± 0.2). Numbers of pumas in Argentina match those of low-density North American sites, and those for Belize are consistent with the Pantanal and high-density North American sites.

"279","mammal_neotropic","Mammals of Cabo Blanco: History, diversity, and conservation after 45 years of regrowth of a Costa Rican dry forest","Reserva Natural Absoluta Cabo Blanco, a strongly seasonal deciduous forest located at the southernmost tip of northwestern Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, was established in 1963 and is the country's oldest nationally protected reserve. The peninsula has been occupied for millennia and is a heavily impacted landscape, and, unfortunately, its biotic diversity is among the most poorly studied in Central America. As part of multiyear studies of the flora and fauna of the region, we assess the changes in vegetation and the terrestrial mammal community from earlier times to the present day. Through historical records, interviews with long-term residents of the area, and our studies over the past decade, we document changes in forest cover, settlement, and land use, and assess the changes in species diversity and in mammal species' abundance. We then discuss the ecology of the mammal species on the peninsula, emphasizing the role that humans have played in influencing population levels. After 45 years of protection, the forest structure of the 3100 ha reserve differs markedly from that observed in the early 20th Century and it is quite heterogeneous. Species diversity of both the native vegetation and the mammals is substantial in the regenerating forest. The known mammal fauna included at least 37 species of non-flying mammals and 39 species of bats. Six species (Geoffroy's Spider Monkey, Giant Anteater, White-lipped Peccary, Central American Red Brocket Deer, Baird's Tapir, and Jaguar) have been extirpated from the reserve. Poaching of game species continues and will be difficult to eliminate completely. Nevertheless, with regenerating habitats, coupled with protection of wildlife, reestablishment of the reserve's native species has been dramatic both in terms of species diversity and abundance. The reserve is not in a defaunated condition. Many mammalian frugivores, seed dispersers, and/or seed predators are common and most top mammalian predators are present. We present several testable hypotheses regarding the significance of this mammalian community in the context of other Neotropical forest mammal and plant communities. Rapid expansion of tourism in this region has the potential to affect the reserve adversely. In recent years, the reserve has served as an important site for teaching tropical biology courses. Small reserves, such as Cabo Blanco, even if not connected to larger protected areas through corridors, provide critical habitat for native flora and fauna, a source of genetic stock, and valuable regional teaching and research sites. ¬© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"3010","mammal_neotropic","Vertebrate population responses to reduced-impact logging in a neotropical forest","Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9 m3 ha-1, equivalent to only 1.1 trees ha-1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"327","mammal_neotropic","Long-term monitoring of tropical bats for anthropogenic impact assessment: Gauging the statistical power to detect population change","Bats are ecologically important mammals in tropical ecosystems; however, their populations face numerous environmental threats related to climate change, habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and emerging diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (‚â•20. years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (‚â•0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (‚â§10. years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20. years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2010.07.029","2-s2.0-77956876153",32,0.738252732818643,1
"387","mammal_neotropic","Effects of Climate and Exurban Development on Nest Predation and Predator Presence in the southern Appalachian Mountains (U.S.A.)","In the eastern United States, land-use and climate change have likely contributed to declines in the abundance of Neotropical migrant birds that occupy forest interiors, but the mechanisms are not well understood. We conducted a nest-predation experiment in southern Appalachian Mountain forests (North Carolina, U.S.A.) during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons to determine the effects of exurban development and temperature on predator presence and the average number of days until eggs in an artificial nest were disturbed by predators. We baited artificial nests with quail (Excalfactoria chinensi) eggs and monitored them for 18 days. We used clay eggs, track plates, and motion-triggered cameras to detect and identify nest predators. The average number of days a nest was undisturbed decreased as mean temperature increased and, to a lesser extent, as the density of buildings increased. Nests on the ground were more often depredated than those in trees, likely due to increased predation by opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and other carnivores. Raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums, corvids (Corvus brachyrhynchos and Cyanocitta cristata), chipmunks (Tamias striatus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and domestic cats (Felis catus) were the most commonly detected predators. Presence of these predators did not vary as a function of mean temperature. Domestic cats and corvids were detected more frequently in plots with high rather than low densities of buildings. Forest-interior specialists and Neotropical migrants often nest in cool, high-elevation areas with low housing density. These bird species, especially those that nest on the ground, may be most vulnerable to increased nest predation if temperature and exurban development increase at higher elevations as anticipated. ¬© 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01851.x","2-s2.0-84864018677",24,0.737607224941597,0

A stronger effect of host-related factors on flea than on mite assemblages, and a stronger effect of environmental factors on mite than on flea assemblages were predicted. In addition, the effects of parasite-related factors on flea and mite diversity and abundance were predicted to manifest mainly at the scale of infracommunities, whereas the effects of host-related and environmental factors were predicted to manifest mainly at the scale of component and compound communities. This study found that, in general, diversity and abundance of flea and mite assemblages at two lower hierarchical levels (infracommunities and component communities) were affected by host-related, parasite-related and environmental factors, and compound communities were affected mainly by host-related and environmental factors. The effects of factors differed between fleas and mites: in fleas, community structure and abundance depended on host diversity to a greater extent than in mites.

The population of D. aurita exhibited many phenotypic changes; males were on average 8 % smaller and females produced 30 % less litters than those from the mainland and other land-bridge islands. The long history of forest disturbance, habitat loss, reduction in forest productivity, and the recent introduction of mesopredators may be the major drivers that explain the small mammal community composition on this island. ¬© 2013 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","10.1515/mammalia-2011-0099","2-s2.0-84878148025",23,0.732423941722677,0
"419","mammal_neotropic","Potential Effects of Climate Change on the Water Level, Flora and Macro-fauna of a Large Neotropical Wetland","Possible consequences of climate change in one of the world's largest wetlands (Ibera, Argentina) were analysed using a multi-scale approach. Climate projections coupled to hydrological models were used to analyse variability in wetland water level throughout the current century. Two potential scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions were explored, both resulting in an increase in the inter-annual fluctuations of the water level. In the scenario with higher emissions, projections also showed a long-term negative trend in water-level. To explore the possible response of biota to such water-level changes, species-area relationships of flora and aerial censuses of macro-fauna were analysed during an extraordinary dry period. Plant species richness at the basin scale was found to be highly resistant to hydrological changes, as the large dimension of the wetland acts to buffer against the water-level variations. However, local diversity decreased significantly with low water levels, leading to the loss of ecosystem resilience to additional stressors. The analysis of macro-fauna populations suggested that wetland provides refuge, in low water periods, for the animals with high dispersal ability (aquatic and migratory birds). On the contrary, the abundance of animals with low dispersal ability (mainly herbivorous species) was negatively impacted in low water periods, probably because they are required to search for alternative resources beyond the wetland borders. This period of resource scarcity was also related to increased mortality of large mammals (e.g. marsh deer) around water bodies with high anthropogenic enrichment and cyanobacteria dominance. The synergy between recurrent climatic fluctuations and additional stressors (i.e. biological invasions, eutrophication) presents an important challenge to the conservation of neotropical wetlands in the coming decades. ¬© 2013 √öbeda et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0067787","2-s2.0-84879901777",21,0.514039019660432,1
"425","mammal_neotropic","Group dynamics, behavior, and current and historical abundance of peccaries in Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands","The abundances and habitat preferences of peccaries in Neotropical forests are important to understand because these keystone species influence many aspects of the ecosystem. In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, we conducted walking surveys for ‚àº2 years to study the behavior and population trends of collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), and found that peccaries are abundant at La Selva Biological Station and overall, detection rates were relatively constant through time. A stable estimate of detection rates was achieved only after 7-9 months of surveying. We found no habitat preferences between primary and secondary forest, yet there were some differences in group dynamics - group radius was larger and sighting distance was greater in primary forest, whereas the number of singletons was higher in secondary forest. More peccaries were seen closer to the laboratory clearing than at greater distances, for a variety of probable reasons: habituation to humans, lower predation and hunting pressure, and various environmental and habitat factors. Peccary groups had spatially clumped distributions across the landscape and were more active diurnally than nocturnally. Collared peccary densities are relatively high at La Selva compared to other Neotropical sites, with the exception of Barro Colorado Island. We combined our data with a review of the historical literature to assess changes in the populations of peccaries in the Caribbean lowlands. We found that collared peccaries have likely increased in abundance at La Selva, seemingly a few years after the extirpation of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari), which were abundant in the area 40-50 years ago. An understanding of the group dynamics, behavior, and habitat preference of collared peccaries is essential for management decisions and conservation efforts. Additionally, assessment of population changes should be carefully considered in a historical context, with a particular focus on how the populations of the 2 peccary species have changed, and how these species might differentially affect their environment. ¬© 2013 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1644/12-MAMM-A-266.1","2-s2.0-84882377861",20,0.688357458253128,1
"436","mammal_neotropic","Experimental Seed Predator Removal Reveals Shifting Importance of Predation and Dispersal Limitation in Early Life History Stages of Tropical Forest Trees","Recruitment limitation of trees in tropical forests can occur because of high rates of seed predation or low rates of seed dispersal, but the degree to which limitation is influenced by variation in seed predator abundance, and hence variation in seed predation and dispersal, is not well understood. We experimentally reduced the density of a granivorous small mammal (Heteromys desmarestianus) by 90 % to assess the degree to which its rates of seed predation and dispersal limit seed to seedling survival of nine species of trees in a Neotropical lowland forest. Overall, the proportion of seeds that germinated was influenced more by high rates of predation than by limited dispersal. Reduction in density of H. desmarestianus resulted in an order of magnitude decrease in fruit removal rates and an order of magnitude increase in both the absolute and relative numbers of seeds that germinated. However, the proportion of seeds that were cached remained relatively constant across all periods and between control grids and removal plots. In removal plots, H. desmarestianus dispersed and cached about 10 % of the fruits they handled, of which approximately 25 % germinated. This was 2 to 3 times greater than the germination rates of undispersed seeds, and for two species dispersed seeds were the only ones that germinated. The results suggest the simultaneous occurrence of both seed predation and dispersal limitation for trees with animal-dispersed seeds, but there may also be a hierarchy of importance in the relative strength of these two mechanisms that is determined by the dynamics of seed predator populations. ¬© 2013 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.","10.1007/s12224-013-9178-9","2-s2.0-84885937390",19,0.430290048144069,0

When only a portion of the population is uniquely identifiable, traditional and spatial mark-resight models provide a viable alternative. We reanalyzed a data set that used photographic capture-recapture methods to estimate the densities of pumas (Puma concolor) across 3 study sites in Belize, Argentina, and Bolivia using newer, more-Advanced modeling including spatial and nonspatial mark-resight techniques. Additionally, we assessed how photo identification influenced density estimates by comparing estimates based on capture histories constructed by 3 independent investigators. We estimated the abundances of pumas using mark-resight models in program MARK and then estimated densities ad hoc. We also estimated densities directly using spatial mark-resight models implemented in a Bayesian framework. Puma densities did not vary substantially among observers but estimates generated from the 3 statistical techniques did differ. Density estimates (pumas/100 km2) from spatial mark-resight models were lower (0.22-7.92) and had increased precision compared to those from nonspatial capture-recapture (0.50-19.35) and mark-resight techniques (0.54-14.70). Our study is the 1st to estimate the density of a population of carnivores, where only a subset of the individuals are naturally marked, using camera-trapping surveys in combination with spatial mark-resight models. The development of spatial mark-resight and spatially explicit capture-recapture techniques creates the potential for using a single camera-trapping array to estimate the density of multiple, sympatric carnivores, including both partially marked and uniquely marked species. ¬© 2014 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1644/13-MAMM-A-126","2-s2.0-84898887713",18,0.647758783661838,0

However, their distribution pattern inside the Eucalyptus plantations remains unknown. This study aimed at the identification of possible influence of distances from the remaining native revegetation areas and riparian systems, on spatial distribution and abundance of small-size mammals in Eucalyptus plantations. This study was carried at Eucalyptus stands recently planted (0-3 years) at the municipality of Angatuba, Sao Paulo state, Brazil between August 2007 and July 2009. The survey was carried out using pitfall traps at 14 sampling units inside Eucalyptus plantations 60-1130 m away from the borders. With a sampling effort of 2,449 bucket night, the experiment captured 680 individuals belonging to 12 species of small-size mammals (rodents and marsupials). The colonization process of Eucalyptus plantations was apparently initiated by generalist species from open Cerrado. In the present study, we did not find any clear correlation between specific richness and abundance of individuals and the distance from native revegetation areas or closer riparian systems. The study suggests that Eucalyptus plantations are permeable matrices to, at least, more generalist species present in the silvicultural landscapes (i.e. composed by an Eucalyptus plantation as the matrix and native vegetation patches). However, further studies must prioritize analyzing the influence of agricultural/sivilcultural practices (e.g., plantation structure and harvest frequency) on habitat quality and carrying capacity of agricultural/silvicultural landscape matrices, as well as implementing long-term monitoring programs to assess the impact of complete production cycles (some years) and along cycles of Eucalyptus plantations (some decades), on rodents population's diversity and dynamics patterns. ¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","10.1007/s10457-014-9702-9","2-s2.0-84902344587",17,0.556856531447424,1

We used a natural experiment in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to investigate the ecological responses of rodents to the functional extinction of a dominant terrestrial mammal, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). We detected a 45% increase in the abundance and a decrease in diversity of rodents in defaunated forests. Two of these species (Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes) are important hosts of Hantavirus, a lethal virus for humans. Stable isotope ratios (Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N) derived from the hair of rodents and peccaries and their food resources indicate that at least two rodent species shifted to a diet more similar to peccaries in the defaunated forest. Because most tropical rainforests are facing dramatic extirpation of large mammals, we can expect changes in the composition and structure of small mammal communities with potential consequences for human health even in non-fragmented landscapes. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.032","2-s2.0-84930678096",14,0.504546107235237,0

However, the ecomorphological boundaries of these species are poorly differentiated, and consequently correspondence between their geographic distribution, ecological plasticity and morphological variation remains unclear. In this study, patterns of cranial and mandibular morphological variation were assessed for Carollia brevicauda, C. castanea and C. perspicillata from Colombia. Using geometric morphometrics, morphological variation was examined with respect to: differences in intraspecific variation, morphological modularity and integration, and biogeographic patterns. Patterns of intraspecific variation were different for each species in both cranial and mandibular morphology, with functional differences apparent according to diet. Cranial modularity varied between species whereas mandibular modularity did not. High cranial and mandibular correlation reflects Cranium-Mandible integration as a functional unit. Similarity between the biogeographic patterns in C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata indicates that the Andes do not act as a barrier but rather as an independent region, isolating the morphology of Andean populations of larger-bodied species. The biogeographic pattern for C. castanea was not associated with the physiography of the Andes, suggesting that large body size does not benefit C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata in maintaining homogeneous morphologies among populations. ¬© 2015 L√≥pez-Aguirre et al.","10.7717/peerj.1197","2-s2.0-84940375126",16,0.297545396417044,0
"493","mammal_neotropic","On palms, bugs, and Chagas disease in the Americas","Palms are ubiquitous across Neotropical landscapes, from pristine forests or savannahs to large cities. Although palms provide useful ecosystem services, they also offer suitable habitat for triatomines and for Trypanosoma cruzi mammalian hosts. Wild triatomines often invade houses by flying from nearby palms, potentially leading to new cases of human Chagas disease. Understanding and predicting triatomine-palm associations and palm infestation probabilities is important for enhancing Chagas disease prevention in areas where palm-associated vectors transmit T. cruzi. We present a comprehensive overview of palminfestation by triatomines in the Americas, combining a thorough reanalysis of our published and unpublished records with an in-depth review of the literature. We use site-occupancy modeling (SOM) to examine infestation in 3590 palms sampled with non-destructive methods, and standard statistics to describe and compare infestation in 2940 palms sampled by felling-and-dissection. Thirty-eight palm species (18 genera) have been reported to be infested by ~39 triatomine species (10 genera) from the USA to Argentina. Overall infestation varied from 49.1-55.3% (SOM) to 62.6-66.1% (dissection), with important heterogeneities among sub-regions and particularly among palm species. Large palms with complex crowns (e.g., Attalea butyracea, Acrocomia aculeata) and some medium-crowned palms (e.g.,Copernicia, Butia) are often infested; in slender, small-crowned palms (e.g., Euterpe) triatomines associate with vertebrate nests. Palm infestation tends to be higher in rural settings, but urban palms can also be infested. Most Rhodnius species are probably true palm specialists, where as Psammolestes, Eratyrus, Cavernicola, Panstrongylus, Triatoma, Alberprosenia, and some Bolboderini seem to use palms opportunistically. Palms provide extensive habitat for enzootic T. cruzi cycles and a critical link between wild cycles. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The application of analysis tools based on principles of statistical generality are nowadays a common practice for describing these phenomena, but, in general, they are more capable of generating clear diagnosis rather than granting valuable modelling. For this reason, in our approach, we detect the principal temporal structures on the bases of different correlation measures, and from these results we build an ad-hoc minimalist autoregressive model that incorporates the main drivers of the dynamics. Surprisingly our model is capable of reproducing very well the time patterns of the empirical series and, for the first time, clearly outlines the importance of the time of attaining sexual maturity as a central temporal scale for the dynamics of this species. In fact, an important advantage of this analysis scheme is that all the model parameters are directly biologically interpretable and potentially measurable, allowing a consistency check between model outputs and independent measurements.","10.1038/srep19553","2-s2.0-84958576669",11,0.451946227890166,1

Jaguarundis occupy and use a range of habitats with dense undergrowth from northern Mexico to central Argentina, but may be most abundant in seasonal dry, Atlantic, gallery, and mixed grassland/agricultural forest landscapes. Jaguarundis are principally predators of small (sigmodontine) rodents, although other mammals, birds, and squamate reptiles are taken regularly. The vast majority of jaguarundi camera-trap records occurred during daylight hours (0600h-1800h); jaguaurndis are also predominantly terrestrial, although they appear to be capable tree climbers. Home range sizes for jaguarundis vary greatly, but most are ‚â§25km2; females' territories may be much smaller than or similar in size to those of males. Males may concentrate movements in one area before shifting to another and, as with other felids, intersexual overlap in habitat use appears to be common. Interference competition may be important in influencing the distribution and ecology of jaguarundis, although their diurnal habits may somewhat mitigate its effect. Conflict between humans and jaguarundis over small livestock may be widespread among rural human communities and is likely to be underreported. Despite this conflict, jaguarundis can persist in agriculturally modified landscapes and small forest fragments. Additional research on local jaguarundi populations from more areas should be a priority to determine the true status of the species. ¬© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","10.1111/mam.12051","2-s2.0-84958773010",12,0.631959266146432,0
"523","mammal_neotropic","Line transect surveys underdetect terrestrial mammals: Implications for the sustainability of subsistence hunting","Conservation of Neotropical game species must take into account the livelihood and food security needs of local human populations. Hunting management decisions should therefore rely on abundance and distribution data that are as representative as possible of true population sizes and dynamics. We simultaneously applied a commonly used encounterbased method and an infrequently used sign-based method to estimate hunted vertebrate abundance in a 48,000-km2 indigenous landscape in southern Guyana. Diurnal direct encounter data collected during three years along 216, four-kilometer -long transects consistently under-detected many diurnal and nocturnal mammal species readily detected through sign. Of 32 species analyzed, 31 were detected by both methods; however, encounters did not detect one and under-detected another 12 of the most heavily hunted species relative to sign, while sign under-detected 12 never or rarely collected species relative to encounters. The six most important game animals in the region, all ungulates, were not encountered at 11-40% of village and control sites or on 29-72% of transects where they were detected by sign. Using the sign methodology, we find that tapirs, one of the terrestrial vertebrates considered most sensitive to overexploitation, are present at many sites where they were never visually detected during distance sampling. We find that this is true for many other species as well. These high rates of under-detection suggest that behavioral changes in hunted populations may affect apparent occurrence and abundance of these populations. Accumulation curves (detection of species on transects) were much steeper for sign for 12 of 16 hunted species than for encounters, but that pattern was reversed for 12 of 16 species unhunted in our area. We conclude that collection of sign data is an efficient and effective method of monitoring hunted vertebrate populations that complements encounter and camera-trapping methods in areas impacted by hunting. Sign surveys may be the most viable method for large-scale, management-oriented studies in remote areas, particularly those focused on community-based wildlife management. ¬© 2016 Fragoso et al.

We performed a 20-month study using transect walks to survey the nonvolant mammal fauna in primary and secondary forests at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We found that secondary forests can hold complex mammalian communities and no species exhibited habitat preferences between primary and secondary forests. With few exceptions, behavioral and group dynamic characteristics of mammal species were similar between forest types. Our research allows us to address methodological questions and assess the effectiveness of transect sampling. Monthly detection rates vary widely by species and likely reflect short-term changes in behavior rather than population fluctuations. Air temperature and rainfall are the factors most associated with monthly detection rates for various species. Small-scale areas of higher and lower use are evident for several species. Neither time of morning for surveys nor number of observers per trail affects detection rate. We report current abundances for the most commonly observed species and note generally lower densities in the Caribbean lowlands than elsewhere in the Neotropics. This research highlights that in less seasonal, evergreen forests climatic factors can still affect mammalian behavior. Overall, we find that secondary forests are of high conservation value and that transect walks are an effective methodology to sample many nonvolant mammal species, and we present recommendations on how to sample properly to conduct rigorous and long-term studies. ¬© 2016 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1093/jmammal/gyw009","2-s2.0-84964425498",10,0.596771602493218,1

Density-dependent tortuosity in individual movements of a Neotropical mammal","Effects of density dependence on animal movements have received much attention in ecology, but it is still debated to what extent dispersal and movements in general are density dependent, and their potential contribution to population regulation processes. Here, we determine the occurrence and nature of density dependence in the movements of a Neotropical marsupial, the black-eared opossum Didelphis auritaWied-Neuwied 1826. Using spool-and-line tracking devices, we estimated the tortuosity of fine-scale movements of 149 individuals by their fractal dimension D. We evaluated the relative importance of population size, reproductive or climatic seasons and reproductive maturity of individuals as determinants of movement tortuosity, using a model selection approach. Population size was the most important determinant of movement tortuosity, with season (climatic seasons for females, reproductive seasons for males) and reproductive maturity as secondary but also important variables. We detected a positive density-dependent effect on movement tortuosity, resulting in more intensive use of areas by individuals during periods of high population size. This positive association between movement tortuosity and population size is more likely to result from intraspecific competition, which forces individuals to explore their environment more intensively during high-density periods. Therefore, despite being density dependent, movements in D.aurita apparently do not contribute to population regulation mechanisms. ¬© 2015 Ecological Society of Australia.","10.1111/aec.12250","2-s2.0-84983175060",13,0.668577525367559,0

Dogs have been shown to impact wildlife populations negatively, and their occurrence can alter the abundance, behavior, and activity patterns of native species. However, little is known about abundance and density of the free-ranging dogs that use protected areas. Here, we used camera trap data with an open-robust design mark-recapture model to estimate the number of dogs that used protected areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We estimated the time period these dogs used the protected areas, and explored factors that influenced the probability of continued use (e.g., season, mammal richness, proportion of forest), while accounting for variation in detection probability. Dogs in the studied system were categorized as rural free-ranging, and their abundance varied widely across protected areas (0-73 individuals). Dogs used protected areas near human houses for longer periods (e.g., >50% of sampling occasions) compared to more distant areas. We found no evidence that their probability of continued use varied with season or mammal richness. Dog detection probability decreased linearly among occasions, possibly due to the owners confining their dogs after becoming aware of our presence. Comparing our estimates to those for native carnivoran, we found that dogs were three to 85 times more abundant than ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), two to 25 times more abundant than puma (Puma concolor), and approximately five times more abundant than the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). Combining camera trapping data with modern mark-recapture methods provides important demographic information on free-ranging dogs that can guide management strategies to directly control dogs' abundance and ranging behavior.

This study explored the conservation status of a large predator, the jaguar, considered an indicator of the maintenance of how well ecological processes are maintained. We implemented an original integrative approach, exploring successive ecosystem status proxies, from habitats and responses to threats of predators and their prey, to canopy structure and forest biomass. Niche modeling allowed identification of more suitable habitats, significantly related to canopy height and forest biomass. Capture/recapture methods showed that jaguar density was higher in habitats identified as more suitable by the niche model. Surveys of ungulates, large rodents and birds also showed higher density where jaguars were more abundant. Although jaguar density does not allow early detection of overall vertebrate community collapse, a decrease in the abundance of large terrestrial birds was noted as good first evidence of disturbance. The most promising tool comes from easily acquired LiDAR data and radar images: a decrease in canopy roughness was closely associated with the disturbance of forests and associated decreasing vertebrate biomass. This mixed approach, focusing on an apex predator, ecological modeling and remote-sensing information, not only helps detect early population declines in large mammals, but is also useful to discuss the relevance of large predators as indicators and the efficiency of conservation measures. It can also be easily extrapolated and adapted in a timely manner, since important open-source data are increasingly available and relevant for large-scale and real-time monitoring of biodiversity. ¬© 2016 de Thoisy et al.

Therefore, some aspects of its distribution, habitat requirements, and abundance are mostly unknown; which makes a proper determination of its conservation status difficult. Considering that new techniques known as species distribution models (SDMs) allow us to estimate the suitable areas and the most important variables for the distribution of a species, we compiled water opossum occurrences and modeled its potential distribution on a continental scale. We performed a SDM for the water opossum using MaxEnt and assessed the extent of habitat loss (km2) and the importance of Protected Areas (PAs). We compared the suitability values within and outside PAs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to evaluate the efficiency of PAs. The results obtained were compared with the IUCN historical water opossum's map. Additionally, we identified gaps in the potential distribution where for future surveys should be focused. We obtained models that describe the distribution of this species based on 292 occurrences with new information for 16 countries. Deforestation reduced the area of suitable habitat by ‚àº40 % and only ‚àº18 % corresponds to natural forest within PAs. Areas inside PAs showed higher suitability values (0.351 ¬± 0.276; P &lt; 0.001) than areas outside them. We identified gaps within the distribution that need attention during future surveys such as the frontier between Venezuela and Guyana, the Amazonian region, and central-eastern Brazil. Our results showed areas absent in the IUCN's distribution map, indicating that it needs to be updated. Thus, we proposed a new tentative extent of the water opossum distribution information here obtained. We demonstrated that PAs included areas with high habitat suitability values for C. minimus, which could protect the water opossum in the medium and long-term. Modifications to the physicochemical characteristics of the habitat due to forest loss and fragmentation can considerably affect water opossum populations and reduce local diversity. Thus, the preservation of river ecosystems and surrounding areas represents a necessary step for the conservation of C. minimus. ¬© 2017 Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Mastozoolog√≠a, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.","10.12933/therya-17-478","2-s2.0-85020797138",6,0.578131939980885,0

We have carried out a survey of small mammal communities in three tropical landscapes differing in their degree of environmental change in Central Panama and investigated the effects of community changes on Hepacivirus prevalence. The modification of continuous habitat into partly connected or isolated habitat patches during the past century was linked to changes in species diversity and species assemblages, which was further associated with shifts in the abundance of generalist marsupial (Didelphis marsupialis, Philander opossum) and rodent (Proechimys semispinosus) species. The latter has become dominant in isolated habitat patches and was the only identified Hepacivirus host in our study system. Our analyses suggest that, in addition to the effects of host age and sex, host population density in interaction with sex ratio is a crucial predictor of infection probability. Although we found no significant relationships between species diversity per se and infection probability, the lowest prevalence detected in the landscape with the highest species diversity indicates that shifts in species assemblages (e.g. changes in the presence and abundance of marsupial predators) impact the host‚Äôs intraspecific contact rates, the probability of virus transmission and, thus, the virus prevalence. Our study additionally provides important data on the influence of human-induced landscape changes on infection probability and, therefore, on virus prevalence in wildlife and emphasizes the importance of a landscape-scale approach with concomitant consideration of the complex interactions between ecological factors. ¬© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","10.1007/s00442-018-4210-7","2-s2.0-85048957516",2,0.417653075611835,1
"621","mammal_neotropic","Negative or positive density-dependence in movements depends on climatic seasons: The case of a Neotropical marsupial","One of the major challenges in animal ecology is to understand the factors and processes driving movement behaviour. Although density may influence movement patterns, the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in animal movements are still unclear, particularly whether it may vary among populations of a species, or across time within a population. Here, we evaluate the occurrence and nature of density-dependence in the movements of a Neotropical marsupial, the Grey four-eyed opossum Philander frenatus (Didelphidae, Didelphimorphia). We quantified fine-scale path tortuosity of individuals inhabiting continuous forest areas and forest fragments, in different climatic seasons (humid vs. super-humid). We also determined the relative importance of population size compared to sex and body mass on movements, using a model-selection approach. In forest fragments, path tortuosity increased with population size in the super-humid season, but decreased in the humid season. In the continuous forest, path tortuosity was affected only by sex and body mass, being slightly higher in males and negatively related to body mass. The occurrence of density-dependence on movements only in forest fragments is likely to reflect the higher overall density of P.¬†frenatus in small forest fragments. The variation in the nature of density-dependence between climatic seasons is likely to reflect a trade off between foraging over large areas (humid season, low resource availability) versus avoiding agonistic encounters (super-humid season, high resource availability). Our results show that (i) density-dependence in movements may be context-dependent occurring only in areas of relatively high overall population density; and (ii) density may affect movements in different ways at different climatic seasons. ¬© 2018 Ecological Society of Australia","10.1111/aec.12666","2-s2.0-85053672644",3,0.651680373007663,0

Additionally, small boat surveys were conducted in the same region between 1989 and 2002 to gather photographic identification data on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) to examine movements and population structure. In the six years of ship survey effort, 706 sightings of 15 marine mammal species were made. Humpback whales were the most common large cetacean species and were seen every year and a total of 232 sightings of 402 animals were recorded during ship surveys. Highest numbers were observed in 2002, when there were 79 sightings of 139 whales. Line-transect estimates for humpback whales indicated that about 100 humpback whales inhabited these waters each year between 1995 and 2000; in 2002, however, the estimate was 562 (CV=0.21) whales. A total of 191 unique individuals were identified photographically and mark-recapture estimates also indicated that the number of animals increased from under 100 to over 200 from 1995 to 2002. There was only limited interchange of humpback whales between this area and feeding areas off Oregon and California. Killer whales were also seen on every ship survey and represented all known ecotypes of the Pacific Northwest, including southern and northern residents, transients, and offshore-type killer whales. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were the most frequently sighted small cetacean; abundance was estimated at 181-291 individuals, except for 2002 when we observed dramatically higher numbers (876, CV=0.30). Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) were the most common pinnipeds observed.

The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable. ¬© 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

From sightings of the six most commonly encountered cetacean species, seasonal, annual and overall density estimates were calculated. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted baleen whales with overall densities of 0.91/1000km2 (CV=0.27), 2.73/1000km2 (CV=0.19), and 1.17/1000km2 (CV=0.21) respectively. Species specific density estimates, stratified by cruise, were analyzed using a generalized additive model to estimate long-term trends and correct for seasonal imbalances. Variances were estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap with one day of effort as the sampling unit. Blue whales were primarily observed during summer and fall while fin and humpback whales were observed year-round with peaks in density during summer and spring respectively. Short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoidesdalli) were the most frequently encountered small cetaceans with overall densities of 705.83/1000km2 (CV=0.22), 51.98/1000km2 (CV=0.27), and 21.37/1000km2 (CV=0.19) respectively. Seasonally, short-beaked common dolphins were most abundant in winter whereas Pacific white-sided dolphins and Dall's porpoise were most abundant during spring. There were no significant long-term changes in blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, short-beaked common dolphin or Dall's porpoise densities while Pacific white-sided dolphins exhibited a significant decrease in density across the ten-year study. The results from this study were fundamentally consistent with earlier studies, but provide greater temporal and seasonal resolution. ¬© 2014 The Authors.","10.1016/j.dsr2.2014.10.008","2-s2.0-84921495236",7,0.866645744,1

This study includes new data on the biological diversity and abundance of the region and research and management recommendations. We conducted surveys and over 300 research SCUBA dives among the remote Phoenix Islands: Nikumaroro (Gardner), McKean, Manra (Sydney), Kanton (Aba-Riringa), Enderbury, Orona (Hull) and Rawaki (Phoenix), only excluding Birnie Island due to time limitations. Corals, benthic and mobile invertebrates, fishes, algae, sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals were surveyed at each site. Deep-sea life was sampled during seven deployments of an autonomous digital video camera system to 1,000 m depth at Kanton, Manra, and Orona. Coral reef and fish communities were surveyed using rapid assessment methods, small benthic fishes were collected using rotenone as a stunning agent, marine algae were collected by hand primarily during SCUBA dives, and a deepdrop collecting net was deployed to sample deep-sea animals. The reefs show evidence of the extreme isolation of these islands, pounded on three sides by the large ocean swells of the Pacific with only a narrow protected side to the west providing protection for anchorage. Coral species diversity of the islands was moderately high. While lacking in some corals dominant in other major reef areas, the reefs have interesting species assemblages, with prolific growth of some species normally subdominant in other reef areas. The reefs were in an excellent state of health, at the time of these surveys free from the bleaching that has plagued reefs in other parts of the Pacific recently and with no evidence of any coral diseases. Our data include new distribution records for species of algae, coral and fishes. Fish communities were abundant and diverse and included pelagic fishes such as tuna and oceanic mackerels. Significant populations of grey reef, whitetip reef, and blacktip reef sharks were also observed indicating a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Reef macropredators (trevally, Napoleon wrasse) were also abundant. The deep-sea camera recorded images of deep-water sharks including six-gilled and Pacific sleeper sharks. Marine mammal sightings include bottlenose dolphins, Pacific spinner dolphins, beaked whales (Mesoplodon spp.), and unidentified whales. Sea birds observed on Rawaki, McKean, Enderbury, and Orona Islands included tens of thousands of nesting spectacled terns (grey-backed), sooty terns, white fairy-terns, brown noddies, blue-grey noddies, masked boobies, brown boobies, red-footed boobies, red-tailed tropic birds, great frigate birds and lesser frigate birds.

Although the waters off Southern California have been surveyed extensively for marine mammals over the past 18 years, such surveys have been periodic and were conducted primarily from summer to fall, thereby missing potential seasonal shifts. We examined seasonal abundance and population density of cetaceans off Southern California from 16 shipboard line-transect surveys conducted quarterly during 2004-08. The study area consisted of 238,494 km2 of coastal, shelf, and pelagic oceanic habitat from nearshore waters to 700 km offshore. Based on 693 encounters of 20 cetacean species, abundance estimates by seasonal period (summer-fall or winter-spring) and depth (shallow: &lt;2000.5 m; deep: ‚â•2000.5 m) were determined for the 11 most commonly encountered species. The following are values of uncorrected density (individuals/1000 km2, coefficients of variation in parentheses) for the seasonal period and depth with greatest density for a selection of the species in this study: blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), summer-fall, shallow, 3.2 (0.26); fin whale (B. physalus), summer-fall, shallow, 3.7 (0.30); humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), summer- fall, shallow, 3.1 (0.36); short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), summer-fall, shallow, 1319.7 (0.24); long-beaked common dolphin (D. capensis), summer-fall, shallow, 687.9 (0.52); and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), winter-spring, deep, 48.65 (0.28).

Sampling intensity ranged between 20 and 80% for different sampling zones within the Bay, with a mean intensity of 40.5%. Population estimates for dugongs were corrected for perception bias (the proportion of animals visible in the transect that were missed by observers), and standardised for availability bias (the proportion of animals that were invisible due to water turbidity) with survey and species-specific correction factors. Population estimates for dugongs in Moreton Bay ranged from 503 ¬± 64 (s.e.) in July to 1019 ¬± 166 in January. The highest uncorrected count was 857 dugongs in December. This is greater than previous population estimates, suggesting that either previous surveys have underestimated abundance and/or that this population may have increased through recruitment, immigration, or a combination of both. The high degree of variation in population estimates between surveys may be due to temporal differences in distribution and herding behaviour. In winter, dugongs were found in smaller herds and were dispersed over a wider area than in summer. The Eastern Banks region of the bay supported 80-98% of the dugong population at any one time. Within this region, there were several dugong 'hot spots' that were visited repeatedly by large herds. These 'hot spots' contained seagrass communities that were dominated by species that dugongs prefer to eat. The waters of Rous Channel, South Passage and nearby oceanic waters are also frequently inhabited by dugongs in the winter months. Dugongs in other parts of Moreton Bay were at much lower densities than on the Eastern Banks.","10.1071/WR98082","2-s2.0-0141763557",9,0.830886639,0

This, in turn, might be affected by climatically driven change in the abundance of the species main prey, krill (Euphausia superba), on the feeding grounds. Annual data on southern right whale number of calves were obtained from aerial surveys carried out between 1997 and 2013 in southern Brazil, where the species concentrate during their breeding season. The number of calves recorded each year varied from 7 to 43 (= 21.11 ¬± 11.88). Using cross-correlation analysis we examined the response of the species to climate anomalies and krill densities. Significant correlations were found with krill densities (r = 0.69, p = 0.002, lag 0 years), Oceanic Ni√±o Index (r = '0.65, p = 0.03, lag 6 years), Antarctic Oscillation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01, lag 7 years) and Antarctic sea ice area (r = '0.68, p = 0.002, lag 0 years). Our results suggest that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success in southern Brazil by determining variation in food (krill) availability for the species. Therefore, increased frequency of years with reduced krill abundance, due to global warming, is likely to reduce the current rate of recovery of southern right whales from historical overexploitation.","10.1038/srep28205","2-s2.0-84975045802",40,0.775146741,0
"912","mammal_oceanic","Assessment of the seabird community of the Mozambique Channel and its potential use as an indicator of tuna abundance","Tropical seabirds are known to associate with aggregations of surface dwelling predators, like tunas when feeding. Some species are even regarded as near obligate commensals of tunas. As food is one of the main factors that shape breeding strategies and determine breeding success of seabirds, it is of interest to test the hypothesis that variations in tuna abundance may have effects on foraging success and thus on breeding parameters of tropical seabirds. The Mozambique Channel is appropriate for such a study because relative tuna abundance is assessed annually (through fishery catches) and seabird populations are abundant. A regional synopsis shows that at least 3.034 million pairs of seabirds breed on islands of the Mozambique Channel, 99.3% being sooty terns. This super-abundant seabird is strongly associated with tuna and marine mammals when feeding. More than 99% of the sooty tern population of the Mozambique Channel breeds at three remote coralline islands, namely Juan de Nova (66%), Europa (25%) and Glorieuses (9%). Various breeding parameters (breeding population size, breeding time, growth rate of the chicks, daily food intake, diet) are studied at these three sites in order to investigate their relation to the marine environment (including tuna abundance). A preliminary estimate is made of the quantity of food eaten by the sooty tern population. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"1013","mammal_oceanic","Large-scale predator control increases population viability of a rare New Zealand riverine duck","The introduction of mammalian predators to oceanic islands has led to dramatic declines in the abundance of many native species. Conservation management of these species often relies on low-cost predator control techniques that can be implemented over large scales. Assessing the effectiveness of such management techniques is difficult, but using population viability analyses (PVA), which identify the population growth rate (Œª) and extinction risk of threatened species, may offer a solution. PVA provide the opportunity to compare the relative effectiveness of various management options and can identify knowledge gaps to prioritize research efforts. We used PVA to assess the population viability of whio (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos), a rare riverine duck endemic to New Zealand. Current populations are threatened by introduced mammalian predators and are rapidly declining in both distribution and abundance. Whio conservation management is dominated by large-scale, low-intensity predator control, targeting introduced stoats (Mustela erminea). There is evidence that such control increases whio productivity but it is unknown if this increase is sufficient for long-term population persistence. We undertook a stochastic PVA to assess the viability of whio populations under different management scenarios using data obtained from a 6-year study of whio demographic responses to predator control. Populations with no predator control and low productivity will rapidly decline to extinction. Increasing productivity through predator control increased population viability but populations still showed a declining trajectory. A perturbation analysis showed that the growth rate of whio populations was largely driven by adult survival. Therefore, future research should target obtaining more robust estimates of adult survival, particularly how it is affected by predator control. Overall, our analysis indicated that large-scale predator control increases the short-term viability of whio populations but is insufficient for long-term population persistence. ¬© 2009 The Authors.

Assessment of their foraging habits was examined based on the isotopic analysis of pups (maternal indicators) (SIAR/ SIBER-R). Environmental variability between 2014 and 2015 was also analyzed, in terms of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration. Both otariids reached their highest abundance in July of both years; however, relative to 2014, the 2015 survey showed a 59.7% decline in the total GFS abundance and a 42.9% decrease of GFS pups, while total CSL abundance decreased 52.0% and CSL pup presence decreased in 61.7%. All monthly surveys for both otariids showed a similar trend (&gt;50% decrease in 2015). Compared to 2014, the 2015 GFSs isotopic niche was three times larger (2.0 in 2015, 0.6 in 2014) and the Œ¥13C was significantly lower. CSLs also showed significantly lower Œ¥31C and higher Œ¥15N in 2015. Interannual segregation was greater for CSLs, and their pup body mass was also significantly lower during the 2015 breeding season (mean = 8.7 kg) than in the same season of 2014 (mean = 9.9 kg). The decrease in Œ¥13C for both otariids reflected a more oceanic foraging; most likely associated with the decline in primary productivity in surrounding areas to the SBA, related to a higher SST caused by the 2015 ENSO, with a subsequent increase in foraging effort. These would explain the fewer observed individuals on land, especially pups, which showed diminished body condition (CSLs). This study highlights the importance of marine mammals as sentinel species that respond dynamically to changes in environment, providing valuable information on the effect of ENSO on pinnipeds in Mexican waters. ¬© 2016 Elorriaga-Verplancken et al.

In the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve of southern Chile the species is currently expanding in an area where the native fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial predators. To evaluate any emerging problems we therefore investigated seasonal variation in prey use by mink on Navarino Island within the Reserve. We identified undigested remains in 414 scats collected from the shores of 27 ponds over JanuaryNovember 2006. Diet consisted mainly of mammals and birds. Mammals, including both native and exotic rodents, were the predominant prey in all seasons but birds were of equal importance during the summer (when birds breed and their abundance and diversity increases on the island). Exotic rodents were the only identifiable mammalian prey item during winter. Native wetland birds constituted a substantial proportion of mink diet, and greater than that reported in other areas. Many birds breeding on Navarino Island are ground-nesting, a strategy that evolved in the absence of native mammalian predators. Considering the international importance of this region, our results emphasize the need for an assessment of the impact of mink predation on the populations of native prey. ¬© Fauna & Flora International 2009.","10.1017/S0030605308099997","2-s2.0-67349234507",48,0.761818988,0

Cod, once an abundant fish species that had been commercially exploited for many decades, declined precipitously during the mid-1980s onwards. This decline was attributed to climatic changes that affected the entire food chain from zooplankton to fish, sea birds and marine mammals. A monitoring programme was introduced, sampling cod by otter trawling using research vessels. The fish, after capture, were frozen at - 20¬∞C, subsequently thawed and the digestive tract removed and examined for the parasite in 2006. Data from samples taken in 1976, 1980-81, 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2003 were compared statistically with those collected in 2006. The results indicate a decline in the prevalence and mean abundance of E. gadi in 1986 with a minimum in 2000 but increasing gradually in 2003 and 2006. These changes were coincident initially with a decline of oceanic temperature and the entire food web, including capelin (Mallotus villosus), a preferred prey of cod and primary source of E. gadi. The increase in prevalence and mean abundance of the parasite in 2006 were associated with an increase of oceanic temperature and the return of small schools of capelin to offshore areas. Cod older than 4 years harboured a greater abundance of E. gadi than younger fish, while no difference was observed between the sexes. The results suggest that the abundance of E. gadi can be useful as a bioindicator of environmental changes in the north-western Atlantic. ¬© 2008 Cambridge University Press.","10.1017/S0022149X0897615X","2-s2.0-55949132378",14,0.754835992,1

We developed a temporally dynamic habitat model to predict wintering right whale distribution in the SEUS using a generalized additive model framework and aerial survey data from 2003/2004 through 2012/2013. We built upon previous habitat models for right whales in the SEUS and include data from new aerial surveys that extend the spatial coverage of the analysis, particularly in the northern portion of this wintering ground. We summarized whale sightings, survey effort corrected for probability of whale detection, and environmental data at a semimonthly resolution. Consistent with previous studies, sea surface temperature (SST), water depth, and survey year were significant predictors of right whale relative abundance. Additionally, distance to shore, distance to the 22uC SST isotherm, and an interaction between time of year and latitude (to account for the latitudinal migration of whales) were also selected in the analysis presented here. Predictions from the model revealed that the location of preferred habitat differs within and between years in correspondence with variation in environmental conditions. Although cow-calf pairs were rarely sighted in the company of other whales, there was minimal evidence that the preferred habitat of cow-calf pairs was different than that of whale groups without calves at the scale of this study. The results of this updated habitat model can be used to inform management decisions for a migratory species in a dynamic oceanic environment. ¬© 2014 Lihong et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0095126.g002","2-s2.0-84899700411",41,0.745970603,1

Despite 80% of the island being formally reserved for conservation, the island‚Äôs northern areas support a small, but rapidly growing human population that we expected would disturb the mammals and their foraging and movement behaviors. Hunting activities are also more frequent and severe on the north side of the island, closer to the villages. We tested the following hypothesis: the probability of occupancy, detectability, and abundance of mid-sized mammals will be higher in less-disturbed areas on southern parts of the island than in more-disturbed areas to the north. Ordination using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) highlighted that mammal assemblages were differentiated between the northern and southern slope areas, and regression analyses showed MDS scores to be associated strongly with an index of human population density. Occupancy models for Didelphis aurita, Dasypus novemcinctus, Dasyprocta leporina, and Cuniculus paca showed no effect of habitat covariates, but there were marked effects of human activity impact on the detection probability of all species, except D. aurita. Species detections and local abundances were higher in the less disturbed southern parts of the island. Our results support the notion that mid-sized mammals will change their movement and foraging behaviors as a function of human activities, even inside reserved, protected areas. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s11852-017-0544-2","2-s2.0-85027376138",43,0.740329169,0

Prey consumption varies annually and accordingly with the physical and biological environment surrounding each island Juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is the most common prey of northern fur seals from St Paul Island; the island is surrounded by a broad neritic environment with widely separated frontal zones and is the greatest distance from the continental shelf-edge. Gonatid squid (Gonatopsis horealis/Berryteuthis magister and Gonatus madokai/Gonatus middendorffi) were the most common prey of northern fur seals from Medny Island; the island is surrounded by a compressed neritic environment and is adjacent to the continental shelf-edge and the oceanic marine environment. A combination of walleye pollock and gonatid squid is consumed by northern fur seals from St. George Island; the island has a surrounding oceanographic environment intermediate between the other two islands. Variability in predation on walleye pollock is consistent with fishery information concerning the relative abundance and availability of walleye pollock around St George and St Paul Islands. The abundance and availability of these prey resources during the summer breeding season are key factors which influence the health and growth of the northern fur seal populations in the Bering Sea.",NA,"2-s2.0-0030809372",46,0.737235765,0
"1714","mammal_oceanic","The forgotten whale: A bibliometric analysis and literature review of the North Atlantic sei whale Balaenoptera borealis","A bibliometric analysis of the literature on the sei whale Balaenoptera borealis is presented. Research output on the species is quantified and compared with research on four other whale species. The results show a significant increase in research for all species except the sei whale. Research output is characterized chronologically and by oceanic basin. The species' distribution, movements, stock structure, feeding, reproduction, abundance, acoustics, mortality and threats are reviewed for the North Atlantic, and the review is complemented with previously unpublished data. Knowledge on the distribution and movements of the sei whale in the North Atlantic is still mainly derived from whaling records. Movement patterns and winter distribution are not clear. Surveys in some known summering areas show that the species has changed its distribution in parts of its previously known range. With the present information, it is impossible to determine whether or not the North Atlantic sei whale population is subdivided into biological units. Abundance estimates are fragmentary and cover a restricted part of the summering habitat. In the North Atlantic, sei whales seem to be stenophagous, feeding almost exclusively on calanoid copepods and euphausiids. On feeding grounds, they are associated with oceanic frontal systems, but how they find and explore these structures has not been fully investigated. The available data on vital rates are based on whaling-derived studies and are 25 years old or older. Despite increasing human and environmentally induced pressures, there are no current estimates for mortality and population trends. Current research needs include the clear definition of stock units, reliable abundance estimates, studies of distribution and migration that incorporate the identification of wintering areas, acquisition of up-to-date data on reproduction and mortality, and investigations into the consequences of environmental changes for the species. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

We sampled a small mammal community on a land-bridge island (Anchieta Island) along the Brazilian coast. We found only one marsupial Didelphis aurita (Wied-Neuwied, 1826) and two rodent species Oligoryzomys nigripes (Olfers, 1818) and Trinomys iheringi (Thomas, 1911) during 12 months of live trapping and 9195 trap-nights. The diversity of rodents and marsupials was not explained by species-area relations, indicating possible past extinctions. The abundance of D. aurita and O. nigripes was approximately three times higher, while the abundance of T. iheringi was approximately four times lower than abundances reported from other Brazilian Atlantic Forest sites. The population of D. aurita exhibited many phenotypic changes; males were on average 8 % smaller and females produced 30 % less litters than those from the mainland and other land-bridge islands. The long history of forest disturbance, habitat loss, reduction in forest productivity, and the recent introduction of mesopredators may be the major drivers that explain the small mammal community composition on this island. ¬© 2013 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","10.1515/mammalia-2011-0099","2-s2.0-84878148025",31,0.732423942,0
"1914","mammal_oceanic","Controlling invasive predators enhances the long-term survival of endangered New Zealand long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus): Implications for conservation of bats on oceanic islands","Invasive mammalian predators pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity globally, particularly on oceanic islands. However, little is known about the impacts of these invasive predators on bats (Chiroptera), one of the most specious mammal groups, and one of the most widespread groups of mammals threatened on oceanic islands (> 200 spp.). Nearly 50% of the world's threatened bats are island endemics and because they are often the only native mammals on islands, they fulfil important ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal. Long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are critically endangered because of predation by exotic mammals, particularly ship rats (Rattus rattus), introduced by humans to the island archipelago of New Zealand. We monitored the survival of bats in three colonies in temperate rainforest in Fiordland over 22 years. Since 2009, we controlled predators during irruption phases and compared survival of bats in previously untreated areas with survival in forest blocks treated using rodenticides deployed in bait stations. Survival was estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models in Program Mark 7.0 with > 15,000 bats tagged. Survival was primarily dependent on year and age of bats, although seedfall intensity of the dominant canopy tree and predator management was also influential. Survival in long-tailed bats was as high as, or higher, than figures for bats generally in years with low predator numbers or predator control. Survival was markedly higher in treatment years when predators were managed (0.82 compared to 0.55). Population modelling indicated managed colonies will increase (Œª > 1.05) whereas unmanaged colonies will decline (Œª = 0.89 ‚àí 0.98) under scenarios that reflect increased frequency of beech mast and predator irruptions. Thus, effective predator control is essential for recovering long-tailed bat populations. Warming temperatures indicate that predator irruptions are becoming more frequent, which would require more predator control in the future than at present if declines in bat populations are to be reversed. These results are relevant to the conservation of threatened bats on oceanic islands, given the abundance of exotic mammalian predators, particularly ship rats, on them. ¬© 2017","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.015","2-s2.0-85027719679",38,0.731413318,1

Therefore, their presence in shelf systems is a good indicator of productive food webs. Line-transect surveys of cetaceans conducted during the late 1990s in the SE Bering Sea (160.32 to 171.08¬∞ W) indicate that the middle shelf (50 m &lt; z &lt; 100 m) now supports the highest whale biomass in this region. In recent decades, whales were rare and hence their ecological role on the shelf was limited. During July 1997, the density and abundance (N) of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were highest on the middle shelf between 163.7 and 168.1¬∞ W: 0.0236 humpback whales km -2, N = 1308 (coefficient of variation, CV = 0.65), and 0.00924 fin whales km-2, N = 513 (CV = 0.61), respectively. Similarly, during June 1999, fin whales were the most numerically dominant species of large whale in the SE Bering Sea, with highest densities and abundance in the 'central' middle shelf (163.7 to 168.1¬∞ W): 0.0169 fin whales km-2, N = 938 (CV = 0.54). During the summers of 1997 and 1999, 65 and 79 % of the prey consumption by fin whales in the SE Bering Sea occurred on the central middle shelf. Prey biomass consumed by fin and humpback whales on the SE Bering Sea shelf and slope in 1997 (264474 to 723504 metric tons, mt) is equivalent to 34-94% of the 1997 echo-integration trawl estimate of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma biomass (age 1+) for the shelf east of 170¬∞ W (0.77 √ó 106 mt). Large whales were much more abundant on the middle shelf during the late 1990s than during preceding decades and, therefore, their foraging may have impacted trophic dynamics, carbon pathways and nutrient cycling. The partitioning of available carbon and energy in the pelagic and benthic systems of the shelf, as determined previously during the 1970s, when whales were rare, should now be reexamined relative to the increased ecological impact of these top-level predators. Fluxes of carbon that involve pathways through whales should be incorporated in shelf and oceanic carbon budgets.","10.3354/meps272281","2-s2.0-3042565851",29,0.729368671,1
"2115","mammal_oceanic","Population status, trends and a re-examination of the hypotheses explaining the recent declines of the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina","1. Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Vald√©s, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. ¬© 2005 Mammal Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2907.2005.00055.x","2-s2.0-13844250597",12,0.726245649,1

One hypothesis for the decline in this western Steller sea lion population is that a climate regime shift in 1976-1977 changed the species composition of the fish community and reduced the nutritional quality (energy density) of the sea lion prey field. This in turn led to nutritional stress and reduced individual fitness, survival, and reproduction of sea lions. Implications of this regime shift-""junk food"" hypothesis are that (1) the recruitment and abundance of supposed high quality species (e.g., Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi) decreased while those of supposed low quality (e.g., species in the family Gadidae) increased following the regime shift, (2) Steller sea lion diets shifted in response to this change in fish community structure, and (3) a diet composed principally of gadids (e.g., walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma) is detrimental to sea lion fitness and survival. We examine data relating to each of these implications and find little support for the hypothesis that increases in the availability and consumption of gadids following the regime shift are primarily responsible for the decline of the western population of Steller sea lion. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","10.1111/j.1748-7692.2005.tb01245.x","2-s2.0-20744454798",39,0.703699415,1
"2312","mammal_oceanic","Range expansion, population sizes, and management of wild pigs in California","The introduction and spread of nonnative organisms to new regions can disrupt ecosystems by causing declines or extinctions of native species. Widely introduced wild pigs (Sus scrofa) have contributed to declines and extinctions of numerous species on oceanic islands and can have pronounced negative ecological effects on mainland areas when population densities are high. Although range expansion by introduced wild pigs has ceased in many regions of the United States, it has increased significantly since the 1950s in California. Our analyses of data from annual hunter surveys and mapped locations of hunter-killed wild pigs shows that the distribution of wild pigs increased from around 10 coastal counties in the early 1960s to parts of 49 of California's 58 counties by 1996. An index to density based on locations of hunter-killed wild pigs plotted in a Geographic Information System (GIS) indicated that within the 79,550 km2 (25%) of the total land area of the state now occupied by wild pigs, populations are most abundant in the central and north-coast regions. By stratifying each county into 1 of 3 relative abundance classes and assigning density values based on research at multiple sites, we estimated there were around 133,106 (range = 106,485-159,727) wild pigs in California in 1996. The recent increase in the range of wild pigs in California was facilitated by a combination of multiple hunting-related introductions, deliberate releases of domestic pigs, and, possibly, increased forage availability associated with agricultural development. Natural range expansion also has occurred, however, and the dynamics of the spread of wild pigs in California appears typical of invasions observed among other organisms. Forage and water availability are important factors influencing the distribution and abundance of wild pigs in California, and predation may be important to an unknown extent. Up to 40% of California's wild pigs are removed from the population annually, which may control populations in some areas but not others. Wild pigs may be causing ecological damage in some coastal regions where population densities are very high, and detailed studies are needed in those areas to help mitigate potential problems with this increasingly widespread mammal in California.","10.2307/3802513","2-s2.0-0033042934",28,0.702030786,0

We identified and enumerated seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans along a replicated 1500 km survey path, representing 450 km2 of coastal and 2000 km 2 of oceanic habitat. Near-surface temperature (5 m depth) fluctuated considerably from year to year, in part due to the timing of the survey, with an early survey in 1996 and a late survey in 2002. Many species were observed across the entire gradient, particularly procellariiform (tubenose) seabirds and Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli). We observed peaks in abundance in the oceanic zone in 1998, 2001, and 2002, owing primarily to influxes of dark shearwaters (Puffinus spp.) and Leach's storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leuchora). Rank correlations indicated similar year-to-year changes in density between species, and species-specific responses to temperature and ocean productivity as indexed by nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations. We developed topographic/bathymetric models of habitat selection for the coastal zone. Although we found some distinct habitat preferences in this zone, overall we observed a continuum in the marine bird and mammal community across the entire eastern GOA. The strength of the coupling between coastal and oceanic environments as provided by variation in top predator dispersion appears related to large-scale variations in oceanography, though we have yet to fully investigate causal mechanisms. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Hete, the genetic uniqueness of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the eastern Baltic is evaluated in the light of new information on the distribution and abundance of Baltic and eastern North Sea populations during the last 11,000 yr, recent hunting statistics, and population counts. Archaeological records reveal that the Baltic population of harbor seals was founded about 8,000 yr ago. Adjacent populations in the North Sea areas were either small, or went extinct, and became significant only during the last 300 yr. This information generates the hypothesis that the Baltic population has been isolated during the last 8,000 yr, despite the lack of geographical barriers. We show that stochastic effects, isolation, and a documented recent population bottleneck can account for the low observed genetic variation in Baltic harbor seals. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","10.1111/j.1748-7692.2005.tb01260.x","2-s2.0-25844477044",30,0.673698967,0

Insights from coastal East Africa","Along the East African coast, marine top predators are facing an increasing number of anthropogenic threats which requires the implementation of effective and urgent conservation measures to protect essential habitats. Understanding the role that habitat features play on the marine top predator' distribution and abundance is a crucial step to evaluate the suitability of an existing Marine Protected Area (MPA), originally designated for the protection of coral reefs. We developed species distribution models (SDM) on the IUCN data deficient Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in southern Kenya. We followed a comprehensive ecological modelling approach to study the environmental factors influencing the occurrence and abundance of dolphins while developing SDMs. Through the combination of ensemble prediction maps, we defined recurrent, occasional and unfavourable habitats for the species. Our results showed the influence of dynamic and static predictors on the dolphins' spatial ecology: dolphins may select shallow areas (5-30 m), close to the reefs (< 500 m) and oceanic fronts (< 10 km) and adjacent to the 100m isobath (< 5 km).We also predicted a significantly higher occurrence and abundance of dolphins within the MPA. Recurrent and occasional habitats were identified on large percentages on the existing MPA (47% and 57% using presence-absence and abundance models respectively). However, the MPA does not adequately encompass all occasional and recurrent areas and within this context, we propose to extend the MPA to incorporate all of them which are likely key habitats for the highly mobile species. The results from this study provide two key conservation and management tools: (i) an integrative habitat modelling approach to predict key marine habitats, and (ii) the first study evaluating the effectiveness of an existing MPA for marine mammals in the Western Indian Ocean.

Intensive and replicated aerial surveys of seals on landfast ice were conducted during six spring seasons: for three seasons before island construction began (1997-1999); after a winter of intensive island construction (2000); and after more limited construction plus drilling (2001) and drilling plus oil production (2002). A Poisson regression model was used to examine seal densities relative to distance from Northstar after allowance for environmental covariates. Post hoc power analysis indicated that the study design and Poisson regression approach had high power to detect small-scale changes in seal densities near Northstar if such changes had occurred. However, seal densities during spring were not significantly affected by proximity to Northstar in 2000-2002. Habitat, temporal, and weather factors did have significant effects on seal densities. This study shows that effects of the Northstar oil development on local distribution of basking ringed seals are no more than slight, and are small relative to the effects of natural environmental factors. An understanding of environmental effects is essential when assessing potential impacts of industrial activity on ringed seals. ¬© 2005 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","10.1111/j.1748-7692.2005.tb01225.x","2-s2.0-18244373676",2,0.655187508,1

Shipboard surveys across a 150 000 km2 grid off the Antarctic Peninsula were conducted once or twice each year from 2003 to 2011 during which the distribution and abundance of top predators were mapped. We hypothesized that spatial organization of species richness and abundance hotspots reflect persistent habitat use and are regionalized according to distance from land and oceanographic boundaries. To test this, we used a new hotspot variance metric based on the percentage of time that the species richness or abundance estimate at any one location is greater than 1 standard deviation above the long term means for the entire survey grid. Species richness hotspots were based on all species sighted, while abundance hotspots were based on concentrations of 16 species: 13 seabirds (penguins, petrels and albatrosses), 1 pinniped and 2 baleen whales. Species abundance hotspots reflected 2 major groupings-those with oceanic and coastal origins. We identified 15 richness hotspots, 9 of which were in proximity to the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front; the 6 others were associated with major breeding colonies and the location of 2 submarine canyon systems.

Surprisingly, of the seven tags that successfully transmitted archived data, six were ingested by warm-gutted predators, as observed by a sudden increase in water temperature. Gut temperatures were in the range of 20 to 25¬∞C-too cold for marine mammals but within the range of endothermic fish. In order to identify the eel predators, we compared their vertical migratory behavior with those of satellite-tagged porbeagle shark and bluefin tuna, the only endothermic fishes occurring non-marginally in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. We accurately distinguished between tuna and shark by using the behavioral criteria generated by comparing the diving behavior of these two species with those of our unknown predators. Depth profile characteristics of most eel predators more closely resembled those of sharks than those of tuna. During the first days following tagging, all eels remained in surface waters and did not exhibit diel vertical migrations. Three eels were eaten at this time. Two eels exhibited inverse diel vertical migrations (at surface during the day) during several days prior to predation. Four eels were eaten during daytime, whereas the two night-predation events occurred at full moon. Although tagging itself may contribute to increasing the eel's susceptibility to predation, we discuss evidence suggesting that predation of silver-stage American eels by porbeagle sharks may represent a significant source of mortality inside the Gulf of St. Lawrence and raises the possibility that eels may represent a reliable, predictable food resource for porbeagle sharks. ¬© 2012 B√©guer-Pon et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0046830","2-s2.0-84867660709",15,0.60980934,0

This endangered seal is endemic to the north-western Hawaiian islands (NWHIs), where about 1300-1400 individuals are distributed among six main breeding subpopulations. A striking property in patterns of abundance among subpopulations is their spatial nature, a feature suggesting that these may be related to variation in the biotic marine environment. In examining linkages between trends in abundance at these subpopulations and the marine habitat of the NWHIs, an understanding of the relative importance of intrinsic or extrinsic regulatory processes to the long-term dynamics of the seal can be gained. Location The north-western Hawaiian islands (Hawaiian Archipelago). Methods Productivity of the seascape was mapped using both remotely sensed images and data collected during oceanographic cruises. Measurements included sea surface temperature (SST), vertical water column structure, integrated chlorophyll, and their respective levels of variability. The spatial structure and heterogeneity of both mean values and coefficients of variation of these variables were quantified statistically by calculating descriptive statistics for each block of a 20¬∞ √ó 10¬∞ grid (with 200 blocks of dimensions 1¬∞) overlain on each map, and computing spatial statistics for each variable (based on the summary statistics calculated for each block). Multivariate techniques were used to identify biogeographical regions within the pelagic landscape of the NWHIs. Monk seal trends among breeding sites within and among biogeographical regions were compared by analysing correlations among mean beach counts for each subpopulation. Results Primary productivity over the marine habitat of the Hawaiian monk seal was found to be non-uniform. A significant spatial pattern of primary productivity over the NWHIs, most apparent in a gradient along latitudinal lines, was documented. Multivariate groupings of environmental data partitioned the NWHIs into distinct biogeographical regions, and Hawaiian monk seal breeding areas can be differentiated on the basis of these. Regions with similar environments displayed synchronous variation in monk seal abundance. Main conclusions These findings suggest the local trends in monk seal abundance have ultimately been shaped by the quality of the surrounding marine environment. In assessing the dynamics of the Hawaiian monk seal as a whole, and notwithstanding the short-term and local effects of proximate mortality factors, extrinsic, ecosystem-level mechanisms appear to be important in shaping the long-term population dynamics of this endangered mammal. If that is the case, then environmental variation may also be an important determinant of the potential for recovery of these subpopulations and therefore for the entire species.","10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00451.x","2-s2.0-0034503181",19,0.587236499,1
"4110","mammal_oceanic","Patterns of abundance, population size structure and microhabitat usage of Paracentrotus lividus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea) in SW Portugal and NW Italy","In coastal habitats, wave exposure influences several aspects of the life history of marine organisms. Here, we assess how hydrodynamic conditions can generate variation in density, size structure and microhabitat usage of Paracentrotus lividus and whether these effects are consistent between regions that are markedly different for oceanic climate, such as the coasts of SW Portugal and NW Italy. The abundance of P. lividus was ~4 times higher in SW Portugal than in NW Italy, but within each region, there was no effect of wave exposure. In SW Portugal, higher urchin abundances were found at shallower depths, while no effect of depth on urchin abundance emerged in NW Italy. Most of the variation in urchin abundance occurred at small spatial scales (metres), and our results suggest that habitat complexity, that is, the presence of cracks and crevices, is an important determinant of patterns of distribution of this species. The population in NW Italy was characterized by a unimodal size distribution, with a higher proportion of medium-sized individuals. In contrast, in SW Portugal, smaller individuals represented a large proportion of the populations. Size structure varied between exposed and sheltered habitats in SW Portugal, suggesting that the proportion of individuals from different size cohorts may vary along wave-exposure gradients as a result of direct or indirect effects of hydrodynamic forces. In SW Portugal, most urchins occurred in burrows, while in NW Italy, urchins were mainly observed in crevices. These results suggest that creating/occupying burrows might be an adaptive behaviour that allows sea urchins to better withstand stressful hydrodynamic conditions and, therefore, are more common on exposed Atlantic coasts. Overall, our study suggests that the effects of hydrodynamic forces on sea urchin populations are context dependent and vary according to background oceanic climate. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s00227-013-2166-z","2-s2.0-84876452854",1,0.547124369,0
"455","mammal_oceanic","Cascading top-down effects of changing oceanic predator abundances","1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. ¬© 2009 British Ecological Society.","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01531.x","2-s2.0-66749121926",3,0.534185877,1
"477","mammal_oceanic","Combining aboriginal and non-aboriginal knowledge to assess and manage feral water buffalo impacts on perennial freshwater springs of the aboriginal-owned arnhem plateau, Australia","Aboriginal land managers have observed that feral Asian water buffalo (Bubalis bubalis Lydekker) are threatening the ecological and cultural integrity of perennial freshwater sources in Arnhem Land, Australia. Here we present collaborative research between the Aboriginal Rangers from Warddeken Land Management Limited and Western scientists which quantified the ground-level impacts of buffalo on seven perennial freshwater springs of the Arnhem Plateau. A secondary aim was to build the capacity of Aboriginal Rangers to self-monitor and evaluate the ecological outcomes of their land management activities. Sites with high buffalo abundance had significantly different ground, ground cover, and water quality attributes compared to sites with low buffalo abundance. The low buffalo abundance sites were characterized by tall herbaceous vegetation and flat ground, whereas wallows, bare ground, and short ungrazed grasses were indicators of sites with high buffalo abundance. Water turbidity was greater when buffalo abundance was high. The newly acquired monitoring skills and derived indicators of buffalo damage will be used by Aboriginal Rangers to assess the ecological outcomes of their future buffalo control efforts on the Arnhem Plateau. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","10.1007/s00267-010-9452-z","2-s2.0-77952096162",11,0.499040451,0
"524","mammal_oceanic","Community structure in pelagic marine mammals at large spatial scales","The understanding of a species' niche is fundamental to the concept of ecology, yet relatively little work has been done on niches in pelagic marine mammal communities. Data collection on the distribution and abundance of marine mammals is costly, time consuming and complicated by logistical difficulties. Here we take advantage of a data archive comprising many different datasets on the distribution and abundance of cetaceans from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Mexico in an effort to uncover community structure at large spatial scales (1000s of km). We constructed a multivariate ordination of the species data, tested for group structure that might exist within the ordination space, and determined how these groups might differ in environmental space. We examined 3 biogeographic regions: the oceanic waters north and south of Cape Hatteras, NC, and the Gulf of Mexico. North of Hatteras, we found 2 main groups split along a temperature and chlorophyll gradient, with most piscivores being found in cooler, more productive waters of the continental shelf, and most teuthivores being found farther offshore in warmer, less productive waters at the shelf break (200 m isobath). South of Hatteras, we found 3 groups, with the largest group being in warmer, lower chlorophyll waters that are closest to shore. In the Gulf of Mexico, we found 7 groups arrayed along a bottom depth gradient. We also tested the effect of taxonomically lumping different beaked whale species on ordination results. Results showed that when beaked whales were identified to the species level, they clustered out into distinct niches that are separate from those of other Odontocete groups. These results add to an increasing understanding of wildlife habitat associations and niche partitionings in the community structure of pelagic species, and provide important baseline information for future population monitoring efforts. ¬© Inter-Research 2011.","10.3354/meps09183","2-s2.0-79961086221",18,0.44883878,0
