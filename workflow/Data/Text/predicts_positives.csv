1,Bee diversity along a disturbance gradient in tropical lowland forests of south-east Asia,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Bees are believed to be dominant pollen vectors in tropical forests, yet studies specific
to bees in south-east Asia are rare. Regeneration and restoration of the rapidly disappearing
lowland forests of this region are reliant on bees, thus there is an urgent need
for forest bee data at the community level.
2. Bee communities of eight forested sites in Johor (Malaysia) and Singapore were
surveyed three times each from February to August 1999 at the below-canopy level.
These sites ranged from relatively undisturbed primary lowland dipterocarp forests to
late secondary forests and exotic forests, including an oil palm plantation. We attempted
to elucidate the environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees.
3. Bee abundance, in particular that of Apidae, was significantly higher in larger
primary forests than other types of forests. However, bee species richness was higher in
disturbed forests.
4. The distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables closely related to
forest disturbance and resource abundance, such as the density of big trees (diameter at
breast height 30–40 cm), temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs.
5. More stingless bees ( Trigona spp.) were found where trees were larger and ambient
conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower.
6. The differences between the bee communities in forests of urban Singapore and primary
forests in Johor may indicate that ecological processes in the forests of Singapore, in
particular pollination, may be changing. However, pollination may not be totally intact
in the primary forests surveyed, as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate.
7. The role of important pollinators, especially bees, for the long-term survival of tropical
lowland forests is poorly understood. Our study indicates that we urgently need more
thorough understanding of pollination and pollinators, as some bee species appear to
be disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests."
2,"Grazing intensity and the diversity of grasshoppers, butterflies, and trap-nesting bees and wasps",Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"The maintenance of grasslands as distinct habitats depends on regular management, usually
through grazing or mowing, but their species diversity is known to decline with increasing management intensity.
The reduction of management intensity can be a useful tool for the long-term conservation of the biological
diversity of grasslands. We analyzed floral and faunal diversity on intensively and extensively (unintensively)
grazed pastures and on 5- to 10-year-old ungrazed grasslands in northern Germany. Each of the
three grassland habitats differing in grazing intensity was replicated six times. We related diverse taxa such
as grasshoppers, butterfly adults and lepidopteran larvae, and trap-nesting solitary bees and wasps to vegetation
structure. There was an increase of species richness and abundance from pastures to ungrazed grasslands.
The percentage of parasitism of the most abundant trap-nesting species, the digger-wasp (
Trypoxylon
figulus
), was also higher on ungrazed grasslands. Decreased grazing on pastures enhanced species richness
for adult butterflies only, whereas the abundance of adult butterflies, solitary bees and wasps, and their natural
enemies increased. Although the differences in insect diversity between pastures and ungrazed grassland
could be attributed to a greater vegetation height and heterogeneity (bottom-up effects) on ungrazed areas,
the differences between intensively and extensively grazed pastures could not be explained by changes in vegetation
characteristics. Hence, intensive grazing appeared to affect the insect communities through the disruption
of plant-insect interactions. A mosaic of extensively grazed grassland and grassland left ungrazed for
a few years may be a good means by which to maintain biodiversity and the strength of trophic interactions."
3,Abundance and Diversity of Euglossine Bees in the Fragmented Landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,Scientific article,Biotropica,"Male euglossine bees were sampled with chemical baits every two months from September 1997 to July 1999 at nine
sites in the Desengano mountain range, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Four sites were located in Atlantic Forest mature
second growth, two sites in disturbed forest, and three sites in forest fragments
of 200, 156, and 14 ha, respectively.
We collected 3653 male euglossine bees from at least 21
species. Analyses of variance indicated no differences
among
the three habitat types for total number of bees, and 5 of the 6 dominant species. Bootstrapping
indicated significant
variation in
species richness and
diversity for some sites, but there was no clear indication of differences among
habitats. Similarity as measured with the Morisita-Horn index was inversely related to distance between sites, but
relatively high
for most site combinations. These results suggest that the
euglossine bee
community in the three
habitats was essentially the same. Although some species were associated with each habitat type, most appeared to
respond to
temporal local conditions. Our results do not support the hypothesis that forest fragmentation
or habitat
alteration reduces abundance and diversity of
euglossine bees"
4,Ecological specialization and susceptibility to disturbance: Conjectures and Refutations,Scientific article,The American Naturalist,"Niche breadth of species has been hypothesized to be
associated with species responses to disturbance. Disturbance is usually believed to affect specialists negatively, while generalists are believed to benefit from disturbance; we call this the specializationdisturbance hypothesis. We also propose an associated hypothesis
(the specialization-asymmetry-disturbance hypothesis) under which
both specialization and asymmetry of interactions would explain species responses to disturbance. We test these hypotheses using data
from a plant-pollinator system that has been grazed by cattle (i.e.,
a biological disturbance) in southern Argentina. We quantified specialization in species interactions, specialization of interaction partners, and species responses to disturbance. We found no relationship
between degree of specialization and a species response to disturbance. We also found that plant-pollinator interactions tend to be
asymmetric in this system; there was no relationship between the
degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of specialization of its interaction partners. However, asymmetry of interactions did not explain the variability in species responses to disturbance. Thus, both hypotheses are rejected by our data. Possible
reasons include failure to assess crucial resources, substantial direct
effects of disturbance, inaccurate measures of specialization, difficulty
detecting highly nonlinear relationships, and limitations of a nonexperimental approach. Or, in fact, there may be no relationship between specialization and response to disturbance."
5,Use of genetic markers to quantify bumblebee foraging range and nest density,Scientific article,Oikos,"Bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are important pollinators of crops and
wildflowers, but many species have suffered dramatic declines in recent decades.
Strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their foraging range and nesting
density, both of which are poorly understood. Previous studies have mainly focussed on
the cosmopolitan bumblebee species Bombus terrestris, and implicitly assume this to be
representative of other species. Here we use a landscape-scale microsatellite study to
estimate the foraging range and nesting density of two ecologically dissimilar species,
B. terrestris and B. pascuorum. Workers were sampled along a 10 km linear transect
and 8 -9 polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We
provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius
50 m in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for B. terrestris and 54.7 for B. pascuorum.
Estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species: 13 km
for B. terrestris and 193 km^2
for B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed
substantially, with B. pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 m and
B. terrestris less than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental
aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the development of
conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations, for the
management of bumblebees as pollinators, and for predicting patterns of gene flow
from genetically modified plants."
6,Wild bees in agroecosystems and semi-natural landscapes. 1997-2000 collection period in Italy,Scientific article,Bulletin of Insectology,"The diversity of the Italian bee fauna was investigated over a four-year period at 52 sites in 8 italian regions of Italy (Piedmont, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, Molise, Sicily, and Sardinia). A previously agreed sampling methodology was used, and the bee collection protocol was based upon the transept method. The sampling sites were chosen within an agricultural landscape. An account on data processing concerning 8,674 captured specimens is presented. Over one third of the known Italian fauna, i.e. 355 species, were recorded. Three species, Hylaeus kahri Förster, 1871, Förster, 1871, Lasioglossum subaenescens (Pérez, 1896) and Osmia niveibarbis Pérez, 1902, are new records, and 45 species showed an enlarged distribution area. Seventyone percent of the bee species collected in the Italian agroecosystems and semi-natural landscapes are distributed in the Palearctic ecozone. The remaining 29% of the bee species are present in Europe: some species mostly occur in Central Europe, whereas others occur also in the Mediterranean countries. The 74.6% (total No. 265) of the 355 censused species was present in agroecosystems, and 81.4% (total No. 289) in semi-natural landscapes. The bee fauna composition varies along the North-South direction of the peninsula, with Halictidae being more abundant in Northern Italy and Anthophoridae more abundant in the South."
7,Rain forest provides pollinating beetles for Atemoya crops,Scientific article,Horticultural Entomology,"Small beetles, usually species of Nitidulidae, are the natural pollinators of atemoya
(Annona squamosa L. x A. cherimola Mill. hybrids; custard apple) ßowers but commercial atemoya
growers often need to carry out labor-intensive hand pollination to produce enough high-quality fruit.
Because Australian rain forest has plant species in the same family as atemoya (Annonaceae) and
because many rain forest plants are beetle pollinated, we set out to discover whether tropical rain
forest in far north Queensland harbors beetles that could provide this ecosystem service for atemoya
crops. Orchards were chosen along a gradient of increasing distance from tropical rain forest (0.1Ð24
km). We sampled 100 ßowers from each of nine atemoya orchards and determined the identity and
abundance of insects within each ßower. To assess the amount of pollination due to insects, we bagged
six ßowers per tree and left another six ßowers per tree accessible to insects on 10 trees at an orchard
near rain forest. Results indicated that atemoya orchards0.5 km from rain forest were predominantly
visited by Þve previously unrecognized native beetle pollinators that are likely to originate in tropical
rain forest. These native beetles occurred reliably enough in crops near rain forest to have a positive
effect on the quantity of fruit produced but their contribution was not great enough to satisfy
commercial production needs. Management changes, aimed at increasing native beetle abundance in
crops, are required before these beetles could eliminate the need for growers to hand pollinate
atemoya ßowers. Appreciation of the value of this resource is necessary if we are to develop landscapes
that both conserve native biodiversity and support agricultural production."
9,Ecological and seasonal patterns in the diversity of a species-rich bee assemblage (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Apiformes),Scientific article,European Journal of Entomology,"Meaningful ecological studies on insect communities require sampling protocols that take into consideration temporal
fluctuations in abundance and species composition. Bees with their specific requirements for nutrition and nesting are good indicators of landscape structure and overall biodiversity, provided the ecological and seasonal patterns they show are taken into consideration. The present two year study traced the ecological and seasonal patterns on 2 km2 of a southern slope in the Swiss Alps, ranging from 1150 to 1550 m above sea level. The study area consisted mainly of grassland under different regimes, mostly hay meadows and pastures. By direct netting at five monthly intervals in each year a total of 247 bee species were recorded. This comprehensive sampling scheme identified one of the most diverse bee faunas in Central and Northern Europe, consisting of a statistically estimated 280 species. Most species were rare with 14.6% represented by a single individual. Ecological analysis of the bee community showed that the primitively eusocial species were over represented among the abundant species and the parasitic species among the rarest. Both abundance and species richness were subject to marked seasonal variations. A substantial turnover in species composition as well as changes in ecological patterns were observed. More than 25% of all species were recorded in only one of the two years, in particular many of the parasitic species. Singletons accounted for a higher proportion when individual years rather than the pooled data were analysed. All these findings underline the importance of season-long sampling and sampling over more than one year if bees are to be used as indicators in ecological and studies on bee communities."
10,Farming practices influence wild pollinator populations on squash and pumpkin,Scientific article,Field and Forage Crops,"Recent declines in managed honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colonies have increased
interest in the current and potential contribution of wild bee populations to the pollination of
agricultural crops. Because wild bees often live in agricultural Þelds, their population density and
contribution to crop pollination may be inßuenced by farming practices, especially those used to
reduce the populations of other insects. We took a census of pollinators of squash and pumpkin at 25
farms in Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland to see whether pollinator abundance was related to
farming practices. The main pollinators were Peponapis pruinosa Say; honey bees, and bumble bees
(Bombus spp.). The squash bee was the most abundant pollinator on squash and pumpkin, occurring
at 23 of 25 farms in population densities that were commonly several times higher than that of other
pollinators. Squash bee density was related to tillage practices: no-tillage farms hosted three times as
great a density of squash bees as tilled farms. Pollinator density was not related to pesticide use. Honey
bee density on squash and pumpkin was not related to the presence of managed honey bee colonies
on farms. Farms with colonies did not have more honey bees per ßower than farms that did not keep
honey bees, probably reßecting the lack of afÞnity of honey bees for these crops. Future research
should examine the economic impacts of managing farms in ways that promote pollinators, particularly
pollinators of crops that are not well served by managed honey bee colonies."
11,Proximity to rainforest enhances pollination and fruit set in orchards,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1.
Tropical rainforests are potential reservoirs of insects that could enhance crop pollination,
but only a few instances of the provision of such services by tropical rainforest
insects have been reported. Our field study aimed to determine the relative importance
of such insects to the pollination of macadamia
Macadamia integrifolia
and longan
Dimocarpus longan
crops on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland, Australia.
2.
We quantified initial fruit set, a measure of pollination success, in treatments
designed to assess the relative importance of the possible modes of pollination. The
treatments were applied in orchards that varied in distance from rainforest, in order to
compare the effects of the contrasting pools of available pollen vectors. We also
recorded the insect species present and estimated the number of visits each made to
flowers in crops near and far from rainforest.
3.
For both crops there was an interaction between pollination treatment and distance from
rainforest. Maximum fruit set was only achieved when pollen vectors had access to flow
-
ers and orchards were close to rainforest. Exclusion of pollinators near rainforest reduced
initial fruit set to a greater extent than exclusion of pollinators far from rainforest.
4.
We confirmed that pollen transfer in macadamia is by autogamous self-pollination
and by pollen vectors, but our design did not distinguish among pollen vectors. The only
abundant insects in macadamia orchards were honeybees
Apis mellifera
. There were
more honeybee visits to macadamia flowers in orchards near rainforest than far from
rainforest, but we detected no relationship between honeybee visits and initial maca
-
damia fruit set in our sample of observations on a per raceme basis. More detailed
studies are needed to identify the pollen vector responsible for enhanced pollination of
macadamia near rainforest.
5.
We established for the first time that pollen transfer in longan is by a combination of
autogamous self-pollination, wind and bees. Longan flowers were visited by stingless
bees and honeybees but only stingless bees had a positive relationship with initial longan
fruit set and higher visitation rates near rainforest than far from rainforest. This
suggests that enhanced pollination in longan near rainforest resulted primarily from a
more abundant supply of stingless bees from the rainforest.
6.
Synthesis and applications.
By demonstrating that tropical rainforest can act as a re
-
servoir of pollen vectors that benefit crops, our study highlights the existence of a largely
unrecognized resource available to agriculture. At the same time our results make a significant
contribution to the growing database of studies that underscore the importance
of tropical rainforest conservation. Policy and management aimed at sustainable use of
this resource would satisfy the goals both of agriculturalists, to improve crop yields, and
conservationists, to conserve tropical rainforest."
12,Effects of landscape elements on the distribution of the rare bumblebee species Bombus muscorum in an agricultural landscape,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The regional distribution pattern of Bombus muscorum was studied in an agricultural
landscape of central Germany, one of two remaining areas with the occurrence of this nationally
endangered species in the Land Hesse. To determine the landscape characteristics that facilitate the
occurrence of B. muscorum, grid-based observation records were analysed in a GIS environment at
a regional scale. A significantly negative effect of the number of trees on the occurrence of
B. muscorum and a significantly positive one of the proportion of arable land, strongly support the
species preference for open landscapes. Yet, apart from open landscapes additional landscape
features were shown to be important. A significantly positive effect of ditches in the final model
revealed the importance of this landscape element for the occurrence of B. muscorum. This finding
was additionally supported by recordings of nest-searching queens, nests, and flower visits along
dithes. The positive effects of clover and fallow land indicate the species need for suitable food
resources throughout the season. Because B. muscorum exhibits small foraging ranges, it is essential
that landscape elements that provide nesting sites, foraging habitats and undisturbed hibernation
structures are next to each other. The low numbers of individuals of B. muscorum recorded indicate
that the supply of these habitat elements may have reached a critical threshold in the study region."
13,Impacts of an agri-environment field margin prescription on the flora and fauna of arable farmland in different landscapes,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","The hypothesis that sown 6 m grass margins strips at the edges of arable fields have a positive impact on farmland biodiversity was tested using a paired field approach in southern England. A total of 42 fields were investigated, half with at least 3-year-old margin strips created under the UK agri-environment scheme Countryside Stewardship and half nearby control sites. The sites were grouped on the basis of average field size into small, intermediate or open landscape locations to examine landscape structure effects. Assessments of the flora, bird and territory numbers, bees, spiders, Orthoptera and Carabidae were made in early to mid-summer 2003. There were positive impacts on diversity
or abundance for the flora, bees and Orthoptera. The herbaceous flora of the pre-existing boundary adjacent to sown 6 m strips was significantly more species-rich than controls, probably reflecting a buffer effect of the strip. Bees and Orthoptera, the latter of which were only found in field boundaries, were more abundant where strips were sited, reflecting added habitat resources. Bee numbers were significantly lower in field centres where there were no 6 m margin strips. There were no significant effects of sown strips on numbers of birds observed or bird territories, spiders or Carabidae, but also no negative impacts. Lycosid spiders were consistently more abundant in boundaries of small
fields with 6 m margin strips. Linyphiidae were more abundant within the crop area of smaller fields. Amongst birds, wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) were also more abundant in small fields, while yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) were more abundant in open landscapes. The results confirm there are benefits to farmland biodiversity from introducing new margin strips at the edges of arable fields. More significantly, the success of agri-environment schemes, which will vary between taxa and species, can be dependent on landscape structure. Scheme administrators may need to address landscape structure and mean field size to achieve significant enhancement of populations of declining farmland species."
14,Are urban parks refuges for bumble bees Bombus spp. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)?,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Declines in bee populations have been documented in several parts of the world. Bees are
dependent upon flowering plants for resources, and flowering plants often depend upon
bees for pollination services. Bees can therefore serve as indicator species of habitat degradation
due to these relationships with flowering plants. This study investigates how the
bumble bee community in San Francisco has responded to urbanization and which urban
park characteristics are important for the current communitys structure. To answer these
questions we sampled bumble bees, in 18 urban parks and two nearby wild parks. We estimated
park characteristics and used multiple regression analysis to determine which characteristics
predicted bumble bee abundance and species richness. Bumble bee abundance
was positively associated with resource availability or proxies of resource availability; natural
area (areas that contain remnant fragments that have been largely unchanged by
human activity) in 2003 and nest site abundance and openness of the surrounding matrix
in both 2003 and 2004. Bumble bee species richness was negatively associated with abundance
of a dominant species, Bombus vosnesenskii, in 2004. The importance of the surrounding
matrix suggests that these parks do not act as islands. Accordingly, area of park did not
explain species richness, while abundance of the dominant competitor did. The species
that was most influenced by competition, Bombus sitkensis, uses rodent holes as nest sites
and is possibly excluded from nest sites by the early emerging B. vosnesenskii, another subterranean
nester. The species least influenced by competition, Bombus melanopygus, is able
to use both rodent holes and abandoned bird nests as nest sites"
15,"Patch and landscape factors shape community assemblage of bumble bees, Bombus spp. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), in montane meadows",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Understanding the scale at which habitat influences species richness in terrestrial ecosystems
is central to both ecology and conservation biology [Wettstein, W., Schmid, B., 1999.
Conservation of arthropod diversity in montane wetlands: effect of altitude, habitat quality
and habitat fragmentation on butterflies and grasshoppers. Journal of Applied Ecology, 36,
363373]. Community composition may be influenced by habitat variation at patch and/or
landscape-scales depending on the body size, home range area, and dispersal distances of
the focal taxa [Calder III, W.A., 1984. Size, function, and life history. Harvard University
Press, Cambridge, MA; Haskell, J.P., Ritchie, M.E., Olff, H., 2002. Fractal geometry predicts
varying body size scaling relationships for mammal and bird home ranges. Nature 418,
527530; Thomas, C.D., 2000. Dispersal and extinction in fragmented landscapes. Proceedings
of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B 267, 139145], not merely their phylogenetic
affinity. We investigated the importance of habitat variables at different scales on
the richness and abundance of bumble bees both annually and seasonally in Sierran montane
meadows over two years. We found that both patch and landscape factors influence
the species richness and abundance of bumble bees and these factors have a seasonal component
to their importance. The proportion of meadow in the surrounding habitat was the
most consistent positive influence on both species richness and abundance across years. In
the second year, 2003, patch factors, plant species richness and current livestock grazing
also influenced bumblebee species richness; plant species richness was positively correlated
and current livestock grazing was negatively correlated with bumble bee species richness.
Bumble bee abundance was positively influenced by meadow wetness and proportion
of meadow in the surrounding habitat in both years. These data suggest conservation of
pollinators depends on conservation planning with attention to the quality and context
of the landscape."
16,Genetic diversity and mass resources promote colony size and forager densities of a social bee (Bombus pascuorum) in agricultural landscapes,Scientific article,Molecular Ecology,"Although habitat fragmentation and agricultural intensification are known as threads to
pollinator diversity, little is known about consequences for population size and genetic
diversity. Here, we combined detailed field observations, molecular approaches and
GIS-based quantification of landscape structure (measured by proportions of seminatural
habitats and proportions of mass flowering crops) to get new insights into driving forces
of population dynamics of the bumblebee species
Bombus pascuorum
. Comparing 13 agriculturally
dominated landscape sectors, we found the proportion of mass flowering crops
to positively influence bumblebee abundance whereas the proportion of seminatural
habitats was of minor importance. We used microsatellites to quantify landscape-related
colony densities, inbreeding and population substructure. Detected colony densities did
not correlate with landscape parameters or with local worker abundance, measured by
field observations. These results indicate that increased worker abundances within
landscapes are rather due to greater colony sizes than due to an increased number of nests.
We found significant population substructure, measured by
FST and seven landscapesectors to bear significantly increased inbreeding values (FIS).FIS was strongly varyingbetween sectors but did not correlate with landscape structure. Moreover,FIS had asignificantly negative effect on colony size, demonstrating the importance of genetic
diversity on population fitness at a landscape scale. We suggest that inbreeding levels
might be related to the temporal variation of food resources and population sizes in
agricultural landscapes."
17,"Patch size and landscape effects on pollinators and seed set of the Horseshoe Vetch, Hippocrepis comosa, in an agricultural landscape of Central Europe",Scientific article,Entomologia Generalis,"Agricultural land use intensifi cation has caused a considerable decline of once common semi-natural 
habitats leaving only small and isolated habitat remnants within a homogeneous landscape matrix. 
Populations of fl owering plant species in these remaining habitat fragments are also declining and 
can not offer suffi cient resources for potential pollinators. The loss of pollinators and consequential 
pollination limitation is especially severe for obligately out-crossing plant species. In this study, pollination and reproductive success of Hippocrepis comosa was examined. Hippocrepis comosa L is a 
self-incompatible, declining plant species occurring on fragmented remnants in semi-natural calcareous 
grassland habitats in an agricultural landscape in Southern Lower Saxony, Germany. Plant-pollinator 
interactions were analysed in small, medium, and large plant patches in 15 differently sized calcareous 
grassland fragments surrounded by landscape matrices of differing complexity. Flower visitors were 
observed during three 15-minute observations, pollen supplementation experiments were performed 
to test for pollination limitation, and fruits from the plant patches were collected to calculate seed 
set. Hippocrepis comosa showed evidence of pollination limitation because hand-pollinated fl owers 
set more seeds per infl orescence than open-pollinated fl owers and seed set was strongly reduced by 
decreased visitation rates. Pollinators were most abundant in large patches and in diverse landscapes. 
Visitation rate was not affected by patch size. Hence, in order to maintain plant-pollinator interactions in an agricultural landscape, conservation efforts should include the preservation of calcareous 
grasslands that can support suffi ciently large patches of a plant species and offer ample rewards for 
pollinators and the establishment of a diverse agricultural landscape around the semi-natural habitats 
that will further enhance pollinator abundance."
18,Semi-natural grasslands as population sources for pollinating insects in agricultural landscapes,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1.
In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very
small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these
small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed
there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at
least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments.
2.
We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes
in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed
abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat
(uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear
habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch.
3.
Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble
bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover,
butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the
linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate
linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density
was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference
in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats.
4.
For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of
semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to
the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness
in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher
density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the
density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest.
5.
 Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural
practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order
to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed
agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural
grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential."
19,Effect of human disturbance on bee communities in a forested ecosystem,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"It is important for conservation biologists to understand how well species persist in humandominated
ecosystems because protected areas constitute a small fraction of the Earths surface and because
anthropogenic habitats may offer more opportunities for conservation than has been previously thought. We
investigated how an important functional group, pollinators (bees; Hymenoptera: Apiformes), are affected by
human land use at the landscape and local scales in southern New Jersey (U.S.A.). We established 40 sites
that differed in surrounding landscape cover or local habitat type and collected 2551 bees of 130 species. The
natural habitat in this ecosystem is a forested, ericaceous heath. Bee abundance and species richness within
forest habitat decreased, not increased, with increasing forest cover in the surrounding landscape. Similarly,
bee abundance was greater in agricultural fields and suburban and urban developments than in extensive
forests, and the same trend was found for species richness. Particular species groups that might be expected
to show greater sensitivity to habitat loss, such as floral specialists and bees of small or large body size, did
not show strong positive associations with forest habitat. Nevertheless, 18 of the 130 bee species studied were
positively associated with extensive forest. One of these species is a narrow endemic that was last seen in 1939.
Our results suggest that at least in this system, moderate anthropogenic land use may be compatible with the
conservation of many, but not all, bee species."
20,Indicators for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes: a pan-European study,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1.
In many European agricultural landscapes, species richness is declining considerably. Studies
performed at a very large spatial scale are helpful in understanding the reasons for this decline and
as a basis for guiding policy. In a unique, large-scale study of 25 agricultural landscapes in seven
European countries, we investigated relationships between species richness in several taxa, and the
links between biodiversity and landscape structure and management.
2.
We estimated the total species richness of vascular plants, birds and five arthropod groups in
each 16-km
2
landscape, and recorded various measures of both landscape structure and intensity
of agricultural land use. We studied correlations between taxonomic groups and the effects of
landscape and land-use parameters on the number of species in different taxonomic groups. Our
statistical approach also accounted for regional variation in species richness unrelated to landscape
or land-use factors.
3.
The results reveal strong geographical trends in species richness in all taxonomic groups. No
single species group emerged as a good predictor of all other species groups. Species richness of all
groups increased with the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Species richness of birds
and vascular plants was negatively associated with fertilizer use.
4.
Synthesis and applications.
We conclude that indicator taxa are unlikely to provide an effective
means of predicting biodiversity at a large spatial scale, especially where there is large biogeographical
variation in species richness. However, a small list of landscape and land-use parameters can be used
in agricultural landscapes to infer large-scale patterns of species richness. Our results suggest that
to halt the loss of biodiversity in these landscapes, it is important to preserve and, if possible,
increase the area of semi-natural habitat."
21,How can we preserve and restore species richness of pollinating insects on agricultural land?,Scientific article,Ecography,"During recent decades, concern about the loss of biodiversity on agricultural land has increased, and semi-natural
grasslands have been highlighted as critical habitats. Temperate European agricultural landscapes require distinct and
appropriate management to prevent further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent for
pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our aim was to examine how species richness of three
important groups of pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are related to different farm
characteristics, and if there are any differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if red-listed species
are related to any farm characteristics. Species richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all seminatural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50 km^2 in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species richness of solitary bees
increased with the area of semi-natural grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural grassland
species richness was strongly positively related with the density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with
the proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed
solitary bees was positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after mid-July) and decreased with
increased farm isolation. The number of burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation height, flower
density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with
traditional hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting traditional hay-meadows, late
extensive grazing and the herb K. arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high species richness
of pollinating insects and support red-listed species. Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be
used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects."
22,"Diet breadth, coexistence and rarity in bumblebees",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Factors that determine the relative abundance of bumblebee species remain
poorly understood, rendering management of rare and declining species difficult. Studies of
bumblebee communities in the Americas suggest that there are strong competitive interactions
between species with similar length tongues, and that this competition determines
the relative abundance of species. In contrast, in Europe it is common to observe several
short-tongued species coexisting with little or no evidence for competition shaping community
structure. In this study we examine patterns of abundance and distribution in one of
the most diverse bumblebee communities in Europe, found in the mountains of southern
Poland. We quantify forage use when collecting nectar and pollen for 23 bumblebee
species, and examine patterns of co-occurrence and niche overlap to determine whether
there is evidence for inter-specific competition. We also test whether rarity can be
explained by diet breadth. Up to 16 species were found coexisting within single sites, with
species richness peaking in mountain pasture at *1,000 m altitude. Results concur with
previous studies indicating that the majority of pollen collected by bumblebees is from
Fabaceae, but that some bee species (e.g. B. ruderatus) are much more heavily dependent
on Fabaceae than others (e.g. B. lucorum). Those species that forage primarily on Fabaceae
tended to have long tongues. In common with studies in the UK, diet breadth was correlated
with abundance: rarer species tended to visit fewer flower species, after correcting
for differences in sample size. No evidence was found for similarity in tongue length or
dietary overlap influencing the likelihood of co-occurrence of species. However, the most
abundant species (which co-occurred at most sites) occupied distinct dietary niche space.
While species with tongues of similar length tended, overall, to have higher dietary niche
overlap, among the group of abundant short-tongued species that commonly co-occurred
there was marked dietary differentiation which may explain their coexistence."
23,At what spatial scale do high-quality habitats enhance the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes?,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives
to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in
intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by
scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated
up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches)
fect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands.
We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in
ansects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in
landscapes dominated by agriculture.
In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects
on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects.
Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover
flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further
declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density
and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only
the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch.
 In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more
undant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do
enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively
small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or
gricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration
in intensivelyused farmlandshould thereforebe implemented preferentiallyin the immediate vicinity of
high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative
to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland."
24,Diversity and abundance of bees (Hymenoptera : Apiformes) in native and ruderal grasslands of agriculturally dominated landscapes,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","This study examined bee communities by sweep-net and pan-trap sampling and quantified the number of ramets of floral resources in
native tallgrass prairie fragments and nearby ruderal areas (within 2.1 km) in Iowa, USA in the summer of 2004. Bee communities in ruderal
areas were significantly less diverse than those in native tallgrass prairie remnants, with about half as many species and approximately a third
as many bees. Diversity, abundance, and richness of floral resources were also significantly less in ruderal grasslands than in native prairies,
indicating that poor floral resource levels may substantially depauperate their bee communities. Common bees dominated the composition of
the ruderal grasslands; only one rare species in this study was found at a ruderal site, indicating that high-quality prairie remnants are
important reservoirs of bee diversity. Abundance of flowering ramets of a plant species was a significant predictor of the abundance of bees
found on that plant. There was also a preference for human-yellow flowers after adjusting for ramet abundance and there were significantly
more bees caught in yellow pan traps than blue or white ones. The abundance, but not the richness, of small bee species (length  7.5 mm) was
less than expected at ruderal sites when compared to prairies, implying the presence of local nesting opportunities in ruderal grasslands for
small bees but insufficient resources to support large populations."
25,"Isolation from forest reduces pollination, seed predation and insect scavenging in Swiss farmland",Scientific article,Landscape Ecology,"Habitat loss and fragmentation lead to
changes in species richness and composition which
may affect ecosystem services. Yet, few studies
distinguish between the effects of habitat loss and
isolation, or how multiple ecosystem services may be
affected simultaneously. We investigated the effects
of variation in cover of woody and open semi-natural
habitats and isolation from forest on the relative
functioning of pollination, seed predation and insect
scavenging in agricultural landscapes. We established
30 sites in grassland locations in the Swiss plateau
around Berne. The sites varied independently in their
isolation from forest edges, in the percentage of
woody habitats and in the percentage of open seminatural
habitats in the surrounding landscape (500 m
radius). We experimentally exposed primroses,
sunflower seeds and cricket corpses during spring
2008. None of the three studied services was affected
by variation in woody or open semi-natural habitat
cover. However, the proportion of flowers setting
seed was significantly reduced by isolation from
forest. Further, seed predation and insect scavenging
were significantly lower at isolated sites than at sites
connected to woody habitat. This pattern was particularly
pronounced for seeds and insect corpses that
were enclosed by wire netting and thus inaccessible
to vertebrates. Thus, all three studied services
responded quite similarly to the landscape context.
The observed small-scale determination of seed set,
seed predation and insect scavenging contrasts with
larger-scale determination of pollination and insect
pest control found in other studies."
26,"Wild bee abundance and pollination service in cultivated pumpkins: farm management, nesting behavior and landscape effects",Scientific article,Journal of Economic Entomology,"Recent declines in managed and feral honey bee populations have greatly increased
interest in the current and potential role of wild pollinators in agricultural pollination. Pumpkin
(Cucurbita pepo L.) has great potential to be served by wild pollinators because of a reliable and
widespread group of bee species that are commonly associated with their ßowers, including bumble
bees (Bombus spp.), and, in the Americas, two genera of specialist ground nesting bees (Peponapis and
Xenoglossa). We examined the effects of several key farm management practices and landscape
variables on bee abundance in pumpkin on 20 farms in Virginia and Maryland during summer 2006.
Weevaluated bee abundance with respect to tillage, irrigation practices, soil properties, natural habitat
(forest and grassland), ßowering crop, and disturbed areas. Additionally, we examined nest site
preference (within or outside of crop areas) of Peponapis pruinosa (Say) at one farm and in a large
screenhouse. We found P. pruinosa nesting preferentially within crop areas and near the vines and
leaves of their host plant. Although these bees typically place some of their brood cells within tillage
depth, we did not Þnd a tillage effect on their abundance at ßowers. We found a negative effect of
soil clay content (R2  0.24, P  0.03) and a positive effect of irrigation (F1, 15  12.2; P  0.001) on
P. pruinosa abundance. Using published data on pollinator visitation requirements, we found wild bee
densities were sufÞcient to fully pollinate all pumpkin ßowers on 13Ð17 of the 20 farms studied."
27,Bumblebee nest density and the scale of available forage in arable landscapes,Scientific article,Insect Conservation and Diversity,"1. Combining the needs of agricultural production with enhancing biodiversity
requires a landscape-scale approach since the geographic scale at which most non-farmed
species operate is unconstrained by farm boundaries. Bumblebees are a key component
of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors
determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood.
2. Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular markers, we
quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans and non-cropped areas, all of
which provide suitable bumblebee forage), at various spatial scales to find the best
predictor of colony density for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable
landscape.
3. Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat
categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant relationships were found for
greater or lesser distances. This concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of
this species. We found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability,
although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility.
4. It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural
landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report a direct relationship
between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area.
Importantly, we suggest that the forage availability within the previously published
estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good predictor of the scale
of impact of forage provision on nesting density.
Key words. Bombus pascuorum, forage availability, foraging range, kinship, mass
flowering crops, microsatellites, nest density."
28,Pollinator diversity increases fruit production in Mexican coffee plantations: The importance of rustic management systems,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Pollination is an ecological process that provides important services to humans. Pollination service in
agroecosystems depends on several factors, including the land management systems used by farmers.
Here we focused on the effects of insect pollinator diversity on coffee fruit production along a gradient of
management systems in central Veracruz, Mexico. The gradient ranged from low environmental impact
management systems (the native forest is not completely removed) to high environmental impact
management systems (the native forest is completely removed). We hypothesized that pollinator
diversity should be higher in low-impact systems. Then, if fruit production is positively related to
pollinator diversity, plantations with low-impact management systems should display higher fruit
production than plantations with high-impact management systems. We used observational and
experimental data to test this hypothesis. Our results indicated that low-impact management systems
have higher species richness and relative diversity (measured with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index)
of pollinators than high-impactmanagement systems. In all cases, fruit production was positively related
with species richness and diversity of pollinators. Moreover, fruit production was higher in low-impact
than in high-impact management systems. These results suggest that the diversity of insect pollinators
can be influenced by the management system applied by farmers, and that such effects may have strong
consequences on coffee fruit production."
29,Effects of ecological compensation meadows on arthropod diversity in adjacent intensively managed grassland,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"An important goal of ecological compensation areas (ECAs) is to increase biodiversity in adjacent intensively
managed farmland and the agricultural landscape at large. We tested whether this goal can be
achieved in the case of the agri-environmental restoration scheme implemented for Swiss grassland
using five large arthropod taxa (bees, true bugs, orthopterans, ground beetles and spiders) representing
different ecological and functional groups. The species richness and abundance of all groups and species,
respectively, was measured along 100 m transects from ECA-meadows into the adjacent intensively managed
grassland at 24 sites. Species richness of all arthropod taxa except ground beetles, and the abundance
of 63% of the 234 arthropod species sampled with at least five individuals were higher in ECAmeadows
than in their surroundings, while the total abundance of spiders and ground beetles was higher
in intensively managed meadows. The abundance of 8% of these species were only increased in the ECAmeadows
themselves (stenotopic species) but 40% had increased abundance both in the ECA-meadows
and the adjacent grassland, declining exponentially with increasing distance from ECA-meadows (edge
species). The 90%-decay distances for these edge species differed among taxonomic groups (117 ± 18 m
for true bugs, 137 ± 24 m for spiders, 152 ± 34 m for bees, 167 ± 5.7 m for orthopterans, 185 ± 34 m for
ground beetles; mean ±1 standard error) and independent of taxonomic group were larger for large-sized
or predacious species than for small-sized or phytophagous species. Because the average distance
between neighbouring ECA-meadows in Swiss grassland is only 73 ± 4 m, the current agri-environment
scheme very likely enhances arthropod diversity and possibly associated ecosystem services in the Swiss
agricultural landscape at large."
30,"Landscape effects on extremely fragmented populations of a rare solitary bee, Colletes floralis",Scientific article,Molecular Ecology,"Globally, there is concern over the decline of bees, an ecologically important group of
pollinating insects. Genetic studies provide insights into population structure that are
crucial for conservation management but that would be impossible to obtain by
conventional ecological methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily
focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary bees. Here, we
investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary
mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was
surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme
northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south.
Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus FST
was up to 0.53, and G0
ST and Dest were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively).
A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears
to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit
isolation by distance. C. floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in
regional migration-drift equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals
urban areas as a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight the
need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline of this and potentially
other rare solitary bees."
31,Effects of land use at a landscape scale on bumblebee nest density and survival,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. We have little idea how landscape-scale factors inﬂuence the success of wild bumblebee nests
over time. Here for the ﬁrst time we use molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the
numbers of nests.
2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late May–June and
late July–August, and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated. We compare
the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which
allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best ﬁt to our data.
Changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival.
3. The two bee species appeared to diﬀer markedly in survival over time, with estimates of 45%of
nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius and 91% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that
the foraging range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us to overestimate
nest survival in this species. Diﬀerential survival may also reﬂect diﬀerences in phenology
between the two species.
4. The land use class which had the most consistent eﬀects on nest number and survival was gardens;
for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens within a 750 and 1000 mradius positively inﬂuenced nest
survival, while for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more
gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum, the area of grassland within a 250 and
500-mradius also positively inﬂuenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the preferred
nesting habitat for this species.
5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now
provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore,
our data suggest that the positive inﬂuence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill
over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland.
6. Synthesis and applications. The substantial eﬀects that even small areas of local resources such
as rough grassland or clover leys can have on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear
relevance for the design of pollinator management strategies."
33,Effects of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on local pollinator diversity and species turnover across a precipitation gradient,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Anthropogenic habitat disturbance can have profound effects on multiple
components of forest biotas including pollinator assemblages. We assessed the effect of
small-scale disturbance on local richness, abundance, diversity and evenness of insect
pollinator fauna; and how habitat disturbance affected species turnover across the landscape
and overall diversity along a precipitation gradient in NW Patagonia (Argentina).
We evaluated the effect of disturbance on overall pollinator fauna and then separately for
bees (i.e. Apoidea) and non-bee pollinators. Locally, disturbed habitats had significantly
higher pollinator species richness and abundances than undisturbed habitats for the whole
pollinator assemblage, but not for bees or non-bees separately. However, significant differences
in species richness between habitats vanished after accounting for differences in
abundance between habitat types. At a local scale ShannonWeaver diversity and evenness
did not vary with disturbance. A b diversity index indicated that, across forest types,
species turnover was lower between disturbed habitats than between undisturbed habitats.
In addition, rarefaction curves showed that disturbed habitats as a whole accumulated
fewer species than undisturbed habitats at equivalent sample sizes. We concluded that
small patches of disturbed habitat have a negligible effect on local pollinator diversity;
however, habitat disturbance reduced b diversity through a homogenization of the pollinator
fauna (in particular of bees) across the landscape."
34,Crofting and bumblebee conservation: The impact of land management practices on bumblebee populations in northwest Scotland,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"The northwest of Scotland is a stronghold for two of the UKs rarest bumblebee species, Bombus distinguendus and Bombus muscorum. The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is
crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial to a wide range of flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee
populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of
our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance
and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific bird and bee conservation
seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of
bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species
were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which
promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland
areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted
areas."
35,Changing bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages along an urban-rural gradient,Scientific article,PLOS ONE,"Background: The potential for reduced pollination ecosystem service due to global declines of bees and other pollinators is
cause for considerable concern. Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have
historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global
urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed
changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban,
suburban, and rural sites across a UK city.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character
(churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter
from wind, diversity and abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.g. percentage of built
landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The
diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization.
Assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and
suburban land-use, but more species negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat
quality, in particular the availability of flowering plants.
Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this
capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the
assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of
different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that
complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely
applicable."
37,Enhancing habitat to help the plight of the bumblebee,Scientific article,Pest Management Science,"Modern farming has caused considerable declines in UK bumblebee populations, and, while options exist for farmers to

38,Patterns of widespread decline in North American bumble bees,Scientific article,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Bumble bees (Bombus) are vitally important pollinators of wild
plants and agricultural crops worldwide. Fragmentary observations,
however, have suggested population declines in several North
American species. Despite rising concern over these observations
in the United States, highlighted in a recent National Academy of
Sciences report, a national assessment of the geographic scope and
possible causal factors of bumble bee decline is lacking. Here, we
report results of a 3-y interdisciplinary study of changing distributions,
population genetic structure, and levels of pathogen infection
in bumble bee populations across the United States. We compare
current and historical distributions of eight species, compiling a database
of >73,000 museum records for comparison with data from
intensive nationwide surveys of >16,000 specimens. We show that
the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to 96%
and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by 23
87%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations
have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian
pathogen Nosemabombi and lower genetic diversity compared
with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species.
Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus,
realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North
America, although cause and effect remain uncertain."
39,Microsatellite analysis reveals the spatial dynamics of Bombus humilis and Bombus sylvarum,Scientific article,Insect Conservation and Diversity,"1. Substantial reductions in the distributional ranges of several species of
bumblebee have been recorded in the UK. Loss and fragmentation of suitable foraging
and nesting habitat to agricultural intensification is thought to be the main driving
force behind declines.
2. Limited knowledge of species ecology means that effective conservation management
prescriptions cannot be put into place.
3. Here we investigated the spatial dynamics of two UK Biodiversity Action Plan
bumblebee species, Bombus sylvarum and Bombus humilis. For the first time, microsatellite
DNA analysis was used to estimate foraging distances in rare bumblebees.
4. Sisterhoods were identified between bees sampled at discrete forage patches
within a fragmented landscape. Using these sisterhoods, minimum estimates of maximum
and mean foraging distances were calculated from distances separating sister
bees.
5. Minimum mean foraging distances were calculated as 475  97 m for B. humilis
and 231  58 m for B. sylvarum. Mean distances were significantly greater for
B. humilis than B. sylvarum (P < 0.001).
6. The differences between the spatial scales that the species were recorded over
highlighted a need for further research into the spatial dynamics of rare and more
ubiquitous foraging bumblebees."
40,Increased bumblebee abundance along the margins of a mass flowering crop: evidence for pollinator spill-over,Scientific report (published),Oikos,"Although the practice of cultivating mass fl owering crops (MFCs) is seen as a means of counteracting the widespread
decline of insect pollinators, no study to-date has evaluated whether the increased pollinator abundance associated with
MFCs infl uences pollinator visits to assemblages of adjacent native, non-crop plant species (pollinator  spill-over  ). In
this study we quantifi ed bumblebee abundance along hedgerow transects in MFC (fi eld bean) vs non-MFC (wheat)
margins. Surveys were conducted on east and west-facing margins twice daily (morning and afternoon) for three or four
days during the main MFC fl owering period (June) over four years involving paired bean and wheat fi elds in Devon and
Cornwall, southwest England. Although no single bumblebee species showed any consistent change in relative frequency,
when taken across all years and bumblebee species combined, we observed twice as many bumblebees visiting fl owers
adjacent to the MFC. However, when we compared bumblebee activity along hedgerow transects two weeks after bean
fl owering, there was no diff erence between crops. We thus conclude that although there is evidence for pollinator spillover
from the bean MFC to nearby semi-natural habitat, the eff ect is comparatively short lived and not specifi c to any
single bumblebee species. We also suggest that while pollinator services to native plant species might be briefl y enhanced
by MFC cultivation, the possible repercussions of bumblebee spill-over from MFCs to semi-natural habitats and the
other pollinator groups they support should be evaluated before MFC cultivation is considered as a means of conserving
declining bumblebee populations."
41,Expansion of mass-flowering crops leads to transient pollinator dilution and reduced wild plant pollination,Scientific article,Proceedings of the Royal Society: B,"Agricultural land use results in direct biodiversity decline through loss of natural habitat, but may also
cause indirect cross-habitat effects on conservation areas. We conducted three landscape-scale field
studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in
a transient dilution of bees in crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland
plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant
Primula veris, but also pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR. This
landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in OSR fields and marginally in grasslands,
where bumble-bee abundances were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of
Primula veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when the amount of
OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent. Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive
biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased competition for
pollinators between crops and wild plants. In conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness
of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the fact that, in the long run,
mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service."
42,Assessing bee species richness in two Mediterranean communities: importance of habitat type and sampling techniques,Scientific article,Ecological Research,"The decline of bees has raised concerns
regarding their conservation and the maintenance of
ecosystem services they provide to bee-pollinated wild
ﬂowers and crops. Although the Mediterranean region is
a hotspot for bee species richness, their status remains
poorly studied. There is an urgent need for cost-eﬀective,
reliable, and unbiased sampling methods that give good
bee species richness estimates. This study aims: (a) to
assess bee species richness in two common Mediterranean
habitat types: semi-natural scrub (phrygana) and
managed olive groves; (b) to compare species richness in
those systems to that of other biogeographic regions,
and (c) to assess whether six diﬀerent sampling methods
(pan traps, variable and standardized transect walks,
observation plots and trap nests), previously tested in
other European biogeographic regions, are suitable in
Mediterranean communities. Eight study sites, four per
habitat type, were selected on the island of Lesvos,
Greece. The species richness observed was high
compared to other habitat types worldwide for which comparable data exist. Pan traps collected the highest proportion of the total bee species richness across all methods at the scale of a study site. Variable and standardized transect walks detected the highest total richness over all eight study sites. Trap nests and observation plots detected only a limited fraction of the bee species richness. To assess the total bee species richness in bee diversity hotspots, such as the studied habitats, we suggest a combination of transect walks conducted by trained bee collectors and pan trap sampling."
43,Butterfly diversity at the ecotone between agricultural and semi-natural habitats across a climatic gradient,Scientific article,Diversity and Distributions,"Aim Understanding the response of species to ecotones and habitat edges is
essential to designing conservation management, especially in mosaic agricultural
landscapes. This study examines how species diversity and composition change
with distance from semi-natural habitats, over ecotones into agricultural fields,
and how within-site patterns of community transition change across a climatic
gradient and differ between crop types.
Location A total of 19 sites in Israel where semi-natural habitats border
agricultural fields (wheat fields or olive groves) distributed along a sharp climatic
gradient ranging between 100 and 800 mm mean annual rainfall.
Methods We performed butterfly surveys in 2006. We analysed species richness
(a-diversity), diversity, community nestedness and species turnover (b-diversity)
within sites and between sites (c-diversity). We also assessed where species of
conservation concern occurred.
Results In wheat sites, richness and diversity declined abruptly from ecotones to
fields and remained homogenously poor throughout the fields, regardless of
climate. In olive sites, despite the sharp structural boundary, richness and
diversity remained high from the semi-natural habitat to the grove margins and
then declined gradually into groves. Species of conservation concern occurred
across all habitats at olive sites, but none were found inside wheat fields or at their
ecotones. The contrast in community structure between semi-natural habitats and
fields was affected by both climate and field type. Irrigation in arid regions did not
augment species diversity.
Main conclusions Our results indicate that consideration of crop type, within a
climatic context, should receive high priority in biodiversity conservation in
agricultural areas. In ‘hostile’ crops, such as wheat, we suggest favouring a
combination of high-intensity management and wide margins over less intensive
management without margins, which may merely aid generalist butterfly species.
The scarcity of butterflies in arid irrigated fields suggests a need to carefully assess the effects of irrigation and agrochemicals on species’ communities."
44,Organic dairy farming: impacts on insect-flower interaction networks and pollination,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Pollination interactions comprise a network of connections between flowers and insect visitors.
They are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural
practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic farming, could improve
farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination
and the stability of insectflower interaction networks.
2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on insectflower interaction network
size and structure, bee and hoverfly diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and conventional
dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland.
3. We found that insectflower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asymmetrically
structured than networks on conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained
fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant  animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously
documented insectflower interaction networks. Organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees
partly because of higher floral abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in
organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance, suggesting
organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monogyna
hawthorn was higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited.
4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of
insectflower interaction networks. However, network stability was not improved and all networks
(organic and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche overlap and low
plant  animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more
flower visitors and improved pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of
important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri-environmental
schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but
more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can
be made for this group. We conclude that organic farming, although not the solution in its present
form, can benefit insect biodiversity, insectflower interaction networks and insect-mediated pollination."
45,"Bee diversity in naturalizing patches of Carolinian grasslands in Southern Ontario, Canada",Scientific article,The Canadian Entomologist,"The bee fauna (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) of the Niagara Peninsula, at the eastern end
of the Carolinian Zone in Ontario, Canada, is poorly known. From April to October 2003, we
studied bee abundance and diversity in set-aside grasslands at Brock University and the Glenridge
Quarry Naturalization Site in southern St. Catharines, Ontario. Using three sampling
methods (pan traps, sweep nets, and aerial nets), we collected and identified 15 733 specimens
of 124 species and morphospecies representing all bee families, except Melittidae, found in North
America. Abundance-based diversity estimators suggested bee species richness to be as high as
148 species. There were three seasonal peaks in bee abundance (early spring, late spring, and midsummer)
with a lull in activity shortly after the summer solstice. Several indicators suggested
substantial impacts of disturbance on the Niagara bee community, including evidence of high
dominance by the most abundant species. Comparison of the sampling methods indicated considerable
catch variation among taxa; Halictidae and Apidae were dominant in pan trap samples
and in sweepaerial net samples, respectively. However, bee abundances in pan traps and sweep
nets were highly correlated, suggesting that both methods fairly sample local bee abundances."
46,Gardens benefit bees and enhance pollination in intensively managed farmland,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"The recent loss of pollinating insects and out-crossing plants in agricultural landscapes has raised concern
for the maintenance of ecosystem services. Wild bees have been shown to benefit from garden habitats
in urban and suburban areas. We investigated the effects of distance from garden habitats on wild
bees and seed set of a native out-crossing plant Campanula persicifolia, in intensively managed agricultural
landscapes in Southern Sweden. Bee abundance and species richness, as well as plant seed set, were
higher closer to gardens (<15 m) than further away (>140 m). This highlights private gardens as a landscape
wide resource for pollinators but also the lack of sufficient pollination of wild plants in contemporary
agricultural landscapes."
47,"Differential effects of habitat isolation and landscape composition on wasps, bees, and their enemies",Scientific article,Oecologia,"Habitat loss and fragmentation are major
threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Effects
of these usually intercorrelated processes on biodiversity
have rarely been separated at a landscape scale. We studied
the independent effects of amount of woody habitat in the
landscape and three levels of isolation from the next woody
habitat (patch isolation) on trap nesting bees, wasps, and
their enemies at 30 farmland sites in the Swiss plateau.
Species richness of wasps was negatively affected by patch
isolation and positively affected by the amount of woody
habitat in the landscape. In contrast, species richness of
bees was neither influenced by patch isolation nor by
landscape composition. Isolation from woody habitats
reduced species richness and abundance of natural enemies
more strongly than of their hosts, so that parasitism rate
was lowered by half in isolated sites compared to forest
edges. Thus, population regulation of the hosts may be
weakened by habitat fragmentation. We conclude that
habitat amount at the landscape scale and local patch
connectivity are simultaneously important for biodiversity
conservation."
48,"A comparison of bee communities of Chicago green roofs, parks and prairies",Scientific article,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Due to loss of natural habitats, human-dominated green spaces are likely to increase in importance
for biodiversity support. We assessed the potential value of urban green roofs for native pollinator
conservation in the Chicago region, comparing them with reference habitats of tallgrass prairie natural
areas and traditional city-park green spaces. We found that native bees are present on green roofs, though
at lower abundance and diversity than in reference habitats. Green-roof and prairie bee communities
were distinct from each other, while those in parks were intermediate and similar to the other two habitat
types. Bee-community patterns were related to habitat characteristics at both the site and landscape
scales. Overall, bee abundance and species richness increased with greater proportions of green space
in the surrounding landscape. However, this relationship disappeared in cases where green space was
dominated by turf grass. At the site scale, bees benefited from greater plant diversity, and bee and plantcommunity
composition were significantly correlated. Green roofs are potentially valuable sites for bee
conservation in urban areas, particularly if planted with diverse native forbs to provide foraging resources,
and designed to accommodate bees with different nesting habits."
49,"Land use intensity in grasslands: Changes in biodiversity, species composition and specialisation in flower visitor networks",Scientific article,Basic and Applied Ecology,"The relationship between resource availability and biodiversity of consumers has gained particular attention with the increasing
loss of biodiversity. We evaluated resource availability on meadows of low intensity (low/unfertilised, mown once or twice per
year) and meadows of high-intensity land use (high fertilisation, mown twice or thrice) before and after the first mowing in
relation to network specialisation, species richness and composition of flower visitors.
We studied 40 meadows, simultaneously sampling one meadow of low intensity and one meadow of high-intensity land use.
Each survey yielded a separate interaction network, comprising all flower visitors found during 6 h in an area of 1000m2.
In total we recorded 105 plant species and 586 flower visitor species. Species composition of plants and flower visitors
differed considerably between the two management regimes, with species overlaps of 43% in plants and 42% in flower visitors.
Complementary specialisation of flower visitors differed between taxa: dipterans were significantly less specialised than beetles
and butterflies, and bees had the highest degree of specialisation. Earlier in the season (before mowing), meadows of lowintensity
land use were significantly richer in flowering plant, bee and butterfly species. They also showed more plantflower
visitor interactions, greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of butterflies than meadows of high-intensity land
use. However, later in the season (after mowing) management types differed only in plant species richness, being higher on
meadows of low-intensity land use.
We conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from differences in grassland management may alter
plantflower visitor interactions. Moreover, an impoverishment of flower diversity has stronger effects on the diversity and
species composition of specialised flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors."
50,"Effect of biotic factors on the spatial distribution of stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Meliponini) in fragmented Neotropical habitats",Scientific article,Neotropical Entomology,"We recorded stingless bee colony abundance and nesting habits in three
sites with different anthropogenic activities in the Soconusco region of
Chiapas, Mexico: (1) agroforestry (7 hacacao crop), (2) grassland (12 ha),
and (3) urban area (3 ha). A total of 67 nests were found, representing
five stingless bee species, Tetragonisca angustula angustula (Lepeletier),
Trigona fulviventris (Guérin), Scaptotrigona mexicana (Guérin),
Scaptotrigona pectoralis (Dalla Torre), and Oxytrigona mediorufa (Cockerell).
The most abundant stingless bee in each site was T. angustula
angustula (>50%). The primary tree species used by the bees were Ficus
spp. (Moraceae, 37.8%) and Cordia alliodora (Boraginaceae, 13.5%). The
nest entrance height of T. angustula angustula (96±19 cm) was different
than the other species, and this bee was the only one that used all
different nesting sites. Volatiles analyzed by gas chromatography from
pollen collected by the stingless bees differed between bee species, but
were highly similar in respect to the fragrances of the pollen collected
by the same species at any site. Our data indicate that T. angustula
angustula experienced low heterospecific and high intraspecific foraging
overlap especially in the urban site. We observed cluster spatial distribution
in grassland and in agroforestry sites. In the urban site, T.
angustula angustula presented random distribution tended to disperse.
Trigona fulviventris was the only overdispersed and solitary species."
51,Supporting wild pollinators in a temperate agricultural landscape: Maintaining mosaics of natural features and production,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Pollination has received attention recently due to reported sharp declines of Apis mellifera in several locations,
and it has been proposed that diverse native bee communities may be key for continued pollination
of economically important crops. However, there is some inconsistency in the literature as to how these
communities should best be managed. To address this issue, we collected bees from an intensively managed
agricultural region in eastern Australia using blue vane traps. Both linear remnants of vegetation,
which form part of a larger corridor network, and adjacent fields of native and exotic pastures, wheat,
canola, and lucerne were sampled. A total of 3249 individual bees, representing four families and 36 species
were collected. Highly modified environments of nectar-bearing crop supported the most speciesrich
bee assemblages, and the highest abundance of individual bee species. Distance from the remnants
did not limit the body size of species occupying fields (up to 400 m). However, richness of bee assemblages
also responded positively to the presence of conservation land in nearby areas, or the number
of remnant native trees surrounding traps. Linear remnants of native vegetation contributed to assemblage
heterogeneity by adding unique species to the regional pool. Our findings indicate that agricultural
industries that currently rely on pollination by A. mellifera should ensure that intensive land use is complemented
by untilled areas in the form of conservation land, or farm dams and scattered trees in fields,
to support wild pollinators that may act as insurance against further future losses of managed hives."
52,Pollinator diversity (Hymenoptera and Diptera) in semi-natural habitats in Serbia during summer,Scientific article,Archives of Biological Sciences,"The aim of this study was to assess species diversity and population abundance of the two main orders of pollinating
insects, Hymenoptera and Diptera. The survey was conducted in 16 grassland fragments within agro-ecosystems in
Vojvodina, as well as in surrounding fields with mass-flowering crops. Pollinators were identified and the Shannon-Wiener
Diversity Index was used to measure their diversity. Five families, 7 subfamilies, 26 genera and 63 species of insects were
recorded. All four big pollinator groups investigated were recorded; hoverflies were the most abundant with 32% of the
total number of individuals, followed by wild bees  29%, honeybees  23% and bumblebees with 16%."
53,The use of off-farm habitats by foraging bumblebees in agricultural landscapes: implications for conservation management,Scientific article,Apidologie,"Recent studies have focused on ways to enhance floral availability on arable farmland, but little
attention has been paid to the importance of off-farm habitats in providing forage for pollinators within farmed
landscapes. We conducted a comparative study to assess bumblebees and flower abundance on farmed and offfarm
habitats in two low-intensity systems in the UK, the Somerset Levels and the Outer Hebrides. In both
farming systems, both on- and off-farm habitats contributed to the mosaic of bumblebee forage. In the Somerset
Levels, track edges and road verges were particularly important sources of forage for long-tongued bumblebees.
Cattle-grazed pasture in Somerset and winter-grazed pasture in the Outer Hebrides were also notable sources of
bumblebee forage. Non-agricultural habitats need to be integrated into local land management plans to ensure
the provision of forage for bumblebees throughout the breeding season."
54,Sex in the city: Reproductive success of Digitalis purpurea in a gradient from urban to rural sites,Scientific report (published),Landscape and Urban Planning,"Urbanization of natural habitats is considered to have large impacts on local plant populations and their associated pollinator faunas, which are expected to cause changes in both plant-pollinator interactions and increased pollen limitation. This study investigated the effects of increasing intensity of urban land use on pollinator diversity, flower visitation rates and reproductive success in Digitalis purpurea. To this end, we set up experimental populations of D. purpurea in three urbanrural gradients and contrasted these against two large, natural populations. In the experimental populations we quantified the number of flower visits per 20 min and applied supplemental hand-pollinations to determine the impact of pollen limitation on fruit-level seed set. We found no impact of urbanization intensity on pollinator diversity at all locations studied, and also the number of flower visits did not differ significantly between urban and rural populations. Reproductive success appeared, however, pollen limited in all sites, even in the large and optimal reference populations. This led us to conclude that the pollen limitation was caused by a bet-hedging strategy of the species rather than by insufficient pollination."
55,Biodiversity of man-made open habitats in an underused country: a class of multispecies abundance models for count data,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Since the 1960s, Japan has become highly dependent on foreign countries for
natural resources, and the amount of managed lands (e.g. coppice, grassland, and agricultural
field) has declined. Due to infrequent natural and human disturbance, early-successional
species are now declining in Japan. Here we surveyed bees, birds, and plants in
four human-disturbed open habitats (pasture, meadow, young planted forest, and abandoned
clear-cut) and two forest habitats (mature planted forest and natural old-growth). We
extended a recently developed multispecies abundance model to accommodate count data,
and used the resulting models to estimate species-, functional group-, and community-level
state variables (abundance and species richness) at each site, and compared them among
the six habitats. Estimated individual-level detection probability was quite low for bee
species (mean across species = 0.003; 0.16 for birds). Thirty-two (95% credible interval:
1364) and one (04) bee and bird species, respectively, were suggested to be undetected
by the field survey. Although habitats in which community-level abundance and species
richness was highest differed among taxa, species richness and abundance of early-successional
species were similar in the four disturbed open habitats across taxa except for
plants in the pasture habitat which was a good habitat only for several exotic species. Our
results suggest that human disturbance, especially the revival of plantation forestry, may
contribute to the restoration of early-successional species in Japan."
56,Local Distribution and Floral Preferences of Founder Bumblebee Queens in Korea,Unpublished article,Unpublished,"Bumblebees are important pollinators of crops and wildflowers in northern temperate
regions. The number of bumblebee species has declined in recent decades, particularly,
in developing regions. Here, we investigated the distribution and floral preferences of
founder bumblebee queens that were collected between 2000 and 2012 in Korea with
the intention of gathering information useful in the conservation of native bumblebee
populations. A total of 13,130 overwintered bumblebee queens were collected at 63
locations from 8 provinces; the collected bumblebees consisted of five species of
native bumblebees (Bombus ardens, B. ignitus, B. hypocrita spporoensis, B.
ussurensis and B. consobrinus wittenburgi) and one species of exotic bumblebee (B.
terrestris). The dominant species were Bombus ardens Smith and Bombus ignitus
Smith, which accounted for 7,462 (56.8%) and 3,725 (28.4%) of the collected
bumblebees, respectively. As a proportional distribution of the founder bumblebee
queens that were collected, B. ignitus was the most common (9.8%-78.5%), followed
by B. ardens (9.8%-66.1%), B. hypocrita spporoensis (0.9%-31.4%), B. ussurensis
(0.8%-22.2%), B. consobrinus wittenburgi (0.1%-3.8%) and B. terrestris (0.0%-1.1%).
The bumblebee queens foraged from 7 families of plants and 18 plant species. B.
ignitus bumblebees were primarily collected from Prunus serrulata Matsumura and
Corydalis speciosa Max, and B. ardens bumblebees were primarily collected from
Rhodldendron mucronulatum Turcz and Prunus yedoensis."
57,"Insect Species diversity in fragmented habitats of the University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria",Scientific article,Journal of Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"The beneficial roles of insects in facilitating pollination of many cultivated and uncultivated plants, and as natural
enemies of pest species cannot be overemphasized. This study was carried out to ascertain the impact of habitat
fragmentation and loss on the composition and diversity of the insect populations within the premises of the University of
Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Four fragmented sites - the Biodiversity Conservation Area (BCA), Monoculture Plantation of
Hevea brasilensis (MP), Gambiama Residential Area (GRA), and Arable Farmland (AF) - reflecting different land
uses/covers and varying degrees of disturbance, were purposively chosen for the study. Pan-trap and pit-fall methods were
used to trap insects at the above-ground and ground levels, respectively. Alpha diversity was measured in each site using
Simpson, Shannon, Menhinick and Margalef indices, while insect species compositional similarity between each pair of
the sites was assessed using Sorensens similarity index. Insect species richness was highest in BCA followed by AF and
GRA respectively, while it was lowest in MP. Dorylus Sp. was the most abundant insect species in all the fragments with
the highest number of individuals occurring in AF. AF also had the highest total number of individuals for all the species,
followed by MP and GRA respectively, while the BCA had the lowest total number of individuals. Alpha diversity was
highest in BCA followed by GRA and AF respectively, while MP had the lowest diversity. The level of similarity between
each pair of the fragments in terms of their insect species composition was generally low (below 23%). The highest
variation (91.67%) was observed between BCA and MP, followed by MP and AF (90.91%); while the least variation
(77.27) was observed between BCA and GRA. The highest species richness and diversity observed in the BCA
underscores the importance of the site for insect species conservation and calls for better protection and management."
58,Movement and phenology of bees in a subtropical Australian agricultural landscape,Scientific article,Austral Ecology,"Bees are mobile organisms that seek food and nesting opportunities from a range of habitats. It is
important to understand the way they move in agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from
their activity as pollinators.We surveyed bees using directional flight interception (Malaise) traps over a 1-year
period in two agricultural landscapes in south-east Queensland, Australia.We placed traps at the ecotone between
crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of movement between these habitats. Species richness in these
landscapes (70) was high relative to that in comparable studies. Some bees were active year round, but most were
caught in the period September to March. Across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where more
species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant vegetation. The same bias was true for the number of
individuals of the two most abundant species (Homalictus urbanus and Apis mellifera). Species exclusively found in
crops were smaller on average (and therefore have smaller foraging range) than their non-crop counterparts.
Together, these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop habitat, the remnant vegetation is important
as the point of origin for bee movements, and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the dry native
remnant. Compositional similarity among samples was significantly explained by landscape but also movement
direction (i.e. to or from the riparian remnant) because different species showed different patterns of response.The
landscape with greater native vegetation cover supported more species in and around crops than the landscape with
less native vegetation."
59,Additive effects of exotic plant abundance and land-use intensity on plant-pollinator interactions,Scientific article,Oecologia,"the continuing spread of exotic plants and
increasing human land-use are two major drivers of global
change threatening ecosystems, species and their interactions.
separate effects of these two drivers on plantpollinator
interactions have been thoroughly studied, but we
still lack an understanding of combined and potential interactive
effects. In a subtropical south african landscape, we
studied 17 plantpollinator networks along two gradients
of relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity. In
general, pollinator visitation rates were lower on exotic
plants than on native ones. surprisingly, while visitation
rates on native plants increased with relative abundance
of exotics and land-use intensity, pollinator visitation on
exotic plants decreased along the same gradients. there
was a decrease in the specialization of plants on pollinators
and vice versa with both drivers, regardless of plant origin.
Decreases in pollinator specialization thereby seemed
to be mediated by a species turnover towards habitat generalists.
however, contrary to expectations, we detected
no interactive effects between the two drivers. Our results
suggest that exotic plants and land-use promote generalist
plants and pollinators, while negatively affecting specialized
plantpollinator interactions. Weak integration and
high specialization of exotic plants may have prevented
interactive effects between exotic plants and land-use. still,
the additive effects of exotic plants and land-use on specialized
plantpollinator interactions would have been overlooked
in a single-factor study. We therefore highlight the
need to consider multiple drivers of global change in ecological
research and conservation management."
60,Effect of deforestation on a southwest Ghana dung beetle assemblage (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) at the periphery of Ankasa conservation area,Scientific article,Environmental Entomology,"During June 2003, an exploratory dung beetle survey (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae:
Scarabaeinae)was conducted in southwestGhana at the southern edge of Ankasa Conservation Area,
which is a 500-km2 conserved region of the threatened Eastern Upper Guinean rainforest. The survey
provided a quantitative assessment of peripheral deforestation effects and an inventory for species on
omnivore dung. Pitfall traps baitedwith pig dungwere placed in both selectively logged and unlogged
rainforest as well as in nearby oil palmand cacao plantations. The Ankasa forest inventory wasmostly
comprised of species previously trapped by human dung in theWestern Upper Guinean rainforest of
Taõ¨ National Park, Co te dÕIvoire. However, there was relatively low species abundance similarity
between the June/July assemblages on omnivore dung in Taõ¨ and Ankasa rainforests, and even lower
similarity between assemblages of Ankasa and the adjacent plantations. Of 29 species recorded in
Ankasa forest,mostwere absent or rare in plantationswhere assemblageswere numerically dominated
by species previously recorded from the West African savannas. This replacement plantation fauna
showed signiÞcantly lower species richness and diversity, but signiÞcantly higher abundance, compared
with Ankasa forest assemblages. The results reiterate that forest reserves are essential for the
conservation of specialist rainforest dung beetle species."
61,Changes in Brazilian Drosophilidae (Diptera) Assemblages Across an Urbanisation Gradient,Scientific article,Neotropical Entomology,"The present study aims to characterise the assemblages of Drosophilidae sampled from
four sites subject to different levels of urbanisation, in the city of Florianópolis, South Brazil. Five
samples were collected between August 2000 and August 2001 and  ve between August 2002 and
August 2003 in each site. A gradual change in the dominant species was observed in the urbanisation
gradient, with an increase in relative abundance of exotic species in urban areas. Among the native
species, the relative abundance of Drosophila capricorni Dobzhansky & Pavan had an expressive
decrease. In the other hand the richness in the low urbanisation site increased, probably due to the
presence of urban gardens. The diversity index did not vary signi cantly among sites, but its correlation
with evenness and richness changed."
62,Changes in Arthropod Assemblages along a Wide Gradient of Disturbance in Gabon,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"Searching for indicator taxa representative of diverse assemblages, such as arthropods, is an
important objective of many conservation studies. We evaluated the impacts of a wide gradient of disturbance
in Gabon on a range of arthropod assemblages representing different feeding guilds. We examined 4 × 105
arthropod individuals from which 21 focal taxa were separated into 1534 morphospecies. Replication included
the understory of 3 sites in each of 4 different stages of forest succession and land use (i.e., habitats) after
logging (old and young forests, savanna, and gardens). We used 3 complementary sampling methods to survey
sites throughout the year. Overall differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were greatest between
forest and open habitats, and cleared forest invaded by savanna had the lowest abundance and diversity.
The magnitude of faunal differences was much smaller between old and young forests. When considered at
this local scale, anthropogenic modification of habitats did not result in a monotonous decline of diversity
because many herbivore pests and their associated predators and parasitoids were abundant and diverse in
gardens, where plant productivity was kept artificially high year-round through watering and crop rotation.
We used a variety of response variables to measure the strength of correlations across survey locations among
focal taxa. These could be ranked as follows in terms of decreasing number of significant correlations: species
turnover > abundance > observed species richness > estimated species richness > percentage of site-specific
species. The number of significant correlations was generally low and apparently unrelated to taxonomy
or guild structure. Our results emphasize the value of reporting species turnover in conservation studies, as
opposed to simply measuring species richness, and that the search for indicator taxa is elusive in the tropics.
One promising alternative might be to consider predictor sets of a small number of taxa representative of
different functional groups, as identified in our study."
63,Land Use and Mosquito Diversity in the Peruvian Amazon,Scientific article,Journal of Medical Entomology,"Anthropogenic environmental disturbance is a significant factor driving mosquito community composition. However, researchers subjectively define environmental change creating difficulties for cross-study comparison. To examine the relationship between terrestrial change and mosquito composition, we used remote sensing techniques to define spatially explicit land use categories along a gradient with low (rural), medium (peri-urban), and high (urban) anthropogenic influence in the Peruvian Amazon. We found significant differences in mosquito diversity among land use categories. Our results provide baseline data linking mosquito distribution to land use in the Peruvian Amazon and present an easily replicable method of comparison for future research. Creating standardized methods to measure the impact of human influence on the environment is of particular importance in designing targeted public health policies and in predicting disease risk in rapidly changing environments such as the Amazon."
64,"Dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) diversity in continuous forest, forest fragments and cattle pastures in a landscape of Chiapas, Mexico: the effects of anthropogenic changes",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"We studied the diversity of dung beetles in three different habitats in the
Lacandona Forest, Chiapas, Mexico. We found a total of 49 species. Of these, 44 were in
well-preserved forests (SC) within the limits of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, 42
in fragmented forests (SF), and 13 in cattle pastures (PZ). These two latter habitats were
part of a fragmented landscape. Even though the species richness between the two forest
habitats is similar, there is a change in guild composition and structure. About 12% of the
species were exclusively found in SC, while 4.1% and 2% were exclusive of SF and PZ
respectively. b diversity was the most important element for overall diversity (c), above
that of the local richness (a). Within well-preserved forests, species composition changes
substantially, even among neighboring sites. Species diversity within the landscape seems
to depend on canopy coverage, soil temperature and geographic distance between sites.
Functional groups vary with the habitat. Large-bodied, nocturnal species with specific
requirements of soil temperature and compaction are more sensitive to anthropogenic
changes. In cattle pastures there is a larger number of heliophilic species, with a higher
percentage of small-bodied and roller beetles."
65,Diversity and abundance of terrestrial ants along a gradient of land use intensification in a transitional forest-savannah zone of Côte d'Ivoire,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Biosciences,"Objective: In the transitional forest-savannah zone, human pressure on natural resources occurs mainly
through converting forests into diverse land use systems. Land use management has an important impact
on soil and its functional role in maintaining ecosystem processes; it generally results in dramatic and rapid
changes in vegetation that are likely to affect soil invertebrate communities significantly. In the context of
the sustainable use of natural resources in tropical countries an investigation was conducted in Cote
dIvoire to study the impacts of land use type on biodiversity.
Methodology and results: Data were collected on ant diversity and relative abundance in five land use
types: (i) forest in Lamto reserve, (ii) rural forest, (iii) food crop plantations, (iv) cocoa and (v) pineapple
plantations, with the aim of characterizing ant assemblage in response to land use change. Standard
sampling methods (Winkler leaf litter extraction, pitfall trapping and soil monolith extraction) were used to
collect ants along three transects of 200 m length per land use type. A total of one hundred and eighteen
ant species were found in all habitats combined. The rural forest was the most species rich habitat (75
species), followed in decreasing order by the Lamto forest (73 species), food crop plantations (61 species),
cocoa plantations (45 species) and pineapple plantations (19 species).
Conclusions and application of findings: Three main conclusions were drawn from this study: (i) a decrease
in terrestrial ant diversity occurred with increasing land use intensification; (ii) food crop lands had levels of
ant diversity comparable to those of the forests; however, there were dramatic changes in the community
structure; (iii) the rural forests are near natural and may serve as refuges for ant diversity. These findings
encourage sustainable types of land use, involving agro-forestry practices to allow natural recovery
processes after agricultural disturbance. This approach will help in the conservation of biodiversity."
66,"The Impact of Human Activities to Dynamic of Insect Communities: a Case Study in Gunung Salak, West Java",Scientific article,Hayati Journal of Biosciences,"Huge areas of diverse tropical forest are lost or degraded every year with dramatic consequences for biodiversity.
Human activities such as deforestation, fragmentation, over-exploitation, and monoculture practices are the
main drivers of tropical forest biodiversity loss. Investigating of these threats with focusses on changes in species
richness or species diversity will be able to minimize any impact of human activities at the early stage in a certain
region. Therefore, to know the impact of human activities to dynamic of insect communities in Gunung Salak,
West Java, we measured moth diversity and their structure within communities by comparing the index diversity,
species richness and species composition across five different habitat types. The results showed that the habitat
changes due to human activities had changed not only to the moth diversity but also to their structure within
communities. The number of moth species decreased significantly as well as the number of lower taxa (family)
in the disturbed forest (secondary forest, Agathis forest, and transition area) within ranges: 20-50 and 10-20%.
The composition of the two main families, Geometridae and Noctuidae also showed a major change, family
Geometridae decreased within ranges 10-50% in the disturbed area but Noctuidae increased up to 50% in those
areas. Indeed, habitat lost due to human activities such as illegal logging, change of land use and land clearing
is the main threats to decrease on macro-moth diversity and change their structures within communities."
67,Habitat fragmentation alters the structure of dung beetle communities in the Atlantic Forest,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Habitat loss and fragmentation have turned into the most important threats to biodiversity and ecosystem
function worldwide. Here we investigate the effects of habitat fragmentation and drastic changes in
tree communities on dung beetle richness and community structure. This study was carried out in a
severely fragmented 670-km2 forest landscape of the Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Brazil. Sampling
was carried out in 19 forest fragments between September 2007 and March 2008 with the use of pitfall
traps and flight interception traps. A total of 5893 individuals and 30 species of dung beetle were collected.
Fragment area and isolation were the most significant explanatory variables for predictable and
conspicuous changes in dung beetle species richness. Smaller and isolated fragments presented lower
number of species, but fragments with lower tree species richness and lower proportion of shade-tolerant
species were also considerably impoverished in terms of dung beetle species richness. The body mass of
dung beetles were explained by fragment area and the percentage of emergent trees with smaller and
less stratified fragments being dominated by small-bodied dung beetles. An ordination analysis segregated
dung beetle communities between small fragments (<100 ha) and the control area. Seventy-seven
percent of the species were recorded in the control area and 22% of all species were unique to this habitat.
Our findings indicate that large fragments in the Atlantic Forest appear to consist in a sort of irreplaceable
habitats for particular groups of dung beetle species, as well as for the integrity of their communities."
68,Biodiversity and ecosystem function of tropical forest dung beetles under contrasting logging regimes,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"A key challenge for tropical conservation biologists is to assess how forest management practices affect
biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) provide an
ideal focal guild for such studies. We compared dung beetle assemblages and experimentally assessed
rates of dung removal and seed burial in undisturbed forest, low-intensity selectively logged forest under
sustainable forest management, and high-intensity logged forest, not under sustainable management in
Malaysian Borneo. In total, 7923 individuals from 39 species of dung beetle were collected. There were no
significant differences in abundance, biomass or diversity across sites. Species richness was significantly
lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Beta diversity was low: of 35 species recorded in undisturbed
forest sites, 32 were also captured in low-intensity sites and 29 in high-intensity sites. The environmental
and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition. An average of 6399% of
dung was removed over 24 h. Mean dung and seed removal were significantly lower in the high-intensity
logged sites. Dung removal rates were significantly and positively correlated with dung beetle species
richness, but not with dung beetle biomass or abundance. However, the biomass of large-bodied, nocturnal
dung beetles was positively correlated with dung removal. In contrast to previous studies, dung beetle
biomass and abundance were not correlated with species richness, indicative of density
compensation. Overall, dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to
low-intensity but not high-intensity selective logging. These differences may be related to changes in
the abundance and biomass of particular dung beetle species or guilds rather than community-wide measures
of abundance and biomass, highlighting the need to move beyond simplistic biodiversity-ecosystem
functioning correlations to understand the functional consequences of habitat modification in
high-diversity ecosystems."
69,"Assessment of grazing effect on sheep fescue (Festuca valesiaca) dominated steppe rangelands, in the semi-arid Central Anatolian region of Turkey",Scientific article,Journal of Arid Environments,"In the semi-arid steppe rangelands of Central Turkey, Festuca valesiaca and Thymus sipyleus ssp rosulans
have become the dominant species on degraded pastures. We hypothesized that decreases in species
richness and abundance are correlated with increasing prevalence of these two species. Therefore, our
objectives were to determine whether there are patterns in examined vegetation; how dominant species
contribute to these patterns; and how patterns differ between grazed and ungrazed vegetation. We
determined that protection from grazing increased species richness. Grazing significantly changed
composition through decreasing total plant, forb, grass and F. valesiaca covers, while substantially
increasing T. sipyleus cover. Topography, soil and grazing appear to impact the dominance of plant
communities where F. valesiaca and T. sipyleus prevail. These two dominant species had a significant
effect in shaping vegetation patterns. Based on regression analysis, alterations in species richness with
changes in cover of forbs and shrubs were evident, and spatial heterogeneity of F. valesiaca and T. sipyleus
indicated unstable vegetative patterns in heavily grazed pastures and successional changes in protected
pastures. Our study results identify F. valesiaca and T. sipyleus as indicator species of vegetation
suppression in condition assessments of degraded steppe rangelands."
70,Plant diversity in sacred forest fragments of Western Ghats: a comparative study of four life forms,Scientific article,Plant Ecology,"The effect of fragmentation on different
life forms within tropical forest plant communities is
poorly understood. We studied the effect of degree of
fragmentation and surrounding matrix on trees,
lianas, shrubs and epiphytes in tropical forest fragments
of Kodagu, Western Ghats, India. These
fragments exist as sacred groves amidst a highly
modified agricultural landscape, and have been
preserved by the religious sentiments of local communities.
Plants were sampled at two sites in
continuous forests and 11 forest fragments. A total
of 122 species of trees, 29 species of lianas, 60
species of shrubs and 66 species of epiphytes were
recorded. Trees exhibited a significant speciesarea
relationship (R2 = 0.74). Richness estimates after
controlling for stem density (rarefaction) revealed
that observed speciesarea relationship was not an
artefact of passive sampling. Variation in species
richness of the other three groups was explained by
stem density and structural diversity. Linear distance
from the reserve forest did not explain any variation
in species richness. All life forms exhibited significant
nested pattern. Trees were nested along the area
gradient while nestedness in the other three groups
showed evidence in support of habitat nestedness.
The four life forms thus responded variably to degree
of fragmentation. Our study revealed that 74% of the
regional diversity for trees was contributed by
diversity among plots, highlighting the importance
of inter-patch habitat diversity in maintaining the
total regional species pool. We conclude that trees
alone cannot serve as good indicator for taking
appropriate conservation measures to mitigate species
loss resulting from habitat fragmentation."
71,MONITORING PHEASANTS (Phasianidae) IN THE WESTERN HIMALAYAS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECTS,Scientific article,The Ring,"In this study, we monitored pheasants abundance to measure the impact of a hydroelectric
development project. The pheasants abundance was monitored using “call count”
and line transect methods during breeding seasons in 2009-2011. Three call count stations
and 3 transects were laid with varying levels of anthropogenic disturbance. To understand
how the hydro power project could effect the pheasant population in the Jiwa Valley, we
monitored it under two conditions; in the presence of hydro-electric project (HEP) construction
and when human activity significantly declined. The Koklass Pheasant (Pucrasia
macrolopha), Cheer Pheasant (Catreus wallichi) and Western Tragopan (Tragopan melanocephalus)
were not recorded in Manjhan Adit in 2009. During 2010 and 2011 springs, the
construction activity was temporarily discontinued in Manjhan Adit. The pheasants responded
positively to this and their abundance increased near disturbed sites (Manjhan
Adit). The strong response of pheasants to anthropogenic disturbance has ecological application
and thus can be used by wildlife management in the habitat quality monitoring in
the Himalayan Mountains."
73,"Bird community structure in natural and urbanized habitats along an altitudinal gradient in Pauri district (Garhwal Himalaya) of Uttarakhand state, India",Scientific article,Biologia,"In the Indian subcontinent there is hardly any study that compares the bird community structure of urban/
suburban areas with those of forest habitat. The present survey identified diverse assemblages of birds in the Pauri
district at different elevations. A total of 125 bird species belonging to 40 families including two least count species (Lophura
leucomelanos and Pucrasia marcolopha) were recorded during this survey in the forest and urbanized habitats of
Pauri District (Garhwal Hiamalaya) of Uttarakhand state, India. The high elevation (Pauri 16002100 m a.s.l.), mid elevation
(Srikot-Khanda 9001300 m a.s.l.) and low elevation (Srinagar 500900 m a.s.l.) contributed 88.8%, 63.2% and 58.4%
of the total species respectively. Rarefaction analysis and Shannon diversity index showed that the high elevation forest
habitat had highest bird species richness (BSR) and bird species diversity (BSD) followed by the mid and then the low
elevation forests. BSR and BSD fluctuated across seasons at all elevations but not across habitat types. Present study provides
a base line data about avian community composition in urbanized and natural habitats along altitudinal gradient in
the study area. This information may be useful to the conservation biologists for the better management and conservation
of the avifauna in the Western Himalaya, a part of one of the hot biodiversity spots of the world."
74,Forest ecosystem services and biodiversity in contrasting Himalayan forest management systems,Scientific article,Environmental Conservation,"In developing countries, the landscape surrounding agricultural land is important for maintaining biodiversity and providing ecosystem services. Forests provide a full suite of goods and services to subsistence farmers in the Himalayan agro-ecological system. The effects of biomass outtake on woody species richness and composition were analysed in forests under communal and government management. Interviews on forest use and perception of forest condition and ecosystem service delivery were conducted in farmer households bordering the forests. Significantly more woody species were found in the community managed forests. Species richness was negatively correlated with walking distance from the nearest village and increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Community forests were generally less degraded than government managed forests, giving support to common pool resource management. Woody vegetation represented a crucial source of fuelwood, timber, fodder, and edible, aromatic and medicinal plants. Using a multidisciplinary framework to analyse ecosystem integrity and ecosystem service delivery enabled a finer understanding of these complex agro- ecological systems, giving support to evidence-based management and conservation planning for the future."
75,Assessing the impact of reforestation on the diversity of Mediterranean terrestrial Gastropoda,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"In the Mediterranean basin, pine tree reforestation has been the most common
management tool in restoring degraded and burnt areas, as well as for economic purposes.
However, the quality of the biodiversity of these habitats has undergone little assessment.
Terrestrial gastropods are suitable indicators of forest quality and long-term stability
because of their strict dependence on microhabitat conditions and their slow dispersal rate.
We sampled the gastropod population in a protected Mediterranean area in order to
compare the species richness in seven main habitats. Holm oak wood and mixed-pine
forests were the habitats with the lowest species density, and areas with a high level of
heterogeneity exhibited the richest communities. In recent decades however, land abandonment
and pine reforestation are leading to landscape homogeneity, which is perhaps the
cause of the extinction of six open-habitat gastropod species in the Park. These results
provide park authorities with insights into how to adapt management plans to enhance
habitat quality for land snail and slug assemblages. More specifically, our results stress the need to create habitat heterogeneity to increase land mollusc diversity in large and continuous
areas of mixed-pine forests."
76,"Spider biodiversity and density following cultivation in pastures in the Waikato, New Zealand",Scientific article,New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research,"The effect of cultivation on spider density and diversity was assessed at three sites before and after cultivation in autumn. Linyphiid spiders dominated the fauna at each site (60-90% of the spiders present) with Eperigone fradeorum (Berland) the most common spider (38% of the spiders collected). At all three sites, the populations of both linyphiid and non-linyphiid spiders decreased significantly after fields were cultivated. Population declines after cultivation did not appear to be related to the intensity of cultivation. This suggests that environmental factors were not an important influence on spider populations, at least in the early part of the experiment. Grazing had a detrimental effect on spider density and diversity. These results suggest
that both cultivation and ongoing management can affect spider density and diversity."
77,"Biodiversity of indigenous tussock grassland sites in Otago, Canterbury and the central North Island of New Zealand I. The macro-invertebrate fauna",Scientific article,Journal of The Royal Society of New Zealand,"This contribution introduces a short series of papers on biodiversity of indigenous tussock grassland at four sites in New Zealand. A survey of invertebrates of tussock grassland sites was carried out in summer of 3 successive years, 2001-03. The sites included two in Otago in snow tussock grassland at Deep Stream and Mt Benger, a site at Cass in inland Canterbury, and one at Tukino in the central North Island. Sampling was carried out by taking turf samples from each site, and extracting the invertebrates with heat extractors. The invertebrates were divided into 30 major groups. This quantitative sampling method allowed the densities of invertebrate groups to be calculated. Total macro-invertebrate density for all sites ranged between c. 1600 and 5600 m2. Total invertebrate abundance was highest at the central North Island site, but this was very much dominated by Formicidae. Across all sites, Formicidae, Coleoptera, and Pseudococcidae were consistently the most abundant groups represented."
78,"Influence of pastoral management on plant biodiversity in a depleted short tussock grassland, Mackenzie Basin",Scientific article,New Zealand Journal of Ecology,"This study investigated the effects of different management inputs (fertiliser and seed) and grazing
patterns on plant biodiversity in a short tussock grassland with a strong Hieracium pilosella component. Cover
abundance of vascular and non-vascular plants and environmental variables were measured in 32 10×10-m
plots located in five blocks with different management treatments. Ordination of the floristic data separated the
block with the highest management inputs from other blocks. Several adventive species were significantly more
abundant in this block, while several native species were either absent or uncommon, but were significantly more
abundant in other study blocks. H. pilosella was significantly more abundant in blocks with lower management
inputs. Diversity was significantly higher in the block with the highest management inputs. The native tussock
Poa colensoi had significantly greater cover abundance while Festuca novae-zelandiae tussocks were significantly
taller in this block. Our results suggest that high management inputs reduce the abundance of H. pilosella and
diversity of native species, but increase the abundance of other adventive species and the cover and vigour
of native tussocks. Our results highlight an interesting management conundrum for short tussock grasslands.
No-input management is likely to result in a decline in native biodiversity, as well as production values, as H.
pilosella mats deplete soil nutrients and restrict regeneration of native species. However, input of fertiliser and
adventive seeds to enhance production values, although resulting in an increase in the vigour and abundance of
some native species (mainly tussocks) and a reduction in H.pilosella abundance, will also result in a decline in overall native species richness."
79,Synergistic interactions between edge and area effects in a heavily fragmented landscape,Scientific article,Ecology,"Both area and edge effects have a strong influence on ecological processes in fragmented landscapes, but there is little understanding of how these two factors might interact to exacerbate local species declines. To test for synergistic interactions between areamand edge effects, we sampled a diverse beetle community in a heavily fragmented landscape in New Zealand. More than 35 000 beetles of ;900 species were sampled over large gradients in habitat area (102106 ha) and distance from patch edge (20210 m from the forest edge into both the forest and adjacent matrix). Using a new approach to partition variance following an ordination analysis, we found that a synergistic interaction between habitat area and distance to edge was a more important determinant of patterns in beetle community composition than direct edge or area effects alone. The strength of edge effects in beetle-species composition increased nonlinearly with increasing fragment area. One important consequence of the synergy is that the slopes of speciesarea (SA) curves constructed from habitat islands depend sensitively on the distance from edge at which sampling is conducted. Surprisingly, we found negative SA curves for communities sampled at intermediate distances from habitat edges, caused by differential edge responses of matrix- vs. forest-specialist species in fragments of
increasing area. Our data indicate that distance to habitat edge has a consistently greater impact on beetle community composition than habitat area and that variation in the strength of edge effects may underlie many patterns that are superficially related to habitat area."
80,Soil fauna in grazed New Zealand hill country pastures at two management intensities,Scientific article,Applied Soil Ecology,"This study examined the influence of superphosphate fertiliser application and sheep stocking rate on the density and diversity of soil macro- and mesofauna, particularly earthworms and oribatid mites in two sheep-grazed New Zealand hill pastures. The low intensity (LI) long-term experimental farmlet is managed with no fertiliser and a low sheep stocking rate (9 stock units/ha); the high-intensity (HI) farmlet receives 34 kg P/ha/yr and has a high sheep stocking rate (16 stock units/ha). Soil mesofaunal samples were collected at two depths (07.5 cm and 7.515 cm). Earthworm species, major mesofaunal groups and
oribatid species were identified, and the trophic groups, body size, biomass, mode of reproduction and global distribution of oribatid species established. Soil fertility, temperature, moisture, and pasture composition were also measured. The study tested the hypotheses that intensive pasture will have fewer native species, and among Oribatida, lower proportion of fungivores, higher proportion of asexuals, and higher proportion of smaller species with shorter life cycles. The results reflect the complex effect of intensive pasture management on soil organisms. Earthworm densities were higher in the intensive pasture system, with the exception of endemic Octochaetus multiporus. The low-intensity pasture system, where soil C:N ratio
was wider, sheep stocking rate was lower and earthworm numbers were lower, supported higher density and diversity of soil mesofauna and Oribatida, which were concentrated in the topsoil (07.5 cm depth). In the high-intensity pasture system the zone of biological activity was expanded verticallythe mesofauna and Oribatida, although lower overall in density and diversity, were more evenly distributed between the 07.5 cm and 7.515 cm soil depths, suggesting reduced effect of livestock treading and greater food availability at depth. Pastoral intensification influenced oribatid trophic structure, with fungivorous species dominant in LI and herbofungivorous species in HI pasture, which probably reflected underlying differences in food resources, such as more fresh root biomass in HI. There was some evidence suggesting a shift to short-lived, cosmopolitan, and asexually reproducing Oribatida in HI at 07.5 cm soil depth. Oribatid density (which reflected mesofaunal densities), overall diversity, trophic groups, life-history characteristics and especially vertical distribution were more sensitive to soil
management regime than their community structure."
81,Separating the effects of defoliation and dairy cow treading pressure on the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates in pastures,Scientific article,Applied Soil Ecology,"The impact on soil invertebrates of changes in the physical environment and feed availability in intensive pastoral systems is difficult to predict given the number of interacting factors. This study explores the influence of a change in defoliation regimes (pastoral fallow, cut and carry, cow grazing), feed type and availability to ruminants (pasture and pasture supplemented with maize) and dairy cow stocking rates (3, 4 and 5 cows ha−1) on the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates (macrofauna, mesofauna and microfauna). Samples were collected from two depths (0–7.5 and 7.5–15 cm) on a well-structured loamy
Andosol soil in two seasons (autumn and winter). Treatments allowed an independent assessment of the influence of changes in food sources to the soil food-web from that of physical disturbance from livestock treading.

There was a clear distinction in habitable pore space between the fallow and other treatments. The high porosity under fallow (28% under fallow vs. 11–13% under other treatments) appears to be an important factor, increasing faunal abundance and biomass, including macrofaunal predators and Oribatida. Large inputs of litter under fallow benefited epigeic earthworms and resulted in a dominance of bacterialfeeding nematodes (Nematode Channel Ratio 0.97), reflecting the still high quality litter from previous management. Grazed pastures had higher abundances of plant-feeding and plant-associated nematodes
as they were stimulated by increased root growth (abundances up to 1.2×106 indm−2). While there was little difference in total earthworm abundance between treatments, anecic A. longa became progressively more abundant under higher cow stocking rates as food availability and physical pressure increased (18 indm−2 vs. 128 indm−2, under 3 and 5 cows ha−1, respectively). Initial earthworm functional diversity is important and we suggest that anecic earthworms can substitute for epigeic earthworms in intensively managed pastoral systems by incorporating litter, as well as being important ecosystem engineers."
82,"Biodiversity of indigenous tussock grassland sites in Otago, Canterbury and the Central North Island of New Zealand VI. Coleoptera biodiversity, community structure, exotic species invasion, and the effect of disturbance by agricultural development",Scientific article,Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand,"The diversity of Coleoptera communities in tussock grassland at two sites in Otago, one in
Canterbury and one in the central North Island, was compared. The impact of agricultural
disturbance on the communities was compared between native tussock, tussock oversown
with exotic pasture species and cultivated sown pasture. Coleoptera were heat-extracted from
turf samples taken in summer in two consecutive years. In native and oversown treatments,
Staphylinidae and Curculionidae predominated in abundance at three of the four sites, and in
species richness at all sites and treatments. Carabidae were more species-rich than Curculionidae in
cultivated treatments at most sites. The mean density of Coleoptera in native tussock treatments
ranged between 654/m2 and 97/m2. Carnivores were the predominant trophic group followed
by herbivores. Species diversity was higher in the native or oversown treatments and the Otago
sites were the most diverse overall, and the least disturbed. A total of 19 exotic species were
found but there was no relationship with treatment, although their density was higher in cultivated
treatments. There was no evidence to suggest that modified vegetation provides a source of exotic
Coleoptera species to invade native tussock."
83,Plant-mediated and nonadditive effects of two global change drivers on an insect herbivore community,Scientific article,Ecology,"Warmer temperatures can alter the phenology and distribution of individual
species. However, differences across species may blur community-level phenological responses
to climate or cause biotic homogenization by consistently favoring certain taxa. Additionally,
the response of insect communities to climate will be subject to plant-mediated effects, which
may or may not overshadow the direct effect of rising temperatures on insects. Finally, recent
evidence for the importance of interaction effects between global change drivers suggests that
phenological responses of communities to climate may be altered by other drivers. We used a
natural temperature gradient (generated by elevation and topology), combined with
experimental nitrogen fertilization, to investigate the effects of elevated temperature and
globally increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on the structure and phenology of a
seminatural grassland herbivore assemblage (lepidopteran insects).
We found that both drivers, alone and in combination, severely altered how the relative
abundance and composition of species changed through time. Importantly, warmer
temperatures were associated with biotic homogenization, such that herbivore assemblages
in the warmest plots had more similar species composition than those in intermediate or cool
plots. Changes in herbivore composition and abundance were largely mediated by changes in
the plant community, with increased nonnative grass cover under high treatment levels being
the strongest determinant of herbivore abundance. In addition to compositional changes, total
herbivore biomass more than doubled under elevated nitrogen and increased more than
fourfold with temperature, bearing important functional implications for herbivores as
consumers and as a prey resource. The crucial role of nonnative plant dominance in mediating
responses of herbivores to change, combined with the frequent nonadditive (positive and
negative) effects of the two drivers, and the differential responses of species, highlight that
understanding complex ecosystem responses will benefit from multifactor, multitrophic
experiments at community scales or larger."
84,Arboreal arthropod sampling methods for urban trees,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"Large, isolated trees are a prominent part of town planning, and the nature of the urban environment poses unique challenges in sampling the arthropod assemblages found on them. As part of a larger study on the role of these trees in supporting wider biodiversity, we undertook a trial of arthropod sampling methods to compare the relative impact of sampling method versus the species of tree sampled. Using four species of study trees, three sampling methods were trialed: an inverted cone based bole trap, a compact flight intercept trap, and branch bagging and clipping. Total arthropod abundance, richness, and diversity
were modeled using generalised linear mixed models, which showed that in many cases the variation between sampling method was larger than that found between tree species. All three of the sampling methods proved to be practical in the field, and overcame the challenges faced in sampling urban trees, thereby providing the opportunity for more detailed study. Our findings also highlight the case for a multifaceted approach to sampling arthropods if a complete picture of the community assemblage is to be gained."
85,Altered species interactions at forest edges: contrasting edge effects on bumble bees and their phoretic mite loads in temperate forest remnants,Scientific article,Insect Conservation and Diversity,"1. The way in which species interactions are altered at habitat edges is an emerging concern in conservation biology, with some theories predicting edge-affected habitats to be less stable and exhibit intensified species interactions relative to interior habitats. One little-studied interaction is phoresy, where an individual of one species attaches itself to an individual of another species for the purpose of dispersal. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important crop pollinators around the world and at least 10 species of phoretic mites have been associated with various bumble bee species.
2. Here, we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced European B. terrestris across forest-grassland edges in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads on these mobile pollinators.
3. Bumble bees penetrated up to 250 m inside forest fragments, with abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat. By contrast, phoretic mite loads increased towards the forest interior. Overall, phoretic mite loads on B. terrestris were greatest in the forest canopy, suggesting that this species interaction is intensified in natural habitat compared to that in the anthropogenic land use surrounding forest fragments.
4. Our data indicate that phoretic loads on bumble bees are elevated in forest canopies. The functional significance of altered bumble bee  mite interactions for pollination services at forest edges remains to be tested."
86,Honeybee declines in a changing landscape: interactive effects of honeybee declines and land-use intensification on pollinator communities,Scientific report (unpublished),,"Honeybees are used as a major agricultural input around the world and their pollination services have been valued at US$14.6 billion to the United States alone. Dramatic declines in honeybee populations around the globe, however, questioned the sustainability of this reliance on a single pollinator species. In this study, I investigated the response of wild pollinator communities to declining honeybee density and changing land use intensity to determine the potential of wild pollinators to compensate for honeybee loss in increasingly human-modified environment. I generated a gradient of declining honeybee density using increasing distances from commercial bee hives, and conducted flower observations on experimentally-grown plants across this gradient. I investigate how declining honeybee densities and intensifying land use combine to influence the composition of the pollinator community as a whole, then go on to explore individual trends in the most common pollinator species. I then analyze how this impacts the transport of viable pollen by the pollinator community and determine how these changes alter seed set in several common plant species. I then change my focus away from the composition of the pollinator community, and instead investigate how declining honeybee densities and land-use intensification influence the structuring of interactions between plants and pollinators within the community. I identify the pollen species carried by pollinators, and use this to construct a network of pollination interactions. I then use this network to analyze how changes in the way species interact influences the pollination services delivered by the pollinator community to different plant groups (weeds, native plants, and crop species).

My findings show that honeybee declines may have a large impact on community structure and interactions within pollination systems. I observed a significant shift in the wild pollinator community composition as honeybee densities declined, from a generally bee/hoverfly dominated community to one more dominated by large flies. This was associated with a significant decline in the total pollen load transported by the community, indicating that pollination services may suffer in the absence of honeybees. As honeybee densities declined, however, I also observed a shift toward greater specialisation of pollinators on abundant resources, increased pollinator constancy, and a higher viability rate of the pollen transported. These findings show that although the total amount of pollen transported by the community declined as honeybee densities decreased, the probability of this pollen transport resulting in effective pollination likely increased. Thus, I observed no decrease in seed set with honeybee declines in any of the three plant species tested, and one of these even showed a significant increase. Finally, I also demonstrated that this change differentially affected different plant types, and that the extent of changes to each plant species differed between land-use types. This reflected changes in the relative abundance of pollen types in different land uses, with greater specialisation in the absence of honeybees disproportionately benefiting common species. These findings have strong implications for several contemporary issues in pollination biology, both locally within New Zealand and on a global scale. These are discussed in the following sections.

Finally, I conclude by discussing the implications of this research on several contemporary issues in pollination biology, namely the ability for wild pollinators to compensate for honeybee declines, the impact of honeybees on natural new Zealand ecosystems, the contribution of honeybees to invasive weed pollination and finally the management of surrounding land use types to maximize the effectiveness of wild pollinators."
87,Resource availability and foraging of Silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) in urban trees,Scientific article,Emu,"Whereas the changes in avian community composition resulting from urban development are well described, the
specific factors that allow certain species to thrive in urban areas remain poorly understood. However, the availability of
arthropod prey is emerging as a potentially important factor in shaping urban bird communities. Silvereyes (Zosterops
lateralis) arecommonin urban areas and so provide a useful study organism to test the factors that allow somebirds tobecome
urban winners.Wehere present the results of an observational study on the foraging frequency of Silvereyes and arthropod
prey availability in native and exotic urban trees in Dunedin, New Zealand. Silvereyes more frequently used individual trees,
native or exotic, that supported the highest level of arthropod abundance. Silvereye foraging also varied greatly on a seasonal
scale. Silvereyes were able to adjust their seasonal foraging to incorporate exotic vegetation with high arthropod abundances.
We conclude that the flexibility of Silvereyes with regards to foraging and their use of exotic plant species are important
factors in their success in surviving urban development."
88,Big and aerial invaders: dominance of exotic spiders in burned New Zealand tussock grasslands,Scientific article,Biological Invasions,"As post-disturbance community response depends on the characteristics of the ecosystem and the species composition, so does the invasion of exotic species rely on their suitability to the new environment. Here, we test two hypotheses: exotic spider
species dominate the community after burning; and two traits are prevalent for their colonisation ability: ballooning and body size, the latter being correlated with their dispersal ability. We established spring burn, summer burn and unburned experimental plots in a New Zealand tussock grassland area and collected annual samples 3 and 4 years before and after the
burning, respectively. Exotic spider abundance increased in the two burn treatments, driven by an increase in Linyphiidae. Indicator analysis showed that exotic and native species characterised burned and unburned plots, respectively. Generalised linear mixed-effects models indicated that ballooning had a positive effect on the post-burning establishment (density) of spiders in summer burn plots but not in spring plots. Body size had a positive effect oncolonisation and establishment. The ability to balloon may partly explain the dominance of exotic Linyphiidae species. Larger spiders are better at moving into
and colonising burned sites probably because of their ability to travel longer distances over land. Native species showed a low resilience to burning, and although confirmation requires longer-term data, our findings suggest that frequent fires could cause long lasting damage to the native spider fauna of tussock grasslands, and we propose limiting the use of fire to essential situations."
89,The winners and losers of land use intensification: pollinator community disassembly is non-random and alters functional diversity,Scientific article,Diversity and Distributions,"Aim Pollination services are at risk from land use change and intensification, but responses of individual pollinator species are often variable, making it difficult to detect and understand community-level impacts on pollination. We investigated changes in community composition and functional diversity of insect pollinator communities under land use change in a highly modified
landscape.

Location Canterbury region, South Island, New Zealand.

Methods We trapped insect pollinators every month for 1 year at 24 sites across four land use types of increasing intensity in New Zealand: gardens with native vegetation, blackcurrant orchards, dairy farms, and rotational cropping farms. We investigated changes in pollinator species and functional richness and differences in species and functional composition.
Results Under increasing land use intensity, both species and functional richness declined markedly. Changes in functional richness, however, were overall not significantly different than expected based on the observed declines in species
richness. Nevertheless, there was a significant trend towards greater than expected functional richness within less-intensive land use types and lower than expected functional richness within intensive land use types. The order of species loss under increasing land use intensity was non-random, as pollinators with a narrow diet breadth, large body size, solitary behaviour and a preference for non-floral larval food resources were lost first. 

Main conclusions Our study shows that pollinator species bearing particular trait attributes are susceptible to differences in land use. Our study suggests that pollination services may be more vulnerable to environmental changes and disturbances in more intensive land use types as a result of lower pollinator functional richness."
90,Oribatid mite diversity and community dynamics in a spruce chronosequence,Scientific report (published),Soil Biology & Biochemistry,"A comparative study on oribatid mite communities was carried out at four sites forming a chronosequence of spruce forest stands (stand age: 5, 25, 45 and 95-years; Tharandter Wald, Germany). A total of 70 species was found. The moderate decline of oribatid species richness at the 5-years-old stand together with a strong deviation from the log-series model indicate that the community had not recovered from initial disturbance after 5 years. Close community similarity between the 5 and the 95-years-old stands nevertheless suggests a delayed response of the oribatid fauna to strong changes in environmental conditions. Species richness significantly increased from 5 to 25-years-old stand. This was accompanied by a strong increase of oribatid abundance that was largely due to the increase of only two species: Oppiella nova and Tectocepheus velatus. Particularly strong deviation from the log-series model at this site suggests that community disturbance becomes most intense at intermediate stages of forest development. Further analyses revealed an alteration of the feeding structure as well as a stimulation of species that either prefer or are at least able to colonize deeper layers of the soil profile in the 25-years-old stand. This indicates marked changes in both nutritional conditions and microclimate in the uppermost horizons 25 years after clear-cutting.

A very high C mineralization rate measured in the 5-years-old stand confirms the important contribution of decomposition processes to net ecosystem production in young stands. However, no strong correlation between oribatid mite community variance and environmental conditions could be established by means of a canonical correspondence analysis. It is concluded that oribatid mite communities are a fairly conservative element of the decomposer fauna in temperate spruce forests and might thus be an important component in the decomposer systems buffering mechanisms against strong environmental change. Our data indicate a multifaceted reaction of the oribatid community to long lasting changes in site conditions rather than a straightforward response to certain environmental factors."
91,Long-term patterns in tropical reforestation: plant community composition and aboveground biomass accumulation,Scientific report (published),Ecological Applications,"Primary tropical forests are renowned for their high biodiversity and carbon storage, and considerable research has documented both species and carbon losses with deforestation and agricultural land uses. Economic drivers are now leading to the abandonment of agricultural lands, and the area in secondary forests is increasing. We know little about how long it takes for these ecosystems to achieve the structural and compositional characteristics of primary forests. In this study, we examine changes in plant species composition and aboveground biomass during eight decades of tropical secondary succession in Puerto Rico, and compare these patterns with primary forests. Using a well-replicated chronosequence approach, we sampled primary forests and secondary forests established 10, 20, 30, 60, and 80 years ago on abandoned pastures. Tree species composition in all secondary forests was different from that of primary forests and could be divided into early (10-, 20-, and 30-year) vs. late (60- and 80-year) successional phases. The highest rates of aboveground biomass accumulation occurred in the first 20 years, with rates of C sequestration peaking at 6.7 ± 0.5 Mg C·ha1·yr1. Reforestation of pastures resulted in an accumulation of 125 Mg C/ha in aboveground standing live biomass over 80 years. The 80 year-old secondary forests had greater biomass than the primary forests, due to the replacement of woody species by palms in the primary forests. Our results show that these new ecosystems have different species composition, but similar species richness, and significant potential for carbon sequestration, compared to remnant primary forests."
92,"Structure and diversity of secondary tropical dry forests in Mexico, differing in their prior land-use history",Scientific report (published),Forest Ecology & Management,"We compared the structure and diversity of secondary tropical dry forests, growing in sites cleared by bulldozer 30 years ago and subjected to different land uses prior to abandonment: (a) housing development (HD), (b) pasture (P), and (c) no use (NU). We sampled two forest sites representing each of the three former land-use types (i.e., a total of six sites) and measured the diameter at breast height (dbh) of all stems with dbh ≥1 cm and at least 2 m in height. All individuals were identified to species and classified into each of four dbh sizes-classes: 1–3, 3–5, 5–10, and >10 cm. No major differences in structure or diversity were evident among land-use types. Total tree densities varied from 2575 ± 55 to 4745 ± 985 individuals/ha and total basal areas ranged from 12.5 ± 2.6 to 14.6 ± 0.3 m2/ha (mean and S.E.). Neither one differed significantly (p < 0.05) among land-use types. Overall, the most abundant tree size-class was the 1–3 cm dbh (47% of the total number of trees), whereas trees greater than 10 cm dbh were the least abundant (4%). We found significantly higher density and basal area (p = 0.01) in NU than in HD and P only in the smallest trees (1–3 cm dbh). We identified a total of 87 species in 28 families. The Leguminosae plant family had the greatest species richness and number of individuals in all land-use types. The HD land-use type showed lower total species richness than P and NU only with two of the four nonparametric estimators. Observed species richness decreased as dbh increased in all land-use types. At least 5 legumes were among the 10 most dominant species in all land-use types, of which the non-native Mimosa arenosa was the most dominant one. It represented between 42% and 52% of the total basal area in each land-use type. The secondary forests have reached, on average, 74% and 22% of the total density and basal area, respectively, of an average primary tropical dry forest of Mexico. The high number of individuals 1–3 cm dbh (48% of the total and 83% of the species) suggest that regeneration is occurring in all land-use types, although to different degrees. The absence of small individuals of M. arenosa and a high abundance of primary forest species at NU, suggest that M. arenosa is being replaced at these sites."
93,"The value of primary, secondary, and plantation forests for Neotropical epigeic arachnids",Scientific report (published),Journal of Arachnology,"Plantations and secondary forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet
we have an insufficient understanding of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation, and almost none for most
arthropods in species-rich tropical forests. We sampled epigeic arachnids (Amblypygi, Araneae, Opiliones, Scorpiones, and
Uropygi) in primary, secondary (1419 years), and Eucalyptus plantation (45 years) forests in the Jari region of
northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We sampled five independent sites in each forest type between January and June 2005,
collecting a total of 4824 individuals (3177 adults, 112 species), including 1864 adults (75 species) in Eucalyptus, 776 (60) in
secondary forest, and 536 (72) in primary forest. We compared species richness, species-abundance distributions, and
community structure, between the three forest types and identified the species that were characteristic of each forest type.
Rarefaction analyses showed that undisturbed primary forest harbored significantly more species and a similar overall
abundance as second-growth forest; while levels of species richness were similar between secondary forest and Eucalyptus.
The species composition and abundance structure of arachnid assemblages was distinct in all three forest types.
Considering all species sampled, 19% were only sampled in primary forest, 4% in secondary forest, and 19% in Eucalyptus.
Most species sampled in plantation forests are known to be wide-ranging habitat generalists. Our data indicate that
regenerating forests are not biological deserts (57% and 56% of species sampled in primary forest were also captured in
secondary and plantation forests respectively) and can, therefore, help mitigate some of the negative effects of deforestation
for epigeic arachnids. However, these replacement habitats do not provide a substitute for primary forest and may fail to
conserve many of those species most at risk from extinction."
94,"Rapid Recovery of Biomass, Species Richness, and Species Composition in a Forest Chronosequence in Northeastern Costa Rica",Scientific report (published),Biotropica,"Secondary forests are a vital part of the tropical landscape, and their worldwide extent and importance continues to increase. Here, we present the largest chronosequence data set on forest succession in the wet tropics that includes both secondary and old-growth sites. We performed 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, including seven old-growth forests and 23 secondary forests on former pastures, ranging from 10 to 42 yr. The secondary forest sites were formerly pasture for intervals of <125 yr. Aboveground biomass in secondary forests recovered rapidly, with sites already exhibiting values comparable to old growth after 2130 yr, and biomass accumulation was not impacted by the length of time that a site was in pasture. Species richness reached old-growth levels in as little as 30 yr, although sites that were in pasture for > 10 yr had significantly lower species richness. Forest cover near the sites at the time of forest establishment did not significantly impact biomass or species richness, and the species composition of older secondary forest sites (>30 yr) converged with that of old growth. These results emphasize the resilience of tropical ecosystems in this region and the high conservation value of secondary forests."
95,The earthworm fauna of regenerating forests and anthropogenic habitats in the coastal region of Paraná,Scientific report (published),Pesquisa Agropecuária Brasileira,"The aim of this study was to evaluate abundance, biomass and diversity of earthworms in the southern coast region of the Mata Atlântica biodiversity hotspot. A total of 51 study sites in pastures, banana monocultures, mixed agroforestry systems, secondary forests in succession and old-growth forests near the coast of Paraná, Brazil, were evaluated. Each site was sampled once. Species richness of the earthworms was generally low and varied little between sites. At all sites except for one, the peregrine species Pontoscolex corethrurus (Glossoscolecidae) strongly dominated. Three other peregrine species, Amynthas corticis, Amynthas gracilis (Megascolecidae) and Ocnerodrilus occidentalis (Ocnerodrilidae), were frequent in moist sites. No autochthonous species were found. Abundance and biomass of earthworms varied strongly within and between sites (0-338 individuals m-2, 0-96 g m-2 fresh weight). Pastures had significantly lower abundance than all other sites. The forest sites had similar earthworm abundance and biomass, with a tendency to be higher in younger succession stages. The coastal plain region has been strongly altered by human activities. Reasons for the lack of any autochthonous species and the dominance of one peregrine species require further investigation."
96,Early Trajectories of Spontaneous Vegetation Recovery after Intensive Agricultural Land Use,Scientific report (published),Restoration Ecology,"We examined the short-term (45 years) dynamics of stand structure and species composition of two chronosequences of secondary forest stands derived from abandoned cattle pastures (1581 years since abandonment) in the Luquillo and Carite Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico. In 1998, Hurricane Georges struck Puerto Rico, affecting both chronosequences.

Stem densities decreased in all sites with a significant effect of age-class. Intermediate-aged sites had the greatest decrease in density and the largest change in the distribution of size classes. Although there was a significant decrease in the small size classes (<10 cm dbh), due to physical damage from falling debris, there was a large increase in the 1020 cm dbh classes, due to growth of surviving stems. Basal area decreased in 11 of the 15 sites and showed only a slight gain in the other sites. Species richness decreased in all but one site and there was a greater proportional loss of shrub species than tree species. Multivariate ordination successfully placed the resampled sites within their original ordinations with acceptable stress, indicating there was no significant change in species composition or deviation from successional pathways during the period. Compared with effects of land-use, hurricanes create minor variation from expected successional pathways. However, hurricanes contribute to regional- and landscape-scale variation in both stand structure and species composition."
97,The high value of logged tropical forests: lessons from northern Borneo,Scientific report (published),Biodiversity and Conservation,"The carbon storage and conservation value of old-growth tropical forests is clear, but the value of logged forest is less certain. Here we analyse >100,000 observations of individuals from 11 taxonomic groups and >2,500 species, covering up to 19 years of post-logging regeneration, and quantify the impacts of logging on carbon storage and biodiversity within lowland dipterocarp forests of Sabah, Borneo. We estimate that forests lost ca. 53% of above-ground biomass as a result of logging but despite this high level of degradation, logged forest retained considerable conservation value: floral species richness was higher in logged forest than in primary forest and whilst faunal species richness was typically lower in logged forest, in most cases the difference between habitats was no greater than ca. 10%. Moreover, in most studies >90% of species recorded in primary forest were also present in logged forest, including species of conservation concern. During recovery, logged forest accumulated carbon at five times the rate of natural forest (1.4 and 0.28 Mg C ha1 year1, respectively). We conclude that allowing the continued regeneration of extensive areas of Borneos forest that have already been logged, and are at risk of conversion to other land uses, would provide a significant carbon store that is likely to increase over time. Protecting intact forest is critical for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, but the contribution of logged forest to these twin goals should not be overlooked."
98,"Butterfly community recovery in degraded rainforest habitats in the Upper Guinean Forest Zone (Kakum forest, Ghana)",Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"Successful regeneration of secondary tropical forest might be crucial in the conservation of rainforests, since large areas of primary forest have been destroyed or degraded. Animal communities might play an important role in restoration of biological diversity in these secondary habitats, since some groups have high mobility and capacity for dispersal. Fruit-feeding butterflies were trapped to measure differences between butterfly communities in primary rainforest and disturbed forest habitats of different stage of regeneration including clear-cut, abandoned farmland, newly planted forest and middle-aged secondary growth. 3465 specimens representing 114 species were identified from 56 traps operated for 36 days. Extremely high values of rarefied species richness were estimated in the clear-cut habitat, due to the high number of singletons and doubletons. This was caused by a gap-effect that allowed penetration of canopy and open area species after disturbance. The differences between butterfly communities were best demonstrated through ecological composition, richness and abundance of indicator groups and habitat similarity based on Jaccard's similarity index. The results show a clear ability of butterfly communities in degraded forest habitats to regenerate in 50-60 years after clearance."
99,"Recovery of amphibian species richness and composition in a chronosequence of secondary forests, northeastern Costa Rica",Scientific report (published),Biological Conservation,"In some tropical regions, following the abandonment of agriculture and pastures, secondary forests can recover plant species richness and forest structure (e.g. canopy cover, biomass); however, the importance of these secondary forests for fauna is not clear. Secondary forests can benefit fauna by providing suitable habitats, connecting forests fragments, and increasing gene flow. Previous studies of forest regeneration have showed different levels of amphibian recovery. In Puerto Rico, 15 years old secondary forests achieved similar amphibian species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests, while in Brazil secondary forests from 14 to 19 years of recovery only recovered 60% of the species of old-growth forests. We evaluated amphibian recovery in secondary forests in northeastern Costa Rica, by assessing amphibian recovery in 12 secondary forests that vary in age of recovery and in three old-growth forests using visual and acoustic surveys. Our sites varied in terms of their landscape (e.g. amount of surrounding forest) and forest characteristics (e.g. forest age, aboveground biomass, basal area, number of tree species, number of stems, leaf-litter depth), but there was no relationship between these characteristics and amphibian species richness or species composition. We found that amphibians are recovering rapidly in secondary forests in Costa Rica, and even young forests (1016 years) had similar species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests. These forests are providing suitable microhabitats conditions for amphibians. In addition, this study highlights the importance of landscape characteristics. The abundance of amphibian species sources (e.g. forest patches) and connections between forests appear to be helping the species colonize these sites. Worldwide, the area of secondary forests is increasing, and our results show that these habitats are suitable for a diversity of amphibian species, suggesting that these forests can help reduce amphibian population and species decline."
100,"Understory plant species and functional diversity in the degraded wet tropical forests of Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands",Scientific report (published),Biological Conservation,"Anthropogenic activities have resulted in extensive deforestation and forest degradation on many tropical
oceanic islands. For instance, some islands in the Solomon archipelago have as little as 10% of primary
forests remaining with few of these remnants protected from future land use change. We examine the
plant species and functional diversity (excluding adult canopy trees) of 48 sites from four forest land
use types (two types of primary forest, secondary forest and abandoned tree plantations) and two common
human-maintained land use types (coconut plantations and grazed pastures) across three elevation
bands on Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands. In total, we surveyed 384 species from 86 families of
which only 6.5% were non-native. Species richness was lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures
and declined with increasing elevation across all land use types. Functional diversity was similar
between primary and secondary forest (high richness, high evenness and unaltered dispersion) and lowest
in coconut plantations and grazed pastures. Our results suggest that species and functional richness
have had divergent responses to land use change in forest land uses indicative of a loss of functional
redundancy. Despite structural and compositional similarities among primary forests and degraded forest
land uses, full recovery of secondary and commercial plantations has not been achieved. We suggest
that conservation of Kolombangaras forest understory flora will require reserves across the islands elevation
gradient and may require active restoration in the future, particularly if degrading activities continue
at the current rate."
101,Primary tree species diversity in secondary fallow forests of Laos,Scientific report (published),Forest Ecology & Management,"The area of primary forest is decreasing throughout the tropical world and being replaced by secondary forests. Many policy makers regard these secondary forests as being unworthy of protection since they are too degraded to have any commercial or conservation value. Because of this many are now being cleared for alternative land uses. But there are a variety of types of secondary forest differing in the extent to which they have been disturbed, the frequency at which this has taken place and, because of their position in the landscape, in their capacity to be recolonized from species from intact primary forests. This
means that some secondary forests may not be as degraded as is supposed and many may have the capacity to recover if protected from further disturbances. This study reports on a comparison between remnant forest, and frequently and infrequently disturbed secondary forests in Lao PDR. The frequently disturbed forest had been cleared for shifting cultivation 35 times in the past 30 years while the infrequently disturbed sites had been cleared only once. The study found comparatively small differences in the occurrence of primary forest species in these two types of secondary forest and that they still contained
a large proportion of primary forest tree species despite the disturbance history. This apparent resilience may be due to the capacity of many species to resprout after disturbances and their ability to recolonize across the present agricultural matrix."
102,Changes in carabid beetle assemblages across an urban-rural gradient in Japan,Scientific article,Ecography,"As part of the international Globenet project, carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) were collected using pitfall traps from four urban, four suburban and four rural sites in Hiroshima City, Japan, during the 2001 summer season. In agreement with expectation, carabid abundance and species richness decreased significantly from rural to urban sites. Furthermore, no large, and only few individuals of medium-sized specialist species were collected from the urban environment, while many specimens of medium-sized and some large-sized specialist species were collected from the suburban and rural sites. Hiroshima city was characterised by medium-sized generalist carabids, while the suburbs and the rural environments were characterised by small-sized generalist beetles. These results did not apply at the species level. To summarise, we found a significant effect of urbanisation on the composition of carabid beetle assemblages in Hiroshima City. These changes were similar to those found in previous studies performed in Sofia (Bulgaria), Edmonton (Canada) and Helsinki (Finland). Thus, it appears that urbanisation has some similar and predictable effects on carabid assemblages in various parts of the world."
103,Biodiversity and trace element content of epiphytic bryophytes in urban and extraurban sites of southern Italy,Scientific article,Plant Ecology,"In the present study epiphytic bryophytes were employed as a model system in an integrated way both as bioindicators at species, population and community levels and as bioaccumulators of airborne trace elements. Twenty sites with Quercus ilex trees were chosen in a Mediterranean area both in urban and natural locations, with an altitude ranging from 0 to about 500 m a.s.l., in coastal and inland areas (Campania, Italy). Data on the presence of species, cover values and phenology were recorded for each site and the Index of Atmospheric Purity (IAP) was calculated. The data matrix of frequency/cover x species was analysed by multivariate methods. Data obtained clearly show that in urban sites the number of species and IAP values are lower, and that acrocarpous mosses and vegetative reproduction occur more frequently. Contents of trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Ti, V, Zn) were measured in four species and concentrations were normalised to the soil pattern by calculating the Enrichment Factor (EF). The results show the large contribution of resuspended soil particles to the chemical composition of the analysed bryophytes. All the examined species were enriched in Cd, Cu and Zn, and in some cases showed high EF for Pb. The differences among epiphytic bryophyte vegetation are discussed in order to evaluate suspected alterations due to human impact and/or environmental change."
104,"Biodiversity on urban roundabouts - Hemiptera, management and the species-area relationship",Scientific article,Basic and Applied Ecology,"The biodiversity of insects within urban areas has been relatively little studied. Given the large and ever increasing extent of urban areas, and that the insect species richness there can be high, it is important to know the factors determining that aspect of biodiversity. In this study two of these factors, namely habitat management and area, were considered. Arboreal and grassland Hemiptera, and grassland plants, were sampled on 18 roundabouts and other road enclosed sites in the town of Bracknell. Hemiptera were sampled using suction sampling and tree beating. A significant species-area relationship was found for arboreal Hemiptera, which was strongly related to habitat diversity. For both grassland plants and Hemiptera, grassland management, by mowing, had a significant effect on species richness. Despite the management grassland plants showed a significant species-area relationship. However the effect of management on Hemiptera was great enough to outweigh any area effect. As the size of open spaces is often constrained in urban areas, altering habitat management has a greater potential. for enhancing biodiversity. For arboreal Hemiptera choice of trees for planting is of particular importance, white for grassland Hemiptera diversity would be increased with a reduction in the intensity of management, such a reduction in the frequency of mowing."
105,"Carabid beetle community composition, body size, and fluctuating asymmetry along an urban-rural gradient",Scientific article,Basic and Applied Ecology,"Within the goal of defining indicators (species or combinations of life history traits) for habitat quality in an urban environment we investigated effects of urbanization on the community composition and morphological characteristics of carabid beetles. Between May and July 2000 nine woodlots were sampled along three axes representing urban - rural gradients from the centre of the city of Hamburg to its rural borders. Species richness decreased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of the sites but was uncorrelated with the size of the site. Species assemblages were highly nested making successive loss of species predictable. Responsivness towards urbanization could not be linked to specific life history traits. Body length of one species (Carabus nemoralis) declined towards the city centre. Four species were found at all sites. These four species showed differences in fluctuating asymmetry (FA) at the different sites that could not be interpreted as an indication of responses to habitat suitability. FA of the remaining species (species negatively affected by urbanization) increased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of a site. This matched the prediction that FA indicates habitat quality. Thus, urban effects lead to changes of communities through a predictable loss of species, to a reduction in body size in one species, and to increased FA in species which are susceptible to urbanization. The results indicate that the different sites were islands in an urban matrix rather than parts of a green network which would allow free exchange of plants and animals within the city of Hamburg."
106,Patterns in ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages along an urbanisation gradient in Denmark,Scientific article,Acta Oecologica,"The responses of ground beetles to an urbanisation gradient (forest-suburban area-urban park) were studied in and near Soro, South Zealand, Denmark, during April-October 2004. The average number of species per trap did not differ significantly among the three urbanisation stages. The average number of forest species was significantly higher in the forest area (6.2 species/trap) than in either the suburban (4.12 spp/trap) or the urban (3.7 spp/trap) areas. Both the number of open-habitat species (1.8 spp/trap), and the generalist species (2.3 spp/trap) were highest in the urban area. The number of predaceous species was highest in the forest area (8.1 spp/trap), while the number of omnivorous species was highest in the urban area (0.9 spp/trap). Multivariate statistical procedures (NMDS, Sorensen similarity index) also confirmed that species composition changed remarkably along the forest-suburban-urban gradient. The highest number of species (S = 37) was found at the urban area, deviating from trends at other northern hemisphere sites (Canada, Finland) where the overall species richness was highest at the forest habitats. Urban green areas, including forest patches contribute to the quality of urban life and thus should be conserved. Apart from their recreational value, which is widely appreciated and enjoyed by human inhabitants, such green urban spaces provide seemingly adequate habitat for numerous species of ground beetles found in less developed forest areas some distance from the city core."
107,Changes of isopod assemblages along an urban-suburban-rural gradient in Hungary,Scientific article,European Journal of Soil Biology,"Responses of isopod assemblages to urbanisation were studied along an urbanesuburbanerural gradient representing a decrease
in the intensity of human disturbance. Pitfall trapping collected six species (Armadillidium vulgare, Porcellio scaber, Porcellium
collicola, Trachelipus ratzeburgii, Cylisticus convexus, and Trachelipus rathkii). A. vulgare occurred abundantly in all sites reflecting
the broad tolerance and invasive nature of this species. Indicator species analysis demonstrated that P. scaber and T. rathkii were
significant quantitative character species for the urban site, while T. ratzeburgii was characteristic for the natural habitats (suburban
and rural sites). CANOCO revealed that ground and air temperature show positive correlation with the distribution of P. scaber and
T. rathkii, and negative correlation with T. ratzeburgii. Nested ANOVA on trap level showed that there were no significant differences
between the number of isopod species and individuals, and the diversity of isopod assemblages in the three studied areas.
Significant differences were observed at site level. The results did not support the hypothesis that diversity should decrease in response
to habitat disturbance. They also contradicted the intermediate disturbance hypothesis; species richness was not the highest
in the moderately disturbed suburban area. Multivariate methods detected that the isopod assemblages of the rural and suburban
areas were relatively similar, while that of the urban area was relatively separated."
108,Preliminary data on the species diversity of Collembola (Hexapoda: Collembola) along an urban gradient in București,Scientific article,Travaux du Muséum National dHistoire Naturelle Grigore Antipa,"The paper presents the Collembola fauna from urban and peri-urban habitats. There were sampled collembolan fauna from a variety of habitats in the metropolitan area of București, in order to assess general species richness and to establish the most sensitive species of Collembola at air pollution. 50 species of Collembola occur in metropolitan area of București."
109,Extreme life history plasticity and the evolution of invasive characteristics in a native ant,Scientific article,Biological Invasions,"Disturbance resulting from urbanization is a leading cause of biotic homogenization worldwide. Native species are replaced with widespread non-native species and ants are among the worlds most notorious invaders. To date, all documented cases of ant invasions involve exotic introduced species that are spread around the world by human-mediated dispersal. I investigated the effect of urbanization on the evolution of invasive characteristics in a native ant species, the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say). Colony social structure, life history traits, and the spatial pattern of nest distribution were compared by sampling T. sessile across a gradient of three distinct habitats: natural, semi-natural, and urban. Results demonstrate a remarkable transition in colony social and spatial structure and life history traits between natural and urban environments. In natural habitats, T. sessile colonies are comprised of small, monogyne (single queen), and monodomous (single nest) colonies. In urban areas, T. sessile often exhibit extreme polygyny and polydomy, form large supercolonies, and become a dominant pest. Results also suggest that urban T. sessile colonies may have a negative impact on native ant abundance and diversity. In the natural environment T. sessile coexisted with a wide array of other ant species, while very few ant species were present in the urban environment invaded by T. sessile. Habitat degradation and urbanization can lead to extreme changes in social and spatial colony structure and life history traits in a native ant species and can promote the evolution of invasive characteristics such as polygyny, polydomy, and supercolonial colony structure."
110,The confounding influence of homogenising invasive species in a globally endangered and largely urban biome: Does habitat quality dominate avian biodiversity?,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"There are many variables within an urban landscape that can be expected to influence faunal diversity. We used a mechanistic approach to observe the relative importance of each of these variables in describing the diversity of avian communities in urban and peri-urban areas of Cape Town, South Africa situated within Cape Floristic Region, a global plant biodiversity hotspot. We expected to find a strong influence of habitat amount and arrangement across a fragmented urban-rural gradient. Birds were sampled in patches of fragmented Cape Flats Sand Fynbos at 39 locations during the middle of summer (November-January 2008/2009). Environmental data included on-site observations, existing GIS layers, and remotely sensed data. Bird community composition was related to habitat amount, arrangement, and quality. Correlations, partial correlations and structural equation analysis showed that habitat amount and arrangement had insignificant effects on species richness across the urban gradient. Changes in urban density and the presence or absence of the invasive alien tree species Acacia saligna (blue wattle) appeared to be the main drivers of avian species richness. Increasing urban density, decreasing A. saligna density and decreasing canopy height correlated with higher avian species richness, with confounding variables corrected for. For the management of urban biodiversity, our results suggest that the most urgent focus should be on retaining the quality remaining areas of native vegetation (and particularly, containing the spread of A salgina) rather than extending current networks with poor quality habitat. More generally, habitat quality appears to be more important than habitat amount or arrangement in this system. We suggest that this observation be encorporated into further research to more effectively predict avian responses to landscape change and that more must be done to adequately capture the critical and complex role of the matrix in terrestrial systems."
111,"Multi-scaled habitat considerations for conserving urban biodiversity: native reptiles and small mammals in Brisbane, Australia",Scientific article,Landscape Ecology,"The rapid expansion of the world's urban population is a major driver of contemporary landscape change and ecosystem modification. Urbanisation destroys, degrades and fragments native ecosystems, replacing them with a heterogeneous matrix of urban development, parks, roads, and isolated remnant fragments of varying size and quality. This presents a major challenge for biodiversity conservation within urban areas. To make spatially explicit decisions about urban biodiversity conservation actions, urban planners and managers need to be able to separate the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration from patch and local (site)-scale variables for a range of fauna species. We address this problem using a hierarchical landscape approach for native, terrestrial reptiles and small mammals living in a fragmented semi-urban landscape of Brisbane, Australia. Generalised linear modelling and hierarchical partitioning analysis were applied to quantify the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration, patch size and shape, and local habitat composition and structure on the species' richness of mammal and reptile assemblages. Landscape structure (composition and configuration) and local-scale habitat structure variables were found to be most important for influencing reptile and mammal assemblages, although the relative importance of specific variables differed between reptile and mammal assemblages. These findings highlight the importance of considering landscape composition and configuration in addition to local habitat elements when planning and/or managing for the conservation of native, terrestrial fauna diversity in urban landscapes."
112,"Effects of urbanization on ground-dwelling spiders in forest patches, in Hungary",Scientific article,Landscape Ecology,"Effects of urbanization on ground-dwelling spiders (Araneae) were studied using pitfall traps along an urban-suburban-rural forest gradient in Debrecen (Hungary). We found that overall spider species richness was significantly higher in the urban sites compared to the suburban and rural ones. The increased diversity was due to the significantly more open-habitat species in the assemblages at the urban sites. This suggests that species from the surrounding matrix (grasslands and arable lands) penetrated the disturbed urban sites. The ratio of forest species was significantly higher in the rural sites than in the suburban and urban ones, suggesting that forest species are indeed sensitive to the disturbance caused by urbanization. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the species composition changed remarkably along the urbanization gradient. Open-habitat spiders were associated with the urban sites of higher ground and air temperature. Forest spiders were characteristic of the rural sites with higher amount of decaying woods. Our findings suggest that the overall diversity was not the most appropriate indicator of disturbance; species with different habitat affinity should be analyzed separately to get an ecologically relevant picture of the effect of urbanization."
113,Screening of xylophagous fungi associated with Platanus acerifolia in urban landscapes: Biodiversity and potential biodeterioration,Scientific article,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Trees in urban landscapes provide a wide range of benefits to the environment; however, they are exposed to several stress factors that can make them vulnerable to decay by fungi. The presence and identity of wood decay Basidiomycetes affecting Platanus acerifolia, a common tree used in cities, were evaluated in sites with different levels of urban disturbances in order to analyze the relationships between human disturbance level, tree age, fungal pathogens and their degradative potential. We carried out morphological and cultural descriptions of the fungi detected, and studied their decay capacity. Eight species of Basidiomycetes were detected, being Inonotus rickii the most frequently isolated and the most widely distributed in the areas sampled. Bjerkandera adusta, although rarely detected, caused the greatest loss of dry weight. In some cases phylogenetic analyses were performed under both static and dynamic homologies. The age of the trees (estimated from DBH values) sampled seemed to be more important as a predisposing factor for decay than anthropogenic disturbance of sites. The correlation between tree age, presence and identity of fungi, degradative potential and environment conditions is discussed."
114,"Decline in the diversity of willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) as a result of urban expansion in Beijing, China",Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"Beijing, the capital and second largest city of China, expanded in a typical concentric pattern. The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the citys ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones."
115,The Effect of Urbanization on Ant Abundance and Diversity: A Temporal Examination of Factors Affecting Biodiversity,Scientific article,PLOS ONE,"Numerous studies have examined the effect of urbanization on species richness and most studies implicate urbanization as
the major cause of biodiversity loss. However, no study has identified an explicit connection between urbanization and
biodiversity loss as the impact of urbanization is typically inferred indirectly by comparing species diversity along urbanrural
gradients at a single time point. A different approach is to focus on the temporal rather than the spatial aspect and
perform before and after studies where species diversity is cataloged over time in the same sites. The current study
examined changes in ant abundance and diversity associated with the conversion of natural habitats into urban habitats.
Ant abundance and diversity were tracked in forested sites that became urbanized through construction and were
examined at 3 time points - before, during, and after construction. On average, 4.361.2 unique species were detected in
undisturbed plots prior to construction. Ant diversity decreased to 0.760.8 species in plots undergoing construction and
1.561.1 species in plots 1 year after construction was completed. With regard to species richness, urbanization resulted in
the permanent loss of 17 of the 20 species initially present in the study plots. Recovery was slow and only 3 species were
present right after construction was completed and 4 species were present 1 year after construction was completed. The
second objective examined ant fauna recovery in developed residential lots based on time since construction, neighboring
habitat quality, pesticide inputs, and the presence of invasive ants. Ant diversity was positively correlated with factors that
promoted ecological recovery and negatively correlated with factors that promoted ecological degradation. Taken together,
these results address a critical gap in our knowledge by characterizing the short- and long-term the effects of urbanization
on the loss of ant biodiversity."
116,Urban summer heat load: meteorological data as a proxy for metropolitan biodiversity,Scientific article,Meteorologische Zeitschrift,"Regional climate models forecast that the incidence of extreme heat waves will increase in Central Europe, and the associated intensification of urban heat islands causes concerns about human health and biodiversity. We investigated species diversity of terrestrial gastropods across an urban gradient in a metropolitan area. We considered 34 sites of different degrees of urbanization and of different thermal stress classes (TSC) that were derived from a classification of urban heat load based on the physiological equivalent temperature (PET). A total of 31 species were recorded with 021 species per site (mean: 4.4 ± 5.2 species per site). Alpha diversity was best explained by TSC, bush cover and perennial vegetation cover, and it decreased with
increasing thermal stress. Overall, thermal stress predicted snail and slug species richness better than urban cover (ANOVA(analysis of variance); TSC: F = 10.0, p < 0.001; urbanization: F = 3.9, p = 0.018), and the proportional loss in species richness was higher for native species than for introduced species. The results indicate that climatic stress contributes to the impoverishment of biodiversity in urban areas.We propose that TSC and/or PET are useful indicators for environmental stress levels in biodiversity studies in natural and anthropogenically transformed landscapes."
117,"Structure and species composition of ground bryophyte community of high-altitude young silvicultural cutovers in Rangtang County, China: evaluation on effects of clear-cutting and silvicultural management",Scientific article,Journal of Plant Ecology,"Aims  Traditional forestry management influences biodiversity. Revealing effects of clear-cutting and silvicultural history on ground bryophyte communities is important for evaluating impacts of forest management on biodiversity.

Methods  We selected four sites with similar physical conditions but different development phases in Rangtang County. We investigated bryophyte and vascular plant vegetation, including species composition and structural characteristics, in 30 plots in each site. ANOVA analysis was used to detect differences among bryophyte communities, and the relationship between vascular plant and bryophyte communities was examined by partial correlations.

Important findings   Bryophyte composition changed significantly during developmental processes of young forests. Photophilic or pleurocarpous mosses were dominant species, while some hygrophilous mosses expanded their populations and become dominant species locally and drought-tolerant species occurred because of disturbance. Richness index (2237) and diversity index (0.371.08) increased during the process of development, and the four young forestlands had differences in structural characteristics. There was a positive relationship between cover of tree and shrub layers and development of bryophytes. Shrub layer significantly promoted bryophyte richness, while pioneer grass with strong development and litter restrained bryophyte development. Characteristics of development in tree, shrub, litter layer and their interaction changed dynamically during the developmental process.Promoting development of tree and shrub layers has an important role on enhancing bryophytes."
118,Evaluation of species composition and development of bryophyte community during early natural recovery progress of high-altitude spruce cutovers,Scientific article,Biodiversity Science,"Due to traditional forest management, many forest ecosystems in western Sichuan Province have
become degraded. To quantify the composition and structure of bryophyte communities which are early in
the natural recovery process, we sampled four sites with similar topographic situation, but at different points
in the recovery process. All sites were located in the Rangtang County, Aba region, Sichuan Province. Species
composition and structural parameters were surveyed between July and October of 2006. We used
ANOVA analysis to detect differences among bryophyte communities, and nonparametric Spearman correlation
to test for relationships between bryophyte structural parameters and environmental factors. We used regression
analysis to explore the factors influencing bryophyte development. Our results suggested three main
points. Firstly, dominant species composition changed during the natural recovery process. Some small-sized,
heliophilous, and disturbance-resistant acrocarpous mosses with a high sporulation ability had expanded their
populations, while some hygrophilous pleurocarpous mosses sensitive to early successional conditions had
disappeared. Secondly, diversity indices, coverage, and biomass decreased during the natural recovery process,
indicating that bryophyte communities became simplified with recovery progress. Thirdly, there was a
close relationship between vascular plants and bryophytes. Bryophyte cover and richness were mainly influenced by herbaceous layer biomass, while bryophyte biomass was significantly affected by herbaceous layer
height. Our results implied that different microhabitats resulting from vascular plant community development
affected development of bryophyte communities."
119,Recovery of woody plant diversity in tropical rain forests in southern China after logging and shifting cultivation,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Logging and intense shifting cultivation have caused major degradation of tropical forests and loss of biodiversity.
Understanding the direct and indirect effects of those land uses on plant biodiversity is essential
to the restoration of tropical forests. We compared the species diversity, community composition and
basal area of all stems P1 cm dbh among 18 1-ha tropical lowland and montane rain forest plots with a
well-recorded long-term history of shifting cultivation and logging on Hainan Island, south China. We
also explored the relative importance of disturbance and environmental factors in determining forest
recovery. We found that the species density and diversity in old growth forests were higher than in shifting
cultivation fallows (55 years old) but lower than in logged forests (3540 years since logging). The
species composition of shifting cultivation fallows was distinct from other forest types but logged forests
were similar to old growth forests, especially in lowland forests. Disturbance intensity was the most frequently
important factor in determining species composition, species density, diversity, and basal area
accumulation. Soil nutrient availability explained some of the variation in species composition and diversity.
Stem density was related to multiple factors including disturbance history, soil nutrients, and distance
to old-growth forest. In general, we found that disturbance intensity was a better predictor of
forest structure and diversity than edaphic environmental variables, highlighting the importance of
human impacts in shaping tropical forest successional pathways."
120,Communities of soil macrofauna in green spaces of an urbanizing city at east China,Scientific article,Revista Chilena de Historia Natural,"We evaluated the diversity of soil macrofauna communities inhabiting urban green spaces in Yancheng City, an
urbanizing city located east of China. In the end of April 2011, the taxonomic richness, abundance and composition of
soil macrofauna communities were assessed and compared among fi ve types of green space (poplar forest, rapeseed
farm, grassland in park, lawn and nursery garden) and three depth layers in the soil, with taxonomic resolution
attained at the order level. Taxonomic richness (orders) and abundance were signifi cantly different among green
spaces. Diversity indices (Margalefs taxonomic richness R and Shannon-Weaver diversity index H) were higher in
poplar forest, grassland in park and nursery garden than in rapeseed farm and lawn. Taxonomic richness (Chao 2)
showed a similar trend. There were signifi cant effects of green space type and soil layer, which showed a signifi cant
interaction affecting macrofauna composition. We recommend that urban green spaces can be used for maintaining
biodiversity, not only for landscape purposes."
121,Regeneration strategies influence ground bryophyte composition and diversity after forest clearcutting,Scientific article,Annals of Forest Science,"& Context Natural regeneration with broadleaved species and
reforestation with coniferous trees are two widely practiced
forest regeneration strategies after timber harvesting. They
lead to different tree species composition and may cause
different understory biodiversity, but the effects on ground
bryophyte composition and diversity are not well-known.
& Aims We tested whether natural regeneration with broadleaved
species and reforestation with spruce induced different diversities
of the ground bryophyte populations 2040 years after oldgrowth
spruce forest clearcutting in the subalpine regions of
southwestern China.
& Methods Differences between natural stands and plantations
were compared through the analysis of 13 paired stands, with
78 plots, 390 shrub/herb quadrats, and a total of 1,560 bryophyte
quadrats.
& Results Naturally regenerated forests were characterized by
lower density and cover and lower tree height but higher
herbaceous plant height, shrub cover, and bryophyte diversity.
They also harbored many more ground bryophytes. The species
richness of pleurocarpousmosses and fans,mats, and turfs were
significantly higher in naturally regenerated forests. Frequency
difference analysis demonstrated that more bryophyte species
preferred ground habitats in naturally regenerated forests than
in plantations (116 vs. 48 species). The canonical correspondence
analysis indicated that stand structure attributes were
more important determinants of ground bryophyte diversity
and abundance.
& Conclusion Natural regeneration and reforestation resulted
in large differences in ground bryophyte populations. A larger
diversity was observed in the former case, and natural regeneration
practices can be an effective measure for the protection
of ground bryophyte diversity after clearcutting."
122,"Species richness and guild composition in rubber plantations compared to secondary forest on Hainan Island, China",Scientific article,Agroforest Syst,"Currently, the one of great threats to
tropical biodiversity is the conversion of natural
ecosystems to agriculture, and this threat is particularly
critical on Hainan, the largest tropical island in China
and a global biodiversity hotspot. Rubber (Hevea
brasiliensis) has been planted on Hainan since the
1950s, resulting in extensive replacement of native
forest, and the rate of this transformation has increased
with latex prices since the 1990s. Rubber plantations
now cover ca. 506,680 ha on Hainan and reach ca
1,000 m in elevation. To investigate the effect of this
land-use change, we compared avian communities
between a rubber plantation and a native secondary
semi-deciduous monsoon forest.Wefound that species
richness was higher in the native forest than in rubber,
and that community composition differed greatly
between the two habitats. No strict frugivores were
recorded in rubber and no granivores in semi-deciduous
monsoon forest. In both richness and abundance,
more nectarivores and fewer insectivores occurred in
rubber than in the native forest. Some common forest
species, as well as protected species, were found only
in native forest, including Hainan Partridge (Arborophila
ardens), Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus), Emerald
Dove (Chalcophaps indica), Black-browed Barbet
(Megalaima oorti), Blue-rumped Pitta (Pitta soror),
Puff-throated Bulbul (Alophoixus pallidus), and Chestnut
Bulbul (Hemixos castanonotus). Although ten
babbler species were found in the native forest, only
two were in rubber. Among the species missing in
rubber was the endemic Hainan species Grey Laughingthrush
(Garrulax maesi). Its endangerment through
habitat conversion is of particular conservation concern."
123,Using soil and litter arthropods to assess the state of rainforest restoration,Scientific article,Ecological Management & Restoration,"The present study investigated recolonization patterns of selected soil and
litter arthropods following replanting of pasture with rainforest species in the Mary River
catchment of eastern subtropical Australia. While extensive research has been conducted
in rehabilitated mined sites in Australian dry sclerophyll forests, very little attention has
been paid to rainforest restoration on previously pastoral land. We examined the utility of
soil and litter arthropod groups for monitoring the progress of restoration, and the relationship
between arthropod assemblage patterns and environmental factors potentially
under the control of those doing the replanting. Leaf litter was extracted from 20 sites: five
remnant rainforest, five pasture, and 10 sites that had been revegetated (from 1 to 12 years
previously) with a diversity of indigenous species. Ants (identified to genus), centipedes,
millipedes, isopods, amphipods and mites were enumerated and their assemblages
described with multi- and univariate methods. Ant genera alone proved unable to distinguish
pasture from rainforest, and mites (identified only to oribatid or non-oribatid) proved
of limited use because these two groups were present in all samples in extremely high
numbers that overwhelmed the contributions of other arthropod groups. However, a coarse
taxonomic approach using five arthropod groups (ants, centipedes, millipedes, isopods,
amphipods) clearly discriminated between pasture and rainforest, and also arranged the
revegetated sites between these two extremes. Simple frequency scores based on the
presence/absence of these arthropod groups in each of three replicate subplots were sufficient
to achieve this separation of site types. Habitats created by close planting of trees
and mulching may accelerate invertebrate colonization and, thus, promote the rapid establishment
of processes and functions characteristic of developing rainforests."
124,A comparison of orang-utan density in a logged and unlogged forest on Sumatra,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Several studies have shown that there is a strong decline in orang-utan densities shortly after logging. Nevertheless, there is little
information on whether orang-utan densities return to their pre-logging values when logged forest is left to recover. This study
investigates the orang-utan density in a 22-year-old selectively logged forest and compares it with the orang-utan density in a nearby
ecologically similar primary forest. The results show that the orang-utan density did not differ significantly between primary forest
and the selectively logged forest. Since we found no difference in fruit availability between the selectively logged and primary forest,
we suggest that the selectively logged forest regenerated sufficiently well to sustain pre-logging levels of orang-utans. This study
confirms previous studies that suggest fruit availability is the best ecological predictor of orang-utan densities and found a positive
overall correlation between orang-utan density and fruit availability. The food attraction hypothesis, which explains local fluctuations
in orang-utan density as a result of variation in fruit availability, was not supported."
125,Species richness and community composition of songbirds in a tropical forest-agricultural landscape,Scientific article,Animal Conservation,"Management strategies that attempt tomitigate tropical biodiversity loss require detailed studies of biodiversity
in different land-uses. In this study the community structure and species richness of songbirdswas characterised
along with the vegetation structure, in three land-use types in and around a tropical forest reserve in Uganda
(intact, mature forest; regenerating secondary forest; smallholder agriculture). Each land-use type had 3035
count stations that were sampled twice by means of a 15-min recording session. In total, 118 bird species
were recorded from 192 station counts. Number of species/station was similar in intact and regenerating forest
and lower in smallholder agriculture. Songbird communities in intact forest were highly distinct from those in
smallholder agriculture and were composed of forest-dependent species. Communities in regenerating forest
were intermediate between intact forest and agriculture, although much closer to intact forest. Generalised
Linear Model (GLM) modelling revealed that tree density and distance to the nearest intact forest had strong
positive and non-linear effects on the community composition and forest species richness of songbirds.
Simulations using these models showed that agroforestry programmes would not raise tree densities to
levels that would shift agricultural songbird communities towards forest communities. Current and bestcase
agricultural practices are therefore unlikely to contribute to the conservation of the songbird component
of forest biodiversity in this area."
126,"Methods for conservation outside of formal reserve systems: The case of ants in the seasonally dry tropics of Veracruz, Mexico",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Like most ecosystems of the world, tropical dry forests of the central coast of the Gulf of Mexico are inadequately preserved.
Given that reserve expansion is unlikely, it is imperative that the conservation capacity of the matrix surrounding reserves is
enhanced. Here, we examine the habitat value of isolated pasture trees and patches of secondary regrowth in terms of their terrestrial and arboreal ant assemblages in both a wet and dry season. These simpliWed wooded systems increase species densities within the agricultural matrix and provide habitat for some forest ant species. Estimated species richness of arboreal ants was particularly low on isolated trees, highlighting an important limitation. This was not the case for terrestrial ants, which were particularly species rich under isolated trees. We also found that the inter-site variations in species densities and similarity to the forest ant assemblage for terrestrial and arboreal strata were not correlated, suggesting that responses to restoration may not be as uniform as often thought. This has important implications for the use of indicator taxa in suggesting the response of other taxa. In terms of species composition, neither secondary regrowth nor isolated trees were appropriate replacements for forest fragments, even though the studied forest fragments were small (1332 ha). The ant assemblages did not exhibit a seasonal change in composition. However, season inXuenced the contrast between habitats, with isolated trees being more distinct from pasture, and regrowth more closely resembling forests, during the wet season. Microclimatic variables indicate that the forests were least aVected by the tropical dry season, and this may contribute to their characteristic fauna. We conclude that even small forest patches make a unique contribution to landscape conservation and that, where reserves are limited, conscientious management of the landscape matrix may provide some species with suYcient new habitat to survive outside of reserve systems. These conclusions are inXuenced by both season and strata studied."
127,Spatiotemporal variation in the diversity of Hymenoptera across a tropical habitat gradient,Scientific article,Ecology,"Understanding global biodiversity patterns requires analyses at multiple spatial and temporal scales, across a variety of different habitat types. We used a highly
replicated study in coastal Ecuador to examine simultaneously for the first time spatial and
temporal species turnover and the contribution of five different habitat types (rice, pasture,
coffee agroforests, abandoned coffee agroforests, and native forest fragments) to regional
diversity in the tropics, using the experimental placement of standardized nesting structures
for bees and wasps. There was notable overlap in the communities of different habitat
types, indicating that even intensively managed land can provide a valuable contribution
to the overall biodiversity of the landscape mosaic. Importantly, there was a significant
effect of habitat type on temporal variation in diversity. While intensive cropping systems
such as rice and pasture exhibited higher diversity in certain months, greater species turnover
through time in the abandoned coffee and forest plots accounted for the higher overall
diversity in these habitats. Overall, spatial and temporal turnover explained 38.6% and
23.1%, respectively, of partitioned regional species richness. A quantitative analysis revealed that the relative habitat specificity of Hymenoptera decreased with increasing habitat
disturbance."
128,"The impacts of forest clearance on lizard, small mammal and bird communities in the arid spiny forest, southern Madagascar",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Madagascar is a global biodiversity hotspot threatened by forest loss, degradation and fragmentation,
all of which are detrimental to the future survival of forest-dwelling organisms.
For conservation purposes it is essential to determine howspecies respond to habitat disturbance,
specifically deforestation. In this study we investigated the impacts of deforestation
on three vertebrate communities, lizards, small mammals and birds, in an area of spiny forest
subjected to anthropogenic forest clearance. Spiny forest has high levels of endemism,
but conservation in this unique ecosystem is hindered by the lack of research.We undertook
standardised trapping, time-constrained and timed species searches to assess species richness,
species abundance and community composition of lizards, small mammals and birds
in six areas of forest and six cleared areas. From surveys and opportunistic sightings we
recorded a total of 70 species of birds, 14 species of mammals and 38 species of reptiles and
amphibians.We found forest clearing to have a negative effect on species richness and community
structure of all groups and identified loss of canopy cover as a driving factor behind
this. However, the response and sensitivity to clearing varied between groups and species.
Lizards (50%) and small mammals (40%) had the greatest decline in species richness in
response to clearing as compared to birds (26%), although birds showed the greatest shift
in community structure. The community in cleared areas contained more generalist and
introduced species that have wider geographic ranges and habitat preferences, than those
unique to the spiny forest.We found the first suite of species to suffer from forest clearance
were those of high conservation priority due to their restricted geographic range. Our findings
are discussed in relation to future spiny forest conservation and management."
129,"Beetle (Coleoptera) and spider (Araneae) diversity in a mosaic of farmland, edge, and tropical forest habitats in western Costa Rica",Scientific article,Pan-Pacific Entomologist,"A central focus in applied entomology is the role that habitat diversity plays in the
creation and maintenance of arthropod diversity. Researchers are increasingly exploring the
possibility that degraded landscapes such as mixed-used agricultural areas and rainforest
fragments might be used to supplement conservation strategies aimed at increasing arthropod
biodiversity. Here we present the results of a comparative biodiversity field study in the
Puriscal region on the Pacific slope of Costa Rica in a rural community characterized by
a mixture of secondary forest and farmland. The study compares beetle and spider diversity
among farmland, nearby tropical forest fragments, and weedy edge habitats. Diversity of
families of Coleoptera and Araneae pitfall catches were compared in each of these three
habitats, and quantitative similarity indices across habitats were calculated for the collected
specimens. Diversity among the three habitats was similar for beetles, but spiders were more
diverse in forest fragments than in edge habitats. Furthermore, composition of beetle families
was markedly different across all three habitats; spider families were similar only between
forest fragment and edge habitats. We discuss the implications of these findings, and suggest
further studies needed to address mechanisms underlying these patterns."
130,Disturbance effects on diversity of epiphytes and moths in a montane forest in Ecuador,Scientific article,Basic and Applied Ecology,"We sampled the diversity of epiphytes (lichens, bryophytes, vascular plants) and moths (Geometridae, Arctiidae) in
mature and recovering forest and in open vegetation in the montane belt in Ecuador. No uniform pattern of change in
species richness was detected among the different taxonomic groups with increasing disturbance. Species richness of
epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants declined significantly from mature forest towards open vegetation. In
contrast, species richness of epiphytic lichens did not change with increasing forest alteration, while that of geometrid
moths was significantly higher in recovering forest compared with mature forest and open habitats. Arctiidae were
significantly more species-rich in recovering forest and open vegetation than mature forest. Hence, for some organisms,
modified habitats may play an important role for biodiversity conservation in the Andes, whereas others suffer from
habitat disturbance. However, trends of changes in species composition following deforestation were surprisingly
concordant across most studied epiphyte and moth taxa."
131,"Mammal persistence and abundance in tropical rainforest remnants in the southern Western Ghats, India",Scientific article,Current Science,"Occurrence and abundance of mammals were compared
in five large protected rainforest patches inside
the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and in four
smaller, unprotected rainforest fragments in a plantation
matrix in the Anamalai hills, southern Western
Ghats using line transect distance sampling. Among
the 28 mammal species found in contiguous protected
rainforests, 24 persisted in unprotected fragments.
For most species, population densities were similar between
the two strata. Density of arboreal mammal species
showed varying habitat correlates across the sites
sampled; Indian giant squirrel density was negatively
correlated to canopy overlap, lion-tailed macaque
density negatively and Nilgiri langur positively to
rainforest tree density respectively. Persistence of most
mammals on private lands in a fragmented landscape
may be attributed to proximity to the surrounding
large tract of reserved forest areas as well as recent
conservation efforts, including reduction of hunting
and protection of fragments. Comparison with past estimates
suggests that arboreal mammals have persisted
and increased in abundance over the last decade, particularly
in private fragments, possibly due to multiple
factors, including the ability of the species to use matrix
habitats, low hunting pressure, lack of predators and
higher food availability."
132,"Oil palm expansion into rain forest greatly reduces ant biodiversity in canopy, epiphytes and leaf-litter",Scientific article,Basic and Applied Biology,"Oil palm cultivation is expanding rapidly into many of the worlds most biodiverse tropical regions.One of the most function-
ally important and ecologically dominant animal groups in these environments is the ants. Here, we quantify the overall impacts
of clear-felling lowland dipterocarp rainforest and conversion into oil palm plantation on ant diversity. At study sites in Sabah,
Malaysia we collected ants from three microhabitats: 1the canopy, 2birds nest ferns (Asplenium nidus complex, a common
epiphyte in forest and oil palm), and 3leaf litter. We also measured temperature, humidity and light at collection sites to assess
their impacts on ant community composition. Total ant species richness decreased from 309 to 110 (64%) between forest and
oil palm plantation. However, this impact was not the same across all microhabitats, with birds nest ferns maintaining almost
the same number of ant species in oil palm compared to forest (forest-oil palm, ferns: 3635(3% loss), canopy: 12058(52%
loss), leaf litter: 21656(74% loss)). Relative abundance distributions remained the same for fern-dwelling ants, but became
less even for oil palm ants in both the canopy and the leaf litter. These differences may be due in part to the ability of birds nest
ferns to provide a stable microclimate in hot, dry plantations. We also found that non-native ant species were more abundant
in oil palm than in forest, and few forest ant species survived in plantations in any of the microhabitats. Only 59 of the 309
forest species persisted in oil palm plantations, corresponding to an 81% loss of forest species resulting from habitat conversion.
Although oil palm supports many more ant species than has been previously reported, converting forest into plantation still
leads to a dramatic reduction in species richness. The maintenance of forested areas is therefore vital for the conservation of
ant biodiversity."
133,Effects of farm and landscape management on bird and butterfly conservation in western Honduras,Scientific article,Ecosphere,"Previous research has indicated that a substantial portion of native flora and fauna may persist
in agricultural mosaics in the Neotropics. However, understanding the relative importance of different
habitat factors and management practices at different scales for sustaining this biodiversity has proven
somewhat elusive. In addition, most such research has taken place in only a few fairly well-studied
landscapes, thus limiting our ability to infer broader patterns that might be transferred to unstudied
locales. This study expands the geographic breadth of prior research by evaluating bird and butterfly
assemblages in an agricultural landscape in the R´o Copa´n watershed of western Honduras. The study also
provides a systematic assessment of the relative influence of categorical and continuous habitat variables
across a range of scales likely to be significant for birds and butterflies. Overall, we recorded 145 tree
species, 139 bird species, and 119 butterfly species. Birds and butterflies displayed contrasting responses to
land cover: birds were most strongly associated with dense vegetation in broadleaf forests, forest fallows,
shade-grown coffee farms, and live fences, while butterflies were most abundant in live fences, pastures,
and riparian forests. Bird assemblages were heavily skewed toward common and non-forest-dependent
species, likely due to the young age and high disturbance level of forest plots. In contrast, butterfly
assemblages contained a substantial proportion of forest-dependent species, which were observed in
forests as well as pastures and live fences. Contrary to expectations, categorical land cover descriptors were
more effective at explaining faunal assemblage patterns than continuous habitat descriptors related to
vegetation and landscape context. In addition, plot scale (25100 m) habitat features had a greater influence
on faunal assemblages than did neighborhood scale (2003000 m) landscape composition or structure,
although differences in management intensity at the scale of the entire watershed (520 km) also exerted a
strong influence on conservation outcomes."
134,"Abundance responses of frugivorous bats (Stenodermatinae) to coffee cultivation and selective logging practices in mountainous central Veracruz, Mexico",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Shifting and permanent cultivation, selective logging, cattle production and
coffee plantations are among the most important factors in montane cloud forest conversion
and disturbance. Although shaded-coffee plantations can contribute to the preservation
of local species richness, abundance of organisms could be determined by habitat
resource availability in agricultural landscapes. We compared abundance of Sturnira and
Artibeus bats (Phyllostomidae, Stenodermatinae), in shade coffee plantations and disturbed
cloud forest fragments, which represent habitats with different chiropterochorous plant
density. We also investigated the relationship between bat species abundance and food
plant richness, abundance and diversity. We captured 956 bats, 76% in cloud forest
fragments and 24% in shaded coffee plantations. Abundance of Sturnira spp. (small bats)
was greater in cloud forest than in coffee plantations, but Artibeus spp. (large bats)
abundance was similar in both habitats. Chiropterochorous plant abundance was positively
related with bat abundance for Sturnira spp., while chiropterochorous plant richness and
diversity were negatively related for Artibeus spp. This suggests that frugivorous bats with
different morphological and ecological characteristics respond differentially to anthropogenic
activities. For landscape management purposes, the maintenance and augmentation
of diverse food resources, for frugivorous bats with different foraging requirements in
coffee plantations, will benefit the resilience of bats to modification of their natural habitat."
135,"Bird communities of the lower Waria Valley, Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea: a comparison between habitat types",Scientific article,Tropical Conservation Science,"From June, 2007, to February, 2009, the Waria Valley Community Conservation and Sustainable Livelihoods Project (WVCP) completed an inventory survey of the birds of the lower Waria Valley, Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. Four land use types -- agricultural, secondary forest edge, primary forest edge and primary forest -- were surveyed using Mackinnon list surveys. In total, 125 species representing 43 families were identified, of which 54 (43.2%) are endemic to the islands of New Guinea and the Bismark Archipelago. The avifauna of primary forest edge and primary forest was more species rich and diverse than that of agricultural habitats. Agricultural habitats also differed significantly in both overall community composition and some aspects of guild composition compared to all three forested habitats. Nectarivores and insectivore-frugivores formed a significantly larger proportion of species in agricultural habitats, whereas obligate frugivores formed a significantly greater proportion in forested habitats. We propose further survey and management initiatives that could help contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of the areas important biological resources."
136,Effects of forest modification on bird community composition and seed removal in a heterogeneous landscape in South Africa,Scientific article,Oikos,"Human disturbance threatens and modifi es forest ecosystems worldwide. Previous studies have investigated the eff ects of
human impact on local bird communities in disturbed forests, but we still lack information on how bird species richness
and ecological processes respond to diff erent forest modifi cations present at a landscape scale. In a heterogeneous South
African landscape, we chose six types of indigenous scarp forest, diff ering in the intensity of human disturbance: continuous
natural forests and natural forest fragments in nature reserves, forest fragments in eucalyptus plantations, fragments
in the agricultural matrix, forest gardens and secondary forests in game reserves. In 36 study sites, we investigated the bird
community using point counts and observed the seed removal of birds at the native tree species Celtis africana . Species
richness did not diff er among the forest types, but abundance varied signifi cantly with most birds observed in fragments in
the agricultural matrix, forest gardens, and secondary forests. Th e higher bird abundance in these forests was mainly due
to forest generalists, shrubland and open country species whereas forest specialists were rarely present. Changes in species
composition were also confi rmed by multivariate analysis which clearly separated bird communities by forest type. Frugivore
abundance in C. africana was highest in natural forest fragments, fragments in the agricultural matrix, forest gardens
and secondary forests. Th e same trend was found for the estimated total number of fruits removed per C. africana tree,
though the diff erences among forest types were not signifi cant. Consequently, modifi ed forests seem to maintain important
ecological functions as they provide food sources for generalist species which may, due to their mobility, enhance natural
plant regeneration. However, we could show that protected forest habitats are important refugees for specialist species
sensitive to human disturbance."
137,The distribution and abundance of small mammals in agroecosystems of southeastern Brazil,Scientific article,Mammalia,"The conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes depends on information about the ways in which species are affected by the conversion of native habitats into novel anthropogenic environments and the strategies that the species use to persist in these altered ecosystems. Here, we investigate how small mammals occupy the different agroecosystems of an agricultural landscape in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. From August 2003 through January 2005, we surveyed small mammals using Sherman traps at 16 sampling sites in each of the four predominant environments of the local agricultural landscape: remnant fragments of semideciduous forest, Eucalyptus plantations, sugarcane plantations, and pastures. With a total effort of 23,040 trap-nights and a capture success of 0.8%, we captured 177 rodents and marsupials belonging to eight species. The assemblage represented by these mammals is essentially composed of generalist species, which are common in degraded areas. Sugarcane plantations had the highest abundance, whereas pastures had the lowest species richness. Our results suggest that the loss of forest species can be related to the loss of native forest. The results also indicate that to improve the conservation value of agricultural landscapes, native forest fragments should be conserved, extensive monocultures should be avoided and agricultural impacts should be mitigated."
138,Terrestrial non-volant small mammals in agro-silvicultural landscapes of Southeastern Brazil,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"The area covered by Eucalyptus plantations is significantly increasing in Brazil for economic reasons.
However, the impact of such land use change is still unknown. In this study we evaluated the spatial
temporal distribution and abundance of terrestrial non-volant small mammals on a recently converted
landscape whose matrix is formed by Eucalyptus plantations up to 3 years of age. From August 2007 to
July 2009 we carried out monthly sampling campaigns over a grid of 30 sampling units, formed by pitfall
traps covering both the landscape matrix of Eucalyptus plantations (n = 18) and legal conservation areas
of native vegetation (n = 7) and abandoned pastures (n = 5). A total of 1640 individuals from 14 species of
the orders Didelphimorphia (4 spp.) and Rodentia (10 spp.) were captured. However, only three species of
rodents (Olygorysomys flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Calomy tener) represented 81.8% of the total
amount. Eucalyptus plantations had a lower species richness and abundance than the abandoned pasture
and the remaining fragments of native vegetation. Although the present species are predominantly generalists,
there is clear distinction among environments in terms of their species composition and relative
abundance, which also present a pronounced time variation. The assemblage found in this study suggests
that silvicultural landscapes still have some conservation value, with species that seem to be resident at
the Eucalyptus plantations. Moreover, the presence of the native and abandoned pastures patches
imbibed in the Eucalyptus plantation matrix may increase the carrying capacity of such a silvicultural system
and these landscapes may play a role in maintaining local biodiversity."
139,Land use practices and their implications on soil macro-fauna in Maasai Mara ecosystem,Scientific article,International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation,"The composition, abundance, diversity and species richness of soil macro-fauna communities were assessed in four major land use types present within protected and agricultural landscapes in Maasai Mara savannah ecosystem (MME), Kenya. The four land uses were: natural grassland; woodland, inside and outside protected area; maize mono-cropping and maize-bean intercropping systems in adjacent agricultural farms. Sampling of soil macro-fauna was carried out in November, 2009 (short rain), April 2010 (wet rainy season) and September 2010 (dry season). Hand sorting of soil taken from 25 × 25 × 30 cm monoliths was used to extract all soil macro fauna greater than 2 mm body length. A total of 3,658 individuals comprising of 128 species mainly belonging to Phylum Arthropoda distributed across 3 classes and 13 orders, and Phylum Annelida with one order were collected across the four different land use systems. Termites and ants, and to a lesser extent coleopteran and earthworms were the most abundant groups. Significant effects of land use on macro-fauna abundance and species richness in all cases (p<0.001) were observed. There were significant interaction between Season*Region*Land use (p<0.01), Region*Land use (p<0.05) and Region*Protection*Land use (p<0.02). Grassland and woodland had the highest density (1351.61 vs. 2852.47 individual m-2) of total macro-fauna, whilst the lowest density occurred in agricultural land (205.48 individual m-2). Agriculture altered macro-fauna communities by declining individuals from Order Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and isoptera by > 50% and eliminating some Orders/Species. Human related disturbances outside protected area network declined macro-fauna density in grassland and woodland in dry region (65.07 vs. 39.74%) but increased the density by 107 vs. 340% in wet region. The study highlights the important effect of agriculture on macro-fauna communities and the need for conservation alternatives in unprotected areas. This study supports conservation of biodiversity beyond protected area network."
140,Avian Habitat Preference in Tropical Forest Restoration in Southern Costa Rica,Scientific article,Biotropica,"An important question for tropical forest restoration is whether degraded lands can be actively managed to attract birds. We censused birds and measured vegetation structure at 27 stations in young (6–9‐yr old) actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. During 481 10‐min point counts, we detected a high diversity—186 species— of birds using the restoration area. Surprisingly, species richness and detection frequency did not differ among habitats, and proportional similarity of bird assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration treatments. Bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic grass cover and understory stem density—vegetation structures that were not strongly impacted by active restoration. The similarity of bird assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds, low structural contrast between treatments, or the effect of nucleation from actively restored plots into passively restored areas. Rapid recovery of vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed dispersal. Previous restoration studies in highly binary environments (i.e., open pasture vs. tree plantation) have found strong differences in bird abundance and richness. Our data contradict this trend, and suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider: (1) when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of implementation; and (2) which avian guilds should be used to measure restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure."
141,How dung beetles respond to a human-modified variegated landscape in Mexican cloud forest: a study of biodiversity integrating ecological and biogeographical perspectives,Scientific article,Diversity and Distributions,"Aim To analyse how the dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) respond to a modified,
variegated landscape, taking into account the biogeographical peculiarities of the
Mexican Transition Zone.
Location This study covers cloud forest (CF) of the Sierra Norte de Puebla
mountain range and part of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range (Mexico).
Methods We applied proportional sampling based on the landscape variegation
model with Scarabaeinae as the indicator group, and using two approaches:
structural units (vegetation type) and spatial units (windows). We used two
measures  richness and Shannon diversity  and applied multiplicative diversity
partitioning to obtain independent alpha and beta diversities for the landscape,
windows and vegetation types. We grouped species by biogeographical
distribution pattern for the biogeographical analysis and by whether they were
originally from CF.
Results The transformation of CF into secondary forest, pastures and other types
of vegetation increases the Scarabaeinae diversity of the landscape, in vegetation
types and windows. This increase is the result of species arriving from the tropical
lowlands. However, the original dung beetle community of the CF dominates at
different scales in the number of species, abundance and biomass. With increasing
habitat modification, beta diversity increases in the windows, and species with the
Tropical Palaeoamerican distribution pattern increase in abundance in vegetation
types and windows.
Main conclusions The variegated character of the landscape explains well the
distribution and diversity of this dung beetle community. The peculiar
characteristics of the Mexican Transition Zone have an effect owing to the
overlap of fauna with different biogeographical origins. The conversion of
fragmented landscapes to variegated landscapes could be a conservation goal in
human-modified mountain landscapes. Sampling proportional to the area of
different types of vegetation and the use of windows offer an alternative
experimental design in variegated landscapes."
142,"The influence of agricultural system, stand structural complexity and landscape context on foraging birds in oil palm landscapes",Scientific article,Ibis,"Functional diversity, an important element of avian biodiversity, can be examined by
quantifying foraging guild composition. Understanding the ecological processes that
underpin functional diversity of birds in oil palm Elaeis guineensis landscapes is important
because different foraging guilds are likely to be influenced in different ways by land use
practices. We surveyed birds at 55 sites within oil palm landscapes and at 20 sites within
logged peat swamp forest, recording 208 species belonging to 19 foraging guilds. Oil
palm landscapes supported a lower abundance of insectivorous, granivorous and omnivorous
birds than did logged peat swamp forest despite the latter being severely degraded
due to intensive timber extraction. However, abundances of other groups of foraging
birds, such as raptors and wetland taxa, were higher in oil palm landscapes than logged
peat swamp forest. Frugivorous species were more abundant in smallholdings than plantation
estates, probably because of the presence of native trees. Foraging guild diversity
was explained by stand-level attributes such as stand age, vegetation cover, epiphyte persistence
and canopy cover. However, each foraging guild exhibited unique responses to
different oil palm management regimes and stand-level attributes. Only arboreal omnivores
and terrestrial frugivores were affected by the proximity of nearby natural forest.
This diversity of responses implies that the occurrence of particular avian foraging guilds
may not be a suitable ecological indicator of best-practice palm oil production. Our
study also suggests that multiple conservation measures will be needed in oil palm landscapes
irrespective of management regimes, including: (1) the maintenance of ground
layer vegetation cover; (2) the pruning of oil palm canopy to permit light penetration to
the ground layer; (3) re-vegetation of parts of oil palm landscapes with native trees;
and (4) retention of natural and/or secondary forest patches within the boundaries of
plantations."
143,Biodiversity and land-use change: understanding the complex responses of an endemic-rich bird assemblage,Scientific article,Diversity and Distributions,"Aim Anthropogenic land-use change is a major driver of the current extinction
crisis, but the processes through which it acts on biodiversity are complex and
still poorly understood. Here, we use several biodiversity metrics to make a
comprehensive assessment of the response of an endemic-rich bird assemblage
to land-use change.
Location Sao Tome´ Island (Sao Tome and Prncipe, Africa).
Methods We sampled bird assemblages in 220 point counts, stratified across
three regions and four land-use types. Species richness was examined using
accumulation curves and generalized linear mixed-effect models. Compositional
and structural changes were analysed with ordination techniques. We used
correlations and model selection to identify species traits and environmental
variables associated with such changes.
Results At the point level, there was a slight decrease of species richness in
more intensive land uses. However, higher dissimilarities within these land uses
led them to have higher overall species richness. Endemics dominated forest
environments and, although most preferred less-disturbed land uses, many persisted
across all land uses. Non-endemics were virtually absent from forests, but
became very abundant in the more intensive land uses. Canopy cover was the
best predictor of the shift between endemic and non-endemic species, and
allowed identifying regional differences in the local responses of bird assemblages
to land-use change.
Main conclusions To better understand biodiversity, it is crucial to use several
metrics simultaneously. In Sao Tome´, simply using species richness, the single
most used biodiversity metric, could have been misleading as it concealed
major shifts in the bird assemblage structure towards an endemism impoverished
avifauna. Despite scarce data on land-use cover, we demonstrate how
landscape context can be vital to understand biodiversity patterns and that
highly forested surroundings might overestimate the strict value of more intensive
land uses. Our results raise concerns about the long-term persistence of
endemic species restricted to islands where forested land uses are being lost."
144,Effects of Oil-Palm Plantations on Diversity of Tropical Anurans,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"Agriculturally altered vegetation, especially oil-palm plantations, is rapidly increasing in Southeast
Asia. Low species diversity is associated with this commodity, but data on anuran diversity in oilpalm
plantations are lacking. We investigated how anuran biological diversity differs between forest and
oil-palm plantation, and whether observed differences in biological diversity of these areas is linked to
specific environmental factors. We hypothesized that biological diversity is lower in plantations and that
plantations support a larger proportion of disturbance-tolerant species than forest. We compared species
richness, abundance, and community composition between plantation and forest areas and between site
types within plantation and forest (forest stream vs. plantation stream, forest riparian vs. plantation riparian,
forest terrestrial vs. plantation terrestrial). Not all measures of biological diversity differed between
oil-palm plantations and secondary forest sites. Anuran community composition, however, differed greatly
between forest and plantation, and communities of anurans in plantations contained species that prosper
in disturbed areas. Although plantations supported large numbers of breeding anurans, we concluded the
community consisted of common species that were of little conservation concern (commonly found species
include Fejervarya limnocharis, Microhyla heymonsi, and Hylarana erythrea). We believe that with a number
of management interventions, oil-palm plantations can provide habitat for species that dwell in secondary
forests."
145,Soil macrofauna as indicators of soil quality and land use impacts in smallholder agroecosystems of western Nicaragua,Scientific article,Ecological Indicators,"The tropical dry forest region along the western slope of Central America represents a biodiverse and
fragile area that is under increasing pressure from agricultural production, thus threatening the provision
of ecosystem services, the integrity of these landscapes, and the rural communities who depend on
them. To address this issue, we evaluated the influence of common agricultural management practices
(cropping and livestock systems) vs. the Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) on
diverse parameters of soil quality and function. We then used this information to identify soil invertebrate
bioindicators that represent key aspects of soil quality (chemical fertility, physical properties,
aggregate morphology, and biological functioning). In February of 2011 soil sampling was conducted on
six hillside farms near the town of Somotillo in western Nicaragua to assess soil properties and the abundance
and diversity of soil macrofauna within four management systems: (1) QSMAS, based on maize
production, (2) traditional maize cropping system with few trees (TC), (3) silvopastoral system with low
tree density (SP), and (4) secondary forest (SF), used as a reference. The conversion of forest to agriculture
demonstrated the greatest impact of management in this study. For example, SF presented significantly
higher diversity of soil invertebrate taxonomic groups than either TC or SP (P < 0.03), and demonstrated
the lowest level of soil compaction, significantly less than SP (P < 0.05). Additionally, SF demonstrated
the highest value of soil quality according to a synthetic indicator that integrates chemical, physical and
biological aspects of soil quality. Although overall soil quality under QSMAS was lower than SF, this system
demonstrated the highest abundance (number of individuals) of soil macrofauna, and appeared to
at least partially mitigate the negative consequences of forest conversion on soil functioning. Using the
Indicator Value Index, which ranks species according to their specificity and fidelity across sites, along
with farmer consultation we found seven indicator taxa of soil quality that could greatly facilitate future
evaluation of land management impacts by farmers and technicians in the region. We suggest that the
methodology applied is robust and adaptable to diverse agroecological contexts and would allow for
more rapid responses to evolving land use issues as they arise."
146,Avian responses to fragmentation of the Maulino Forest in central Chile,Scientific article,Oryx,"Depending on the mosaic of habitats that is created, forest fragmentation can reduce the abundance and diversity of forest birds. Temperate deciduous forests in South America are rapidly being replaced by pine plantations, causing changes in habitats for both breeding and migrant birds. We examined differences in avian species richness and abundance in three areas: a reserve with continuous tracts of native forest, forest fragments and pine plantations. Four species were negatively affected by fragmentation, with their abundance declining from continuous forest to pine plantations. Fourteen species were not affected by fragmentation and eight had significantly increased abundance in pine plantations compared to continuous forest. Overall abundance in pooled and ground/understorey birds was higher in forest fragments and pine plantations compared to continuous forest. The abundance of granivorous species was higher in the pine plantations than in the forest reserve, but the abundance of insectivorous species was higher in the forest reserve and in forest fragments than in pine plantations. Thus, forest fragmentation affects birds differentially according to their feeding ecology."
147,"Presence and abundance of birds in an Atlantic forest reserve and adjacent plantation of shade-grown yerba mate, in Paraguay",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"In the Atlantic forest region, there is a need to develop economic activities that can be carried out in buffer zones around parks, with minimal impact on forest bird species. One such possibility is the farming of yerba mate, Ilex paraguariensis, under native trees. We compared bird species presence and abundance between a forest reserve and an adjacent plantation of shadegrown
yerba mate, to determine which species might use such plantations. Of the 145 species that were regularly recorded in the forest, 66%, including five globally threatened species, were also regularly recorded in the plantation. Most canopy species and tree trunk insectivores showed similar abundance in both habitats, but forest floor and understory species were absent from the plantation. Within the plantation, higher tree density did not lead to a greater abundance of forest birds. Yerba mate grown under native trees could be used to rehabilitate cleared land and allow recolonization by some Atlantic forest bird species."
148,Influence of habitat management on the abundance and diet of wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus) populations in Mediterranean ecosystems,Unknown,ICN and CIBIO Report,"During the last decades wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations have been progressively declining in the Iberian Peninsula as a result of several factors, namely habitat deterioration. Hence, habitat management has become one of the most commonly used management techniques to restore wild rabbit populations. To test the efficacy of some of these measures (creation of pastures, opening firebreaks) in rabbit populations, two managed (M1 and M2) and two control areas (C1 and C2) were selected in the Portuguese Southwest (SW) Coast. In each study area, the influence of habitat management was tested assessing temporal changes in rabbit abundance obtained from pellet counts and in rabbits diet through microhistological analysis of fecal pellets. Rabbit densities were higher in managed than in control areas (mean annual values: M11.08 pellets/m2; M21.60 pellets/m2; C10.69 pellets/m2; C20.40 pellets/m2). In general, Gramineae was the most consumed plant group throughout the year and in all study areas. In control areas, consumption of alternative species with low nutritive value (e.g., Cistus ladanifer) was observed, especially in summer. Our data suggest a positive influence of habitat management on rabbit populations since in managed areas individuals presented an overall higher abundance and a more nutritive diet. In addition, there was no evidence that sown species were consumed in detriment to naturally occurring grasses, suggesting that in Mediterranean semi-arid regions clearing vegetation inside the scrubland might be sufficient to improve habitat conditions for rabbits."
149,"Termite (Insecta, Isoptera) richness in primary and secondary Atlantic Forest in southeastern Bahia",Scientific article,"Iheringia, Série Zoologia","The Atlantic Forest is considered one of the most diverse biome in the World, harboring a large number of endemic species. However, it is one of the most degraded ecosystems in Brazil; less than 8% of its original vegetation has been preserved. In southeastern part of the state of Bahia, irresponsible deforestation and misuse of land have being degrading the forest. In this area, the termite fauna is poorly known and there was no available survey. This paper aimed: 1) to carry out a first survey on the Isoptera from this region of the Atlantic Forest; 2) to compare the termite richness between primary and secondary forests using two kind of collecting protocols; 3) to compare the results from the two different collecting protocols; 4) to classify the species into trophic groups. The study areas are Mata da Esperança (primary forest) and Reserva Zoobotânica da CEPLAC (secondary forest), both in the county of Ilhéus, BA. Quantitative and qualitative surveys followed standard protocols and the samples were obtained directly, without baits. Thirty-eight species within twenty-seven genera were identified and the family Termitidae was the most frequent. The termite fauna of the primary forest was the richest. Nineteen and thirty-three species were registered with the quantitative and qualitative protocol, respectively. The majority of the species was classified as xilophagous."
150,Grazing promotes dung beetle diversity in the xeric landscape of a Mexican Biosphere Reserve,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"We analyze the impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity at the Barranca de Metztitlán Biosphere Reserve, a xeric ecosystem in central Mexico with a long history of use by humans. We compared the community structure, as well as the alpha and beta diversity between two cover conditions (open and closed vegetation) that represent the impact of grazing within a habitat, and between habitat types (submountainous and crassicaule scrublands). From 576 samples we collected 75,605 dung beetles belonging to 20 taxa. While mean species richness and diversity were different between habitat types, cumulative species richness was not. The effects of grazing on vegetation structure influenced the cumulative species richness and diversity of dung beetles in the submountainous scrubland, where grazing has created land mosaics of a grassland matrix with scrubland patches. This was not the case in the crassicaule scrubland where the impact of grazing is not as evident. Beta diversity significantly responds to the effects of grazing on habitat conditions. We discuss the ecological factors that may promote these responses by landscape diversity components. We also identify the species that could act as useful indicators to monitor the effect of land management on biodiversity. Our results indicate cattle farming maintains a diversified land mosaic, and these areas support more diverse dung beetle ensembles than homogeneous areas of closed, shrubby vegetation cover. Thus, controlled grazing activity could certainly favour the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and improve ecosystem functioning by maintaining dung decomposition rates."
151,Human Disturbance affects a Deciduous Forest Bird Community in the Andean Foothills of Central Bolivia,Scientific article,Bird Conservation International,"Neotropical deciduous forests are threatened by anthropogenic activities and only a small area is
protected against exploitation. In contrast to other Neotropical forest types, not much is known
about the effect of habitat disturbance on deciduous forest bird communities. In the present study,
we examine the effects of human disturbance on a deciduous forest bird community in the Andean
foothills of Bolivia. Bird community composition was determined by means of point count surveys
in three forest types, i.e. undisturbed deciduous and semi-deciduous forest, and disturbed forest
habitat. Habitat disturbance was estimated indirectly by measuring vegetation structure variables
in these forests. The effect of habitat disturbance was subsequently examined at bird community
level (species richness, species abundance and diversity indices) and functional group level (habitat
preference categories and foraging guild). Differences in community composition and reduced
species abundance could clearly be related to habitat disturbance. However, results also indicated
that sensitivity to disturbance varied among functional groups. Humid forest specialists showed the
strongest response to habitat disturbance, predominantly bark-gleaning insectivores, canopy
insectivores, understorey insectivores and ground-dwelling species, whereas dry forest specialists
were not affected by disturbance. The present study suggests that anthropogenic disturbance
negatively influenced the forest bird community in the investigated deciduous forest in Bolivia.
This may indicate that conservation of both deciduous and semi-deciduous forest remnants is
relevant for a diverse montane bird community in South America. Because various bird species
typical of deciduous forests may also be able to survive in partly disturbed forests, conservation
strategies should not only be focussed on the protection of pristine remnants but should also include
secondary forest edge zones."
152,"Effect of the forest succession on the anurans (Amphibia: Anura) of the Reserve Catuaba and its periphery, Acre, southwestern Amazonia",Scientific article,Revista Brasileira de Zoologia,"The objective of this work it was verify the abundance, richness, and the anuran composition in plots of vegetation of different succession stages in a forest and the matrix that surrounds it, of Acre (10º04S, 67º37W). The sampling was carried out between August 2005 and April 2006 in twelve plots located in three different sites in the forest. In each site four kinds of environments were chosen: primary forest (wood), secondary forest (capoeira), periphery (matrix) and secondary forest (succession). A total of twenty-seven species distributed in seven families was found. Greater abundance was registered in the plots of matrix two and capoeira three and the least in succession one. The richness was greater in matrix two, with the greater number of exclusive species. The abundance of anurans correlated significantly, with the average circumference at the breast height of the trees of the plots. The richness however correlated only marginally, with this  structural feature. The larger richness in plots of capoeira and matrix can be explained partially by the existence of temporary ponds and more structural heterogeneity is able constitute intermediary stages in a gradient of perturbation and this can increase the biodiversity. Thus environments with intermediary levels of disturbance are important for the conservation of the diversity of anuran amphibians."
153,Lizard diversity in coffee crops and primary forest in the Soconusco Chiapaneco,Scientific article,Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad,"Fragmentation and the transformation of natural habitat are the primary factors that promote the loss of biodiversity. However, there are some kinds of land management that may be less aggressive with the environment. Some of these are agrosystems such as coffee crops, which have been considered biodiversity refuges. In this work, we examine lizard diversity in these agrosystems, finding a higher diversity in the low altitude coffee crops than in the primary vegetation such as rain forest, and montane cloud forest. Lizard diversity is explained by the high microhabitat richness in the coffee crops, a pattern also found in birds. This paper supports the idea that the coffee crops work like a refuge for biodiversity and could be useful for conservation biology. Also we report observations of beta diversity and spatial (microhabitat) niche breath and niche overlap."
154,Avian Assemblages in Altered and Natural Grasslands in the Northern Campos of Uruguay,Scientific article,The Condor,"Alteration of habitat has been highlighted as the most important factor causing declines in populations
of grassland birds. In this study we characterized bird assemblages in cultivated and natural grasslands under
four different agricultural schemes in Uruguay. We surveyed birds along transects to determine species richness,
composition, and population density along this agricultural gradient. Although species richness was lower in the
most natural grassland type (24 species), community composition and abundance patterns highlighted the importance
of natural grasslands for the conservation of habitat specialists. An analysis of similarity showed that bird
communities in the four grassland types were distinct (ANOSIM global R 􀀝 0.68). Several species using grassland
facultatively were characteristic of cultivated habitats, whereas the opposite was true for grassland obligates and
natural grasslands. An indicator-species analysis further supported the association of grassland-facultative
and grassland-obligate birds with cultivated and natural grassland, respectively. Population-density patterns varied
by species; some were more abundant in cultivated habitats, others in natural grasslands, but threatened species
attained relatively high densities in natural grasslands only. Some threatened species, such as the Ochre-breasted
Pipit (Anthus nattereri) and Pampas Meadowlark (Sturnella defilippii), were largely restricted to natural grasslands,
so their long-term survival will depend on the conservation of suitable patches of these habitat types."
155,Palm (Arecaceae) diversity and distribution in three humid forest fragments in Costa Rica,Scientific article,Revista de Biología Tropical,"To determine the existing differences between species composition of palms in forest fragments with different
disturbance regimes, three forest fragments at El Zota, Cariari de Guápiles, Costa Rica, were chosen according
to their disturbance level: 1) Disturbed primary forest (B1-i), 2) Secondary forest (B2) and 3) Primary forest
(B1). A field survey was carried out in nested plots, where palms were identified and counted according to three
size categories: i) 0.15 m to 1.35 m ii) 1.35 m to 5 m and iii) more than 5 m in height. The diversity found in
B1 and B1-i is very similar, meanwhile the B2 has the lowest diversity. Palm abundance and distribution were
influenced by the level of disturbance of the fragment. The B1-i presents the higher diversity in the first size
categories, while B1 has the highest abundance of palms over 5 m tall."
156,Effects of pasture implantation on the termite (Isoptera) fauna in the Central Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado),Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"The advance of agricultural frontier may cause the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) to disappear before 2030. This work focuses on measuring the impact of pasture implantation on a cerrados termite fauna. Termites were sampled in a cerrado sensu stricto and a pasture, originally cerrado. All species were classified as their feeder group, accumulation curves were made and Shannon-Wiener indexes and b diversity were calculated for both areas. Cerrado was richer than pasture and species composition differed considerably, leading b diversity to a high value. The humivorous was the most representative species, followed by grass/litter feeders, xylophagous and, less representative, the intermediates. There were more xylophagous and intermediates species on cerrado than in pasture; the grass/litter feeders were more abundant in pasture, but didnt differed in number or species; and humivorous didnt differed neither in richness nor in abundance. This work shows that the simplification of the habitat is indeed causing the extinction of populations that depend on some specifics resource."
157,Ants as biological indicators of Wayana Amerindian land use in French Guiana,Scientific article,Comptes rendus biologies,"We examined the ecological impact of traditional land use byWayana Amerindians in French Guiana using ants as bio-indicators.
Ants were sampled through a rapid assessment method and the core results analyzed using Kohonens self-organizing maps (SOM). Our sample sites included: (1) aWayana village; (2) a cassava plantation; (3) an abandoned cassava plantation; (4) a forest fragment near the village; (5) a riparian forest; and (6) a primary terra firma forest. The ant diversity decreases according to the degree to which the habitat is disturbed. The SOM allowed us to compare the ecological succession between the six habitats. The protocol used is robust since the same conclusions were drawn using partial data."
158,The effect of land use on snail species richness and diversity in the tropical rainforest of south-western Nigeria,Scientific article,African Scientist,"The effect of land use on the land snail species richness, composition and diversity in some localities in the tropical rainforest of Edo State (South Western Nigeria) is studied using a combination of direct search (for 1hour) and litter-sieving techniques. The forest types in gradient of intensity and frequency of disturbance includes a primary forest, an old growth secondary forest, a young growth secondary forest, a cocoa plantation and an oil palm plantation. A total of 4665 specimens comprising 60 species/morphospecies belonging to eleven molluscan families were collected from 73 sample plots in all locations. Each plot (400m2) yielded between 4 and 195 specimens (mean 63.88 ± 45.74) and 4 and 31 species (mean 12.55, ± 5.40). Local species richness or alpha diversity (S) ranged from 22 to 52 depending on the forest type. Species richness was highest in the primary forest, followed by old growth secondary forest, young secondary forest, cocoa plantation and least in oil palm plantation. Comparison of species accumulation curves using nonparametric estimators based on jackknife and bootstrap techniques showed agricultural plantation strongly impact land molluscs species richness (P<0.05) while secondary forests have reduced fauna lacking most of the rare species although difference is not significant (P>0.05). The implication of the results to conservation is discussed."
159,"Diversity and abundance of orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Euglossini) in a tropical rainforest succession",Scientific article,Neotropical Entomology,"Euglossine bee males are easily lured to chemical baits imitating natural fragrances gathered by bees, providing a widely applied measure for estimating the diversity and abundance of euglossines. In here, I report the composition of euglossine bees in three lowland rainforest habitats of Peru, a primary old forest, a reforested and managed forest, and a very disturbed forest. A total
of 2,072 males of euglossine were collected, belonging to 33 species and four genera. Although a comparable diversity relative to other studies from the Amazonian region was found, no signifi cant differences among the sampled areas were detected. Perhaps, the short time and low intensity surveys here used (< 3 months) were not good enough indicators of forest disturbance without additional data. Compared to other major studies on the euglossine bee fauna, Loreto is most similar to the species
assemblage reported from lowland rainforest in Brazil (Manaus), central Peru (Panguana) and southern Peru (Tambopata)."
160,Small off-shore islands can serve as important refuges for endemic beetle conservation,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"Although large islands generally support a richer insect fauna than small islands, many large islands, which are more often inhabited, have lost numerous species because of human activities and introduced organisms. To clarify the consequences of endemic insect conservation on small islands near inhabited islands, we compared the species richness, abundance, and composition of two beetle groups (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae and Mordellidae) captured using Malaise traps among three islands (Chichijima, 24.0 km2; Anijima, 7.85 km2; Nishijima, 0.49 km2) in the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Island group in the northwestern Pacific during JuneJuly 2006 and 2007. Chichijima, the largest island, is inhabited, while Anijima and Nishijima are not. The numbers of cerambycid and mordellid species previously recorded were positively correlated with island area. However, the total numbers of cerambycid and mordellid species we captured in Malaise traps were not correlated with island area because we were unable to collect many species previously documented on Chichijima. The numbers of cerambycid and mordellid species per trap did not differ significantly among islands and years, although the deviance was well explained by the island variable. We captured greater numbers of cerambycid and mordellid individuals on Chichijima than on Anijima and Nishijima, and the numbers of cerambycid and mordellid individuals per trap significantly differed among islands and between years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the species composition of cerambycids and mordellids differed among the three islands. Whereas endangered species were rarely captured on Chichijima, alien or non-endemic species were frequently collected. Cerambycid and mordellid beetles on Chichijima may have been deleteriously affected by recent forest disturbance and introduced organisms. Therefore, conserving insect fauna on uninhabited island refugia is important for preserving the insect diversity of the Ogasawara Islands."
161,"Fauna assemblages in regrowth vegetation in tropical open forests of the Northern Territory, Australia",Scientific article,Wildlife research,"CONTEXT: World-wide, primary forest is in decline. This places increasing importance on understanding the use by
biodiversity of regrowth (secondary) forest, and on the management of such regrowth.
AIMS: This study aimed to compare the terrestrial vertebrate assemblages in tropical eucalypt forests, regrowth in these
forests (following clearing for pastoral intensification) and cleared land without regrowth, to provide evidence for
developing management guidelines for regrowth vegetation in a region (the Daly catchment of the Northern Territory)
subject to increasing demands for land-use intensification.
METHODS: The terrestrial vertebrate fauna was surveyed consistently at 43 quadrats sampling forest, 38 sampling regrowth
and 19 sampling cleared land (formerly forest), and the faunal composition was compared with ordination and analysis of
variance. Further analysis used generalised linear modelling to include consideration of the relative importance of
disturbance (condition) of quadrats.
KEY RESULTS: Faunal assemblages in regrowth vegetation were found to be intermediate between cleared land and
intact forest, and converged towards the faunal assemblage typical of intact forest with increase in the canopy height of the
regrowth. However, even the tallest regrowth quadrats that were sampled supported relatively few hollow-associated
species. The management of fire, weeds and grazing pressure substantially affected the faunal assemblages of the set of
regrowth and intact forest quadrats, in many cases being a more important determinant of faunal attributes than was whether
or not the quadrat had been cleared.
CONCLUSIONS: In this region, regrowth vegetation has value as habitat for fauna, with this value increasing as the regrowth
structure increases. The convergence of the faunal composition of regrowth vegetation to that of intact forest may be
substantially affected by post-clearing management factors (including fire regime and level of grazing pressure and weed
infestation).
IMPLICATIONS: Regrowth vegetation should be afforded appropriate regulatory protection, with the level of protection
increasing as the regrowth increases in stature."
162,"Riqueza e abundância de aves em três estágios sucessionais da floresta ombrófila densa submontana, Antonina, Paraná",PhD thesis,NA,"In this study we evaluated the effects of anthropogenic forest disturbances on Atlantic Forest bird communities in the Reserva Natural Rio Cachoeira, in the Municipality of Antonina, Paraná, Brazil. Quantitative surveys were carried out using the point-count method in three distinct forest types located in continuous forest with a mosaic of successional stages. One of these types can be considered primary forest while another secondary forest in an intermediate stage of regeneration and still a third in an early stage of regeneration. A total of 141 bird species were recorded in the three types, where 10 species were exclusive to the primary forest and 36 to the secondary forests. Despite the structural differences in the vegetation of the three areas, patterns of bird richness and abundance were very similar in the three areas sampled. We analyzed attributes such as size, occupancy in the upper and lower canopies, and forest and forest edge behaviors and eating habits. We did not find significant differences between the bird species in these attributes for the three forest types. The species occupancy potential was also analyzed in relation to forests in the secondary stage of regeneration. We found that 85% of species have potential to occupy secondary forests. The results indicate that the pattern found is associated with the structure of the continuous forest and the heterogeneity of environments making up the mosaic. The presence of recovering secondary forests within primary forests in mosaic form helps maintain the richness and abundance of Atlantic forest birds."
163,"Floristic and structural comparisons among palm communities in primary and secondary forest fragments of the Raimundo Irineu Serra Environmental Protection Area - Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil",Scientific article,Acta Amazonica,"This study compares the composition and structure of palm communities in fragments of secondary and primary forest
within the Raimundo Irineu Serra Environmental Protection Area (APARIS), located at the urban perimeter of Rio Branco,
Acre. To evaluate the palm communities, we selected secondary forest areas belonging to three distinct successional stages:
7.5 years; 27.5 years, 37.5 years, and a primary forest fragment. In each forest type we installed five 20 x 20 m plots, where
we analyzed floristic composition, vegetation structure, and population demography of all palm species (Arecaceae). In all,
we identified 1034 palm individuals, including 12 genera, 19 species. Primary forest exhibited the greatest palm diversity.
Structural analysis of each area revealed a scarcity of seedlings (. 50 cm tall) and reproductive adults. Fragmentation altered
the composition and decreased the richness and diversity of palms within the APARIS, while at the same time, favoring the
dominance of certain species, such as A. phalerata."
164,Functional response traits in relation to land use change in the Montado,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","The socio-economic changes of the last decades have resulted in changes in traditional land uses with
consequent abandonment of large farmland areas in the Mediterranean region. We assessed the
response of species richness and composition, and species functional traits to decreasing land use
intensity in a Montado system, an agro-pastoral system characteristic of the Alentejo, Southern Portugal.
Additionally, we investigated whether plant functional types can be established based on the response to
decreasing land use intensity in these systems. Consistent with previous studies, species richness
decreased sharply after land abandonment, and this was associated with a strong turnover in species
composition from grazed to abandoned sites as the vegetation changed from herbaceous to shrub
dominated communities. Pronounced differences in functional traits were found for different
successional stages. Therophyte life form, short plant height, high specific leaf area (SLA), low leaf
dry matter content (LDMC) and small seeds with dispersal structures were dominant in grazed plots.
Within abandoned plots, chamaephytes dominated in plots abandoned for 1015 years and decreased in
favour of nanophanerophytes in plots abandoned for 2030 years. Plant height, LDMC and seed mass
increased with abandonment time while SLA decreased. Functional response groups sufficient to
describe vegetation change were identified combining life form and SLA. Therophytes with mediumSLA
were the dominant functional group in grazed areas, while nanophanerophytes with mediumor low SLA
were associated with later phases of abandonment. At intermediate stages of succession the dominant
group was chamaephytes with mediumSLA but functional diversity was highest as all the groups, except
hemicryptophytes with mediumSLA, were represented. These changes in functional composition can be
translated into effects on key ecosystem properties. The increase in LDMC indicates an increase in
flammability while trends in both LDMC and SLA suggest decreased decomposition, and thereby carbon
and nutrient cycling. These will need to be considered in combination with consequences for other
ecosystem properties for future management."
165,Long-term effects of fragmentation and fragment properties on bird species richness in Hawaiian forests,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Forest fragmentation is a common disturbance affecting biological diversity, yet the impacts of fragmentation on many forest processes remain poorly understood. Forest restoration is likely to be more successful when it proceeds with an understanding of how native and exotic vertebrates utilize forest patches of different size. We used a system of forest fragments isolated by volcanic activity 153 years ago in Hawaii to examine how long-term fragmentation, as well as fragment size and structural features affect the richness of native and exotic bird species. The total number of bird species increased rapidly with forest fragment size, with most of the native species pool found in patches <3 ha. Smaller fragments were dominated by native bird species with several exotic bird species found only in the largest fragments, suggesting that exotic bird species in this landscape show greater area-sensitivity than native species. We used airborne scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to assess whether fragment area was correlated with estimates of fragment vegetation volume as well as measures of tree height. Fragment area was highly correlated with vegetation volume, maximum tree height, and canopy height heterogeneity, and these variables were strong predictors of bird richness, demonstrating that remote sensing can provide key insights into the relationship between fragment structural attributes and biodiversity indicators. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of conserving small remnant mid-elevation forest patches for native birds in Hawaii. This work also provides insight into how newly created forest patches might be used by native and exotic bird species in Hawaii."
166,Recovery of plant species composition and ecosystem function after cessation of grazing in a Mediterranean grassland,Scientific article,Plant Soil,"Short- and long-term changes in species composition, plant biomass production, and litter decomposition after cessation of grazing were examined in a Mediterranean grassland with high dominance of annual species and strong seasonality in biomass production. Short-term changes were assessed during three consecutive years in plots previously exposed to different grazing pressures and compared to plots in long-term (3040 years) exclosures. Short-term cessation of grazing led in the short-term to an increase in relative biomass of annual crucifers and tall annual and perennial grasses, while biomass of annual legumes, annual thistles and short annual grasses decreased. Consequently, similarity increased between vegetation recently excluded from grazing and vegetation in long-term protected plots. Our research showed that in systems with high dominance of grasses and annual species, the rapid changes in plant species composition that occur after grazing cessation were associated with a fast recovery of the potential for biomass production to levels found in long-term protected plots, while litter decompositionrate did not change even after long-term cessation of grazing. Moreover, previous history of grazing did not affect plant litter decomposition, despite higher litter quality in grazed treatments. This study provides new insights about the processes involved in the diverse responses of ecosystem functions resulting from shifts in species composition associated with grazing cessation and land use change in Mediterranean grasslands."
167,How might intensification of farming influence dung beetle diversity (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in Maputo Special Reserve (Mozambique)?,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"There are concerns over the increasing encroachment of humans, domestic livestock, and farming onto Maputo Special Reserve because of the potential for habitat modification. Therefore, differences between an undisturbed area of the reserve and a neighbouring farming area are assessed using dung beetle as indicators. In each of the two areas, pig-dung-baited pitfall traps were used to sample dung beetle assemblages in two contrasting habitats, grassland and forest. Distributional analysis of the 57 species and 36 942 individuals that were captured, showed that species richness, species turnover, relative abundance patterns, and biogeographical composition differed strongly between both habitats and areas under different land usage. However, in analyses that apportion variation, the greatest amounts were related to habitat rather than land usage. Even so, in both habitats, the total and mean number of species per trap was higher in the farmed area than in the reserve although this was a significant trend only in grassland. Furthermore, in grassland, widespread species were better represented in the farmed area than in the reserve whereas in forest, widespread species were poorly represented compared to grassland. Also in forest, Maputaland endemics were better represented in the reserve than in the farmed area. Further work is necessary to separate the different geographical, ecological, and land usage factors responsible for the patterns detected in this preliminary study. Even so, there are clearly differences between the Maputo Special Reserve and the farmed area."
168,Flying Foxes Prefer to Forage in Farmland in a Tropical Dry Forest Landscape Mosaic in Fiji,Scientific article,Biotropica,"To test flying fox adaptations to a habitat mosaic with extreme deforestation, the abundance, habitat choice and feeding behavior of the Pacific flying fox, Pteropus tonganus, were investigated across 16 islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji. The habitat mosaic is formed by 4.3 percent tropical dry forest and 3.3 percent farmland, leaving exotic grasslands and stands of Leucaena leucocephala to overrun the vast majority of land. Pteropus tonganus abundance was high (5757 bats) despite deforestation and hunting. Roosting sites were restricted to native forest fragments. Grasslands and stands of L. leucocephala were completely void of bats at all times. The mean foraging density in farmland was four times higher than in forests and foraging competition was routinely observed in farmland but was extremely rare in forests. The author suggests that during the study, extensive foraging in farmland was supporting the high P. tonganus population. Additionally, the preferential foraging in farmland was responsible for the low foraging densities within forests and dramatically less intraspecies competition for forest resources. Further research is needed on seed dispersal within forests and to test for seasonal variations in bat abundance and feeding."
169,Unexpected changes in the bird assemblage in areas under selective logging in piedmont forest in northwestern Argentina,Scientific article,The Neotropical Ornithological Society,"It is estimated that 90% of the Argentine northwest piedmont forest has been transformed and the remaining patches are subject to intensive logging. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of logging on the understory bird community of piedmont forest in northwestern Argentina comparing an area without logging (C) and an area with logging (LO). In each area we established 20 circular plots of 0.05 ha where we measured different vegetation variables and we placed 16 mist nets to capture understory birds. Basal area of trees with a diameter at breast height > 10 cm was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in LO producing changes in the vegetation structure towards a more open environment. In C we captured 27% of the individuals and 13 species and in LO we captured 73% of the individuals and 28 species of birds. The similarity between bird species of the two areas was low (S = 0.34). In C we captured only one (8%) bird species typical of secondary forests or edges; however 32% of the birds captured in LO were typical of secondary forests or edges. We found a greater percentage of birds typical of the canopy in LO than in C. This is probably because in C bird species remain in the canopy since canopy openness was significantly lower in C (P < 0.05). Forest management produces changes in the vegetation structure and might cause: 1) that bird species associated with the canopy to use the understory since there is a lack of the tree stratum continuity, and 2) the entry of bird species of secondary or edge environments."
170,Plant and bird diversity in natural forests and in native and exotic plantations in NW Portugal,Scientific article,Acta Oecologica,"Forest ecosystems have been subjected to continuous dynamics between deforestation and forestation.
Assessing the effects of these processes on biodiversity could be essential for conservation planning. We
analyzed patterns of species richness, diversity and evenness of plants and birds in patches of natural
forest of Quercus spp. and in stands of native Pinus pinaster and exotic Eucalyptus globulus in NW
Portugal. We analyzed data of forest and non-forest species separately, at the intra-patch, patch and
inter-patch scales. Forest plant richness, diversity and evenness were higher in oak forest than in pine
and eucalypt plantations. In total, 52 species of forest plants were observed in oak forest, 33 in pine
plantation and 28 in eucalypt plantation. Some forest species, such as Euphorbia dulcis, Omphalodes nitida
and Eryngium juresianum, were exclusively or mostly observed in oak forest. Forest bird richness and
diversity were higher in both oak and pine forests than in eucalypt forest; evenness did not differ among
forests. In total, 16 species of forest birds were observed in oak forest, 18 in pine forest and 11 in eucalypt
forest. Species such as Certhia brachydactyla, Sitta europaea and Dendrocopos major were common in oak
and/or pine patches but were absent from eucalypt stands. Species-area relationships of forest plants and
forest birds in oak patches had consistently a higher slope, at both the intra and inter-patch scales, than
species-area relationships of forest species in plantations and non-forest species in oak forest. These
!ndings demonstrate the importance of oak forest for the conservation of forest species diversity,
pointing the need to conserve large areas of oak forest due to the apparent vulnerability of forest species
to area loss. Additionally, diversity patterns in pine forest were intermediate between oak forest and
eucalypt forest, suggesting that forest species patterns may be affected by forest naturalness."
171,"Study of the Dung Beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) Community at Two Sites: Atlantic Forest and Clear-Cut, Pernambuco, Brazil",Scientific article,Community and Ecosystem Ecology,"The aim of this study was to compare the dung beetle (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) community structure at two sites in the Charles Darwin Ecological Refuge in Igarassu, Pernambuco, Brazil. Dung beetles were collected in 2006 using monthly samples from 48 pitfall traps baited with human dung and bovine carrion. The dung beetle communities from the study sites were compared in terms of abundance, species richness, and diversity (Shannon index). Seasonality was analyzed by Spearman correlation between rainfall data and community parameters. In total, 2,560 individuals belonging to 40 species, 16 genera, and 6 tribes were collected. Species richness was higher for the clear-cut area compared with the forest habitat. Estimators of species richness suggested a total richness of 42Ð47 species in the entire study area. A positive correlation was observed between monthly rainfall and total abundance of individuals for the clear-cut area but not for the forest habitat. This study contributes to a better understanding of Scarabaeinae ecology in the Atlantic rainforest of northeastern Brazil."
172,"Efecto del grado de disturbio sobre el ensamble de aves en la reserva provincial Parque Luro, La Pampa, Argentina",Scientific article,Asociación Argentina de Ecología de Paisajes,"Habitat disturbance may modify bird assemblage and change their distributions. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of disturbance type on the specific richness and relative abundance of birds in the Reserva Provincial Parque Luro, La Pampa Province. In this reserve there are three sites of calden forest with different degree of disturbance, (tourism, burn forest, and less disturbed forest). The birds were sampled by point counts; with a total of eight points in each site. All point counts were carried out during the 2008 reproductive season (October to December). We registered a total of 36 bird species, 25 of them were resident and 11 migratory. The difference of relative abundance was marginally not signifi-cant between sites (F: 2.98; p<0.08), bird abundance was highest in the burnt area due to the presence of Zenaida auricu-lata, that uses this area for nesting. The specific richness was smaller in this area, while it did not show differences between the tourism and the less disturbed sites (F: 4.69; p<0.05). However, most of the species present in the tourism area were generalists or edge species. Elaenia parvirostris, considered an interior species of the caldén forest, was present in the less disturbed area and absent in the other two sites. Our result shows diversity decreases in burnt areas, while tourism areas are occupied by generalist or edge species."
173,"Species of Scarabaeinae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) of forest ecosystems with different alteration degress in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul",Unpublished article,"MSc Thesis, Santa Maria Federal University","This study aims to contribute to the scarce data on the Scarabaeinae fauna of the Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Twenty-four samplings were made with pitfall traps baited with human excrement, rotting meat and fermented banana in three forest fragments with different degrees of disturbance in Santa Maria, RS, between May 2009 and April 2010, in order to investigate the diversity of Scarabaeinae in these habitats and learn about the feeding preference in relation to the baits used and the temporal distribution of species. A total of 19,699 individuals of 33 species were collected. The greatest richness of Scarabaeinae was found in a forest fragment with larger size and highest conservation level, whereas the greatest abundance occurred in a forest fragment with intermediate level of perturbation. The spring, then summer, was the greatest period of richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae. The richness and abundance were positively correlated with temperature during the study period. Human excrement was the most attractive bait in number of species and individuals. Aiming to help the future identification of studied species is presented a local identification guide containing an illustrated dichotomous key, ecological information and illustrations of species of Scarabaeinae cited to Santa Maria. Through an extensive literature review was possible to provide a preliminary list, even nonexistent, of genera and species of Scarabaeinae cited for Rio Grande do Sul. Widen the distribution of Sulcophanaeus rhadamanthus (Harold, 1875) to Rio Grande do Sul, being a recent record of the same, where it was not captured nearly 80 years."
174,Patterns and magnitude of temporal change in avian communities in the Ecuadorian Andes,Scientific article,The Condor,"The tropical Andes rank first among the worlds 25 hotspots of biodiversity and endemism yet are threatened and little studied. We contrast population trends in avian diversity in montane cloud forest (bosque altoandino) and similar forest degraded by the planting of introduced tree species (bosque introducido) in the Mazán Reserve, Ecuador. We describe changes in bird diversity and abundance in these habitats over 12 years and evaluate the nature of change within these avian communities. On the basis of 2976 count detections and 419 net captures of 76 species of landbirds, indices of similarity between the habitats were low, with only 47.6% of species occurring in both forest types. From 199495 to 200607, species richness decreased from 54 to 31 in bosque introducido and from 67 to 30 in bosque altoandino. Capture rates also declined from 56.0 to 28.5 birds per 100 mist-net hr in bosque introducido and from 38.0 to 22.4 birds per 100 mist-net hr in bosque altoandino. We explore various potentially interacting factors that might have caused the observed changes in bird communities, including changes in vegetation within the Mazán Reserve and environmental changes resulting from global warming. But our results also suggest that local and regional changes in habitat outside of the Mazán Reserve were likely responsible for some community changes within the reserve. We argue for increased population monitoring to verify trends and to strengthen the effectiveness of conservation efforts in the Andes."
175,"Population densities of understorey birds across a habitat gradient in Palawan, Philippines: implications for conservation",Scientific article,Oryx,"There is widespread concern for many understorey and ground-dwelling bird species in the Philippines that appear intolerant of forest alteration. We present density estimates for 18 key bird species in old growth forest, advanced and early secondary growth and active cultivation within the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Palawan. Six species were not recorded in cultivation and the abundance of these and several others increased along the successional gradient from cultivation to old growth forest. Eleven species, including five endemics and three of four threatened species, had highest density estimates in old growth forest. However, several species had high density estimates in the heavily disturbed habitats and every habitat type held highest densities of at least one of the bird species. The commonest habitat association across the bird community was a preference for areas containing large trees, indicating the importance of retention of such trees in allowing suitable ground and understorey microhabitats to persist. Old growth forests have the highest conservation value for Palawans endemic birds and, while some species thrive in the anthropogenic habitats that occur within the Park, the present extent of cultivation and associated successional stages within its boundaries should not be increased. We caution against extrapolation of the abundance figures from the Park to the whole island but we suggest that population sizes for the threatened species are likely to be much greater than previously thought. We urge authorities to strengthen management within the protected area network in Palawan to ensure survival of key species."
176,Effects of land use on nocturnal birds in a Mediterranean agricultural landscape,Scientific article,Acta Ornithologica,"Knowledge on the effects of land use on community composition and species abundance is crucial for designing
realistic conservation strategies, particularly in highly dynamic systems such as Mediterranean agricultural mosaics
that are subjected to intensive cultivation. We investigated these effects on the nocturnal bird species occurring in the
study area (Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Red-necked Nightjar Caprimulgus ruficollis, Barn Owl Tyto alba, Eurasian
Scops Owl Otus scops, Little Owl Athene noctua, Tawny Owl Strix aluco, Long-eared Owl Asio otus, Short-eared Owl Asio
flammeus and Eagle Owl Bubo bubo) across an agricultural-natural habitat mosaic in Central Spain for three consecutive
years. Shares of vineyards, scrubland, herbaceous cropland, water bodies, and roads significantly affected the composition
of the nocturnal bird community. Herbaceous cropland and olive groves, which covered 50% of the study area,
proved to be neutral for all species. Remnant patches of natural and semi-natural scrubland (around 10% of the study
area) and water bodies (only 1.5% of the study area) showed a positive effect on Eagle Owls, Eurasian Scops Owls,
Long-eared Owls, and Red-necked Nightjars. Vineyard (35% of the study area) had a negative influence on Eagle Owls,
Long-eared Owls, and Eurasian Scops Owls. Our results indicate, first, that the relative extent of land use types was
apparently not related with the presence of nocturnal bird species and, second, that natural scrublands and water bodies
are key habitats for assuring the persistence of nocturnal birds in agricultural Mediterranean landscapes. Current
land planning focused toward land use intensification will likely increase the areas of habitats that are neutral or have
adverse effects on nocturnal birds."
177,Do eucalypt plantations provide habitat for native forest biodiversity?,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Plantation forestry contributes to the economic growth of many regions, but may also produce ecological
impacts (e.g. on biodiversity) that can be reduced with proper management. We assessed the value of
eucalypt plantations to favor habitat connectivity at the landscape scale by determining their ability to
provide habitat for species associated with the natural vegetation. For this purpose, we compared
diversity and composition of understory vegetation in low-management eucalypt plantations in young,
intermediate (ready for harvest) and mature stages with pine plantations, native forests and shrublands.
We estimated the true species richness with Chao2 estimators and compared among habitats the average
species richness (at two different local scales: per plot and per site), Shannon indices and biovolume of
herbs, shrubs and trees in the understory using ANOVAs or GLZs, depending on data distributions. Differences
among habitats in understory species composition and functional types were compared with PERMANOVA,
and were graphically represented using NMDS ordinations. At local scales, diversity tended to
be higher in native communities (native forests and shrublands) and lower in plantations (lowest in
intermediate eucalypt plantations). Diversity across all study sites was again lowest in eucalypt plantations
in intermediate age, but was relatively high in other plantations, due to a high species turnover in
young and mature eucalypt plantations. Eucalypt plantations were similar to shrublands in understory
species composition and functional types when young, becoming more distant to them when older,
and more similar to pine plantations and native forests. Native forests were the most distinctive community,
with pine plantations being the most similar to them. Native forests harbored the rarest species and
were also associated with seed dispersal by vertebrates (internally). Ant- and wind dispersal were the
most common in shrublands and eucalypt plantations. Given the prevalence of eucalypt plantations in
some regions, determining (and improving, if feasible) their ability to harbor biodiversity of native communities
becomes a crucial goal, in order to increase landscape connectivity and favor species persistence
at regional scales. In the study region, eucalypt plantations provide habitat for species typical of shrublands
when young but do not contribute significantly to the maintenance of the understory biodiversity
associated with native forests. Considering the distinctiveness of native forests, we favor protection and,
where feasible, restoration of native forests over managing eucalypt plantations for biodiversity to best
improve conservation outcomes."
178,The importance of novel and agricultural habitats for the avifauna of an oceanic island,Scientific article,Journal for Nature Conservation,"Conservation management can no longer rely on protecting pristine habitats, but must consider the wider landscape. This is especially true on oceanic islands where endemic species are believed to be particularly susceptible to the extinction risks that accompany land conversion. Despite this, there is a paucity of studies examining how endemic communities on oceanic islands may be distributed across such human-modified habitats. Taking Príncipe Island in West Africa as a case study, we investigate how avian communities vary across the habitats (primary forest, secondary forest, agricultural areas) of this globally important centre of endemism. Here, recent policy reforms aimed at poverty alleviation and increased food production are rapidly altering the current land-use mosaic. Across all habitats, 27 bird species were encountered. Survey points in secondary forest and agricultural areas were, on average, more diverse and held higher overall abundances of birds than those within primary forest. This was true for both the entire avian assemblage and the endemic species alone. Nevertheless, two IUCN-listed species were restricted to primary forest, and many other endemics occurred at higher densities within this habitat. We demonstrate that agricultural areas and novel habitats, such as secondary forest, can hold high abundances of endemic species and thus have the potential to act as a resource for biodiversity conservation. A double-stranded approach to conservation is therefore required that both protects the integrity of the primary forest and controls the rapid changes in agricultural land-use to ensure that it continues to support a large component of the endemic avifauna."
179,"Effects of peat extraction on the composition of Sphagnum peatland exploited and abandones for 20 years, Chile",Scientific article,Anales Instituto Patagonia (Chile),"Magellanic Sphagnum peatlands are characterized by their ability to maintain biodiversity and water cycle of subantarctic ecosystems, together withits contribution to the global carbon storage through the slow production and accumulation of peat. Through industrial peat extraction, these wetlands have become an economic resource for the past 30 years, generating impacts on the landscape, hydrology and flora of these ecosystems. To evaluate the effects of peat extraction on peatland vegetation, we studied a Sphagnum peatland exploited 20 years ago in the locality of Río Rubens, Province of Última Esperanza, Magallanes, Chile. 42 plots of 1 m2 were studied in order to determine differences in species composition and plant coverage. In total 24 taxa were identified, 8 of these were alien to the study area, all classified as invasive. Significant differences where found in floristic composition between the exploited and non exploitedares. The mechanical modification of the area, as a result of peat extraction and construction of drainage channels, favors the arrival of exotic flora specimens such as Rumex acetosella, Carex canescens, Holcus lanatus and Hieracium pilosella."
181,Vascular epiphytes and climbing plants diversity in an agroforestal landscape in southern Chile: a comparison among native forest fragments,Scientific article,Boletín de la Sociedad Argentina de Botánica,"Vascular epiphytes and climbing plants diversity in an agroforestal landscape in southern Chile: a comparison among native forest fragments. We compared the diversity of vines and vascular epiphytes among an evergreen forest fragment (Laureliopsis philippiana y Eucryphia cordifolia) and four fragments of secondary forest dominated for Nothofagus obliqua in an agro-forestry matrix landscape localized in the coastal range of Osorno, in Chile. Based on a sampling transects with ground-based observations, we obtained the species richness, floristic composition, frequency of occurrence (fo) and forest structure. The results showed that: (1) the richness was higher in the evergreen forest (19 species) and decreased in the fragments of N. obliqua (16 to 10 species), (2) the Hymenophyllaceae family (epiphytes) was the most diverse group (10 species), and presented more fo in the evergreen fragment, (3) vines increased their fo in the fragments of N. obliqua, (4) four and five species were found only in evergreen forest and N. obliqua, respectively, (5) floristic similarity ranged between 38% and 75%, (6) the state of forest development varied among forest communities. We conclude that changes in species diversity occur as a result of changes in forest structure."
182,Assessing the effects of selective logging on birds in Neotropical piedmont and cloud montane forests,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"In tropical and subtropical forests there is limited information about how to integrate sustainable timber management with the conservation of biodiversity. We examined the effect of selective logging on the bird community to help develop management guidelines to assure the conservation of biodiversity in forests managed for timber production. The study design consisted of control and harvested plots in piedmont and cloud forests of the subtropical montane forests of the Andes in northwestern Argentina. We conducted bird point-count surveys combined with distance estimation. Breeding season bird community composition was more similar between control and logged forest in both the cloud forest and piedmont, than between the two elevations, probably because Neotropical bird communities change dramatically along elevational gradients. Within each elevation zone, community composition changed significantly between harvested and control forests. Both between and within each elevation zone no significant differences in bird density were detected. Similarly, when we analyzed bird density according to diet guilds no general pattern could be extracted. However, we found a significantly greater density of cavity nesters and lower of non-cavity nesters in control plots, probably because most trees that can develop suitable cavities were extracted in logged plots and these plots had a greater structural diversity enabling more nesting resources. Grouping species according to their nesting habitat requirements has rarely been used in the neotropics and other tropical and subtropical forests, but focusing management attention on cavity nesters might address the most sensitive portion of the avian community as well as other species dependent on trees likely to hold cavities."
183,"The effect of reduced-impact logging on fruit-feeding butterflies in Central Amazon, Brazil",Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"The Amazon region represents more than a half of all tropical forests in the world, and has been threatened by many anthropogenic activities, including several kinds of timber harvesting. The reduced-impact logging (RIL) is considered a less destructive method of timber harvesting, but there is a general lack of information about the effects on Amazonian invertebrates, including butterflies. We investigated the effect of RIL on fruit-feeding butterflies by comparing canopy and understory between an area under RIL and a control area without RIL. The canopy fauna is different and significantly richer than the understory fauna, showing that sampling only the lower strata underestimates the diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies. The effects of RIL were mainly detected in the understory butterfly assemblage, as significant differences were observed in species composition within this stratum. Effects of the RIL regime, which include tree cutting, skid trails and roads openings, are stronger in the understory than in the canopy, explaining the reported differences. Despite the detectable effects of RIL on the composition of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages, the overall diversity was not affected. A similar pattern has been detected in many other groups, indicating that a noticeable part of the diversity of many taxa could be preserved in areas under RIL management. Therefore, in view of the problems of creating protected areas in the Amazon, RIL is a good alternative to preserve fruit-feeding butterflies and surely many other taxa, and it might be a desirable economic alternative for the region."
184,Patterns of plant species richness of temperate and tropical grassland in South Africa,Authored material shared with the project,Plant Ecology and Evolution,"Background and aims  The grasslands of southern Africa are threatened by habitat transformation and
invasive alien species. However, the resultant plant species loss per unit area cannot be quantified, as
the true richness of grassland have not been determined accurately and current estimates of richness are
generally based on once-off site visits. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare the species
richness of selected transformed and untransformed grasslands of tropical and temperate regions in South
Africa. The study sites were located in four grassland vegetation units: KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Belt
and Maputaland Woody Grassland (tropical), and Paulpietersburg Moist Grassland and Rand Highveld
Grassland (temperate).
Methods  Thirty-two plots of 10 × 10 m were sampled at the four sites, namely eight in each of the
vegetation units. At each site four plots were sampled in untransformed grassland and four in adjacent
transformed grassland. Thorough floristic sampling of each plot was undertaken three times during the
peak growing seasons.
Key results  Plant species richness was higher for untransformed grassland than transformed grassland,
and is higher than what was previously estimated. Species richness is not severely affected by alien
cover and richness, as species losses are made up by better adapted native and alien species entering the
transformed habitat. Rare species and habitat specialists are displaced. The type of transformation has a
pronounced effect on species richness.
Conclusion  Plant species richness of grassland is higher than previous estimates. Increasing alien
cover and richness reduces the species richness of certain grassland growth forms and replaces species of
conservation importance such as endemics."
185,"Spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) associated to agroecosystems in the Elqui Valley (Coquimbo Region, Chile)",Scientific article,Revista Colombiana de Entomología,"The taxonomic composition of spiders associated with both cultivated areas and dry uncultivated sectors in
the Elqui River Valley (Coquimbo Region, Chile) were examined by surveys within an altitudinal transect. A total of
230 specimens were captured. Taxonomically, 19 families and 29 species were obtained. Species richness was higher in
the dry uncultivated sectors (23 species) than in the cultivated sites (18 species). Eight families were common to both
situations; these were Anyphaenidae (1.3% of total capture), Araneidae (5.6%), Gnaphosidae (8.6%), Lycosidae (3.0%),
Sicariidae (32.2%), Theridiidae (15.7%), Titanoecidae (3.5%) and Zodariidae (6.5%). The more abundant species in the
semiarid area were Sicarius sp. (Sicariidae) (17,6% of total capture in the area), Steatoda porteri (Theridiidae) (9.5%)
and Cybaeodamus lycosoides (Zodariidae) (9.5%). In the cultivated areas, in turn, the numerically dominant species
were Loxosceles laeta (Sicariidae) (42.7%), Steatoda grossa (Theridiidae) (8.5%) and Goeldia patellaris (Titanoecidae)
(8.5%). This paper is the first approach to the study of spider assemblages found in the semi-arid watersheds of
Chile and sets the taxonomic bases for examining the role played by these organisms in integrated pest management or
biological control."
186,"Distribution of nocturnal birds (Strigiformes and Caprimulgidae) in relation to land-use types, extent and configuration in agricultural landscapes of Central Italy",Scientific article,Rendiconti Lincei,"Understanding the role of land-use patterns in determining the distribution of nocturnal birds has important implications for the conservation of these species and for land management. One important step for effective conservation is to develop statistical models to assess how the probability of birds presence can be influenced by land-use types in order to support decision making in conservation planning at the landscape or regional scale. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of extent and configuration of land-use types in determining the distribution of some nocturnal birds of prey (Strigiformes) and the European Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus in agricultural landscapes. We surveyed six nocturnal birds (Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops, Little Owl Athene noctua, Barn Owl Tyto alba, Long-eared Owl Asio otus, Tawny Owl Strix aluco and European Nightjar) in 123 listening stations located in nine protected areas of southern Tuscany, Central Italy. Nocturnal birds were present in 97 % of the stations, where variables relative to the extent and configuration of land-use types were measured. The probability of Tawny Owl presence increased with increasing forest cover, the probability of Little Owl presence increased with increasing amount of arable land, whilst the probability of Eurasian Scops Owl and Long-eared Owl presence increased with increasing amount of open areas. The model of European Nightjar showed that the probability of presence increased with increasing amount of forest edge and scrubs. Our results suggest that heterogeneous agricultural landscapes may favour the coexistence of several nocturnal birds, since the different species are each associated with different land-use types."
187,Rapid evaluation of threats to biodiversity: human footprint score and large vertebrate species responses in French Guiana,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Although there is an extensive literature demonstrating the impact of human activities on both species extinction risk and local ecological processes, the methodological tools that allow for the visualization and quantification of the intensity of the observed and forthcoming impacts are lacking. Here we propose a Footprint index for French Guiana, (northern Atlantic coast of South America) which sums up the expected and proven disturbances on biodiversity. The index was developed by superimposing geographical and human data, including human population densities, land use, settlements and camps, mining and forest activities, tracks, roads and rivers. The relevance of the index as a general measure of anthropic impact on large terrestrial fauna was estimated by investigating the structure of the large terrestrial vertebrate assemblages, including primates, large frugivorous birds, rodents and ungulates, in relation to the extent of disturbances. The abundance of large terrestrial fauna was assessed using the line-transect sampling method in 34 forest sites facing different disturbance levels, including hunting, logging and fragmentation, and consequently different footprint scores. A Self Organizing Map was used to combine species abundances and disturbance scores. It allowed us to rank species in accordance to their sensitivity towards disturbances, identifying the response of fauna to different concomitant threats. The index provided correct identification of sites with similar threats which proves it is a relevant estimator of human disturbance. In addition, the richness of animal communities and abundances of several seed dispersers and predators were negatively correlated to the index (e.g. large monkeys and frugivorous birds, r2 = 0.49, P\0.0001 and r2 = 0.48, P\0.0001, respectively), indicating its reliability in identifying areas where animal communities are disturbed. The index could, therefore, constitute a useful tool to identify areas where ecological processes supported by those species are expected to be disrupted, and where they are already disrupted. Furthermore, the footprint index can deal with lack of field data or with only partially valid information, and so may directly help land managers forecast and, hopefully, mitigate forthcoming impacts resulting from the development of human activities."
188,Differences in the Effects of Selective Logging on Amphibian Assemblages in Three West African Forest Types,Scientific article,Biotropica,"Making generalizations about the impact of commercial selective logging on biodiversity has so far remained elusive. Species responses to logging depend on a number of factors, many of which have not been studied in detail. These factors may include the natural forest conditions (forest types) under which logging impacts are investigated; but this question has so far remained unexamined. In a largescale replicate study we aimed at clarifying the relationship between logging and forest types on leaf litter frogs. We contrast three distinct and naturally occurring forest types, including wet evergreen, moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Selectively logged sites were compared with primary forest sites for each forest type. We found that the response of frog communities to logging varies in different forest types. In the wet evergreen forest, richness was higher in logged forest than primary forest, while diversity measures were not different between logged and primary forest habitats. In the moist evergreen, richness and diversity were higher in selectively logged areas compared with primary forest habitats. In the semi-deciduous, logged forests were characterized by drastic loss of forest specialists, reduced richness, and diversity. These results indicate that the net effect of logging varies with respect to forest type. Forest types that are characterized by adverse climatic conditions (i.e., low rainfall and protracted dry seasons) are more likely to produce negative effects on leaf litter anuran communities. For comparisons of the impact of logging on species to be effective, future research must endeavor to include details of forest type."
189,"Land snail diversity in post extraction secondary forest reserves in Edo State, Nigeria",Scientific article,African Journal of Ecology,"Knowledge of the fauna of tropical lowland rainforest is urgently necessary because of the high rate of biodiversity loss and global extinction of species as a result of deforestation. We studied land molluscs species richness and diversity in four heavily degraded secondary forest reserves and one old-growth forest reserve in Edo State, Nigeria using a combination of direct fixed-time search and litter-sieving techniques in twelve plots of 400 m2 each per reserve. A total of 43 species and 2570 individuals were collected from all the reserves. Local species richness ranged from 19 to 39 species while number of specimens from 203 to 971. Molluscan species richness and diversity is significantly higher in the old-growth forest than in the disturbed forest reserves. Land molluscs family composition was similar in all the forests with respect to the common and wide-ranging species while rare and narrowrange species are restricted to the old-growth forest in Okomu. The carnivorous streptaxids and detritivorous subulinids dominate species richness and abundance respectively in all the sites. Species turnover is moderately high within and between the forest reserves indicating the uniqueness of the faunal composition of each forest and the need for adequate protection."
190,Species Composition of Termites (Isoptera) in Different Cerrado Vegetation Physiognomies,Scientific article,Sociobiology,"Little is known about the termite fauna of the different vegetation physiognomies in the Cerrado biome. It is suggested that the species compositions in grassland and savanna areas are closely related to each other, and quite distinct from those of forests. This study compared the species composition from five different physiognomies of Cerrado, and tested the hypothesis that the termite faunas of savannas and grasslands form a distinct group from that of forests. The study was conducted in the Parque Estadual da Serra de Jaraguá, state of Goiás, Brazil. Termites were sampled from two physiognomies of savanna, one natural grassland, one pasture, and one gallery forest. A transect with 10 parcels of 5x2 m was established in each physiognomy. The relative abundance was inferred by the number of encounters, termites were classified in feeding guilds, and the dissimilarity in the species composition between the physiognomies was calculated. A total of 219 encounters, of 42 species of two families were recorded. The most abundant feeding guilds were the humivores (98) and xylophages (55). The physiognomies with the largest number of species were rupestrian cerrado (23 species) and cerrado sensu stricto (21). The physiognomies had a similar species composition (less than 55% dissimilarity), mainly the natural open areas. The hypothesis of a distinct fauna of termites in forest vegetation was refuted. The termite fauna of gallery forest is very different from that of pasture, but most species also occur in natural open areas. The impact of pasture on the diversity and composition of termites seems to be significant, but the impact is even greater on the proportion of the feeding guilds, reducing the proportion of xylophages and intermediates."
191,"Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in three landscapes in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil",Scientific article,Brazilian Journal of Biology,"Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in three landscapes in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Dung Beetles are
important for biological control of intestinal worms and dipterans of economic importance to cattle, because they
feed and breed in dung, killing parasites inside it. They are also very useful as bioindicators of species diversity in
agricultural or natural environments. The aims of this paper were to study the species richness, and abundance of
dung beetles, helping to answer the question: are there differences in the patterns of dung beetle diversity in three
environments (pasture, agriculture and forest) in the municipality of Dourados, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. A
total of 105 samplings were carried out weekly, from November 2005 to November 2007, using three pitfall traps in
each environment. The traps were baited with fresh bovine dung, and 44,355 adult dung beetles from 54 species were
captured: two from Hyborosidae and 52 from Scarabaeidae. Five species were constant, very abundant and dominant
on the pasture, two in the agricultural environment, and two in the environment of Semideciduous forest. Most of the
species were characterised as accessories, common and not-dominant. The species with higher abundance was Ataenius
platensis Blanchard, 1844. The indexes of Shannon-Wiener diversity were: 2.90 in the pasture, 2.84 in the agricultural
environment and 2.66 in the area of native forest. The medium positive presence of dung beetles in the traps in each
environment were: 36.88, 42.73 and 20.18 individuals per trap, in the pasture, agricultural environment and in the
native forest, respectively. The pasture environment presented a higher diversity index. The species diversity of dung
beetles was superior where there was higher abundance and regularity of resource (bovine dung)."
192,Responses of Five Arboreal Marsupials to Recent Selective Logging in Tropical Australia,Scientific article,Biotropica,"We assessed effects of selective logging of rain forest upon a diverse assemblage of folivorous (leaf-eating) marsupials in tropical Queensland, Australia. Spotlighting censuses of mammal populations were conducted for I-yr periods before logging (1886/87) and 3 yr after logging (1993/94), on a 150-ha sire in which an average of 8-10 trees/ha (50-55 m(3)/ha) were extracted. Two formerly logged ''reference sites'' were censused concurrently to assess effects of sampling variation and between-year population fluctuations on census results. Lemuroid ringtail possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides) declined markedly in logged forest, while three other possums (Pseudocheirops archeri, Trichosuras vulpecula, Pseudocheirus herbertensis) and a tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) did not differ significantly between pre- and pen-logging censuses. Folivores char are highly dependent upon primary forest clearly are most vulnerable to logging. The magnitude and duration of logging impacts on arboreal mammal populations is probably strongly affected by the level of forest structural damage incurred during logging operations. We suggest that ecological and behavioral traits such as the degree of arboreality, diet, denning requirements and territorial behavior influenced the responses of these marsupials to logging."
193,Grasshopper biodiversity and bioindicators in Australian tropical savannas: Responses to disturbance in Kakadu National Park,Scientific article,Austral Ecology,"Grasshoppers are a dominant group of herbivorous insects throughout the world, and their high diversity, functional importance, sensitivity to disturbance and ease of sampling makes them potentially useful bioindicators for land management. In Australia, however, the dynamics of grasshopper assemblages are extremely poorly understood. Here we describe the responses of grasshopper (Acridoidea, Eumastacoidea and Tettigonioidea) assemblages in the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory, Australia to disturbance associated with mining. Three questions were addressed in this study: (i) do local grasshopper assemblages show consistent responses to disturbance?; (ii) can particular species or functional groups be identified that are reliable indicators of ecological disturbance?; and (iii) to what extent do the responses of grasshopper assemblages merely reflect those of vegetation? Grasshoppers were sampled at 26 sites located in and around the Ranger uranium mine, representing three habitat types with respect to degree of disturbance: (i) 'natural' (10 sites representing a range of 'undisturbed' savanna habitats); (ii) 'disturbed' (10 sites representing a range of disturbances, but with soil intact); and (iii) 'waste rock' (six sites undergoing rehabilitation on a constructed landform). A total of 56 grasshopper species in 46 genera was recorded during the study, with site species richness ranging from five to 20. There were no significant differences between habitat types in site species diversity, but multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong correspondence between grasshopper species composition and degree of habitat disturbance. Using Indicator Species Analysis, six species and one functional group were identified as significant indicators of habitat type in relation to disturbance. Grasshopper responses were correlated with that of vegetation, but grasshopper assemblages showed apparently meaningful differentiation among disturbed sites that was not evident on the basis of floristic data. Our results demonstrate that grasshopper assemblages respond to disturbances associated with human land use and that these responses do not simply reflect those of plants. Grasshoppers are therefore potentially useful bioindicators of ecological disturbance in Australia, but further work is required on the extent to which their responses reflect general ecological change."
194,"The value of primary, secondary and plantation forests for Amazonian birds",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Secondary forests and exotic tree plantations are rapidly expanding across tropical landscapes,
yet we currently have a very poor understanding of the value of these human-dominated
forest landscapes for biodiversity conservation. Mist netting, point counts and
transect walks were used to compare the bird communities of these habitats and neighboring
primary forest in north-east Brazilian Amazonia. The extensive spatial scale of plantations
and second-growth in our study area enabled us to implement a robust replicated
design, with survey plots approximately two to three orders of magnitude larger than most
previous studies of land-use change in the tropics, thus minimising the influence of the
surrounding landscape. Species richness was highest in primary forest and lowest in Eucalyptus
plantations, and community turnover between habitats was very high whether
based upon matrices of relative abundance or species presenceabsence data, and for both
point count and mist net data. Monthly line-transect censuses conducted over an annual
cycle showed an increase in the detection of canopy frugivores and seed predators during
the peak of flower and fruit availability in primary forest, but failed to suggest that secondgrowth
or Eucalyptus stands provide suitable foraging habitat at any time of the year. The
conservation value of both secondary forest and plantations was low compared to conclusions
from previous studies. Our results indicate that while large-scale reforestation of
degraded land can increase regional levels of diversity, it is unlikely to conserve most primary
forest species, such as understorey insectivores and canopy frugivores."
195,A case study on the effects of disturbance and conversion of tropical lowland rain forest on the non-volant small mammals in north Borneo: Management implications,Scientific article,Mammal Society of Japan,"The conversion and loss of primary rainforest in Southeast Asia is presumed to affect
many animal assemblages in terms of their diversity and species composition. We studied the
responses of non-volant small mammals to forest loss and degradation caused by logging and the
establishment of large-scale oil palm plantations located in the north-eastern part of Borneo in
Southeast Asia. We found that habitat types (forest versus plantation) were important determinant of
species occurrences and assemblage compositions. However, within forest habitats irrespective of
whether logged or unlogged, similarities in assemblage compositions of sites close to each other
underline the importance of geographic distance in shaping small mammal assemblages. In terms of
conservation management, it is imperative to incorporate the size and overall surrounding
environment of a forest into forest management concepts, and although not equivalent to areas of
primary forest, old regenerating secondary forest needs to be considered as an important component
for the preservation of small mammal species diversity. In contrast, oil palm plantations are clearly of
little or no importance for the conservation of the non-volant small mammal fauna and this habitat
may also act as an effective barrier to the dispersal of the small mammals."
196,"Increased grazing and dominance of an exotic pasture (Bothriochloa pertusa) affects vertebrate fauna species composition, abundance and habitat in savanna woodland",Scientific article,The Rangeland Journal,"The invasion of exotic pasture species into intact woodlands has the potential to affect native fauna by altering habitat structure and ecosystem function. The spread of these weeds is generally in concert with cattle grazing, so that fauna or habitat change is due to multiple interrelated causes. In this study we investigated whether the spread of the introduced pasture grass Bothriochloa pertusa and replacement of the native bluegrass B. ewartiana in eucalypt woodlands of northern Queensland has had an effect on terrestrial vertebrate fauna. We located 40 sites that sampled a range of native and introduced pastures cover, and investigated the spatial pattern of abundance with canonical analysis of principle coordinates, and correlation of the habitat attributes on the ordination space. We then selected a subset of four habitat attributes (eliminating highly colinear variables) and modelled species response to each using an information-theoretic approach. Thirty-one species (26 birds, one mammal and four reptiles) and two summary variables (bird abundance and richness) had best subset Akaike Information Criteria models with reliable parameters estimates. Seventeen models contained the B. pertusa frequency term and a further 16 had a term relating to upper storey cover (tree cover > 10, 5-10 or 3-5 m). Though pasture grass cover, grazing and habitat features were correlated and thus we cannot ascribe B. pertusa as the sole determinant of fauna species change, this study has demonstrated that tropical savanna woodlands with changing Bothriochloa dominance from native to introduced species have different fauna species composition. In particular bird species richness, ground nesting species (e.g. rufous songlark Cincloramphus mathewsi, golden-headed cisticola Cisticola exilis) and terrestrial reptiles (e.g. Carlia munda and Ctenotus taeniolatus) declined. Disturbance-tolerant species such as Australian magpie Cracticus tibicen and yellow-throated miners Manorina flavigula increased in abundance in exotic pasture-dominated sites. As pastoral intensification continues in northern Australian rangelands there is a potential for significant change in the relative abundance and composition of vertebrate fauna and the reduction or loss of some species in the landscape."
197,"The population dynamics of some arid zone plants during 46 years of grazing on Mileura Station, Western Australia",Scientific article,The Rangeland Journal,"Grazed quadrats were monitored on Mileura Station, Western Australia from 1967 to 2013 in order to study the population dynamics of the perennial plants in two of the land systems on the property. Counts of plants on four quadrats at each of 10 sites were made in 1967, 1976, 1990 and 2013, and individual plants were traced for the first three samplings. Five sites were on the Sherwood land system and five on the Belele land system. The results indicated that the populations of some species in the mulga shrubland increased steadily over the 46 years of the study whereas the populations of other species, especially the small, short-lived shrubs, fluctuated over this period. A reduction in stocking rate from 1976 to 1990 was associated with an increase in the population of perennial plants; the total numbers for the 1976 count were 1506 compared with 2102 in 1990. Mean summer rainfall increased between 1990 and 2013 and this increase may have been associated with the recruitment. Overall, the study showed that commercial stocking, although at a lower rate than that recommended by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, was compatible with increases in the populations of the perennial components of mulga shrubland in this region."
198,Comparison of animal biodiversity in three livestock systems of open environments of the semi-arid Chaco of Argentina,Scientific article,The Rangeland Journal,"Increasing global food demand requires the exploration of agricultural production systems that minimise the conflict between food production and biodiversity conservation. Cattle ranching is a main land-use in tropical and sub-tropical South American semi-arid ecosystems, such as the Chaco eco-region of subtropical Argentina, one of the most active frontiers of land-use change. Despite open habits being a key component of the Chaco landscape, conservation studies and policies have focussed on forests. In this study, bird and mammal communities of three different open-canopy livestock-producing systems in the semi-arid Argentinian Chaco: natural grasslands, sown non-native pastures and silvopastoral systems are discussed. Diversity (Inverse Simpson index) and species composition (multivariate ordinations) were measured and species identified that characterise each system (indicator species). The three livestock systems did not significantly differ in terms of diversity but showed differences in the composition of bird communities. Natural grasslands had the highest number of bird and mammal indicator species (including Myrmecophaga tridactyla, a high conservation-value species). These results highlight natural grasslands as a landscape unit with a high conservation value and indicate that they should be explicitly targeted by conservation and land-use policies, particularly because they represent a small and rapidly decreasing proportion of the semi-arid Argentinian Chaco."
199,The effects of grazing and fire on vegetation and the vertebrate assemblage in a tropical savanna woodland in north-eastern Australia,Scientific report (published),Journal of Tropical Ecology,"We studied the response of vegetation and vertebrate assemblages to fire and grazing, and their interacting
effects, in Eucalyptus woodland in north-eastern Australia. In this vegetation type, many pastures remain free of
cattle grazing due to the occurrence of a native shrub poisonous to livestock. Vegetation (floristic data and 22 habitat
variables) and vertebrate fauna (birds, mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29 standardized 50 x 50-m quadrats in
the 2001 wet season, representing four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2y) and grazed by cattle (4-8 ha
per livestock unit); sites unburnt (last burnt > 2y ago) and grazed; sites burnt recently and ungrazed; and unburnt
and ungrazed sites. Fire and grazing had a significant influence on vegetation: both grazing and fire reduced ground
cover (fire in grazed sites 51-23%, fire in ungrazed sites 68-39%) and increased the cover of forbs (8% in burnt
and grazed sites, 3% if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20% in grazed and unburnt sites and 5% when ungrazed).
Grazing caused a shift in floristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda pungens to tussock grasses
(e.g. A ristida spp., Enneapogon spp.), forbs (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate groups,
birds responded more to fire effects (9 species), reptiles to grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction
(2 species). Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes, hooded robin Melanodryas
cucullatus, Ctenophorun suchalis) and to the dominant ground cover (e.g. Ctenotusp antherinus) or change in vegetation
architecture( e.g. singing honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The clearest
example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary dominance between the rodents Pseudomydse licatulus
and P. desertor, the latter's post-fire recovery becoming more muted in sites where cattle grazed (modelled time for
population recovery twice as long as in ungrazed sites)."
200,The utilization of large savanna trees by elephant in southern Kruger National Park,Scientific report (published),Journal of Tropical Ecology,"Elephant are believed to be one of the main ecological drivers in the conversion of savanna woodlands to grassland. We assessed the impacts of elephant on large trees (≥5 m in height) in the southern section of the Kruger National Park. Tree dimensions and utilization by elephantwere recorded for 3082 individual trees across 22 transects (average length of 3 km and 10 m wide). Sixty per cent of the trees exhibited elephant utilization and 4% were dead as a direct result of elephant foraging behaviour. Each height class of tree was utilized in proportion to abundance. However, the size of the tree and the species influenced the intensity of utilization and foraging approach. Sclerocarya birrea was actively selected for and experienced the highest proportional utilization (75% of all trees). Interestingly, the proportion of large trees that were utilized and pushed over increased with distance from permanent water, a result which has implications for the provision of water in the KNP. We conclude that mortality is likely to be driven by a combination of factors including fire, drought and disease, rather than the actions of elephant alone. Further investigation is also required regarding the role of senescence and episodic mortality."
201,"""Ordinary biodiversity"" in western Burkina Faso (West Africa): what vegetation do the state forests conserve?",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The role of state forests in the conservation of the savannah environment of western Burkina Faso (West Africa) was assessed by considering the customary and fundamental biological components of plant diversity. The focus is on the ordinary biodiversity which constitutes the current environment of human populations and which generates their resources. Overall floristic composition, a, b, c diversities and species accumulation curves of landscape units were compared inside and outside protected areas. Common species were identified according to their frequencies in landscape units and their local abundance. The occurrences of functional (life form, dispersion, etc.) and human-valued (current uses, potential threats, etc.) traits were compared. Current land uses outside protected areas have an unequal effect on the various components of plant diversity. Species richnesses and specific structures were all the more altered for woody species as agricultural pressure is high; conversely, they were maintained for herbaceous communities for which the proportion of wide-ranging species increased. The preservation of useful plant species on cultivated lands was obvious for woody species with edible fruits but less tangible for timber and service wood. It was deficient for species that furnish other non-wood products (e.g. leaves used as food or fodder), the conservation of which may be jeopardized where anthropic pressure is high. Given current land uses and dynamics,
maintaining conservation areas in land use planning is crucial in order to preserve ordinary biodiversity."
202,Dynamics of the Leaf-Litter Arthropod Fauna Following Fire in a Neotropical Woodland Savanna,Scientific report (published),PLoS One,"Fire is an important agent of disturbance in tropical savannas, but relatively few studies have analyzed how soil-and-litter
dwelling arthropods respond to fire disturbance despite the critical role these organisms play in nutrient cycling and other
biogeochemical processes. Following the incursion of a fire into a woodland savanna ecological reserve in Central Brazil, we
monitored the dynamics of litter-arthropod populations for nearly two years in one burned and one unburned area of the
reserve. We also performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine the effects of fire and litter type on the
dynamics of litter colonization by arthropods. Overall arthropod abundance, the abundance of individual taxa, the richness
of taxonomic groups, and the species richness of individual taxa (Formiciade) were lower in the burned site. However, both
the ordinal-level composition of the litter arthropod fauna and the species-level composition of the litter ant fauna were not
dramatically different in the burned and unburned sites. There is evidence that seasonality of rainfall interacts with fire, as
differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were more pronounced in the dry than in the wet season. For many taxa
the differences in abundance between burned and unburned sites were maintained even when controlling for litter
availability and quality. In contrast, differences in abundance for Collembola, Formicidae, and Thysanoptera were only
detected in the unmanipulated samples, which had a lower amount of litter in the burned than in the unburned site
throughout most of our study period. Together these results suggest that arthropod density declines in fire-disturbed areas
as a result of direct mortality, diminished resources (i.e., reduced litter cover) and less favorable microclimate (i.e., increased
litter desiccation due to reduction in tree cover). Although these effects were transitory, there is evidence that the
increasingly prevalent fire return interval of only 1–2 years may jeopardize the long-term conservation of litter arthropod
communities."
203,Fire tolerance of perennial grass tussocks in a savanna woodland,Scientific report (published),Austral Ecology,"Grass populations in tropical savannas are highly resilient in relation to different fire regimes, but the
mechanisms conferring such resilience have been poorly studied. Here we examine one such mechanism, high adult
survival during fire, for three perennial grass species in an Australian savanna: Eriachne triseta Nees ex Steud,
Eriachne avenacea R.Br and Chrysopogon latifolius S.T.Blake.The study examined survivorship after 3 years, at plots
subject to experimental fire regimes (experiencing 0, 1, 2 or 3 fires over the study period) at theTerritory Wildlife
Park near Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia. Mean survivorship was 79.9%, 64.3% and 62.0% for E.
avenacea, E. triseta and C. latifolius respectively. For the two species of Eriachne, mean survivorship was highest (E.
avenacea, 94.6%; E. triseta, 77.1%) in unburnt plots, whereas survivorship of C. latifolius was highest (71.7%) under
highest fire frequency. However, variation in survivorship among fire regime treatments was not statistically
significant for any of the study species. This negligible difference in survivorship among regimes points to fire
tolerance (sprouting ability) as an important mechanism contributing to the resilience and persistence of perennial
grasses in these savannas."
204,Conservation value of low fire frequency in tropical savannas: Ants in monsoonal northern Australia,Scientific report (published),Austral Ecology,"The conservation values of old-growth forests in landscapes subject to repeated disturbance by fire or logging have received considerable conservation attention. However, little is known of the conservation values of old-growth sites in ecosystems with an evolutionary history of highly frequent disturbance. Here we address the value of low fire frequency (<1 fire/10 years) in tropical savannas, the world's most fire-prone biome, in terms of ant biodiversity. We do this by comparing savanna ant communities within the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP) near Darwin in the Australian monsoonal tropics, which has experienced a low incidence of fire over 25 years due to active fire exclusion, with those of adjacent (outside) sites experiencing the ambient fire regime of burning every 25 years. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and arboreal pitfall traps at 16 sites, eight each inside and outside TWP. More than 16 000 ants were recorded during the study, representing a total of 98 ant species from 30 genera. More species in total were recorded outside (90) than inside (74) TWP, but there was no difference in mean site species richness or abundance, and overall species composition was similar. All species recorded inside TWP are common and widespread throughout the savanna landscapes of the broader region, in the absence of active fire exclusion. Low fire frequency at the Territory Wildlife Park therefore does not appear to have enhanced regional ant conservation values. Our findings reinforce the importance of targeting fire regimes that are clearly linked to positive conservation outcomes, rather than assuming a need for maximum pyrodiversity."
205,Effects of experimental fire regimes on the abundance and diversity of cursorial arachnids of Brazilian savannah (cerrado biome),Scientific report (published),Journal of Arachnology,"We investigated the influence of burning frequency and timing on the abundance and diversity of cursorial arachnids in the cerrado (savannah of central Brazil). Five areas were subjected to different burning regimes. In each area, 40 pitfall traps were installed. The arachnids were sampled for three days each month from April 2007 to October 2008. Abundance was higher in the control area than in areas subjected to any fire regime. Species richness was similar in all areas. The evenness was lower in the control area. The areas subject to fires had significantly higher diversity than the control area. Although it was not possible to rank areas according to their diversity, areas burned in the middle of the dry season tended to have higher diversity than areas burned at the beginning or end of this season, indicating that the time at which fire occurs may be more important than the frequency of burning for the diversity of cursorial arachnids in the Brazilian cerrado."
206,"Impact of land-use type and harvesting on population structure of a non-timber forest product-providing tree in a semi-arid savanna, West Africa",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) strongly contribute to livelihood security in the semi-arid tropics. Main factors determining the populations of NTFP-providing species are human activities. This study examined the impact of land-use, combined with rates and patterns of debarking and chopping on a NTFP-providing tree (Anogeissus leiocarpa) in Burkina Faso. We compared stands in a protected area (W National Park) with those of its surrounding communal area (fallows, croplands) in order to (i) obtain an indication on the status of the population, (ii) assess its harvesting tolerance, (iii) estimate the sustainability of present management, and (iv) derive which additional management strategies may foster its conservation. Our results reveal that the stands of A. leiocarpa are in healthy states in fallows and in the park. In croplands, the absence of saplings gives evidence of a declining population. Nearly all individuals of A. leiocarpa were harvested in croplands and fallows, while the number of harvested individuals in the park was negligible. Intensity of debarking and chopping was tree size-specific. The sprouting ability significantly increased with higher chopping intensity. We conclude that despite the land-use impact and the intense harvesting, stands of A. leiocarpa are still well preserved due to the species life history (fast growing and high sprouting) and due to indirect positive influences of human activities by providing better environmental conditions for its recruitment. Thus, the population of A. leiocarpa is not at risk to over-harvesting and land-use even though it is not protected."
207,"The influence of fire frequency on the abundance of Maerua subcordata in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania",Scientific article,Journal of Plant Ecology,"Aims
Invasive species alter the composition and function of communities, threatening the conservation of important ecosystems worldwide. In savanna ecosystems, fire plays a key role by modifying biogeochemical cycles and shaping the composition and structure of vegetation communities. Although many studies have examined the long-term effects of fire frequency on grassland communities, few studies have examined the relationship between fire regime and woody species invasions.
Methods
The Serengeti ecosystem is an ecologically and economically valuable natural resource in East Africa whose conservation is currently threatened by a variety of factors, including invasive species. We determined the abundance of Maerua subcordata, a noxious woody shrub, in three different regions of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We then examined the influence of fire frequency, developed through the use of 7 years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, on M. subcordata abundance.
Important Findings
In all regions, burned transects had significantly greater abundances of M. subcordata compared to unburned transects. Furthermore, the number of times each transect burned from 2000 to 2006 had a significant positive effect on the abundance of
M. subcordata and the number of years since a transect last burned had a significant negative relationship with abundance. These results are particularly important as this species provides little forage value and is potentially toxic to wildlife and cattle. Additional studies are needed to determine the ecological consequences of increasing M. subcordata abundance, as the potential expansion of noxious shrubs into protected areas of important conservation status is of serious concern."
208,Post-wildfire regeneration of rangeland productivity and functionality - observations across three semi-arid vegetation types in South Africa,Scientific report (published),African Journal of Range & Forage Science,"Wildfires can have significant impacts on rangeland productivity and functionality causing substantial economic
losses to affected farmers. In August 2011, such wildfires swept through the North West province of South Africa,
destroying large areas of grazing and farm infrastructure. There is little information available on how the regional
semi-arid rangelands respond to fire. In order to increase knowledge on short-term regeneration capacities of
burned rangelands, the recovery of grass phytomass, composition and diversity as well as the frequency distribution
of patch types (i.e. grass-, litter- and bare patches) were assessed in the growing season following the fire.
Burned and unburned sites were compared in two regional grasslands and one savanna type receiving between
480 and 700 mm rainfall y1. Fire significantly reduced phytomass production, and lowered the grazing capacity and
potential grazing days across vegetation types. In general, grass diversity, composition and relative frequencies
remained unaffected documenting an overall good regeneration potential of the grass sward. An increased proportion
of bare patches and decrease of litter indicated that the post-fire environment lost functionality with respect to
erosion control, nutrient cycling and water infiltration. Gained insights provide valuable baseline information for
future impact assessments and research into the fire dynamics of investigated vegetation types."
209,The effect of land-use on the local distribution of palm species in an Andean rain forest fragment in northwestern Ecuador,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The northern Andes is extremely rich in plant species, but this diversity is threatened by extensive
deforestation. This study reports on how ®ve palm species respond to human disturbance in an area
of montane forest in Ecuador. The abundance of each species was determined in 250 40 ´ 30m plots,
established in disturbed and undisturbed forest within an area of 3 ´ 3 km and altitudes spanning
1248±1938 m. Aiphanes erinacea (H. Karst.) H. Wendl. and to a lesser degree Geonoma undata
Klotzsch were negatively aected by even moderate human disturbance, while Chamaedorea linearis
(Ruiz & Pav.) Mart. and C. pinnatifrons (Jacq.) Oerst. bene®tted from such disturbance and Prestoea
acuminata (Willd.) H.E. Moore was unaected given time enough to replenish its population after
disturbance. At the scale of the plots, species richness was maximized in undisturbed forest. Aiphanes
erinacea is endemic to northern Ecuador and southern Colombia and must be considered threatened
by the extensive deforestation here. If the behaviour of these palms is representative of Andean rain
forest plans in general, the negative eect of moderate anthropogenic disturbance on plant biodi-
versity at scales of ³1km2 might be negligible. Thus, biologically sustainable logging could be
Possible."
210,Effects of forest disturbance on the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in central Amazonia,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"This study evaluates biotic responses, using ants as bio-indicators, to relatively recent anthropogenic
disturbances to mature forest in central Amazonia. The structure of the ground-foraging ant com-
munity was compared in four habitats that represented a gradient of disturbance associated with
dierences in land use. Ants were collected in undisturbed, mature forest, in an abandoned pasture,
in a young regrowth forest (situated in a former pasture area), and in an old regrowth forest
(established where mature forest was just cleared and abandoned). More ant species were found in
mature and old regrowth forest than in the abandoned pasture. By contrast, ant abundance tended
to decrease with forest maturity. Both pasture and young regrowth forest exhibited a distinct ant
species composition compared to mature forest, whereas species composition in the old regrowth
forest showed greater similarity to that of mature forest. In spite of dierences in fallow time between
former pasture areas and non-pasture areas, there is evidence that dierent land-management
practices do result in dierent rates of recovery of the ant forest fauna after land abandonment. In
any case, recuperation of the ground-foraging ant fauna appears to be faster than regeneration of the
woody-plant community. In this sense, regrowth forests may be valuable for the conservation of
ground-foraging ants and perhaps for other components of mature-forest leaf-litter fauna within the
context of a fragmented landscape."
211,Responses of ants to selective logging of a central Amazonian forest,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Relatively little information exists on the eects of logging on rain forest organ-
isms, particularly in the Neotropics where logging operations have increased dra-
matically in recent years. In this study we determined experimentally the eects of
selective logging of a central Amazonian forest on ground-living ants.
2. The experimental design consisted of three 4-ha replicated plots representing
control unlogged forest, forest logged 10  years prior to the start of the study
(1987), and forest logged 4  years prior to the start of the study (1993). The logging
operation removed 50% of the basal area of trees of commercial value, or about
eight trees per hectare. This resulted in a signi®cant decrease in canopy cover, and
an increase in understorey vegetation density in logged plots relative to controls.
3. Collection and identi®cation of ants from a total of 360 1-m2 samples of leaf-lit-
ter revealed 143 ant species, of which 97 were found in the control plots, 97 in the
plots logged in 1987, and 106 in those logged in 1993. Species richness, evenness
and mean abundance (ants m
ÿ2) per plot did not vary among treatments. Most of
the species found in the control plots were also present in the logged plots. How-
ever, population density of many species changed as a result of logging, an eect
that persisted for at least 10  years after logging. Species commonly found in sites
that were directly disturbed by logging (gaps and tracks) were rare in the undis-
turbed forest, as revealed by an additional collection of ants.
4. These results suggest that the persistence of ant assemblages typical of undis-
turbed forest is likely to depend on the amount of structural damage incurred by
logging. Thus management techniques that minimize logging impacts on forest
structure are likely to help maintain the conservation value of logged forests for
ground-dwelling ants. It is particularly important to minimize the extent of logging
roads and tracks created by heavy machinery because these areas appear more
prone to invasion by non-forest species."
212,"The structure of raptor assemblages in riparian environments in the south-west of the Northern Territory, Australia",Scientific article,Emu,"During 1995–97, raptor assemblages were studied in ten riparian habitats in the arid south-west of the
Northern Territory, Australia. The assemblages at different creeks differed in species composition, diversity,
richness and pair density. They also changed from year to year, in parallel with changes in rainfall and food
abundance.
Differences in food abundance probably accounted for much of the spatial and temporal variation in the
assemblages, although between-creek differences in habitat and the availability of nesting resources were also
implicated. Most species appeared to respond to the environmental changes individualistically, but differences in
pair spacing within and between trophic groups were suggestive of competitive interactions."
213,"Responses of vertebrates to pastoralism, military land use and landscape position in an Australian tropical savanna",Scientific article,Austral Ecology,"Despite the hegemony of pastoralism over most of Australias tropical savannas, its impacts upon
biodiversity are poorly known. There is even less knowledge about the impacts of military training, a recent, but
rapidly expanding, alternative land use. We compare impacts of these land uses upon mammals, birds, reptiles and
frogs at a site in north-eastern Australia, with sampling from 24 quadrats stratified by four landscape positions (upper
slope to riparian) and three current land-use types (pastoralism, military training and undisturbed). Prior to
exclusion in 1967, the whole study area had been subjected to grazing over the course of approximately 100 years,
so differences observed strictly reflect responses to changed land use (largely cessation from grazing) over the period
of 32 years subsequent to the imposition of the present regime. The four classes of vertebrates showed contrasting
responses. Frog distribution was unrelated to land use, but strongly associated with landscape position. Reptiles
showed a very strong response to land-use type but not to landscape position. The total abundance and richness of
reptiles was greater in ungrazed (i.e. military and undisturbed) than in grazed quadrats. The total abundance and
species richness of birds varied strongly with landscape position but was unrelated to land use. However, many
individual bird species showed significant responses to land-use type, and bird species composition was significantly
related to both land-use type and landscape position. The richness of the mammal fauna was weakly related to
landscape position and not related to land-use type. A few individual mammal species showed significant responses
to either or both factors, but mammal species composition was significantly (albeit weakly) related only to land-use
type. With due regard to some interpretative constraints in the study design, and the history of the site prior to this
study, these results suggest that pastoralism leads to a substantial rearrangement of the vertebrate fauna, and
particularly so for reptiles and those mammals and birds associated with the ground and understorey layers. Given
the extent of pastoralism across the tropical savannas, these results suggest that this industry has contributed to major
and widespread change in the savanna fauna. In contrast to pastoralism, military land use (at least at the relatively
low intensity examined here) produced little change in vertebrate assemblages."
214,Soil faunal response to land use: effect of estuarine tideland reclamation on nematode communities,Scientific article,Applied Soil Ecology,"Effects of reclaiming estuarine tideland on soil fauna biodiversity were studied in the Yangtze river estuary of China, focusing on nematodes. The responses of the nematode community to the disturbance caused by reclamation can be summarized as: (1) there was no distinct decline in the density of nematodes, but the community structure changed greatly; (2) the proportions of plant feeders and omnivorous nematodes increased after reclamation, whereas the proportions of bacterial feeders and predators decreased; (3) more apparent patchiness of nematode distribution was found in the reclaimed terrestrial environment than in intertidal marshes. Generally, agrocenoses have been characterized by low proportions of predator-omnivores. Our study indicated that omnivorous dorylaimids can be markedly abundant in agroecosystems, depending on the annual crop rotation and tillage practices. The predominant trophic group in cultivated land shifted between omnivorous nematodes and plant feeders, implying that the food chain path changed with agricultural processes. The maturity index (MI) provides little information in the present study, probably because the MI value embraced information of many disturbances including vegetation succession and changes in soil features. The faunal profile, representing both enrichment and structural conditions, is believed to be effective and more informative for analyzing the nematode successional trends."
215,Land-use intensity affects range condition in arid to semi-arid Namibia,Scientific article,Journal of Arid Environments,"Range condition at sites of differing land-use intensity at a communal farm
was assessed. Vegetation, soil and termite parameters were tested for their
potential as indicators. The vegetation indicators did not discriminate
between two sites of high and low land-use intensity. However, the soil
fertility parameters provided interesting results. The phosphorus (P),
nitrogen (N), organic carbon (OC), light fraction (LF), C:N and C:LF data
indicate that nitrogen limitation is more critical under high land-use and
grazing pressure. Organic carbon levels are generally low but reduced to
critical levels under high land-use intensity; nutrients such as phosphorus and
nitrogen are conserved in the system, whereas organic carbon losses are high
and inputs low. The conversion of the ‘active carbon pool’ into the ‘slow
pool’, a prerequisite for long-term soil resilience, is not taking place under
high land-use intensity. Termites might play an important role in maintaining
range condition."
216,Relationship between land-use intensity and species richness and abundance of birds in Hungary,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","When Hungary, together with nine other central and eastern European countries, enters the European Union in 2004 two
major threats will arise to the birds inhabiting agricultural landscapes. Marginal agricultural land may be abandoned, while
the remaining area may suffer from intensification. To assess the effects of these threats breeding birds were monitored in
abandoned, extensively and intensively used vineyards and grasslands in Hungary using point counts to determine species
richness and density. Species numbers and bird density were highest in extensively used vineyards, while bird diversity
was highest in abandoned vineyards. Abandoned vineyards were rich in species and individuals, mainly woodland species,
whereas intensively used vineyards had both fewer species and individuals than the other two vineyard types. In grassland, four
management types were distinguished, abandoned, extensively, intensively grazed and both intensively grazed and fertilised
grassland. Extensive grassland harboured most species, bird density and diversity being highest at the abandoned site which
was covered by bushes and contained many non-grassland species. Intensively grazed fields had lower species numbers,
lower density and diversity than extensively grazed grassland but were still much more species rich and diverse than the
fertilised fields. Our results suggest that extensively used farmland holds the highest diversity and abundance of farmland
birds. Conservation efforts aimed at farmland birds should therefore focus on maintaining extensive farming systems."
217,Diversity of pselaphine beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae) in eastern Thailand,Scientific article,Entomological Science,"Pselaphine beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae) are cosmopolitan, species-rich, and yet poorly
studied, particularly in the tropics. We sampled beetles in three types of primary forest and two types of
disturbed forest habitats in eastern Thailand to assess the utility of pselaphine beetles as bioindicators of
forest disturbance. We simultaneously measured leaf litter mass, soil moisture, soil acidity and canopy cover
at each site to infer which environmental factors affect pselaphine beetle diversity and abundance. At each
site, pselaphine beetles were extracted from ten 1 m2 samples of leaf litter and soil with Tullgren funnels. We
sampled 1867 adult beetles representing six supertribes, 51 genera and 114 morphospecies; 7% of the genera
and 92% of the species were undescribed. Forest types differed significantly in species richness, abundance,
diversity and evenness. Primary forest had greater numbers of species and individuals, and higher diversity
indices (H′). Teak plantation and secondary forest had substantially fewer individuals and species of
pselaphine beetles. Species composition differed between primary and degraded forests. Canopy cover, soil
moisture, and leaf litter mass positively correlated with beetle species richness and abundance. Leaf litter
mass and soil moisture were the two most important factors affecting the diversity of pselaphine beetle
assemblages. Among the 114 morphospecies collected, 43 morphospecies were specific to two or three
habitats and 64 morphospecies were found only in a single habitat. Thus pselaphine beetles appear to have
rather narrow habitat requirements and their presence/absence was correlated with environmental differences.
These traits make pselaphine beetles a suitable bioindicator taxon for assessing forest litter diversity
and monitoring habitat change."
218,Bat diversity in tropical forest and agro-pastoral habitats within a protected area in the Philippines,Scientific article,Acta Chiropterologica,"Parks and other protected areas in tropical forests often include secondary forest, cropland, and pasture. Documentation of the impact of such anthropogenic disturbance is essential for effective management. We re-sampled bats within Mount. Isarog Natural Park (MINP), a protected area in southeastern Luzon, Philippines, seventeen years after a survey in old- and second-growth forest and ill agro-pastoral areas was conducted in 1988. By employing harp traps and a tunnel trap, in addition to mist nets as used ill the earlier study, we aimed to document species previously undetected by mist netting alone. We documented 26 bat species, seven of which were captured exclusively in harp, traps, and two that were only captured in a tunnel trap. This survey resulted in nine new records of bat species for MINP, bringing the total number to 30. We did not recapture four species documented in 1988, all of which were noted in that study as uncommon. Nineteen species were captured in agro-pastoral areas on the south slope, including two Hipposideros spp. not Captured at the forested sites."
219,"Dung Beetle Assemblages and Seasonality in Primary Forest and Forest Fragments on Agricultural Landscapes in Budongo, Uganda",Scientific article,Biotropica,"Very little is known about the diversity of arthropods in the fast-disappearing fragments of natural forests in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated: (1) the influence of forest fragment characteristics on dung beetle species richness, composition, abundance, and diversity; and (2) the relationship between dung beetle assemblages and rainfall pattern. Beetles were sampled through 12 mo using dung baited pitfall traps. A total of 18,073 dung beetles belonging to three subfamilies and 45 species were captured. The subfamily Scarabaeinae was the most abundant (99%) and species rich (89%). Fast-burying tunnellers (paracoprids) were the most dominant functional group. Catharsius sesostris, Copris nepos, and Heliocopris punctiventris were the three most abundant species, and had the highest contributions to dissimilarities between forests. With few exceptions, dung beetle abundance, species richness, and diversity were generally higher in larger forest fragments (100-150 ha) than in smaller ones (10-50 ha) and the nature reserve (1042 ha). Forest fragment size had a highly significant positive relationship with beetle abundance, but only when the nature reserve is excluded in the analysis. Dung beetle abundance and species richness showed direct weak relationships with litter depth (positive) and groundcover (negative) but not tree density, tree species richness, and fragment isolation distance. Dung beetle abundance and species richness were strongly correlated with monthly changes in rainfall. Results of this study indicate that forest fragments on agricultural lands in the Budongo landscape, especially medium-sized (100-150 ha) ones, represent important conservation areas for dung beetles."
220,Hunting for Sustainability in Tropical Secondary Forests,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"The interaction between land-use change and the sustainability of hunting is poorly understood
but is critical for sustaining hunted vertebrate populations and a protein supply for the rural poor. We
investigated sustainability of hunting in an Amazonian landscape mosaic, where a small human population
had access to large areas of both primary and secondary forest. Harvestable production ofmammals and birds
was calculated from density estimates. We compared production with offtake from three villages and used
catch-per-unit-effort as an independent measure of prey abundance. Most species were hunted unsustainably
in primary forest, leading to local depletion of the largest primates and birds. The estimated sustainable
supply of wild meat was higher for primary (39 kg · km−2 · yr−1) than secondary forest (22 kg · km−2 ·
yr−1) because four species were absent and three species at low abundance in secondary forests. Production
of three disturbance-tolerant mammal species was 3 times higher in secondary than in primary forest, but
hunting led to overexploitation of one species. Our data suggest that an average Amazonian smallholder
would require ≥3.1 km2 of secondary regrowth to ensure a sustainable harvest of forest vertebrates. We
conclude that secondary forests can sustainably provide only 2% of the required protein intake of Amazonian
smallholders and are unlikely to be sufficient for sustainable hunting in other tropical forest regions"
221,"Diversity and similarity of butterfly communities in five different habitat types at Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam",Scientific article,Journal of Zoology,"Diversity and similarity of butterfly communities were assessed in five different habitat types (from natural closed forest to agricultural lands) in the mountains of Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam for 3 years from 2002 to 2004. The line transect count was used to record species richness and abundance of butterfly communities in the different habitat types. For each habitat, the number of species and individuals, and indices of species richness, evenness and diversity of butterfly communities were calculated. The results indicated that species richness and abundance of butterfly communities were low in the natural closed forest, higher in the disturbed forest, highest in the forest edge, lower in the shrub habitat and lowest in the agricultural lands. The indices of species richness, evenness and diversity of butterfly communities were low in agricultural lands and natural closed forest but highest in the forest edge and shrub habitats. The families Satyridae and Amathusiidae have the greatest species richness and abundance in the natural closed forest, with a reduction in their species richness and abundance from the natural closed forest to the agricultural lands. Species composition of butterfly communities was different among five different habitat types (40%), was similar in habitats outside the forest (68%) and was similar in habitats inside the forest (63%). Diversity and abundance of butterfly communities are not different between the natural closed forest and the agriculture lands, but species composition changed greatly between these habitat types. A positive correlation between the size of species geographical distribution range and increasing habitat disturbance was found. The most characteristic natural closed forest species have the smallest geographical distribution range."
222,"Orangutan population density, forest structure and fruit availability in hand-logged and unlogged peat swamp forests in West Kalimantan, Indonesia",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"We investigated the population density of Bornean orangutans Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus and aspects of habitat quality in a
selectively hand-logged peat swamp forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, and in a comparable unlogged forest nearby. We conducted
orangutan nest surveys, measured different parameters of forest structure, recorded monthly changes in fruit availability,
and noted the sex and the stage of maturity of orangutans encountered. Nest density, an index of orangutan population density,
was 21% lower in the logged area. The forest, logged 2 years previously, had fewer large food trees and a greater number of canopy
gaps. We discuss these differences in relation to the lower orangutan nest density in the logged forest. Significantly fewer adult
orangutans were observed in the logged study area. We hypothesize that fully adult orangutans, particularly females, are the most
severely affected by hand-logging."
223,How does landscape context contribute to effects of habitat fragmentation on diversity and population density of butterflies?,Scientific article,Journal of Biogeography,"Aim Studies on habitat fragmentation of insect communities mostly ignore the impact
of the surrounding landscape matrix and treat all species equally. In our study, on
habitat fragmentation and the importance of landscape context, we expected that
habitat specialists are more affected by area and isolation, and habitat generalists more
by landscape context.
Location and methods The study was conducted in the vicinity of the city of Go¨ ttingen
in Germany in the year 2000. We analysed butterfly communities by transect counts on
thirty-two calcareous grasslands differing in size (0.035.14 ha), isolation index (2100
86,000/edge-to-edge distance 551894 m), and landscape diversity (ShannonWiener:
0.091.56), which is correlated to percentage grassland in the landscape.
Results A total of 15,185 butterfly specimens belonging to fifty-four species are recorded.
In multiple regression analysis, the number of habitat specialist (n ¼ 20) and
habitat generalist (n ¼ 34) butterfly species increased with habitat area, but z-values
(slopes) of the speciesarea relationships for specialists (z ¼ 0.399) were significantly
steeper compared with generalists (z ¼ 0.096). Generalists, but not specialists,
showed a marginally significant increase with landscape diversity. Effects of landscape
diversity were scale-dependent and significant only at the smallest scale (landscape
context within a 250 m radius around the habitat). Habitat isolation was not related
to specialist and generalist species numbers. In multiple regression analysis the density
of specialists increased significantly with habitat area, whereas generalist density increased
only marginally. Habitat isolation and landscape diversity did not show any
effects.
Main conclusions Habitat area was the most important predictor of butterfly community
structure and influenced habitat specialists more than habitat generalists. In
contrast to our expectations, habitat isolation had no effect as most butterflies could
cope with the degree of isolation in our study region. Landscape diversity appeared to be
important for generalist butterflies only."
224,"Determination of ape distribution and population size using ground and aerial surveys: a case study with orang-utans in lower Kinabatangan, Sabah, Malaysia",Scientific article,Animal Conservation,"Because of the difficulties encountered in detecting many large tropical forest-dwelling species in their natural habitat, precise figures concerning the distribution, number and trends of many populations remain deficient. In tropical forests, ground surveys are generally carried out by counting objects along straight lines. These counts require a strict compliance with the line-transect methodology before (proper design of the census), during (careful data collection) and after (accurate and correct data processing and analysis) the census itself. In addition, the major source of bias when estimating population size and/or trends comes from the extrapolation of estimates obtained in small sampling areas to the larger, and often incompletely known, distribution of the population. In the Kinabatangan floodplain (Sabah, Malaysia), helicopter surveys were useful in directly assessing the distribution of orang-utans and were a major advantage in the precise estimation of the size of the orang-utan population surviving in this region. Our survey showed that about 1100 orang-utans remain in the multiple-use forests of the Kinabatangan floodplain. These results provide new evidence on orang- utan adaptation to habitat disturbance and indicate the potential of the Kinabatangan multiple-use forests for orang-utan conservation. Helicopter surveys appear to be a promising alternative to ground survey for precise distribution assessment and for monitoring population trends of apes throughout their entire range in Asia and in some parts of Africa."
225,"Diversity and community composition of butterflies and odonates in an ENSO-induced fire affected habitat mosaic: a case study from East Kalimantan, Indonesia",Scientific article,Oikos,"Little is known about the diversity of tropical animal communities in recently fireaffected
environments. Here we assessed species richness, evenness, and community
similarity of butterflies and odonates in landscapes located in unburned isolates and
burned areas in a habitat mosaic that was severely affected by the 1997/98 ENSO (El
Nino Southern Oscillation) event in east Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. In addition
related community similarity to variation in geographic distance between sampling sites
and the habitat/vegetation structure Species richness and evenness differed significantly
among landscapes but there was no congruence between both taxa. The species
richness of butterflies was, for example, highest in sites located in a very large unburned
isolate whereas odonate species richness was highest in sites located in a small
unburned isolate and once-burned forest. We also found substantial variation in the
habitat/vegetation structure among landscapes but this was mainly due to variation
between unburned and burned landscapes and variation among burned landscapes.
Both distance and environment (habitat/vegetation) contributed substantially to
explaining variation in the community similarity (beta diversity) of both taxa. The
contribution of the environment was, however, mainly due to variation between
unburned and burned landscapes, which contained very different assemblages of both
taxa. Sites located in the burned forest contained assemblages that were intermediate
between assemblages from sites in unburned forest and sites from a highly degraded
slash-and-burn area indicating that the burned forest was probably recolonised by
species from these disparate environments. We, furthermore, note that in contrast to
species richness (alpha diversity) the patterns of community similarity (beta diversity)
were highly congruent between both taxa. These results indicate that community-wide
multivariate measures of beta diversity are more consistent among taxa and more
reliable indicators of disturbance, such as ENSO-induced burning, than univariate
measures."
226,"Effects of habitat area, isolation, and landscape diversity on plant species richness of calcareous grasslands",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Calcareous grasslands harbour a high biodiversity, but are highly fragmented and endangered
in central Europe. We tested the relative importance of habitat area, habitat isolation, and landscape
diversity for species richness of vascular plants. Plants were recorded on 31 calcareous grasslands in the
vicinity of the city of Go¨ttingen (Germany) and were divided into habitat specialist and generalist
species. We expected that habitat specialists were more affected by area and isolation, and habitat
generalists more by landscape diversity. In multiple regression analysis, the species richness of habitat
specialists (n¼66 species) and habitat generalists (n¼242) increased with habitat area, while habitat
isolation or landscape diversity did not have significant effects. Contrary to predictions, habitat specialists
were not more affected by reduced habitat area than generalists. This may have been caused by
delayed extinction of long-living plant specialists in small grasslands. Additionally, non-specialists may
profit more from high habitat heterogeneity in large grasslands compared to habitat specialists. Although
habitat isolation and landscape diversity revealed no significant effect on local plant diversity, only an
average of 54% of habitat specialists of the total species pool were found within one study site. In
conclusion, habitat area was important for plant species conservation, but regional variation between
habitats contributed also an important 46% of total species richness."
227,Species diversity and habitat fragmentation: frogs in a tropical montane landscape in Mexico,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"We evaluate the alpha (within patch species richness), beta (spatial turnover among patches) and gamma (landscape) diversity
of frogs in a tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in central Veracruz, Mexico in order to assess (1) the influence of forest
fragmentation on frog assemblages, (2) the importance to diversity of the various elements of the landscape matrix, including the
shaded coffee plantations and cattle pastures that surround TMCF and (3) to identify the frog guilds most affected by habitat
transformation. We sampled ten sites between May 1998 and November 2000: five TMCF fragments and five anthropogenic
habitats. For the entire landscape, we registered 21 species belonging to six families. 100% of these were found in the TMCF
fragments and 62% in the surrounding mosaic of anthropogenic habitats. Gamma diversity (g) is determined to a greater extent by
species exchange (b) than by local species richness (a). Elevational variation, the degree of conservation of the vegetation canopy
and fragment size appear to determine the species diversity of this landscape. Large species, terrestrial species, those whose eggs
develop outside water, and those whose larvae develop in the water seemed to be most affected by habitat transformation. On its
own, even the largest and most species-rich cloud forest fragment is not capable of preserving the current anuran diversity. Neither
are the shaded coffee plantations that are interspersed among and link the patches of TMCF. However together they form a diverse
system of habitats crucial to species conservation in this landscape."
228,Life after logging: Post-logging recovery of a neotropical bat community,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. There is considerable debate about whether tropical forests can be managed for tim- ber production and to conserve biodiversity. Few sustainable forestry systems have been evaluated adequately in this respect. Microchiropteran bats may be model taxa for this purpose. They are an important component of mammalian diversity, play key roles in forest dynamics and are indicators of disturbance in neotropical forests.
2. We investigated the effect of Trinidads periodic block system (PBS) on bat species diversity and community organization. PBS is a polycyclic system of selective logging with a 30-year harvesting rotation. We captured bats in primary forest and PBS-managed forest logged 33, 31, 21, 20 and 10 years previously.
3. Selective logging did not affect species diversity but did affect community structure. Frugivorous bats were significantly more abundant in logged forest whereas gleaning animalivores were more abundant in primary forest, suggesting that frugivores bene- fited and gleaning animalivores were adversely affected by logging.
4. The bat community showed evidence of recovery. The number of years since forest disturbance was positively correlated with the abundance and number of species of gleaning animalivores and negatively correlated with the proportional abundance of the most common species. Gleaning animalivores increased in abundance with forest regen- eration, whereas the community became less dominated by a single generalist frugivore. 5. Synthesis and applications. PBS selective logging appears to be compatible with the conservation of bat diversity. This provides evidence that neotropical forests can be managed for timber production in an ecologically sustainable way and that significant biodiversity conservation efforts can occur outside national parks and nature reserves in areas set aside for sustainable development. PBS could serve as a basic blueprint for sustainable forestry in the Guianan Shield where there are forests similar in species composition to those of Trinidad. Key attributes that could be adopted by many tropical countries to manage their forests in an ecologically sustainable way are a low intensity harvest, a long rotation and multiple controls on harvesting."
229,Conservation of Vascular Epiphyte Diversity in Mexican Coffee Plantations,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"Coffee plantations have replaced many lower-montane forests in the Neotropics, and ongoing intensification is converting traditional polycultures with a variety of shade trees to plantations with no or monospecific shade trees. To evaluate the impact of coffee cultivation on epiphyte diversity, I surveyed vascular epiphytes on shade trees in nine different coffee plantations and compared records with those in four natural forests in central Veracruz, Mexico. Eighty-nine species occurred in coffee plantations, and 104 species occurred in natural forests. The number of epiphytic species in traditional polycultures with old shade trees, mostly of the genus Inga, was similar to that in forests, but plantations with small trees and sparse shade hosted fewer epiphytes than those with large trees. Epiphyte communities were, however, more homogeneous in coffee plantations than in forests, possibly because of a drier microclimate and the lack of large and long-lived trees. These results demonstrate the value of traditional polycultures for epiphyte diversity, show the importance of conserving large shade trees, and suggest that these coffee systems may not be suitable for all epiphytes."
230,"Tree diversity in primary forest and different land use systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"We studied the tree communities in primary forest and three different land use systems (forest
gardens, ca. 5-year-old secondary forests, cacao plantations) at 9001200m elevation in the environs of
Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi. The primary forests had ca. 150 tree species 10 cm
diameter at breast height (dbh) per hectare, which is unusually high for forests at this elevation in
southeast Asia. Basal area in the primary forest was 140m2 ha1, one of the highest values ever recorded
in tropical forests worldwide. Tree species richness declined gradually from primary forest to forest
gardens, secondary forests, and cacao plantations. This decline was paralleled by shifts in tree family
composition, with Lauraceae, Meliaceae, and Euphorbiaceae being predominant in primary forests, Euphorbiaceae,
Rubiaceae and Myristicaeae dominating in the forest gardens and Euphorbiaceae, Urticaceae,
and Ulmaceae in the secondary forests. Cacao plantations were composed almost exclusively of cacao
trees and two species of legume shade trees. Forest gardens further differed from primary forests by a
much lower density of understorey trees, while secondary forests had fewer species of commercial
interest. Comparative studies of birds and butterflies demonstrated parallel declines of species richness,
showing the importance of trees in structuring tropical forest habitats and in providing resources."
231,"Effects of biomass extraction on vegetation structure, diversity and composition of forests in Sariska Tiger Reserve, India",Scientific article,Environmental Conservation,"Despite the fact that tropical dry forests are being exploited on a large scale for various forest products, there has been limited evaluation of the accom- panying ecological impacts. In particular, there is no information on the effects of widespread biomass extraction such as grazing and firewood collection. A study was carried out in Sariska Tiger Reserve in northern India, to investigate the effects of biomass extraction on forest vegetation composition, diversity and structure. Biomass extraction caused significant changes in forest vegetation structure and species composition in the tree layer but the extent of these changes varied across the three major vegetation types found in the Reserve. Anogeissus-dominated slope forest showed significantly lower mean canopy cover, tree density, tree basal area and height of trees in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Riparian forest showed lower mean canopy cover, tree basal areas and number of recorded tree species in disturbed sites. Scrub forest had lower mean canopy cover, tree basal area and tree height. There were fewer tall trees but greater number of short trees in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types. Girths of trees similarly shifted towards lower values in riparian and scrub forest. In Anogeissus-dominated forest, disturbed and undisturbed sites did not differ in proportions of trees in various girth-classes. Tree species richness was substantially lower in disturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated and riparian forest in comparison to undisturbed sites, but was not affected by disturbance in scrub forest. Understorey species richness was higher in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types but understorey changed structurally only in Anogeissus-dominated forest. Overall tree and understorey species composition was significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated forest, but was unchanged in scrub and riparian forest. Observed changes in vegetation structure, diversity and composition of the different vegetation types due to biomass extraction have implications for biodiversity conservation in tropical dry forest ecosystems, and need to be addressed in future forest management planning."
232,Burning and logging differentially affect endemic vs. widely distributed butterfly species in Borneo,Scientific article,Diversity and Distributions,"We assess the differential impact of logging and ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation)-
induced disturbance on the relative butterfly abundance and species richness of
range-restricted and widespread species within the island of Borneo. Relative abundance
and species richness were assessed using rarefaction and species accumulation
curves in unburned isolates surrounded by burned forest, the burned forest itself,
and continuous forest unaffected by ENSO-induced disturbance in addition to
logged and unlogged landscapes in unburned forest. The relative abundance of
endemics was significantly higher in unlogged forest than logged forest and significantly
higher in unburned forest than burned forest. Rarefied species richness of
range categories was similar (Bornean endemics) or higher (other categories) in
selectively logged than unlogged forest. In contrast, rarefied species richness of
range-restricted species was highest in continuous forest, intermediate in unburned
isolates, and lowest in burned forest. Only two individuals of a single Bornean
endemic species were found in all the burned forest. Although species richness was
higher in all range categories in continuous forest than in unburned isolates and
in burned forest, the difference was most pronounced for range-restricted species.
Logging and ENSO-induced fires thus have contrasting effects on range-restricted
species. While both increase the relative abundance of widely distributed species at
the expense of range-restricted species, only ENSO-induced disturbance lowers the
rarefied number of restricted range species. Our research highlights the threat that
severe ENSO events pose to geographically restricted classes of biodiversity."
233,"Arthropod Diversity in Lama Forest Reserve (South Benin), a Mosaic of Natural, Degraded and Plantation Forests",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Arthropod assemblages were examined in Lama forest reserve, a protected area situated in the Dahomey gap, southern Benin, composed of plantations, degraded forest and remnants of natural forest. The objectives were to compare assemblages in relation to forest type and use, to elucidate the value of forest plantations for biodiversity conservation and to identify indicator species for specific forest habitats. Arthropods were collected over an 11-month period, using standardized sets of traps (pitfall, emergence, Malaise and flight intercept traps). Nine different habitats were studied, including natural and degraded forest, forest plantations (Tectona grandis and Senna siamea) of different age, and isolated forest fragments. Our analysis focused on detritivorous and xylophagous arthropods but also included ground beetles and heteropterans, totalling 393 species. We found no differences in species richness among natural and degraded forest habitats in the centre of the reserve (Noyau central). Outside of the Noyau central, species richness was highest in old teak plantations and isolated forest fragments and lowest in young teak and fuelwood plantations. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) separated three main groups: (1) natural forest, (2) degraded forest and young plantations, and (3) old plantations and isolated forest fragments. Multiple regression of DCA scores of the first two axes on environmental variables identified one natural and three disturbance-related predictors of arthropod assemblages in Lama forest: soil type (texture), canopy height, naturalness (proportion of Guineo-Congolian plant species) and understorey vegetation cover. We identified 15 indicator species for six different forest habitats. The highest numbers were found in abandoned settlements and old teak plantations. b-diversity was similar among the three DCA ordination groups (degraded forest excluded). Values for b-diversity were relatively high, suggesting that all major forest habitats contribute significantly to regional species pools and should therefore be protected. To enhance arthropod diversity, we propose that management practices in Lama forest should aim to encourage the development of species-rich understorey vegetation of the Guineo-Congolian phyto- geographical region."
234,Short-term responses of birds to forest gaps and understory: An assessment of reduced-impact logging in a lowland Amazon forest,Scientific article,Biotropica,"We studied physiognomy‐specific (i.e., gaps vs. understory) responses of birds to low harvest (18.7 m3/ha), reduced‐impact logging by comparing 3500 mist net captures in control and cut blocks of an Amazonian terra firme forest in Brazil at 20–42 mo postharvest. Species richness did not differ significantly between control (92 species) and cut (85) forest based on rarefaction to 1200 captures. Fifty‐six percent of all species were shared between control and cut forest, compared to the 64 percent shared between control blocks. Higher captures of nectarivores and frugivores in cut forest likely occurred as a consequence of postharvest resource blooms. Higher captures of some insectivores in cut as compared to control forest were unexpected, attributable to increased wandering or shifts from association with midstory to understory as a consequence of habitat alteration. Logging influenced capture rates for 21 species, either consistently, or via positive interaction with physiognomy or time (13 species higher in cut forest and 8 species higher in control forest). Cut understory sites had lower diversity (H′) and scaled dominance than understory and gap sites in control forest. Temporal changes in captures may have resulted from successional dynamics in cut forest: two guilds and three species increased in abundance. Increases in abundances of guilds and particular species were more prevalent in control than in cut forest, suggesting that logging displaced birds to control forest. In general, the effects of logging were relatively minor; low harvest rates and reduced‐impact methods may help to retain aspects of avian biodiversity in Amazon forest understories."
235,"The value of primary, secondary and plantation forests for fruit-feeding butterflies in the Brazilian Amazon",Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1.
Secondary forests growing on cleared lands and tree plantations are becoming
increasingly widespread land-uses in the tropics. Previous studies are divided on the
conservation importance of these habitats for tropical forest butterflies.
2.
We use a robust sampling design, accounting for both seasonality and vertical
stratification, to examine fruit-feeding butterflies (Nymphalidae) in patches of
secondary forest and
Eucalyptus
plantation 23 orders of magnitude larger than those
previously sampled.
3.
We recorded 10 587 butterflies and 128 species in 3200 trap-days. Species richness
was highest in primary forest and lowest in plantations, while butterfly abundance showed
the opposite response. All habitats were distinct in terms of community structure.
4.
There was a significant interaction between habitat and season based on richness and
abundance metrics, although not based on community structure. Secondary forest
exhibited higher observed richness than primary forest in the peak of the dry-season,
but not at other times of the year. This observation could explain the lack of consensus
in previous studies, as those reporting higher richness in secondary forest only sampled
during the dry-season.
5.
In general, habitat quality appeared to be more important than the surrounding
landscape in determining butterfly community structure. However, the community
structure of the strong-flying Charaxinae was related to the amount of primary forest in
surrounding landscape. There was very poor congruence between the response patterns
of richness and abundance among different butterfly subfamilies.
6.
Linear regressions between resource availability and butterfly abundance showed a
strong influence of leaf phenology in both primary and secondary forest, but no influence
of fruit phenology.
7.
Synthesis and applications
: A lack of seasonal replication and small sampling sizes
may have led previous studies to over-emphasize the conservation importance of
secondary forest and plantations for butterflies. We show that these habitats are significantly
poorer than primary forest in terms of number of species, and hold distinct butterfly
communities. Although quantifying the number of species restricted to primary
forest remains difficult, these results cast doubt on the presumption that secondary
habitats will provide refuge for many of the species being lost through deforestation. We
therefore strongly urge measures that prioritize the conservation of remaining primary
forests where they still exist."
236,Bird assemblages in secondary forests developing after slash-and-burn agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon,Scientific article,Journal of Tropical Ecology,"Although indigenous farmers and other traditional peoples have disturbed Amazonian forests for centuries,
few studies investigate the effects of these disturbances on biodiversity. This short-term study investigates how bird
assemblages are affected by agricultural practices adopted by the residents of a national park in the Brazilian Amazon.
Twelve sites in secondary forest (four sites in three age categories) and 12 sites in primary forest were selected
for bird sampling. Audio-visual censuses of birds were conducted in small plots (1 ha) of young secondary growth
(45 y), middle-aged (715 y), and old (2035 y) secondary forests. Each site in secondary forest had a corresponding
control site in adjacent primary forest. Young secondary growth had fewer species than old secondary and primary
forests. Bird species richness was similar inmiddle-aged, old secondary and primary forests. Bird communities of young
secondary habitat were dominated by species normally found in open habitats, such as agricultural fields and igap´o
flooded forests. The bird species composition of young secondary growth was more similar to that ofmiddle-aged forest,
which in turn was more similar to that of old secondary forests. Bird species composition differed between young
secondary growth and old secondary forests and primary forests and between middle-aged secondary and primary
forests. Nectarivore/insectivores and frugivore/insectivores of monospecific flocks are significantly associated with
secondary forests, especially in initial stages of forest regeneration. In contrast, specialized insectivorous birds that join
mixed-flocks show a significant association with primary forest."
237,The contribution of cacao agroforests to the conservation of lower canopy ant and beetle diversity in Indonesia,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The ongoing destruction of tropical rainforests has increased the interest in the
potential value of tropical agroforests for the conservation of biodiversity. Traditional,
shaded agroforests may support high levels of biodiversity, for some groups even
approaching that of undisturbed tropical forests. However, it is unclear to what extent
forest fauna is represented in this diversity and how management affects forest fauna in
agroforests. We studied lower canopy ant and beetle fauna in cacao agroforests and forests
in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, a region dominated by cacao agroforestry. We compared
ant and beetle species richness and composition in forests and cacao agroforests and
studied the impact of two aspects of management intensification (the decrease in shade tree
diversity and in shade canopy cover) on ant and beetle diversity. The agroforests had three
types of shade that represented a decrease in tree diversity (high, intermediate and low
diversity). Species richness of ants and beetles in the canopies of the cacao trees was
similar to that found in lower canopy forest trees. However, the composition of ant and
beetle communities differed greatly between the agroforest and forest sites. Forest beetles
suffered profoundly from the conversion to agroforests: only 12.5% of the beetle species
recorded in the forest sites were also found in the agroforests and those species made up
only 5% of all beetles collected from cacao. In contrast, forest ants were well represented
in agroforests, with 75% of all species encountered in the forest sites also occurring on
cacao. The reduction of shade tree diversity had no negative effect on ants and beetles on
cacao trees. Beetle abundances and non-forest ant species richness even increased with
decreasing shade tree diversity. Thinning of the shade canopy was related to a decrease in
richness of forest ant species on cacao trees but not of beetles. The contrasting responses of
ants and beetles to shade tree management emphasize that conservation plans that focus on
one taxonomic group may not work for others. Overall ant and beetle diversity can remain
high in shaded agroforests but the conservation of forest ants and beetles in particular
depends primarily on the protection of natural forests, which for forest ants can be complemented
by the conservation of adjacent shaded cacao agroforests."
238,Harvestmen in an Atlantic forest fragmented landscape: Evaluating assemblage response to habitat quality and quantity,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Despite the importance of considering arthropods in monitoring programs and conserva- tion planning given their diversity in terrestrial ecosystems and potential in revealing environmental disturbances, most studies on the effects of habitat disturbances in trop- ical forests focused on vertebrates, plants and a few arthropod groups. By sampling 16 sites evenly distributed in four habitat categories (continuous mature and secondary for- est and large and small secondary forest fragments), we investigated how harvestmen (Opiliones), which represent the third largest order of arachnids and have been poorly studied in tropical forests, are affected by habitat quality and quantity. Richness and abundance of rare species were strongly affected by habitat quality (first axis of principal component analysis on forest structure), increasing in less disturbed/mature forests. Richness, total abundance, abundance of rare species and of one of the three common species were higher in continuous forest, while only total abundance differed between large and small fragments. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that just one species increased in abundance in fragments, while several
others were associated with continuous and/or mature forest and that harvestman composition did not vary between large and small fragments. Our results suggest that harvestmen (1) are strongly affected by habitat quality and quantity, probably because, compared to other arthropod groups, they are relatively uniform in some relevant biological aspects (nocturnal predators dependent on microclimatic conditions that present low vagility); (2) are probably more indicative of intermediate-level disturbances, given the absence of species associated with highly-disturbed areas."
239,"Quantifying the biodiversity value of tropical primary, secondary, and plantation forests",Scientific article,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Biodiversity loss from deforestation may be partly offset by the
expansion of secondary forests and plantation forestry in the
tropics. However, our current knowledge of the value of these
habitats for biodiversity conservation is limited to very few taxa,
and many studies are severely confounded by methodological
shortcomings. We examined the conservation value of tropical
primary, secondary, and plantation forests for 15 taxonomic
groups using a robust and replicated sample design that minimized
edge effects. Different taxa varied markedly in their response to
patterns of land use in terms of species richness and the percentage
of species restricted to primary forest (varying from 5% to 57%),
yet almost all between-forest comparisons showed marked differences
in community structure and composition. Cross-taxon congruence
in response patterns was very weak when evaluated using
abundance or species richness data, but much stronger when using
metrics based upon community similarity. Our results show that,
whereas the biodiversity indicator group concept may hold some
validity for several taxa that are frequently sampled (such as birds
and fruit-feeding butterflies), it fails for those exhibiting highly
idiosyncratic responses to tropical land-use change (including
highly vagile species groups such as bats and orchid bees), highlighting
the problems associated with quantifying the biodiversity
value of anthropogenic habitats. Finally, although we show that
areas of native regeneration and exotic tree plantations can
provide complementary conservation services, we also provide
clear empirical evidence demonstrating the irreplaceable value of
primary forests."
240,Impacts of El Nino related drought and forest fires on sun bear fruit resources in lowland dipterocarp forest of East Borneo,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Droughts and forest fires, induced by the El Nin o/Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) event, have increased considerably over the last decades affecting millions
of hectares of rainforest. We investigated the effects of the 19971998 forest fires and
drought, associated with an exceptionally severe ENSO event, on fruit species
important in the diet of Malayan sun bears (Helarctos malayanus) in lowland dipterocarp
forest, East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. Densities of sun bear fruit
trees (10 cm DBH) were reduced by ~80%, from 167±41 (SD) fruit trees ha1 in
unburned forest to 37±18 fruit trees ha1 in burned forest. Densities of hemi-epiphytic
figs, one of the main fallback resources for sun bears during periods of food
scarcity, declined by 95% in burned forest. Species diversity of sun bear food trees
decreased by 44% in burned forest. Drought also affected sun bear fruit trees in
unburned primary forest, with elevated mortality rates for the duration of 2 years,
returning to levels reported as normal in region in the third year after the ENSO
event. Mortality in unburned forest near the burn-edge was higher (25±5% of trees
10 cm DBH dead) than in the forest interior (14±5% of trees), indicating possible
edge effects. Combined effects of fire and drought in burned primary forest resulted
in an overall tree mortality of 78±11% (10 cm DBH) 33 months after the fire event.
Disturbance due to fires has resulted in a serious decline of fruit resources for sun
bears and, due to the scale of fire damage, in a serious decline of prime sun bear
habitat. Recovery of sun bear populations in these burned-over forests will depend
on regeneration of the forest, its future species composition, and efforts to prevent
subsequent fire events."
241,"The importance of cenotes in conserving bat assemblages in the Yucatan, Mexico",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"In the Yucatan, cenotes or water sinkholes formed by the dissolution of limestone and sur- rounded with a characteristic dense layer of heterogeneous vegetation, are the main sources of water for plant and animal assemblages. We investigated their importance to bats by comparing the assemblage structure and diversity between tropical forest and pas- tureland, with and without cenotes. We set ground level mist nets, sub-canopy nets and harp traps for 96 nights and caught 2819 bats of 26 species and six families. Forest had a greater bat species diversity and abundance than pastureland, as well as rare and threa- tened species. In forest, sites with and without cenotes had a similar bat assemblage struc- ture and diversity, whereas in pastureland there was a greater species diversity and abundance and number of rare and threatened species at cenotes than sites without cen- otes. Chrotopterus auritus and Micronycteris schmidtorum, both threatened in Mexico, and Eptesicus furinalis, were exclusively captured at cenotes. We suggest that it may be the vege- tation around cenotes rather than the water bodies per se that attracts many bat species in pastureland. Cenotes are threatened by nitrate contamination from untreated domestic and animal waste and fertilizers and the removal of vegetation to allow livestock access to water. In Yucatans agricultural landscapes, protection of cenotes and their characteristic vegetation is key not only for bat conservation but also because they represent potential seed sources for the regeneration of the lowland forest, in which bats play key roles as poll- inators and seed dispersers."
242,Satellite detection of bird communities in tropical countryside,Scientific article,Ecological Applications,"The future of biodiversity hinges partly on realizing the potentially high
conservation value of human-dominated countryside. The characteristics of the countryside
that promote biodiversity preservation remain poorly understood, however, particularly at the
fine scales at which individual farmers tend to make land use decisions. To address this
problem, we explored the use of a rapid remote sensing method for estimating bird community
composition in tropical countryside, using a two-step process. First, we asked how finegrained
variation in land cover affected community composition. Second, we determined
whether the observed changes in community composition correlated with three easily
accessible remote sensing metrics (wetness, greenness, and brightness), derived from
performing a tasseled-cap transformation on a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
image. As a comparison, we also examined whether the most commonly used remote sensing
indicator in ecology, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), correlated with
community composition.
We worked within an agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica, where the land
comprised a complex and highly heterogeneous mosaic of remnant native vegetation, pasture,
coffee cultivation, and other crops. In this region, we selected 12 study sites (each ,60 ha) that
encompassed the range of available land cover possibilities in the countryside. Within each
site, we surveyed bird communities within all major land cover types, and we conducted
detailed field mapping of land cover.
We found that the number of forest-affiliated species increased with forest cover and
decreased with residential area across sites. Conversely, the number of agriculture-affiliated
species using forest increased with land area devoted to agricultural and residential uses.
Interestingly, we found that the wetness and brightness metrics predicted the number of
forest- and agriculture-affiliated species within a site as well as did detailed field-generated
maps of land cover. In contrast, NDVI and the closely correlated greenness metric did not
correlate with land cover or with bird communities. Our study shows the strong potential of
the tasseled-cap transformation as a tool for assessing the conservation value of countryside
for biodiversity."
243,"Effects of extractive disturbance on bird assemblages, vegetation structure and floristics in tropical scrub forest, Sariska Tiger Reserve, India",Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"A study was carried out in a tropical scrub forest in India, to investigate the effects of extractive activities such as fodder and firewood collection, on native bird communities and to study the relative influences of altered vegetation composition and structure. The study was based on comparison between six disturbed (extracted) and four undisturbed (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition. There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However, bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However, altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition. Partial Mantels tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition"
244,"Species richness, composition and abundance of fruit-feeding butterflies in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: comparison between a fragmented and a continuous landscape",Scientific article,Global Ecology and Biogeography,"Aim
To evaluate frugivorous butterflies as indicators of forest disturbance in the
Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
Location
The study area is located in the municipality of Cotia, São Paulo State,
south-eastern Brazil (23°35′−23°50′S, 46°45′−47°15′W).
Methods
Sampling was done at four sites inside a large forest block, the Morro
Grande State Reserve, and in five forest fragments in an adjacent fragmented landscape.
Butterflies were sampled with portable traps, baited with a fermented mixture
of banana and sugar cane juice. Sampling was carried out during the period most
favourable for the capture of frugivorous butterflies in south-eastern Brazil.
Results
All richness-related results indicated no effect of forest fragmentation on the
frugivorous butterfly guild, concurring with the suggestion of appreciable resistance
of Atlantic Forest butterflies to habitat modification. However, species composition
discriminated between the two landscapes, indicating that fragmentation may have
effects beyond simple species richness. When species were analysed individually,
clear patterns of distribution emerged, with some species that were very abundant in
the fragmented landscape being practically absent in the continuous landscape, and
vice versa. This pattern seems consistent even for some subfamilies.
Main conclusion
Our findings support the usefulness of the frugivorous butterfly
guild as a biological indicator of forest disturbance effects in one of the world’s most
threatened ecosystems."
245,Effects of rain forest logging on species richness and assemblage composition of small mammals in southwest Asia,Scientific article,Journal of Biogeography,"Aim The effects of logging and habitat degradation on the richness and abundance of small mammals in Asian rain forests are largely unknown. This work compares the species richness, dominance and evenness of small non-volant mammals between logged and unlogged forests, and assesses whether assemblage variability (b-diversity) is similar between forest types.
Location Southeast Asia, northern Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), Sunda-shelf.
Methods We surveyed species-rich assemblages of small non-volant mammals in three unlogged and three logged forests for 2 years. At each forest site, we sampled a permanently marked transect and two additional sites in three trapping sessions. All analyses were performed at both levels to include the effects of local abundances and point estimates, separately from the relative abundances of species on a more regional scale.
Results We trapped a total of 1218 individuals of 28 species. Eleven common species accounted for 95% of all captures. Species richness and diversity were significantly higher in unlogged forest (27 species) than in logged forest (17 species). This was mainly attributable to the smaller number of rarely recorded species in logged forest (five compared with 16 in unlogged forest, with a total of fewer than 10 captures). However, all common species were present in both logged and unlogged forests, and our analyses revealed similar patterns of dominance, evenness and fluctuations in abundance. Hence overall assemblage composition in multivariate space did not differ greatly between forest types. Assemblages of Muridae and Tupaiidae showed similar population fluctuations in space and time, indicating that the ecology of these taxa may be partially driven by the same environmental factors.
Main conclusions Although species were distributed patchily within sites, analyses at local and regional scales revealed similar patterns in diversity and assemblage variability, suggesting that effects of forest modification did not differ extensively locally and regionally, but had a profound effect on rare species. Our results emphasize the importance and conservation value of logged forest stands that are able to hold a large proportion of the small mammals also found in unlogged forests. Rare and more specialized species are more vulnerable to forest degradation than commonly caught species, resulting in the complete loss, or a decrease in numbers, of certain groups, such as arboreal small mammals and Viverridae."
246,Phyllostomid bats of lowland Amazonia: effects of habitat alteration on abundance,Scientific article,Biotropica,"Habitat fragmentation and conversion are among the human activities that pose the greatest threat to species persistence and conservation of biodiversity. This is particularly true in the Neotropics, where bats represent important components of biodiversity from taxonomic and functional perspectives, and provide critical ecosystem services (e.g., seed dispersal and pollination). We assessed the degree to which conversion of lowland Amazonian rain forest to agriculture, and its subsequent abandonment and secondary succession, affect the abundances of populations of phyllostomid bats in the vicinity of Iquitos, Peru ́. During 90,720 net-m-h of sampling, we captured 3789 bats of five families; of these 3764 were phyllostomids representing 44 species, 23 genera, and three feeding guilds. We focus on the 24 most abundant species of phyllostomids. In terms of abundance, frugivores dominated assemblages in all habitat types and seasons. Eight species consistently responded to habitat conversion, two species consistently responded to season, two species responded consistently to both habitat and season, and five species responded to habitat conversion in a season-specific manner. Frugivores and nectarivores were abundant in areas that had been converted to agriculture, which suggests that these bats are resilient to extant levels of disturbance and may be important in promoting secondary succession. However, this result may be scale- or context-dependent. If habitat conversion continues and dramatically reduces the areal extent and increases fragmentation of mature forest, then a complex metacommunity dynamic may characterize the region and source populations of bats may become threatened or extirpated locally."
247,Do secondary forests act as refuges for old growth forest animals? Recovery of ant diversity in the Atlantic forest of Brazil,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"The extent to which secondary forests occupying degraded and abandoned lands provide
suitable habitat for forest-adapted species is an important conservation issue in times of
vanishing old growth forests. We used ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a functionally
important and diverse group of invertebrates, to investigate the recovery of soil taxa during
secondary forest succession in the Atlantic Forest of Southern Brazil. We compared the
resilience of epigeic vs. hypogeic ant assemblages. For this purpose we established 27 sites
that encompassed a chronosequence from pastures to old growth forests on two contrasting
soil types. Our results are based on a collection of 35508 individuals in 40 genera.
Richness and composition of ant assemblages in secondary forests have recovered slowly
and have not approached conditions typical of old growth forests. The distribution of
genera along the successional stages was arranged in a nested pattern where ant genera
of younger successional stages were a subset of genera present in older stages. Edaphic
conditions had no influence on the recovery process. Overall, richness of ants was lower
at study sites with water-logged soils than at sites where soils did not exhibit hydromorphic
properties. The hypogeic ant assemblage recovered more slowly than the epigeic
assemblage.
Our results show that secondary forests do not act as refuges for many forest-adapted
animals which are currently restricted to discontinuous patches of old growth forest in
the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Moreover, estimated recovery times of 50
to several hundred years suggest it would take much longer than previously presumed
for complete recolonization."
248,Conservation value of forest plantations for bird communities in western Kenya,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Tree plantations of native and exotic species are frequently used to compensate for forest loss in the
tropics. However, these plantations may support lower species diversity and different communities than
natural forest. We therefore investigated bird communities in stands of natural forest, different types of
tree plantations and secondary forest in Kakamega Forest, western Kenya. Wecompared birds differing in
habitat specialisation, i.e. forest specialists, generalists, and visitors. We recorded significant differences
in mean species richness and number of individuals among the different forest types. Stands of natural
forest and plantations of indigenous tree species comprised more species and individuals than
plantations of exotic tree species and secondary forest. This was caused by a significant decline of forest
specialists and generalists from natural forest and indigenous plantations to exotic plantations and
secondary forest. Species composition of the bird communities did not differ between natural forest
stands and plantations of a mixture of indigenous tree species, but clearly changed between natural forest
and plantations of single tree species. These findings demonstrate that natural forest areas are needed for
the conservation of forest bird diversity, but that plantations with a mixture of indigenous tree species
can have similarly high conservation value."
249,Understanding the biodiversity consequences of habitat change: the value of secondary and plantation forests for neotropical dung beetles,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1.
Secondary and plantation forests are becoming increasingly widespread in the tropics. A recent
meta-analysis on the impacts of land-use change on tropical forest dung beetles concluded that
regenerating forests can be effective in helping to offset species loss following deforestation. However,
our understanding of the extent to which these results can be generalized to new locations
remains very poor.
2.
We attempted to overcome many of the design limitations that characterize previous studies by
collecting spatially independent dung beetle samples from primary, secondary and
Eucalyptus
plantation forests in north-east Brazilian Amazonia across a large quasi-experimental landscape
that minimized confounding edge and fragmentation effects.
3.
We recorded 9203 dung beetles, comprising 85 species. Species richness was significantly higher
in primary forest and the majority of species were more abundant there than elsewhere, whereas
secondary and plantation sites harboured an impoverished subset of primary forest species.
4.
Our data illustrate the low value of tropical secondary and plantation forests for dung beetles in
our study area, and our conclusions are more pessimistic than those of earlier studies.
5.
Because of differences in the order of species rank-abundance and rank-biomass patterns,
re-coding community data from abundance to biomass significantly altered the analytical weight of
individual species in determining community patterns. Larger bodied beetles were more prone to
local extinctions and abundance declines and this effect was consistent both within and between
genera.
6.
Synthesis and applications
. Our study demonstrates that secondary and plantation forests in a
large neotropical landscape host exceptionally impoverished dung beetle communities. Furthermore,
the depletion of beetle abundance combined with a reduction in average body mass in converted
forests is likely to have detrimental consequences for the maintenance of dung beetle-mediated
ecosystem services in these habitats. Differences in biogeographical and landscape context, and the
influence of common limitations in sampling design, may explain why many other studies have
painted a more optimistic picture of the conservation value of anthropogenic habitats. In the
absence of further evidence we caution strongly against the claim that forest regeneration schemes
on degraded land can effectively offset the loss of species following deforestation, and urge that
conservation strategies prioritize the protection of remaining areas of primary forest."
250,Tolerance of frugivorous birds to habitat disturbance in a tropical cloud forest,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"In view of the continued decline in tropical forest cover around the globe, forest restoration
has become a key tool in tropical rainforest conservation. One of the main  and least
expensive  restoration strategies is natural forest regeneration. By aiding forest seed influx
both into disturbed and undisturbed habitats, frugivorous birds facilitate forest regeneration.
This study focuses on the tolerance of a frugivorous bird community to anthropogenic
habitat disturbance within the broader context of natural forest regeneration with conservation
purposes. It was carried out in the tropical cloud forest of Costa Ricas Talamanca
Mountains. Bird community response and tolerance to habitat disturbance was assessed
by comparing bird presence and densities along a disturbance gradient, ranging from open
pastures to closed mature forests. Birds were censused along nine transects applying the
variable width line transect procedure. Forty relevant frugivorous bird species were
observed during 102 h of survey time. Densities were calculated for 33 species; nine species
responded negatively to increasing level of disturbance and nine others positively. Results
indicate that large frugivores are generally moderately tolerant to intermediate, but intolerant
to severe habitat disturbance, and that tolerance is often higher for medium and small
frugivores. It appears that moderately disturbed habitats in tropical cloud forests are highly
suitable for restoration through natural regeneration aided by frugivorous birds. Due to a
lack of large forest seed dispersers, severely disturbed habitats appear less suitable."
251,What loggers leave behind: Impacts on big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) commercial populations and potential for post-logging recovery in the Brazilian Amazon,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"The sustainability of current harvest practices for high-value Meliaceae can be assessed by quantifying logging intensity and projecting growth and survival by post-logging populations over anticipated intervals between harvests. From 100%-area inventories of big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) covering 204 ha or more at eight logged and unlogged forest sites across southern Brazilian Amazonia, we report generally higher landscape-scale densities and smaller population-level mean diameters in eastern forests compared to western forests, where most commercial stocks survive. Density of trees ≥20 cm diameter varied by two orders of magnitude and peaked at 1.17 ha−1. Size class frequency distributions appeared unimodal at two high-density sites, but were essentially amodal or flat elsewhere; diameter increment patterns indicate that populations were multi- or all-aged. At two high-density sites, conventional logging removed 93–95% of commercial trees (≥45 cm diameter at the time of logging), illegally eliminated 31–47% of sub-merchantable trees, and targeted trees as small as 20 cm diameter. Projected recovery by commercial stems during 30 years after conventional logging represented 9.9–37.5% of initial densities and was highly dependent on initial logging intensity and size class frequency distributions of commercial trees. We simulated post-logging recovery over the same period at all sites according to the 2003 regulatory framework for mahogany in Brazil, which raised the minimum diameter cutting limit to 60 cm and requires retention during the first harvest of 20% of commercial-sized trees. Recovery during 30 years ranged from approximately 0 to 31% over 20% retention densities at seven of eight sites. At only one site where sub-merchantable trees dominated the population did the simulated density of harvestable stems after 30 years exceed initial commercial densities. These results indicate that 80% harvest intensity will not be sustainable over multiple cutting cycles for most populations without silvicultural interventions ensuring establishment and long-term growth of artificial regeneration to augment depleted natural stocks, including repeated tending of outplanted seedlings. Without improved harvest protocols for mahogany in Brazil as explored in this paper, future commercial supplies of this species as well as other high-value tropical timbers are endangered. Rapid changes in the timber industry and land-use in the Amazon are also significant challenges to sustainable management of mahogany."
252,Pollen dispersal and genetic structure of the tropical tree Dipteryx panamensis in a fragmented Costa Rican landscape,Scientific article,Molecular Ecology,"In the face of widespread deforestation, the conservation of rainforest trees relies increasingly
on their ability to maintain reproductive processes in fragmented landscapes. Here, we
analysed nine microsatellite loci for 218 adults and 325 progeny of the tree Dipteryx
panamensis in Costa Rica. Pollen dispersal distances, genetic diversity, genetic structure
and spatial autocorrelation were determined for populations in four habitats: continuous
forest, forest fragments, pastures adjacent to fragments and isolated pastures. We predicted
longer but less frequent pollen movements among increasingly isolated trees. This pattern
would lead to lower outcrossing rates for pasture trees, as well as lower genetic diversity
and increased structure and spatial autocorrelation among their progeny. Results generally
followed these expectations, with the shortest pollen dispersal among continuous forest
trees (240 m), moderate distances for fragment (343 m) and adjacent pasture (317 m) populations,
and distances of up to 2.3 km in isolated pastures (mean: 557 m). Variance around
pollen dispersal estimates also increased with fragmentation, suggesting altered pollination
conditions. Outcrossing rates were lower for pasture trees and we found greater spatial
autocorrelation and genetic structure among their progeny, as well as a trend towards lower
heterozygosity. Paternal reproductive dominance, the pollen contributions from individual
fathers, did not vary among habitats, but we did document asymmetric pollen flow between
pasture and adjacent fragment populations. We conclude that long-distance pollen dispersal
helps maintain gene flow for D. panamensis in this fragmented landscape, but pasture and
isolated pasture populations are still at risk of long-term genetic erosion."
253,"Effects of rainforest fragmentation and shade-coffee plantations on spider communities in the Western Ghats, India",Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"Studies on the effects of tropical rainforest fragmentation and disturbance have often focussed on plants and vertebrates such as birds and mammals and seldom on invertebrates, despite the latter being among the most biologically diverse groups in these ecosystems. Spiders are one such group of invertebrate predators that are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems. The present study assesses the spider community structure and responses to rainforest fragmentation and degra- dation and conversion to shade-coffee plantations in the Anamalai hills, southern Western Ghats, India. Ten rainforest fragments ranging in size from 11 ha to 2,600 ha under varying levels of degradation within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and private lands of the Valparai plateau, and two shade-coffee plantation sites were sampled for spiders using visual searches along time-constrained belt transects between January and May 2005. Within a total sampled area of 5.76 ha, 4,565 individual spiders (4,300 detections) belonging to 156 morphospecies within 21 families and 8 functional groups were recorded. The estimated total number of understorey spider species in the study area was 192 (±5.15 SD) species, representing around 13% of the total number of spider species so far described from India. Overall spider density, species richness, and species density showed no trend in relation to fragment area across all sites. Specific comparisons among undisturbed sites indicated however that high altitude sites had fewer species than mid-altitude sites and fragments had fewer species than relatively larger continuous forest sites. In contrast to the lack of trend in overall species richness and abundance, species composition changed substantially in relation to habitat alteration and altitude. Cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarities among sites in spider species composition revealed four distinct clusters: high altitude undisturbed sites, mid-altitude disturbed sites with an undisturbed mid altitude site, mid-altitude highly disturbed sites with a disturbed site, and shade- coffee plantation sites. Spider species, such as Psechrus torvus and Tylorida culta, that contributed significantly to the dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed rainforest sites, and rainforest and shade-coffee sites were identified that serve as useful indicators of habitat alteration."
254,Effects of reduced-impact logging and forest physiognomy on bat populations of lowland Amazonian forest,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. As human population size increases, demand for natural resources will increase. Logging pressure related to increasing demands continues to threaten remote areas of Amazonian forest. A harvest protocol is required to provide renewable timber resources that meet consumer needs while minimizing negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) may be a viable option to achieve these goals.
2. Effects of RIL (18 m3 ha1) and forest physiognomy were assessed for populations of bats from Amazonian terra firme forest in Brazil at 2042 months postharvest. 3. Based on 64 512 meter-hours of netting, 1468 bats were captured representing 47 species, 30 genera, four families and five feeding ensembles. Five species (one nectarivore and four frugivores) responded to management in a consistent manner: four were more abundant in logged forest and one was more abundant in undisturbed forest. Ten species (one nectarivore, two gleaning animalivores and seven frugivores) responded to forest physiognomy in a consistent manner: nine were more abundant in closed-canopy sites and one was more abundant in gaps. Three species (all frugivores) exhibited idiosyncratic responses to management that were contingent on physiognomy.
4. Using qualitative measures (changes in status from common to rare, or from present to absent), RIL elicited negative responses from 16 species, mostly rare taxa. After accounting for differences in total number of collected individuals, control forest harboured seven to 15 more rare species than did forest subjected to RIL.
5. Synthesis and applications. In the short term, RIL generally did not negatively affect populations of abundant bats. In contrast, reductions in abundance or local extirpation in response to RIL generally characterized uncommon or rare species. Arrangement of RIL sites in a matrix of undis- turbed forest may allow sourcesink dynamics to mitigate effects of RIL on rare or sensitive species and enhance sustainability at a regional scale."
255,Sustaining biodiversity in ancient tropical countryside,Scientific article,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"With intensifying demands for food and biofuels, a critical threat
to biodiversity is agricultural expansion into native tropical ecosystems.
Tropical agriculture, particularly intensive agriculture,
often supports few native organisms, and consequently has been
largely overlooked in conservation planning; yet, recent work in
the Neotropics demonstrates that tropical agriculture with certain
features can support significant biodiversity, decades after conversion
to farmland. It remains unknown whether this conservation
value can be sustained for centuries to millennia. Here, we
quantify the bird diversity affiliated with agricultural systems in
southwest India, a region continuously cultivated for>2,000 years.
We show that arecanut palm (Areca catechu) production systems
retain 90% of the bird species associated with regional native
forest. Two factors promote this high conservation value. First, the
system involves intercropping with multiple, usually woody, understory
species and, thus, has high vertical structural complexity
that is positively correlated with bird species richness. Second, the
system encompasses nearby forests, where large quantities of leaf
litter are extracted for mulch. The preservation of these forests on
productive land traces back to their value in supplying inputs to
arecanut cultivation. The long-term biodiversity value of an agricultural
ecosystem has not been documented in South and Southeast
Asia. Our findings open a new conservation opportunity for
this imperiled region that may well extend to other crops. Some of
these working lands may be able to sustain native species over
long-time scales, indicating that conservation investments in agriculture
today could pay off for people and for nature."
256,"Diversity and composition of Amazonian moths in primary, secondary and plantation forests",Scientific article,Journal of Tropical Ecology,"The response of tropical fauna tol andscape-level habitat change is poorly understood. Increased conversion of native primary forest to alternative land-uses, including secondary forest and exotic tree plantations, highlights the importance of assessing diversity patterns within these forest types. We sampled 1848 moths from 335 species of Arctiidae, Saturniidae and Sphingidae, over a total of 30 trap-nights. Sampling was conducted during the wet season 2005, using three light-traps at 15 sites within areas of primary forest, secondary forest and Eucalyptus urograndis plantations in northern Brazilian Amazonia. The Jari study region provides one of the best opportunities to investigate the ecological consequences of land-use change, and this study is one of the first to examine patterns of diversity for a neotropical moth assemblage in a human-dominated landscape in lowland Amazonia. We found that the three moth families responded consistently to disturbance in terms of abundance and community structure but variably in terms of species richness, in a manner apparently supporting a life-history hypothesis. Our results suggest that secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations can support a substantial level of moth diversity but also show that these forest types hold assemblages with significantly distinct community structures and composition from primary forest. In addition, the ability of these converted land-uses to support primary forest species may be enhanced by proximity to surrounding primary forest, an issue which requires consideration when assessing the diversity and composition of mobile taxa in human-dominated landscapes."
257,Invasion and retreat: Shifting assemblages of dung beetles amidst changing agricultural landscapes in central Peru,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"This study examines the effects of deforestation, and the habitat value of coffee and regenerated forest for tropical dung beetles, a functionally significant insect group. Pitfall trapping was conducted at 22 sites in a montane region of central Peru during April and November/December of 2002. Sites included primary and secondary forest, shade- coffee, regenerated forest and open farms (mainly with banana, yuca, and corn). Ordination techniques indicated that beetle assemblages in forests, regenerated forest and coffee were relatively similar. However, assemblage compositions in forested areas differed even at similar altitudes under the influence of biogeographical factors, and the assemblages at disturbed sites (farms/coffee) were influenced by beetle dispersal from adjacent forests. During dry months, when beetle activity is low, communities at all habitat types tended to converge because fewer unique species were recorded in forests at that time and habitat/ season generalists were dominant. Preliminary results also indicate that beetles in shady crops such as bananas responded to plant growth: as the banana canopy closed-in, pro- ducing more shade, open-habitat specialists retreated and forest/shade specialists invaded the sites. Chronosequence data at two of the sites demonstrate the rapid and dramatic changes in species richness and assemblage composition caused by deforestation. As forests become increasingly fragmented, and open farms continue to expand, dung beetles will become more restricted to the remaining fragments and reserves. In the mosaic landscape studied here, shade crops, like coffee, act as habitat and corridors for many dung beetle species. Small farm size and the consequent magnitude of edge effects, likely contributed to beetle movement between habitat types and determined the apparent gen- eralist nature of many of the dung beetle species in this study."
258,Complementary roles of home gardens and exotic tree plantations as alternative habitats for plants of the Ethiopian montane rainforest,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"Many tropical forests have been converted for agri- or silviculture or a combination of both (agro- forestry). Conservation at a landscape scale requires an understanding of the distribution and abundance of native biodiversity in these converted natural ecosystems, of which the knowledge is especially poor for African agroecosystems. We compared species density and species composition of four plant groups (trees and shrubs, epiphytic vascular plants, mosses, and liverworts) among three arboreal land-use types in southwest- ern Ethiopia (montane rainforest fragments, shade-tree coffee home gardens, and exotic tree plantations). Species density was significantly higher in forests than in coffee home gardens for all plant groups and in exotic tree plantations for all groups except mosses. Home gardens had more vascular epiphytic species than plantations, whereas the reverse was true for mosses and liverworts. The species composition of the forest plots was sometimes more similar to home-garden plots than plantation plots and sometimes vice versa. Fifteen forest plots had, however, cumulatively more species than a random selection of 15 nonforest (coffee home garden and plantation) plots, even if the 2 plot types complemented each other in terms of habitats for forest plants. Tree plantations dominated by Eucalyptus had many small trees and shrubs in common with forests, whereas plantations with Cupressus were important substrates for forests mosses and liverworts. Our results illustrate the importance of undisturbed forests habitats for conservation of species at a landscape scale and that different human-made land-use types may complement each other in their capacity as additional habitats for forest species."
259,Alpha and beta diversity of plants and animals along a tropical land-use gradient,Scientific article,Ecological Applications,"Assessing the overall biological diversity of tropical rain forests is a seemingly insurmountable task for ecologists. Therefore, researchers frequently sample selected taxa that they believe reflect general biodiversity patterns. Usually, these studies focus on the congruence of a diversity (the number of species found per sampling unit) between taxa rather than on b diversity (turnover of species assemblages between sampling units). Such approaches ignore the potential role of habitat heterogeneity that, depending on the taxonomic group considered, can greatly enhance b diversity at local and landscape scales. We compared a and b diversity of four plant groups (trees, lianas, terrestrial herbs, epiphytic liverworts) and eight animal groups (birds, butterflies, lower canopy ants, lower canopy beetles, dung beetles, bees, wasps, and the parasitoids of the latter two) at 15 sites in Sulawesi, Indonesia, that represented natural rain forest and three types of cacao agroforests differing in management intensity. In total, we recorded 863 species. Patterns of species richness per study site varied strongly between taxonomic groups. Only 1317% of the variance in species richness of one taxonomic group could be predicted from the species richness of another, and on average 1218% of the variance of b diversity of a given group was predicted by that in other groups, although some taxon pairs had higher values (up to 76% for wasps and their parasitoids). The degree of congruence of patterns of a diversity was not influenced by sampling completeness, whereas the indicator value for b diversity improved when using a similarity index that accounts for incomplete sampling. The indication potential of a diversity for b diversity and vice versa was limited within taxa (720%) and virtually nil between them (04%). We conclude that different taxa can have largely independent patterns of a diversity and that patterns of b diversity can be more congruent. Thus, conservation plans on a landscape scale need to put more emphasis on the high heterogeneity of agroforests and the overarching role of b diversity shaping overall diversity patterns."
260,"Traditional land use associated with swidden agriculture changes encouter rates of the top predator, the army ant, in Southeast Asian tropical rain forests",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"We examined the effect of traditional swidden agriculture on biodiversity using
the litter arthropod top predator, the army ant Aenictus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) as an
indicator species in and around an intact tropical rain forest in Sarawak, Borneo, Malaysia. We compared the encounter rates with Aenictus colonies among five forest types: continuous
primary forest, isolated primary forest, old secondary forest ([20 years elapsed
after abandonment of the fields), young secondary forest (5 years after abandonment), and
new fallow (2 years after abandonment) by intensive area searching in 2003 and 2005. In
total, seven Aenictus species (15 colonies) and six Aenictus species (11 colonies) were
encountered in 2003 and 2005, respectively. The encounter rates were the highest in
continuous and isolated primary forests, intermediate in old and young secondary forests,
and the lowest in new fallow. Year and the interaction between year and forest type were
not significant. That is, abundance of top predators, which is rare and likely to be vulnerable
to disturbance, has never fully recovered even 20 years after the termination of
cultivation. We discuss forest management strategies to sustain biological diversity."
261,Vertebrate population responses to reduced-impact logging in a neotropical forest,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4 km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416 km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9 m3 ha1 , equivalent to only 1.1 trees ha1 . Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests."
262,Habitat fragmentation causes immediate and time-delayed biodiversity loss at different trophic levels,Scientific article,Ecology Letters,"Intensification or abandonment of agricultural land use has led to a severe decline of
semi-natural habitats across Europe. This can cause immediate loss of species but also
time-delayed extinctions, known as the extinction debt. In a pan-European study of 147
fragmented grassland remnants, we found differences in the extinction debt of species
from different trophic levels. Present-day species richness of long-lived vascular plant
specialists was better explained by past than current landscape patterns, indicating an
extinction debt. In contrast, short-lived butterfly specialists showed no evidence for an
extinction debt at a time scale of c. 40 years. Our results indicate that management
strategies maintaining the status quo of fragmented habitats are insufficient, as timedelayed
extinctions and associated co-extinctions will lead to further biodiversity loss in
the future."
263,Abundance of Panamanian dry-forest birds along gradients of forest cover at multiple scales,Scientific article,Journal of Tropical Ecology,"Community structure and species abundances may be strongly correlated to patterns of forest cover,
although such patterns are poorly known for tropical dry-forest birds, especially for those in Panamanian dry forests.
Birds were distance-sampled during point counts in five dry-forest fragments in Panama. Distance from point count
to forest edge and forest coverage at three spatial scales (500, 1000 and 2000-m radius) were compared as covariate
predictors of the abundance of avian species and guilds. Each covariate was selected in at least two models of species
or guild abundance. Abundance patterns were consistent with previously reported habitat associations for only two
of seven open-habitat or forest-preferring species that showed forest cover-abundance relationships. Null models best
described the abundance of all forest species and the subset of uncommon forest species. Thus many of these species
appear insensitive to the forest-cover gradients studied. Total abundance of open-habitat-preferring species increased
in dry forests with increasing forest coverage within 500 m, suggesting that the relationship between their abundance
and vegetation structure are spatial-scale and habitat dependent. Nectarivores had lower abundance as forest cover
within 1000 m increased, supporting previous claims that this group is tolerant of forest edges."
264,Wild coffee management and plant diversity in the montane rainforest of southwestern Ethiopia,Scientific article,African Journal of Ecology,"Coffea arabica occurs naturally in the montane rainforests
of Ethiopia, but large areas of these unique forests have
been converted to other land-uses. In the remaining forest,
wild coffee is managed and harvested with increasing
intensity because of rising coffee prices in the world market.
This study evaluated the impact of coffee management
on wild coffee populations and the forest vegetation as a
basis for conservation planning in southwestern Ethiopia.
Vegetation surveys and yield assessments were carried out
in unmanaged natural forest and in managed semi-forest
coffee (SFC) systems. Analyses show that wild coffee
density and coffee yields were low in natural forest (max.
15 kg ha)1 year)1). In SFC systems, 30% of the canopy
trees and most undergrowth vegetation were removed.
This stimulated wild coffee growth and strongly enhanced
yields (max. 54 kg ha)1 year)1), but severely disturbed
forest structure. Species richness increased by 26% because
of an increase in species of ruderal and secondary vegetation;
however, species richness and abundance of typical
forest species declined. Conservation of the natural forest
therefore requires the control of wild coffee management.
Wild coffee certification is discussed as one tool to reconcile
conservation measures and the interests of local farmers."
265,Deforestation and the population decline of the army ant Dorylus wilverthi in western Kenya over the last century,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. It is important to document changes in the population sizes of species to justify and implement
conservation programmes. This is often hampered by the absence of historical population count
data, particularly for tropical animal species.
2. Here, we developed a predictive habitat distribution model (PHDM) for the army ant Dorylus
wilverthi, a keystone species of Central African rainforests. We applied the model to forest cover
data in western Kenya from 1913 to 2003 in order to estimate changes in the distribution and population
size over the last century. The model was based on a large data set including abundance data
of 51 repeatedly monitored 500 mtransects in forest and non-forest habitats.
3. Forest cover within 1400 m of the transect lines explained 58%of the variation in abundance of
D. wilverthi. The model predicts that the colony abundance of the army ant exponentially increases
with increasing forest cover and that colonies are absent from landscapes with less than 11%forest
cover.
4. Applying the PHDMto historical and recent forest cover data predicts a 52%decline in the population
size of D. wilverthi (from 2801 to 1346 colonies) between 1913 and 2003. Under a worst-case
scenario in which the forest area is reduced to the current national nature reserves, the population
size would decrease to fewer than 300 colonies, which is probably too low to ensure the long-term
survival of the species.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the application of a PHDM on landcover
change time series data may give valuable insights into changes in the population size of species
for which no historical population count data are available. Using this approach, we revealed a
significant decline in population size of the army ant D. wilverthi over the last century. High protection
status should be applied to all of the remaining forest area to prevent the population becoming
regionally threatened and to facilitate long-term conservation of this keystone species in Kenya."
266,Explaining the saproxylic beetle diversity of a protected Mediterranean area,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Saproxylic beetle diversity is high at the Cabaneros National Park (central
Spain), where woodland habitats exhibit remarkable heterogeneity. Our aim was to explain
the diversity of saproxylic beetles, focusing on species turnover among mature woodland
types. We surveyed five woodland types that represented the heterogeneity of the parks
woodland habitats. Beetles were collected using window traps over a period of 20 months.
The Jaccard Similarity Index was used as indirect value of beta diversity among woodlands
and to test the relation between species turnover and geographical distance. We also
identified the contribution of species turnover to landscape diversity by using a partitioning
model. Moreover, the presence of mixed woodlands (more than one tree species) allowed
us to attempt to valorise the effect of tree species (coupled with their historical management)
on species turnover among woodlands. Finally, we looked for different saproxylic
beetle preferences for habitat and tree species using an indicator value method. We found
that saproxylic beetle species composition varied significantly among the studied woodlands.
The variation in species turnover was independent from the distance among
woodlands, which suggested that beetle dispersal abilities could not explain this high
turnover. Tree species within woodlands were a key factor that increased diversity turnover
in woodlands and, consequently, the diversity of the park. Moreover, we found saproxylic
beetle species that had different habitat and tree species preferences. We conclude that
woodland heterogeneity (highly affected by woodland composition) seems to be the
driving force for saproxylic beetle diversity in this protected area."
267,Do riparian reserves support dung beetle biodiversity and ecosystem services in oil palm-dominated tropical landscapes?,Scientific article,Ecology and Evolution,"Agricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to global biodiversity,
ecological functions, and ecosystem services. The rapid expansion of oil
palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high
biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species
and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a
priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated
areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can
also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed
communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an
oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness,
diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian
reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent
logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more
similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in
biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates
among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance
dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous
studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness
and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but significant positive
relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and
between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting
that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis
and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest
demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil
palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle community
characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research
into spatial variation in biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships and how
the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices."
268,Impacts of forestry on ant species richness and composition in warm-temperate forests of Japan,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"To understand the long-term impacts of forestry, i.e., the conversion of old-growth native forests to second-growth native
forests or conifer plantations, on ant species richness (i.e., the number of species) and species composition, ant assemblages from five old-growth forests (more than 120 years), four second-growth forests (3070 years) and three conifer plantations (3040 years) were compared in the Shimanto River Basin, Shikoku, southwest Japan. The number of ant species collected totaled 39. The number of ant species from the old-growth native forests, second-growth native forests and conifer plantations was 1020, 1520 and 1115, respectively. The overall ant species richness had not been affected by forest conversion. However, correspondence analysis (CA) showed that the ant species composition was markedly different between old-growth forests and converted forests (second-growth forests and conifer plantations). The species richness of woodland specialists was greater in the old-growth forests, and open-habitat specialists and habitat generalists dominated the converted forests. The impacts of forestry on ant assemblages were of a long duration. Ant assemblages of the second-growth forests under regeneration for 4070 years after logging were still distinct from those of old-growth forests. Careful management of second-growth forests bordering old-growth remnants would be essential to prevent the invasion of open-habitat species of ants into the interior of old-growth forests."
269,Effects of grazing intensity on bird assemblages and populations of Hungarian grasslands,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Agricultural intensification is responsible for the dramatic decline of farmland bird populations in the European Union (EU).
The joining of eight Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries to the EU will re-structure agriculture there. One of the main threats is the intensification of farmland management. Can agri-environmental programs balance the expected decline in bird assemblages of the CEE countries if farming will be intensified?We studied this question by comparing bird assemblages of 42 extensively and intensively grazed paired fields in three regions of Hungary (alkali steppes and meadows in Central Hungary and alkali steppes in Eastern Hungary). Bird assemblages varied significantly across regions and grazing intensity. Intensively grazed sites showed a higher species number and diversity, but lower densities than the extensive sites. This is probably the consequence of higher landscape diversity of intensive sites, which included farm buildings, shelters, wells and other structures. Several bird species, mainly with European conservation concern, showed contrasting responses to grazing intensity in the three regions, including key grassland species (black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, redshank Tringa totanus, skylark Alauda arvensis and corn bunting Emberiza calandra). Therefore, threat and sensitivity to grassland characteristics are correlating. Although many of the declining species ofWestern Europe are still abundant in Hungarian grasslands, our results project the threat of the expected intensification. This study showed that it is not possible to provide a general grassland management scheme that will favour all bird species in all regions of Hungary. In the process of integrating to the EU and re-structuring agriculture, the establishment of scientifically sound schemes is urgent."
270,Species traits as predictors of lepidopteran composition in restored and remnant tallgrass prairies,Scientific article,Ecological Applications,"Restoration ecologists are increasingly turning to the development of trait-filter
models, which predict how evolved traits limit species membership within assemblages depending on existing abiotic or biotic constraints, as a tool to explain how species move from a regional species pool into a restored community. Two often untested assumptions of these models, however, are that species traits can reliably predict species broadscale distribution and that the effects of traits on community membership do not vary between restored and remnant habitats. The goals of this study were to determine whether combinations of ecological traits predispose moth species toward recolonization of restored prairies and to assess the degree to which restored prairies contain moth assemblages comparable with prairie remnants. In 2004, we collected 259 moth species from 13 tallgrass prairie remnants and restorations in central Iowa. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify significant combinations of ecological traits that were shared by groups of moth species. Logistic regression was then employed to test for significant effects of the trait combinations on the frequency of prairie sites occupied by moth species. PCA partitioned moth traits into four axes that explained a total of 81.6% of the variance. Logistic regression detected significant effects for all four PCA axes on the fraction of sites occupied by moths. Species frequently filtered from the regional species pool into prairies were those that had long flight periods and were multivoltine, displayed a feeding preference for legumes but not other forb families, and were regionally abundant but relatively small in body size. Ordination revealed significant differences in moth communities among prairies, suggesting that species traits and habitat characteristics likely interact to create observed patterns of species recolonization of restorations. Thus, the optimal approach to restoring the lepidopteran fauna of tallgrass prairies may involve locating prairie plantings adjacent to habitat remnants."
271,"Land use and habitat gradients determine bird community diversity and abundance in suburban, rural and reserve landscapes of Minnesota, USA",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Bird species’ community responses to land use in the suburbanizing Twin Cities, Minne- sota, USA, were contrasted among reserves, rural lands, and suburbs. For each land use
type, bird composition, diversity, and abundance were recorded for 2 years in 99 plots in three sampling units (each 4500 ha). A habitat gradient defined by canopy structure (grasslands to savannas to forests) was influenced by land use, so 300 plots were used to characterize simultaneous variation in bird communities along land use and habitat gra-
dients. At broad scales (aggregate of 33 plots covering 4500 ha) suburbs supported the lowest bird richness and diversity and rural landscapes the most, with reserves slightly
below rural. Although reserves were like rural lands in diversity of bird communities, they supported more species of conservation concern, particularly of grasslands and savannas. Differences among land use types varied with habitat structure. Suburbs, rural lands, and reserves had similar forest bird communities, but differed in grassland and savanna bird communities. The extensive rural forests are important for the region’s forest birds. Subur- ban grasslands and savannas had low shrub abundance, low native bird richness and high non-native bird richness and abundance. However, total bird richness and diversity were as high in suburban as in rural and reserve plots because high native richness in suburban for- ests and high non-native species richness in suburban grasslands and savannas compen- sated for lower native richness in suburban grasslands and savannas. Bird conservation here and in the Midwest USA should protect rural forests, expand grasslands and savannas in reserves, and improve habitat quality overall."
272,Snake species distributions and temperate grasslands: A case study from the American tallgrass prairie,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Many snake species are declining globally, yet data unavailability in temperate grasslands hinders snake conservation in one of the worlds most endangered biomes. To encourage and inform the conservation of snakes in these regions, I examined snake species diversity and abundance during 2 years of a mark-recapture study at 22 sites located in six American tallgrass prairie preserves in northern Illinois, USA. I emphasized landscape-scale relation- ships after accounting for covariance with environmental factors at both finer (microhab- itat) and broader (regional) scales. A total of 120 snakes representing seven species was captured using drift fence arrays associated with funnel traps and sheet metal cover. The low numbers and diversity of snakes captured, when compared to historic evidence, indicate that since the 1930s Midwestern snake populations have declined. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and Mantel tests demonstrate that differences in snake species composition in remnant and degraded prairies are discernable along gradients of urban and agricultural land cover. However, different patterns of abundance for individual snake species indicate that the relative importance of specific landscape factors differ among spe- cies, which has significant conservation implications. Here, I recommend that conserva- tionists use a species-specific approach to manage snake populations. I also stress the need for thorough inventory of snake populations and studies of snakehabitat relation- ships to advance our understanding of snake ecology and conservation within the little studied temperate grassland habitats of South America and eastern Eurasia."
273,Bird assemblages in pine plantations replacing native ecosystems in NW Patagonia,Scientific report (published),Biodiversity and Conservation,"Forest plantations of exotic conifers represent an important economic activity in NW Patagonia, Argentina. However, there is a remarkable lack of information on the impact of forestry on native biodiversity. We analyzed the effect of Pinus ponderosa plantations on bird communities, considering different stand management practices (dense and sparse tree covers), and different landscape contexts where they are planted (Austrocedrus chilensis forest and steppe). Ultimately we wished to assess in which way plantations may be designed and managed to improve biodiversity conservation. Bird richness and abundance did not change significantly in the steppe, although community composition did, and was partially replaced by a new community, similar to that of ecotonal forests. In contrast, in the A. chilensis forest areas, species richness decreased in dense plantations, but bird community composition remained relatively constant when replacing the native forest with pine plantations. Also, in A. chilensis forest, stand man- agement practices aiming at maintaining low tree densities permit the presence of many bird species from the original habitat. In the steppe area in turn, both dense and sparse plantations are unsuitable for most steppe species, thus it is necessary to manage them at higher scales, maintaining the connectivity of the native matrix to prevent the fragmen- tation of bird populations. We conclude that pine plantations can provide habitat for a substantial number of native bird species, and this feature varies both with management practices and with the landscape context of areas where afforestation occurs."
274,Habitat and landscape characteristics underlying anuran community structure along an urban-rural gradient,Scientific article,Ecological Applications,"Urbanization has been cited as an important factor in worldwide amphibian
declines, and although recent work has illustrated the important influence of broad-scale ecological patterns and processes on amphibian populations, little is known about the factors structuring amphibian communities in urban landscapes. We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urbanrural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quantified wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a significant negative influence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post-breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad-scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes. This study underscores the importance of a regional approach to amphibian conservation in urban and urbanizing areas; in fragmented landscapes, a network of interconnected wetland and upland habitats may be more likely to support a successful, diverse anuran community than will isolated sites."
275,Butterfly distribution and abundance is affected by variation in the Swedish forest-farmland landscape,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Remaining patches of semi-natural grasslands are hot spots for biodiversity in modern agricultural landscapes.
In Sweden semi-natural pastures cover approximately 500,000 ha. However, power-line corridors,
road verges and clear-cuts cover larger areas (in total about 2,000,000 ha), and these open, less
intensively managed habitats are potentially important for species associated with taller vegetation
and flower resources (e.g. pollinating insects). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative
importance of semi-natural pastures and the other three open habitats for butterflies in 12 forest-farmland
mosaic landscapes in south central Sweden. Species composition differed significantly between habitats
in multivariate analyses. Power-line corridors and semi-natural pastures harbored several species
that were disproportionally abundant in these habitats (13 and 8 species, respectively), and power-line
corridors also harbored several species that were classified as typical in indicator species analyses. There
were more butterfly species, higher abundances and a tendency for more individuals of red-listed species
in power-line corridors than in the other three habitats. Effects of the surrounding landscape composition
seemed to be weaker than that of the local habitat. However, species composition was significantly associated
with landscape composition and species with intermediate and low mobility were more abundant
in forested landscapes than in landscapes dominated by arable fields. Analyses of flying time and host
plants for larvae suggest that early flying species and species associated with dwarf shrubs were more
common in power-line corridors than in the other habitats. A landscape perspective, which takes several
habitats into account, is needed for conservation of butterfly communities in forest-farmland landscapes.
Power-line corridors and road verges offer possibilities for creating habitats that are suitable for pollinating
insects through conservation-oriented management."
276,Understory succession in post-agricultural oak forests: Habitat fragmentation affects forest specialists and generalists differently,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"The herbaceous understory forms the richest stratum in temperate broadleaved forests in terms of plant diversity. Understanding the process of understory succession is thus of critical importance for the devel- opment of management guidelines for biodiversity restoration in post-agricultural plantation forests. We studied effects of stand age, forest fragmentation, and soil and canopy conditions on species rich-
ness and abundance of four species groups in the understory of post-arable oak plantations in southern Sweden: herbaceous forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-land species, and woody species. The group of forest specialists may approach the richness of continuously forested sites after 60
80 years in non-fragmented plantations, but many forest species were sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Open-land species richness decreased during succession, while the richness of woody species and of gen- eralists remained stable, and was not affected by fragmentation. Abundance of generalists gradually decreased in non-fragmented plantations, probably due to competition from colonizing forest specialists. Soil pH in post-arable stands remained consistently higher than in continuously forested stands, which maintained differences in species composition. The development of a shrub layer seemed to imply a com- petitive advantage for forest specialists compared to generalist species. For successful recovery of a rich understory, we suggest that post-arable plantations should be estab-
lished on loamy soils of intermediate to high pH proximate to older forest with source populations, and that a continuous overstory canopy cover of 7080% is maintained by regular light thinnings and promo- tion of a shrub layer."
277,Pasture area and landscape heterogeneity are key determinants of bird diversity in intensively managed farmland,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Agriculture intensification has drastically altered farmland mosaics, while semi- natural grasslands have been considerably reduced and fragmented. Bird declines in northern temperate latitudes are attributed to habitat loss and degradation in farmed landscapes. Conversely, landscape-modification effects on grassland/farmland bird communities are less studied in the South American temperate grasslands.Weinvestigated how bird communities were influenced by landscape characteristics in the Rolling Pampa (Argentina). We sampled bird communities in 356 landscapes of 1-km radius that varied in cover and configuration of pastureland, flooding grassland and cropland. Using generalized linear models, we explored the relationship between both bird species richness and abundance, and landscape structure. Analyses were carried out for all species, and open-habitat, grassland and aquatic species. Pasture area was far the most important factor, followed by landscape composition, in predicting species richness and abundance, irrespective of specific habitat preferences, followed by partially-flooded grassland cover and its mean shape index. Grassland frag- mentation did not affect species richness or abundance. When comparing the effects of landscape variables on bird richness and abundance (using mean model coefficients), pasture and grassland area effects were on average more than four times greater than those of compositional heterogeneity, and about ten times greater than shape effects. To conserve species-rich bird communities persisting in Rolling Pampa farmland, we recommend the preservation of pasture and grassland habitats, irrespective of their fragmentation level, in intensively managed farmland mosaics."
278,Forestcheck: the response of epigeous macrofungi to silviculture in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest,Agency report (published),Australian Forestry,"Species richness, abundance and composition of epigeous macro-fungi were monitored at 48 grids across four jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest ecosystems in south-west Western Australia as part of an integrated monitoring project to examine responses to different timber harvesting and regeneration treatments. Forest that had never been harvested or had not been harvested for over 40 years was used as a reference, and compared to forest that had undergone shelterwood/selective cutting and gap release treatment after 1988. Silvicultural treatment also included post-harvest burning. All epigeous species of macrofungi and their abundance were recorded from autumn surveys at each grid. A total of 450 species were recorded. Overall mean species richness and abundance was similar but the composition of species assemblages contributing to macrofungal communities differed significantly between silvicultural treatments and reference forest. Sixty-nine species were restricted to reference forest while 35 were restricted to shelterwood/selective cut and 62 to gap release treatment. In all treatments, the overall mean number of species per grid recorded fruiting on soil was 24 times higher than that recorded on litter or wood. Species richness of sporophores recorded on both soil and litter was similar for all treatments, but was significantly lower on wood in reference forest compared to the gap release treatment. Mean sporophore abundance was significantly higher on litter and lower on wood in reference forest compared with silviculturally treated forest. Because fire is an integral part of jarrah forest silviculture, it was not possible to separate the singular effect that either tree removal or fire had on macrofungal communities. However, in different time-since-treatment classes the overall composition of species assemblages was different, but species richness and abundance for each silvicultural treatment were similar. Each forest ecosystem supported its own unique fungal community, which supports the concept of ecosystems in jarrah forest based on forest structure and understory vegetation resulting from variation in climate, soils and landforms. Current conservation policy and silviculture practice in jarrah forest produces a landscape mosaic containing early succession stands through to mature forest across the landscape, which is important for the maintenance of fungal biodiversity. Much of the fungal population in jarrah forest, however, remains unknown and only a long-term commitment to survey and monitoring will improve knowledge on the diversity and ecology of these important organisms and ensure their consideration in future management decisions."
279,"Effects of Habitat Size, Vegetation Cover, and Surrounding Land Use on Diptera Diversity in Temperate Nearctic Bogs",Scientific article,Wetlands,"Higher Diptera (Schizophora) are taxonomically and ecologically diverse, and include bog specialist and bog-associated species known to respond to peatland disturbance. We examined the effects of three factors (habitat size, vegetation cover and surrounding land use measured in concentric circles of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 m radii from the sampling location) on Schizophora species richness, diversity, and composition in six temper- ate eastern Nearctic bogs. A total of 381 species of Schizophora were collected with observed species richness among sites ranging from 96 to 182. Assemblages in apparently similar peatlands were highly variable, but characterized by a few highly dominant species, most of which are not peatland specialists. Bog size had no influence on species richness or diversity. Vegetation cover at the sampling sites and surrounding land use at the largest scales measured (1500 and 2000 m) both influenced species assemblages."
280,Managing the forest for more than the trees: effects of experimental timber harvest on forest Lepidoptera,Scientific article,Ecological Applications,"Studies of the effects of timber harvest on forest insect communities have rarely considered how disturbance from a range of harvest levels interacts with temporal variation in species diversity to affect community resistance to change. Here I report the results of a landscape-scale, before-and-after, treatmentcontrol experiment designed to test how communities of forest Lepidoptera experience (1) changes in species richness and composition and (2) shifts in species dominance one year after logging. I sampled Lepidoptera from 20 forest stands allocated to three harvest treatments (control, even-aged shelterwood or clearcuts, and uneven-aged group selection cuts) within three watersheds at Morgan-Monroe State Forest, Indiana, USA. Moths were sampled from all forest stands one year prior to harvest in 2007 and immediately post-harvest in 2009. Species composition was most significantly affected by temporal variation between years, although uneven-aged management also caused significant changes in lepidopteran community structure. Furthermore, species richness of Lepidoptera was higher in 2007 compared to 2009 across all watersheds and forest stands. The decrease in species richness between years, however, was much larger in even-aged and uneven-aged management units compared to the control. Furthermore, matrix stands within the even-aged management unit demonstrated the highest resistance to species loss within any management unit. Species dominance was highly resistant to effects of timber harvest, with pre- and post-harvest values for Simpson diversity nearly invariant. Counter to prediction, however, the suite of dominant taxa differed dramatically among the three management units post-harvest. My results suggest that temporal variation may have strong interactions with timber harvest, precipitating loss of nearly 50% species richness from managed stands regardless of harvest level. Even-aged management, however, appeared to leave the smallest footprint on moth communities. Timber harvest also created greater heterogeneity in species dominance among management units, suggesting that forest watersheds may diverge in post-harvest recovery transients relative to unlogged watersheds in Morgan-Monroe State Forest. Because moth communities appear to be highly sensitive to group-selection cuts, shelterwood cuts, and clearcuts, it will be important to retain unlogged concessions within management units to resist landscape-level loss of Lepidoptera."
281,"Comparative study of forest-dwelling bats' abundances and species richness between old-growth forests and conifer plantations in Nikko National Park, central Japan",Scientific article,Mammal Study,"To determine the influence of the forest type on bats in terms of roosting sites and foraging habitats, we compared species richness and abundance (total and by species) of forest- dwelling bats in old-growth forests and conifer (larch) plantations in central Japan. We also compared species richness and abundance of the bats in riparian and non-riparian habitats, and compared the old-growth forest stands with the larch plantation stands to examine differences in the forest stand structures. Species richness, total bat abundance, and the abundances of two tree-roosting specialists, the Ikonnikovis Myotis (Myotis ikonnikovi) and the Ussurian tube-nosed bat (Murina ussuriensis), were significantly higher in the old-growth forests than in the conifer plantations. The old-growth forests contained larger trees and more snag trees, which provided roosting sites for tree- roosting species. Species richness, total bat abundance, and abundances of the two tree-roosting specialists and the Japanese large-footed bat (My. macrodactylus) were also significantly higher in the riparian habitats than in the non-riparian habitats. The riparian old-growth forest appears to be an important habitat for forest-dwelling bats. Our results suggest that a shift from old-growth forests to conifer plantations has negative effects on forest-dwelling bats, particularly tree-roosting specialists."
282,"The effect of clearing on plant composition in mulga (Acacia aneura) dry forest, Australia",Scientific article,Austral Ecology,"Despite high deforestation rates in dry forests there are few assessments of the impacts of this transformation on biodiversity. This study addresses the impact of clearing on plant species composition and diversity in mulga (Acacia aneura) forests of Queensland, Australia using data collected from either side of 58 clearing boundaries, incorporating data on site and management conditions.The physical and climatic conditions of the study sites were narrowly constrained but had greater influence on plant composition and richness than clearing per se. In general, the abundance of perennial forbs and shrubs was higher in cleared forest compared with adjacent intact forest and there was no significant difference in abundance of other plant life forms. Perennial forb richness diminished with the age of clearings, particularly where acid sub-soils had been exposed and shrubs proliferated.Where deforestation in the mulga dry forests is not accompanied by the establishment of exotic pasture it has a relatively benign effect on plant diversity, mulga itself remains in high density as small trees and the integrity of the forest could be maintained with restoration."
283,Old park trees as habitat for saproxylic beetle species,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Very old trees harbour a diverse fauna of saproxylic insects, many of which are
classified as threatened due to the scarcity of this kind of habitat. Parks, which often
contain many old trees, are therefore considered to be important sites for this fauna.
However parks are intensively managed and dead wood is often removed. Therefore this
study compares if the saproxylic beetle fauna in parks is as diverse as it is in more natural
stands. Eight Park sites at manor houses around lake Ma¨laren, Sweden were compared
with trees in wooded meadows: eight grazed sites, here termed Open, and 11 sites
regrown with younger trees, termed Re-grown. The comparison was made on lime trees
(Tilia spp.): one of the most frequent tree species in old parks which host a diverse beetle
fauna. Beetles were sampled with window traps, which in total caught 14,460 saproxylic
beetles belonging to 323 species, of which 50 were red-listed. When comparing all
saproxylic species, Park sites had significantly fewer species than Open sites. However,
for beetles in hollow trees and for red-listed species there was no significant difference, the
number in Park being intermediate between Open and Re-grown. Species composition
differed between sites, but only marginally so. Therefore, the conclusion is that old park
trees on average are as valuable for faunal diversity as trees in more natural sites. Large
conservation benefits can be obtained by combining cultural and conservational values in
the management of park habitats."
284,"Effects of grazing, vegetation structure and landscape complexity on grassland leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha) and true bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) in Hungary",Scientific article,Insect Conservation and Diversity,"1. Agricultural intensification is a major cause of biodiversity loss in European farmlands. Grasslands are particularly important habitats for the conservation of rich insect assemblages of Central and Eastern Europe. Although regular grazing or mowing of these grasslands is required to maintain diversity, there is no information about how such management and other factors influence Hemiptera assemblages.

2. We studied leafhopper and true bug assemblages in semi-natural grasslands in three regions of the Great Hungarian Plain. We investigated how local vegetation factors and landscape complexity influence assemblages and whether they interact with management effects.

3. Seven pairs of intensively (>1 cow/ha) versus extensively (∼0.5 cow/ha) grazed pastures were sampled in each region by sweep-netting.

4. Sward height was the most important explanatory factor for leafhoppers (84 species, 27264 individuals), as it increased both species number and abundance, and influenced assemblage composition. The extent of grassland surrounding the sample sites negatively affected leafhoppers, whereas extensive grazing decreased abundance and influenced composition. True bug assemblages (140 species, 6656 individuals) were positively affected only by mean sward height, whereas regional differences determined the community composition of both taxa.

5. We conclude that vegetation structure is the primary factor shaping Hemiptera communities and that the various types of grasslands studied are all important habitats for the taxon. Therefore, cattle grazing in its current form is beneficial for the rich Hemiptera fauna in lowland pastures of Hungary. However, in some cases, local and landscape factors and great regional differences may confound the effects of grazing, and this must be considered in conservation planning in the future."
285,"Habitat use by carnivores at different spatial scales in a plantation forest landscape in Patagonia, Argentina",Scientific report (published),Forest Ecology & Management,"Forest plantations are an increasingly important source of industrial wood around the world, and the design and management of plantations can greatly influence the relationship with wildlife. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of conversion of native open vegetation to conifer plantations on mammalian carnivore assemblages in NW Patagonia, Argentina. We conducted camera-trap surveys at 69 sites and assessed composition of carnivore assemblages and habitat use in conifer plantations and native vegetation. We also evaluated habitat characteristics at stand and landscape scales related to presence of carnivores. Four species of carnivores were detected: Lycalopex culpaeus, Conepatus chinga, Puma concolor, and Leopardus geoffroyi. L. culpaeus and C. chinga used continuous native vegetation most frequently, but also used dense conifer plantations and tended to be more abundant in firebreaks and sparse plantations than in dense plantations. L. geoffroyi was almost fully restricted to continuous native vegetation, but was also detected in firebreaks and native vegetation remnants between plantations; this species was never detected in plantations. P. concolor was detected in all habitat types and did not exhibit any preference. The presence of carnivores was associated with understory diversity, tree density, and prey availability at the stand scale, and with amount of area with native vegetation at the landscape scale. Our results suggest that management decisions at the stand and landscape scales can influence habitat quality for wildlife in the region."
286,Effect of forest shape on habitat selection of birds in a plantation-dominant landscape across seasons: comparison between continuous and strip forests,Scientific article,Journal of Forest Research,"Conversion of natural forests to other land use results not only in a decrease of forest area but also in the degradation of remnant forests as a habitat for forest ani- mals. Although such degradation due to an increase of forest edges has been studied most intensively, other fac- tors such as forest shape may also contribute to the deg- radation. In this study, we compared bird abundance and species richness between irregular-shaped and relatively continuous forests in the breeding and migratory seasons. Since the forests were surrounded by tree plantations rather than open lands, the edge effect may have been weak at the study site. Our results suggested that the irregular forest shape negatively affected forest bird abundance and spe- cies richness in the breeding season, but not in the migratory season. The response of birds varied with bird traits: migrants avoided the irregular-shaped forest, but residents did not. Among the residents, small ones pre- ferred or tolerate the irregular-shaped forest whereas large ones avoided it. This study indicates that careful consid- eration of various factors such as seasonality and bird traits is needed to understand the consequences of land use changes on forest birds."
287,"Effects of habitat degradation on the lizard assemblage in the Arid Chaco, central Argentina",Scientific article,Journal of Arid Environments,"Habitat degradation in the Chaco has been intense and widespread since European settlement. Detailed knowledge about its effects on the Chaco fauna is scarce despite the critical importance of such infor- mation for biodiversity conservation. The effects of habitat degradation on the Arid Chaco lizard assemblage were evaluated by comparing species richness and abundance in four sites along a gradient of increasing vegetation degradation. Two undisturbed sites (primary forest and grassland), and two sites with different degrees of forest degradation (moderate and severe) were selected. Ten lizard species were recorded (nine were trapped and one was sighted), totaling 1122 captures. Abundance of Homonota fasciata, Leiosaurus paronae, Liolaemus chacoensis and Stenocercus doellojuradoi was highest in the primary forest, with significantly lower values in the remaining three sites. Teius teyou and Tropidurus etheridgei were more abundant in the moderately and severely degraded forests than in the primary forest. Management implications of our results in terms of lizard biodiversity in the Chaco are analyzed."
288,Sensitivity of insectivorous bats to urbanization: Implications for suburban conservation planning,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Effective conservation planning requires an understanding of specieshabitat relationships across a diverse array of taxa, yet many studies typically focus on conspicuous fauna. Using systematic acoustic surveys, we examine the response of insectivorous bat species to urbanization and quantify specieshab- itat relationships to classify species in terms of their tolerance or sensitivity. Surveys were conducted in Sydney, Australia, during springsummer of 2008 in 29 defined 25 km2 landscapes, across various land uses. We quantified bathabitat relationships using local and landscape scale variables. We recorded 17 taxa across the urban gradient, with substantial variation in the tolerance and sensitivity of each spe- cies. The density of houses, landscape geology, the amount of bushland (ha) exclusively on fertile geolo- gies and moth biomass were the most frequent predictors of individual activity, explaining more than 60% of variation in activity for some species. Importantly, the area of bushland on poorer soils was not a good predictor, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results of large scale studies which do not account for variations in habitat productivity. Species-specific differences existed, although the majority of the assemblage was considered to be urban-sensitive. Many of these sensitive species were most active in fertile suburban habitats, with an average of 1228% bushland cover within 5 km. Our study demonstrates the necessity to elucidate species-specific habitat relationships, and suggests bats would benefit from the conservation of productive suburban bushland remnants and riparian habitats, while improving connectivity to these areas via the maintenance of tree cover across the matrix."
289,Impact of game hunting by the Kayapo of south-eastern Amazonia: implications for wildlife conservation in tropical forest indigenous reserves,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Indigenous forest reserves represent approximately one fifth of Brazilian Amazonia and
pose enormous challenges for sustainable natural resource management by native Amazonians.
In collaboration with the Kayapo´ Indians of AUkre of southeastern Amazonia, we obtained a
game harvest profile of over 1360 forest vertebrates consumed at this village over a 20-month
period, including 743 mammals, 361 forest tortoises and 256 birds from a minimum of 42 game
species. This amounted to a total of 13,775 kg of game animals harvested over the entire study
(mean = 26.2 kg d!1). We also obtained some 450 km of line transect census data of midsized to
large-bodied vertebrates within the core hunting catchment of this village and in an unhunted but
otherwise comparable site upriver of AUkre. Population density estimates of 16 of the 18 species
censused were significantly depressed by hunting by central place foragers within the village
catchment, and a number of harvest-sensitive prey species showed clear evidence of local
depletion. For the time being, however, we can conclude that hunting was sustainable at the
landscape scale largely because source-sink dynamics in the context of low village catchment
density is made possible by large surrounding tracts of primary forest that remain unharvested or
underharvested."
290,"Relative densities of mammals in response to different levels of bushmeat hunting in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania",Scientific article,Tropical Conservation Science,"Bushmeat hunting constitutes the most immediate threat to wildlife populations in the Udzungwa Mountains of the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. This study assesses the impact of hunting by comparing densities of mammalian species between the little hunted West Kilombero Scarp Forest Reserve (WKSFR), the medium-hunted Udzungwa Scarp Forest Reserve (USFR) and the intensively hunted New Dabaga Ulongambi Forest Reserve (NDUFR). Of the 22 species recorded, 20 were present in WKSFR, 17 in USFR and 12 in NDUFR. Most large species (>40 kg) were absent from hunted areas, while medium-sized species were reduced more than smaller species. Few traces of Abbotts duiker were observed in hunted areas and bush pig were reduced by more than 85% in hunted areas. Hunting appears to have had little effect on relative abundance of primates, blue duiker, Harveys duiker, aardvark, eastern tree hyrax, and giant pouched rat in USFR, at least for those areas surveyed. In NDUFR relative abundance of most mammals are reduced compared to the less hunted reserves. The exception is the red colobus which were no less abundant than USFR. However in NDUFR, transects were placed in the best quality habitat for these habitat-sensitive monkeys, thus emphasising the additional role of habitat degradation. The effect of hunting appears to be proportional to the size of the species and the intensity of hunting, although effects of life history strategy, forest fragment size, isolation, and previous logging cannot be excluded. Reduction of hunting levels are paramount to the survival of large bodied species in USFR and for the continued presence of most species in NDUFR. This study furthermore constitutes an important baseline for monitoring the effect of current efforts to implement joint forest management in the Udzungwa Mountains."
291,"The importance of secondary forest blocks for terrestrial mammals within an Acacia/secondary forest matrix in Sarawak, Malaysia",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"With the rapid conversion of tropical forests in Asia to plantation forests for timber or biofuel production
there is a need to determine if these forests serve any viable role in wildlife conservation. We used infrared
trip cameras to survey for large terrestrial mammals within an Acacia/secondary forest matrix being
created for pulpwood production in Sarawak, Malaysia. We detected at least 27 species of mammals
within the matrix and 18 species were detected in both Acacia and secondary forest. Using occupancy
modeling to determine important covariates for seven mammal species within the project area, six of
these species were sensitive to forest type, and most were sensitive to the amount of secondary forest
within 1 km of the sample point. For four species (sun bear, Helarctos melayanus; common porcupine,
Hystrix brachyura; mousedeer, Tragulus spp.; and pig-tailed macaque, Macaca nemestrina), the mean distance
of detection from large secondary forest blocks was significantly closer than expected from the distribution
of sample points. Most species used Acacia forest less frequently than secondary forest, possibly
for transit or foraging, with the exception of bearded pigs (Sus barbatus), sambar (Rucervus unicolor), and
civets which were more common in Acacia stands. The amount of secondary forest preserved within forest
plantations seems to be the best measure of conservation potential for these industrial forests. Forest
plantations can provide a conservation value if managed properly and those retaining significant
amounts of secondary forest should be eligible for a base level of certification as they comprise a significant
portion of the landscape in this region."
292,"The Effects of Habitat Disturbance on Lemurs at Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar",Scientific article,International Journal of Primatology,"The alarming rate of deforestation in Madagascar is driving some endemic primates to extinction. Surprisingly, anthropogenic habitat disturbance is not always deleterious. The effect of disturbance on lemur abundance may be related to diet, with frugivorous species more prone to population declines than folivores or insectivores. To test the effects of disturbance on lemur abundance and group size, we surveyed 2 sites within contiguous forest at Ranomafana National Park, 1 lightly disturbed primary forest (Vato) and 1 heavily logged forest (Tala). We quantified forest structure variables along 6 survey routes and conducted 68 diurnal and 42 nocturnal lemur surveys. Canopy closure, canopy height, and understory visibility were greater in Vato than in Tala. We encountered 2 frugivorous lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons, Varecia variegata) and 1 folivore (Avahi peyrierasi) significantly more frequently in Vato than in Tala, whereas the opposite was true for the insectivorous Microcebus rufus. Rates did not differ statistically for 1 frugivore (Eulemur rubriventer) and 2 folivores (Propithecus edwardsi, Hapalemur griseus). Comparisons across the 6 survey routes suggest that the abundance was heterogeneous within as well as between sites. Neither group size nor composition differed between sites. Encounter rates for Varecia variegata were positively related to canopy closure, and encounter rates for Avahi peyrierasi were positively related to canopy height. Encounter rates for Microcebus rufus were negatively related to canopy closure, height, and understory visibility. Similar to other studies, the results suggest that some lemurs, including folivores, may cope with anthropogenic disturbance better than others, including some frugivores. Lemur abundance is heterogeneous, though, even on small spatial scales."
293,Status and distribution of the leopard in the central hills of Sri Lanka,Scientific article,Cat News,"The Sri Lankan leopard Panthera pardus kotiya is an endangered sub-species and data on its status, distribution and abundance in the island's central hills is lacking. A main objective of this long term study (2003-2011) is to determine these fundamental aspects of leopard ecology in this highly fragmented wet zone region. Here we report results from presence/absence surveys, camera trap surveys initiated to estimate leopard abundance, and trail index surveys comparing relative abundance between two contrasting highland sites, the first a mid-elevation secondary wet zone forest adjacent to a large town (pop. 100 000) and the other a mix of regeneratingsecondary and primary montane forest adjacent to a large (98 km2) protected area. Results indicate that leopards inhabit a wide variety of landscapes in the region ranging from large intact forest swaths to small (<5 km2), isolated patches of heavily impacted secondaryforest. Long term (minimum 6 years) use of small patches by individually identified leopards and repeated cub-rearing confirms residency, highlighting the importance of these seemingly marginal lands. Leopard abundance differs markedly between hill country sites with a higher relative abundance in areas adjacent to large, intact forests than more isolated forest patches. Leopards are using a range of landscapes within the region including established and regenerating forests, plantation lands (e.g. pinus, eucalyptus, tea), and areas in close proximity to human settlement."
294,Spatial and temporal effects of grazing management and rainfall on the vertebrate fauna of a tropical savanna,Scientific article,The Rangeland Journal,"Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread uses of the rangelands of Australia. There is
limited information on the effects of grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of Australia and the
establishment of a long-term grazing experiment in north-eastern Queensland at Wambiana provided an opportunity to
attempt an examination of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of themanipulation of stocking rates. The aim
was to identify what the relative effects of vegetation type, stocking rate and other landscape-scale environmental factors
were on the patterns recorded. Sixteen 1-ha siteswere establishedwithin three replicated treatments (moderate, heavy and
variable stocking rates). The sites were sampled in the wet and dry seasons in 19992000 (T0) and again in 200304 (T1).
All paddocks of the treatments were burnt in 1999. Average annual rainfall declined markedly between the two sampling
periods, which made interpretation of the data difficult. A total of 127 species of vertebrate fauna comprising five
amphibian, 83 bird, 27 reptile and 12 mammal species were recorded. There was strong separation in faunal composition
from T0 to T1 although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between the grazing stocking rate treatments were
less well defined. Therewas a relative change in abundance of 24 bird, fourmammal and five reptile species from T0 to T1.
The generalised linear modelling identified that, in the T1 data, there was significant variation in the abundance of
16 species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors. This study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did
change and that these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking rates, the vegetation types on the
sites surveyed, the burning of the experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of the two surveys.
It is recommended that the experiment is sampled again but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa
(i.e. birds and reptiles) to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling and replication of the data. This would help to
articulate more clearly the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of stocking rates compared with
wider landscape environmental changes. Given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern Australia,
any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should
be taken for the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species."
295,Landscape and patch attributes impacting medium- and large-sized terrestrial mammals in a fragmented rain forest,Scientific article,Tropical Ecology,"Understanding the response of biodiversity to land-use changes is an important challenge for ecologists. We assessed the effects of five landscape metrics (forest cover, number of patches, edge density, mean inter-patch isolation distance and matrix quality) and three patch metrics (patch size, shape and isolation) on the number of species and patch occupancy of medium- and large-sized terrestrial mammals in the fragmented Lacandona rain forest, Mexico. We sampled mammal assemblages in 24 forest patches and four control areas within a continuous forest. The landscape metrics were measured within a 100-ha buffer, and within a 500-ha buffer from the centre of each sampling site. A total of 21 species from 13 families was recorded. The number of species increased with shape complexity and patch size at the patch scale, and with matrix quality within 100-ha landscapes. When considering 500-ha landscapes, only the number of patches (i.e. forest fragmentation level) tended to have a negative influence at the community level. Different landscape and patch metrics predicted the occurrence of each species within the sites. Our results indicate that there is a gradient of tolerance to forest cover change, from highly sensitive species to those tolerant of, or even benefited by, forest-cover change."
296,"Habitat and human factors associated with white-tailed deer density in the tropical dry forest of Tehuacan-cuicatlan biosphere Reserve, Mexico",Scientific article,Tropical Conservation Science,"The main objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between population densities of the white-tailed deer 
Odocoileus virginianus and certain habitat and human characteristics in the tropical dry forest of the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan 
Biosphere Reserve (TCBR), Mexico. To estimate population density and characterize the habitat, we established 32 strip 
transects (500 x 2 m) at four different locations in the TCBR from May to June during the dry season of 2010. Principal 
component analyses were used to order the 32 transects using habitat/human impact variables and tree species 
composition. Estimated average density was 1.7 deer/km2, ranging from 0.1 to 2.9 deer/km2. The variables associated with 
white-tailed deer density were: basal area, distance to roads, distance to the area with largest human population, slope, 
aspect and presence of cattle; the principal plant species were Zapotillo (Lantana camara), Chintoborrego (Vallesia 
glabra), Nanche (Bunchosia biocellata), Cuachalalate (Amphipterigyum adstringens) and Cuajiote Amarillo (Bursera 
aptera). Compared to other tropical dry forests, estimated white-tailed deer densities in the TCBR were lower. We discuss 
the possible effect of these variables on deer density and suggest management actions."
297,Forest loss or management intensification? Identifying causes of mammal decline in cacao agroforests,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in terrestrial systems are being driven by the synergistic
interactions between the loss of native vegetation and land-use intensification. Disentangling the influence
of these two processes on species persistence is an important step towards reconciling conservation
and agriculture production. We investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect the
conservation value of cacao agroforests for mammals in an Atlantic forest landscape in southern Bahia,
the most extensive area of diverse shaded cacao plantations in Brazil. Although both factors affected
the distribution of mammal species, management intensification had a stronger effect, negatively affecting
a larger number of species. Frequency of domestic dogs, an indirect aspect of management intensification,
negatively affected four species and lower connectivity of shading trees decreased the use of cacao
agroforests by three species of conservation concern. In comparison, the reduced forest cover negatively
affected two species of conservation concern. Our results suggest that controlling domestic dog populations
is particularly valuable for large mammal conservation in agroforestry mosaics, since it does not
affect crop productivity. Improving shade cover within agroforests, on the other hand, should be implemented
carefully, maintaining acceptable yield while promoting canopy connectivity and the recruitment
of tree species used by forest dependent mammals. However, the importance of both local
management intensification and local forest cover are likely to be context dependent, and changes in
their relative importance are likely to occur with different levels of deforestation at the landscape scale."
298,The scale of community structure: habitat variation and avian guilds in tropical forest understory,Scientific article,Ecological Monographs,"Both local and regional habitat characteristics influence species richness and
community structure. The scale at which communities are studied, however, affects the
detection of relationships between habitat characteristics and patterns of habitat selection,
species diversity, and species composition, and may obscure observation of differences in
how species perceive the scale of environmental variation. To determine how environmental
variation at different scales is related to species occurrence and richness, I analyze mist
net sampling data on several guilds of forest understory birds. Bird capture, vegetation,
and physical environment data come from 23 0.5-ha study sites in primary and secondary
forest in Amazonian Ecuador. The percentages of primary forest within concentric circles
around each site form forest imbeddedness measures (FIMs), which are evaluated using
satellite imagery. Variation in FIM size represents different measurement scales for determining
forest cover. Primary forest cover is also analyzed in successively larger tori surrounding
sites and is used, after variable reduction with Principal Components Analysis,
to summarize variation in forest cover around sites. Linear regression, surface trend analysis,
and ordination help to quantify how variation in guild composition and species richness is
explained by forest cover, vegetation structure, and physical environment.
Species composition is related to variation in primary forest cover, primarily within 200
600 m of study sites. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicates that nectarivores,
shrub-layer frugivores, and ant-following birds are captured in areas with relatively low
primary forest cover. In contrast, shrub-layer insectivores, shrub-layer omnivores, and birds
probing dead foliage for large insects tend to be captured in areas of relatively high primary
forest cover. The species richness of insect gleaners, ant followers, and omnivores is statistically
related to the percent cover of primary forest within hundreds of meters from the
study sites. This suggests that some mechanisms that influence guild composition act over
substantial distances. Nonetheless, the small radii of FIMs related to the species richness of
dead-leaf probers suggests that local conditions and variation in forest cover over short (,200
m) distances directly or indirectly influence species richness of some primary forest birds.
The significant relationship between temperature variation among capture sites and species
richness of ant-following birds suggests that these species choose among habitats in a temperature
range at which physiological constraints operate, either directly on the birds themselves
or on the ants they follow. Species richness within the nectarivores, in contrast, shows
no relationship with large-scale variation in primary forest cover.
The radius of the FIM most closely associated with species richness differs among
guilds, which suggests variation in the scale at which forest cover is associated with guild
structure, as well as variation in the strength of the association. Differences in the scale of
relationships between environment and species richness among guilds suggest that the
mechanisms that influence both species habitat use and community structure differ among
guilds. A single mechanism, operating at a single scale, is inconsistent with these patterns.
Independent data from eight additional sites suggest that prediction of species richness
from surrounding forest structure could be useful for managing human impacts on tropical
avian communities."
299,"Amphibians and reptiles in tropical rainforest fragments on Negros Island, the Philippines",Scientific article,Environmental Conservation,"To elucidate effects of fragmentation and degradation of tropical rainforest on Negros Island (Philippines) on tropical herpetofauna, nine tropical rainforest fragments (eight limestone and one non-limestone), ranging in area from five to 122 ha (total area = 352 ha) in south-western Negros were surveyed using cruising and quadrat sampling methods, between December 2001 and October 2002. A 14-ha limestone plantation forest served as a reference site. Ten to fifteen of the total 61 species (16.4-24.6%) expected in the nine forest fragments (taken as a whole) had been lost in the previous 50 years. These species are known to occur in the tropical rainforest on Cuernos de Negros and environs in south-eastern Negros Island at altitudes <500m above sea level. The factors responsible for the loss of these species appear to be (1) removal of large trees, which decreases canopy cover causing physical changes; and (2) forest fragmentation, which increases the edge areas. However, it is not possible to separate the effects of each of these two factors. The main factor that was correlated with the number of species in the limestone forest fragments appeared to be area. Two species of frogs appeared to be represented by relatively moderate population densities: the Negros cave frog (Platymantis spelaeus) and the common forest frog (Platymantis dorsalis). The burrowing skink (Brachymeles boulengeri taylori) also exhibited a relatively higher density than the other burrowing species of skinks. The other herpetofaunal species exhibited low population densities."
300,Conservation value of forest fragments to Palaeotropical bats,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Forested landscapes in Southeast Asia are becoming increasingly fragmented, making this region a conservation and research priority. Despite its importance, few empirical studies of effects of fragmentation on biodiversity have been undertaken in the region, limiting our ability to inform land-use regimes at a time of increased pressure on forests. We estimated the biodiversity value of forest fragments in peninsular Malaysia by studying fragmentation impacts on insectivorous bat species that vary in dependence of forest. We sampled bats at seven continuous forest sites and 27 forest fragments, and tested the influence of fragment isolation and area on the abundance, species richness, diversity, composition and nestedness of assemblages, and the abundance of the ten most common species. Overall, isolation was a poor predictor of these variables. Conversely, forest area was positively related with abundance and species richness of cavity/foliage-roosting bats, but not for that of cave-roosting or edge/open space foraging species. The smallest of fragments (< 150 ha) were more variable in species composition than larger fragments or continuous forest, and larger fragments retained substantial bat diversity, comparable to continuous forest. Some fragments exhibited higher bat abundance and species richness than continuous forest, though declines might occur in the future because of time lags in the manifestation of fragmentation effects. our findings suggest that fragments > 300 ha contribute substantially to landscape-level bat diversity, and that small fragments also have some value. However, large tracts are needed to support rare, forest specialist species and should be the conservation priority in landscape-level planning. Species that roost in tree cavities or foliage may be more vulnerable to habitat fragmentation than those that roost in caves."
301,Nested species subsets of amphibians and reptiles on Neotropical forest islands,Scientific article,Animal Conservation,"Nested species subsets are a common pattern of community assembly characteristic of many types of fragmented landscapes and insular systems. Here we describe nested subset patterns of amphibian and reptile occupancy on 23 forest islands in north-eastern Bolivia. We used observed occupancy patterns to differentiate five distributional guilds: widespread species, rare species, poor colonizers, area-sensitive species and supertramps. Amphibian occurrences were nested along a forest island isolation gradient, and when species from each of the distribution classes were removed from subsequent analyses of nestedness, we found that dispersal-limited poor colonizers were responsible for the association between nestedness and isolation. Amphibians associated with the grassland matrix at the study site showed a nested pattern linked with area, although this pattern did not scale up to all amphibians and could not be unequivocally attributed to any of the distributional guilds we recognized. There were no strong associations between two biological characteristics, body size and relative abundance in the matrix, and the likelihood of occupancy along either forest island area or isolation gradients. The relative importance of isolation in shaping nested patterns of amphibians on these forest islands may be a result of either (1) the greater range in isolation values included in this study compared with many others; (2) the long time since isolation in this landscape, manifesting a footprint of isolation not apparent in more recently fragmented patches; (3) the relatively homogeneous grassland matrix surrounding forest islands that likely provides little refuge for animals moving among forest islands."
302,Mammals in a fragmented savannah landscape in south-western Brazil,Scientific article,Journal of Natural History,"Mammal abundance, richness, and community structure were examined in fragments of savannah and in gallery forests of south-western Brazil in order to assess the influence of fragment size and habitat on the communities. Five savannah fragments and two gallery forests were sampled. Within the savannah fragments, environmental parameters such as tree and shrub densities were measured. Live-traps and pitfalls were used for trapping small mammals; larger mammals were recorded from footprints and sightings. Seventeen species of small mammal and 15 species of large mammal were recorded. Small mammals were affected by fragment size and isolation, whereas larger mammals were not. Communities of small mammals were better structured in the largest fragments, and those in smaller fragments were subsets of the communities in larger fragments. Gallery forests revealed a rather different assemblage of mammals, but also contained species common to both gallery and large savannah remnants. Data are discussed relating mammal community structure to area size and vegetation structure, in an attempt to understand the present conservation status of this fragmented landscape."
303,"Small mammal assemblages in a disturbed tropical landscape at Pozuzo, Peru",Scientific article,Mammalian Biology,"Deforestation in the Peruvian pre-montane forests has increased alarmingly in recent years. Particularly, fragmentation in these forests takes place against a background of very extensive continuous forest. Until now, no studies have detailed how Peruvian small mammals responded to forest fragmentation. In this paper, we report the results of an assessment of nonvolant small mammal fauna in forest remnants (one large fragment and one small fragment) and cattle pasture in a disturbed landscape at Pozuzo, formerly a pre-montane tropical forest in central Peru. In each forest remnant, we quantify habitat parameters and identified small mammals to know if there is a relationship between forest remnant size or microhabitat structure and small mammal assemblages. In addition, we investigated the influence of habitat structure on the presence of small mammal species. We did not find any evidence that habitat structure in large fragment was greater than small fragment. Actually, both forest remnants presented habitat features typical of forests subject to higher levels of disturbance. We found that abundance of small trees (10 - 19 cm DBH) was positively associated with the presence of Marmosops noctivagus, but negatively with the presence of Oecomys bicolor. Likewise, the presence of the arboreal Rhipidomys leucodactylus was associated with the abundance of larger trees (DBH > 50 cm). We recorded 12 small mammal species in large fragment, 9 in small fragment and 3 in cattle pasture. No significant differences were found in species richness between both fragments, but marsupial abundance in the small fragment was greater than large fragment. At Pozuzo, we recorded 9 species restricted to forest habitat and 3 to forest and cattle pastures. However, it is necessary to assess more fragments to improve our knowledge about species survival in this landscape."
304,Deforestation and Avian Extinction on Tropical Landbridge Islands,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"There are few empirical data, particularly collected simultaneously from multiple sites, on extinctions resulting from human-driven land-use change. Southeast Asia has the highest deforestation rate in the world, but the resulting losses of biological diversity remain poorly documented. Between November 2006 and March 2008, we conducted bird surveys on six landbridge islands in Malaysia and Indonesia. These islands were surveyed previously for birds in the early 1900s, when they were extensively forested. Our bird inventories of the islands were nearly complete, as indicated by sampling saturation curves and nonparametric true richness estimators. From zero (Pulau Malawali and Pulau Mantanani) to 15 (Pulau Bintan) diurnal resident landbird species were apparently extirpated since the early 1900s. Adding comparable but published extinction data from Singapore to our regression analyses, we found there were proportionally fewer forest bird extinctions in areas with greater remaining forest cover. Nevertheless, the statistical evidence to support this relationship was weak, owing to our unavoidably small sample size. Bird species that are restricted to the Indomalayan region, lay few eggs, are heavier, and occupy a narrower habitat breadth, were most vulnerable to extinction on Pulau Bintan. This was the only island where sufficient data existed to analyze the correlates of extinction. Forest preservation and restoration are needed on these islands to conserve the remaining forest avifauna. Our study of landbridge islands indicates that deforestation may increasingly threaten Southeast Asian biodiversity."
305,"Nestedness for different reasons: the distributions of birds, lizards and small mammals on islands of an inundated lake",Scientific article,Diversity and Distributions,"Aim We examined whether the community compositions of birds, lizards and small mammals were nested in a fragmented landscape in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We also assessed whether the mechanisms influencing nestedness differed among these taxonomic groups. Location Thousand Island Lake, China. Methods Presence/absence matrices were compiled for birds (42 islands) and lizards (42 islands) using line-transect methods, and for small mammals (14 islands) using live-trapping methods from 2006 to 2009. Nestedness was analysed using BINMATNEST, and statistical significance was assessed using the conservative null model 3. We used Spearman rank correlations and partial Spearman rank correlations to examine associations of nestedness and habitat variables (area, isolation, habitat diversity and plant richness) as well as life-history traits (body size, habitat specificity, geographical range size and area requirement) related to species extinction and immigration tendencies. Results The community compositions of birds, lizards and small mammals were all significantly nested, but the causal factors underlying nestedness differed among taxonomic groups. For birds, island area, habitat specificity and area requirement were significantly correlated with nestedness after controlling for other independent variables. For lizards, habitat heterogeneity was the single best correlate of nestedness. For small mammals, island area, habitat heterogeneity and habitat specificity were significantly correlated with nestedness. The nested patterns of birds, lizards and small mammals were not attributable to passive sampling or selective colonization. Main conclusions The processes influencing nested patterns differed among taxonomic groups. Nestedness of bird assemblages was driven by selective extinction, and lizard assemblage was caused by habitat nestedness, while nestedness of small mammals resulted from both selective extinction and habitat nestedness. Therefore, we should take taxonomic differences into account when analysing nestedness to develop conservation guidelines and refrain from using single taxa as surrogates for others."
306,Effects of anthropogenic environmental changes on amphibian diversity in the rain forests of eastern Madagascar,Scientific article,Journal of Tropical Ecology,"Madagascar has one of the worlds highest rates of human population increase, which is coupled with an increase of resource exploitation, particularly food and firewood. Forests are cleared and converted to rice fields or plantations (mainly Eucalyptus or pine). How does deforestation affect the amphibian diversity of the original biotope, the rain forest? To answer this question, the amphibian fauna of intact rain forests was compared with that of secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields. The main consequence of rain forest disturbance was loss of amphibian species. Compared with an intact forest, species richness in secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields were 54%, 46% and 12%, respectively. Species number and individual density increased with increasing structural complexity of the habitat and the presence of water bodies. The reproductive strategy of the species could be decisive for the presence or absence of single species in different habitats. With increasing degradation the percentage of species spawning in water increased. Correspondingly, Hyperoliidae and Raninae
were characteristic of degraded habitats, whereas Microhylidae and Mantellinae were representative of natural habitats."
307,The impact of fire and forest conversion into savanna on the bird communities of West Madagascan dry forests,Scientific article,Animal Conservation,"We studied the influence of vegetation structure and tree phenology on bird communities along a gradient of tropical forest degradation in NW Madagascar. Birds were censused by point counts at Ankarafantsika, one of the largest remnants of the severely reduced dry deciduous forest. The original forest was dominated  by foliage insectivores. A few years after wildfire, regrowth was dense, most forest bird species were still present and additional understorey species appeared. As a result, species richness and abundance per point count increased. In contrast, when forest was transformed into savanna, the avian assemblage became poor, dominated by granivores and aerial insectivores,with only seven species shared with the original forest. Foliage  volume, grass volume and bare ground cover explained most of the bird community variation by means of
canonical correspondence analysis. Birds tended to increase their habitat breadth along the forestsavanna gradient. An index of bird conservation value, including abundance, endemism and the threatened status of  the species, was highest in burned forests (1.12), intermediate in unburned forests (1) and lowest in savanna (0.44). The results emphasise the urgent need to protect not only the undisturbed fragments, but also the burned dry forests, because of their high value for biodiversity."
308,"Effects of karst forest degradation on pulmonate and prosobranch land snail communities in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo",Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"Limestone (karst) outcrops in Southeast Asia are rich in land snails. Certain groups of land snails, in particular Prosobranchia species, are restricted to limestone and show a high degree of short-range endemism. Karst habitats are, however, seriously degraded by quarrying, logging, agriculture, and burning. The effect of these disturbances on land snail fauna is unknown, so we studied paired primary and secondary forest localities on six separate limestone hills in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Land snails were sampled with a standard protocol and identified to species level. More than 16,000 individuals, belonging to 74 species,
were recorded. In most sites, snail diversities did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed plots. However, pulmonate snails were significantly more abundant at disturbed localities than prosobranch snails, whereas abundances for both groups were similar at undisturbed sites. Because Prosobranchia contain many siteendemic species, our findings suggest that continued exposure to these disturbances will eventually lead to extinctions in this group."
309,Invasibility and species richness of island endemic arthropods: a general model of endemic vs. exotic species,Scientific article,Journal of Biogeography,"Aim This paper has two objectives. First, we examine how a variety of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors influence the endemic and introduced arthropod richness on an oceanic island. Second, we look at the relationship between the endemic and introduced arthropod richness, to ask whether areas with high levels of endemic species richness deter invasions.

Location The work was carried out on a young volcanic island, Terceira, in the Azores.

Methods We used standard techniques to collect data on arthropod species richness. Environmental data were obtained from the CIELO climatic model and using GIS. The explanatory value of environmental variables on a small-scale gradient of endemic and exotic arthropod species richness was examined with  generalized linear models (GLMs). In addition, the impact of both endemic and exotic species richness in the communities was assessed by entering them after the environmental variable(s) to see if they contributed significantly to the final model (the hierarchical method).

Results Abiotic (climatic and geomorphological) variables gave a better explanation of the variation in endemic species richness, whereas anthropogenic  variables explained most of the variation in introduced species richness. Furthermore, after accounting for all environmental variables, part of the unexplained variance in the endemic species richness is explained by the introduced species richness and vice-versa. That is, areas with high levels of endemic species richness had many introduced species. There is evidence of a  somewhat inverse spatial distribution between a group of oceanic-type, forestdwelling, endemic, relict arthropods and a group of more generalist endemic arthropods that are able to survive in disturbed marginal sites particularly rich in non-indigenous species.

Main conclusions Richness of endemic species is mainly driven by abiotic factors such as a climatic axis (oceanic-type localities with lower temperatures  and summer precipitations) and a binary variable CALD (location of sites in caldeiras or ravines),  whereas richness of introduced species depends on disturbance related factors. However, after factoring out these major influences, there is a correlation between endemic and introduced richness, suggesting that  independent of the environmental and geographical factors that affect the distribution of endemic or introduced species  the richest endemic assemblages  are more prone to invasion, due probably to a facilitation process. Inconclusive evidence suggests that non-indigenous species are limited to those sites unde anthropogenic influence located mainly near forest edges, but the rate of expansion of those species to high-altitude, core pristine sites has still to be tested."
310,Butterfly diversity in Mediterranean islands and in Pentadaktylos Pinus brutia forests of Cyprus,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"We analysed the influence of contemporary geography on butterfly diversity for islands in the Mediterranean Basin. We found that island size and distance from the  mainland has a significant effect on the number of species. We also used butterflies as an
indicator group to identify the importance of forest habitats for biodiversity conservation in the island of Cyprus. To understand the relative importance of local vegetation characteristics of butterflies in the Pentadaktylos mountains transect counts were used to assess the abundance and butterfly diversity in two different forest types. A total of 1,602 butterflies and 23 species were recorded during this research. We observed highly significant effects of forest type on abundance and species richness of butterflies. For example, number of butterflies was significantly higher in old forest than young pine forest. Also, the abundance of endemic butterflies was highest in old forest habitats. Therefore, the survival of the majority of endemic butterflies in Cyprus may depend on conservation of old forests and their understorey plants."
311,"Structural and environmental characterization of old-growth temperate rainforests of northern Chiloe Island, Chile: Regional and global relevance",Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Old-growth forests are ecologically relevant reservoirs of biodiversity and provide valuable and unique ecosystem functions in the landscape. However, what constitutes an old-growth stand is confusing because the definition depends largely on the forest type under study. Despite the ecological importance  of old-growth temperate rainforests in southern Chile in comparison to other global forests, no attempts have been made to characterize them as a way to assess their structural variability. Here, we
characterized old-growth stands of Valdivian and North Patagonian rain forest types located in Chiloe´ Island (Chile, 428300S) using inventory data from 23 permanent plots (0.1 ha each) located in rural landscapes and protected areas of northern Chiloe´ Island. For each stand, its age (average age of the oldest trees present in each stand) and disturbance regimes (evidence of recent human impact, e.g. cuttings or fires, and tree growth rates) were used as defining old-growth criteria.We characterized the structure (tree species richness, size-density distributions, vertical stratification and presence of snags) and floristic composition of each stand. Environmental variables (i.e. temperature, distance to coastline and elevation) were related to stand structure using multivariate constrained correspondence analysis. Old-growth forests were commonly characterized by (a) tree basal areas >80 m2/ha; (b) density of  shade-tolerant tree species in the emergent and dominant canopy layer >36%; (c) higher tree species  richness (>7 tree species) than successional stands; (d) presence of large canopy emergents (>80 cm dbh, >25 m tall); (e) high vertical heterogeneity; and (f) minimum stand ages older than 200 years. Old-growth forests showed a distinctive structural variability and floristic diversity influenced both by stand age and disturbance history of the stands. Structural variability was also related to environmental differences among sites (e.g. air temperature, distance to coastline, soil types). Oldgrowth forest features described here can offer a baseline for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old-growth forest structure in southern temperate rain forests."
312,Landscape and patch-level factors influence bird communities in an urbanized tropical island,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"As human population continues to increase and intensification of human land use escalates, it is important to address the role of urban forest patches in supporting bird communities. We related bird species richness and community assemblage to landscape- and patch- level factors in 40 forest patches in the densely populated metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In total, 54 bird species were observed including 26 resident, 10 endemic, 12 migratory, and 6 introduced species. Patch size, level of urbanization in the surrounding matrix, and vertical heterogeneity of forest patches were the most important variables in explaining species richness. Patch size had the highest predictive power in explaining species  richness for all groups except migrants, which were best predicted by patch-level factors (vegetation heterogeneity). The degree of matrix urbanization was correlated negatively with endemic species richness, but positively with introduced species. Endemic species were particularly sensitive to landscape factors (patch size, matrix urbanization, and canopy texture). Introduced species richness was not dependent on any patch-level factors. Eight species were relatively unaffected by urbanization, whereas two species were only found in large forest patches, and two species were sensitive to urban development. Seven species demonstrated a preference for small patches. Recommendations for land managers and conservation agencies to maintain a high bird species richness and diversity include: (1) preserve both large and small forest patches, (2) limit urban development near forest patches, (3) manage forest patch structure to  maintain vertical heterogeneity, and (4) maintain forest patches with different vegetation types."
313,"Investigating residual effects of selective logging on ant species assemblages in Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Sri Lanka",Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"The residual effects of logging on forest fauna and flora have been well studied in other regions of the world, with many investigations finding that recovery of species richness and abundance can occur within one or two decades after the logging event. In this study, we use ant assemblages to compare logged (>30 years) and unlogged mixed dipterocarp forest in the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, a World Heritage Site in Sri Lanka. Species richness and abundance were higher in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest, but not significantly so. Species assemblages, on the other hand, were significantly different and were associated with different environmental variables in the logged and unlogged forest. The findings from this study corroborate other studies that have shown that species composition in logged forest does not appear to return to unlogged forest composition, even after three to six decades have passed. Since this study was not a before-and-after comparison, it is difficult to confirm whether the differences arise from the residual effects of logging or from the general patchiness of species
distribution in tropical forest. However, the cumulative results do suggest that there is a residual effect of logging on ant species composition in this forest, even after more than 30 years of regeneration."
314,"Avian Diversity and Feeding Guilds in a Secondary Forest, an Oil Palm Plantation and a Paddy Field in Riparian Areas of the Kerian River Basin, Perak, Malaysia",Scientific article,Tropical Life Sciences Research,"The diversity and the feeding guilds of birds in three different habitats (secondary forest, oil palm plantation and paddy field) were investigated in riparian areas of the Kerian River Basin, Perak, Malaysia. Point-count observation and mist-netting methods were used to determine bird diversity and abundance. A total of 132 species of birds from 46 families were recorded in the three habitats. Species diversity, measured by Shannons diversity index, was 3.561, 3.183 and 1.042 in the secondary forest, the paddy field and the oil palm plantation, respectively. The vegetation diversity and the habitat structure were important determinants of the number of bird species occurring in an area. The relative abundance of the insectivore, insectivore-frugivore, and frugivore guilds was greater in the forest than in the monoculture plantation. In contrast, the relative abundance of the carnivore, granivore and omnivore guilds was higher in the plantation. The results of the study show that the conversion of forest to either oil palm plantation or paddy fields produced a decline in bird diversity and changes in the distribution of bird feeding guilds."
315,Changes in the diversity of soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi after cultivation for biofuel production in a Guantanamo (Cuba) tropical system,Scientific article,PLoS ONE,"The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are a key, integral component of the stability, sustainability and functioning of ecosystems. In this study, we characterised the AMF biodiversity in a native vegetation soil and in a soil cultivated with Jatropha curcas or Ricinus communis, in a tropical system in Guantanamo (Cuba), in order to verify if a change of land use to biofuel plant production had any effect on the AMF communities. We also asses whether some soil properties related with the soil fertility (total N, Organic C, microbial biomass C, aggregate stability percentage, pH and electrical conductivity) were changed with the cultivation of both crop species. The AM fungal small sub-unit (SSU) rRNA genes were subjected to PCR, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Twenty AM fungal sequence types were identified: 19 belong to the Glomeraceae and one to the Paraglomeraceae. Two AMF sequence types related to cultured AMF species (Glo G3 for Glomus sinuosum and Glo G6 for Glomus intraradices-G. fasciculatum-G. irregulare) did not occur in the soil cultivated with J. curcas and R. communis. The soil properties (total N, Organic C and microbial biomass C) were higher in the soil cultivated with the two plant species. The diversity of the AMF community decreased in the soil of both crops, with respect to the native vegetation soil, and varied significantly depending on the crop species planted. Thus, R. communis soil showed higher AMF diversity than J. curcas soil. In conclusion, R. communis could be more suitable for the long-term conservation and sustainable management of these tropical ecosytems."
316,Endangered anurans in a novel forest in the highlands of Sri Lanka,Scientific article,Wildlife research,"Context. Lands without agricultural or urban use embedded within agricultural and urban regions now account for ~35% of Earths terrestrial extent. Although created by human disturbances, these novel ecosystems, usually poor in native flora and often dominated by alien species, do not require human intervention for their maintenance. Given their large and increasing area, however, their ability to support native  and especially threatened  faunas warrants investigation. With 20 species already extinct and 47 of its 91 extant species assessed as Endangered or Critically Endangered, Sri Lankas amphibian fauna is in trouble. The 18 anurans (12 of these Endangered) occurring above 1500m in the islands central mountains are at particular risk from drastic declines in the extent and quality of habitat. Habitat restoration, however, is retarded by successional vegetation being arrested at least in the decadal time-frame by alien invasive species, creating a novel ecosystem. Aim. To investigate whether such an ecosystem is able to support native anurans with a species richness and abundance comparable to that of neighbouring tropical montane cloud forest.
Methods.Wesurveyed 110 transects (each 20m2m) across three neighbouring locations covering three microhabitattypes,
and recorded 552 specimens. One-way analyses of variance and post hoc, pair-wise Tukeys tests were performed to test for differences in species richness and abundance among the three microhabitat types.
Key result. Of the 15 anuran species occurring in the neighbouring primary forest, 12 (eight of them Endangered) had established populations in the novel ecosystem (a former tea plantation), with abundances comparable to (or in some cases
exceeding) those in primary forest.
Conclusion. Even young secondary forest dominated by alien plant species, in which native vegetation is almost wholly absent, can provide adequate habitat for most threatened highland anurans in Sri Lanka.
Implications. (1) Even if florally poor and dominated by alien species, novel ecosystems may present potential  conservation opportunities for previously threatened faunas. (2) Threatened anurans exclusively dependent on primary forest and unable to utilise secondary-growth forest should receive greater conservation attention and be prioritised for in situ conservation measures. (3) Given their large and increasing extent globally, novel ecosystems should be considered as part of the area of occupancy of species able to complete their life cycles in them when assessed for conservation purposes, rather than being arbitrarily discarded as degraded."
317,Forest Restoration and Parasitoid Wasp Communities in Montane Hawaii,Scientific article,Plos One,"Globally, most restoration efforts focus on re-creating the physical structure (flora or physical features) of a target ecosystem
with the assumption that other ecosystem components will follow. Here we investigate that assumption by documenting biogeographical patterns in an important invertebrate taxon, the parasitoid wasp family Ichneumonidae, in a recently reforested Hawaiian landscape. Specifically, we test the influence of (1) planting configurations (corridors versus patches), (2) vegetation age, (3) distance from mature native forest, (4) surrounding tree cover, and (5) plant community composition on ichneumonid richness, abundance, and composition. We sampled over 7,000 wasps, 96.5% of which were not native to Hawai’i. We found greater relative richness and abundance of ichneumonids, and substantially different communities, in restored areas compared to mature forest and abandoned pasturelands. Non-native ichneumonids drive these differences; restored areas and native forest did not differ in native ichneumonid abundance. Among restored areas, ichneumonid communities did not differ by planting age or configuration. As tree cover increased within 120 m of a sampling point, ichneumonid community composition increasingly resembled that found in native forest. Similarly, native ichneumonid abundance increased with proximity to native forest. Our results suggest that restoration plantings, if situated near target forest ecosystems and in areas with higher local tree cover, can facilitate restoration of native fauna even in a highly invaded system."
318,"Influence of variations in land use intensity on species diversity and abundance of small mammals in the Nama Karoo, Namibia",Scientific article,Belgian Journal of Zoology,"The influence of the intensity of land use on small mammals in the ecoregion Nama Karoo, Namibia
was investigated within the biodiversity programme BIOTA. Changes in species diversity and abundance were
investigated across a fence separating heavily grazed communal and lightly grazed government owned rangeland.
Assessing and monitoring of the small mammal populations were done seasonally from 2001-2003 on each of 2ha
plots by using capture-mark-recapture methods. In total, 311 individuals representing nine species were caught
within 5760 trap nights. Species richness, total abundance, species diversity and settlement was lower in the overgrazed
area. The most abundant species were the Gerbillinae, Gerbillurus vallinus and Tatera leucogaster. T. leucogaster
did not occur in the overgrazed area. Due to the loss of grass cover, smaller bush diversity, bush encroachment
and smaller arthropod abundance in the overgrazed area, changes in the small mammal community were most
likely caused by the loss of food resources, available dew, disruption of habitat structures, cover and shelter and by
increased predation risk. Only the desert species, G. vallinus, was favoured by the degraded land. It is also obvious
that the uncontrolled grazing in the communal lands has affected the biodiversity and the regeneration potential,
thus leading to land degradation."
319,Effects of land use on ant species composition and diaspore removal in exotic grasslands in the Brazilian Pantanal (Hymenoptera: Formicidae),Scientific article,Sociobiology,"The influence of pasture use intensity on ant-diaspore interactions was investigated in the Brazilian Pantanal. Ants were sampled using models of myrmecochorous diaspores placed in pastures with intensive and extensive use. The two types of pasture showed low ant species richness and high species similarity, suggesting that only a few species are able to persist in this simplified environment. Diaspore removal was higher in intensive use pastures, indicating a disturbance-related change in the interaction among ants and diaspores. The factors that may account for the observed pattern are discussed."
320,Grazing impacts on moth diversity and abundance on a Scottish upland estate,Scientific article,Insect Conservation and Diversity,"1. Livestock grazing is the most important direct management impact on
grasslands in upland areas of the UK. For phytophagous species, such as Lepidoptera,
the impact is primarily through grazing altering the species composition and structure of
the vegetation. However, specific impacts related to different grazing regimes are not
well understood for this group of insects.
2. Within a replicated controlled grazing experiment, nocturnal adult moths were
sampled by light trapping in the fifth year after establishment. Sampling effort was
standardised between the four grazing treatments by simultaneously using identical traps
in each treatment.
3. The highest-intensity grazing treatment produced the lowest moth abundance and
species richness. Ungrazed and low-intensity sheep grazing treatments produced the
highest moth abundance and species richness.
4. Moths that feed exclusively on graminoids and moths that overwinter as larvae
were disproportionately well represented in the ungrazed treatment.
5. A sub-set of species for which large declines have recently been documented in the
UK were most abundant in the ungrazed treatment. However, they made up the largest
proportion of the overall assemblage in the high-intensity grazing treatment.
6. Increased grazing inversely affects moth abundance and species richness. However,
effects are not even across all moth species. An absence of grazing is likely to negatively
affect the abundance of some moths, especially those that overwinter in the egg stage."
321,"Diversity Pattern of Bats at Two Contrasting Habitat Types along Kerian River, Perak, Malaysia",Scientific article,Tropical Life Sciences Research,"We present an assessment of the diversity of Malaysian bats at two contrasting habitat types (secondary forest and oil palm plantation) along the Kerian River surveyed between February 2009 and February 2010. Three hundred and twenty nine individual bats from 13 species representing 4 families were recorded using 10 mist nets. The most commonly caught bat in the secondary forest was Cynopterus brachyotis (n=75), followed by Macroglossus minimus (n=10). Meanwhile, in the oil palm plantation, the most commonly caught bat was Cynopterus brachyotis (n=109), followed by Cynopterus horsfieldi (n=76). The netting efforts were equal for both habitat types. The total sampling nights for each habitat type was 5460. The oil palm plantation had a greater bat abundance that was significantly different from that of the secondary forest, with 209 and 120 individuals, respectively (Mann-Whitney U-test = 31.5, p<0.05). Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in species richness between the two sites. However, the invasion by disturbance-associated species of the secondary forest is indicative of negative effects on the forest and animal diversity in this area. Forest managers should consider multiple measures of forest fragmentation sensitivity before making any forest management decisions."
322,Eufriesea violacea (Blanchard) (Hymenoptera: Apidae): an Orchid Bee Apparently Sensitive to Size Reduction in Forest Patches,Scientific article,Neotropical Entomology,"Eufriesea violacea (Blanchard) is a very seasonal euglossine species, more frequently found
in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil. A number of studies have revealed large variations in
the abundance of males of this species present in Atlantic Forest remnants throughout both regions. In
this paper, we report variations in the abundance of E. violacea males sampled in several forest patches
of different sizes (ranging from 10 to 580 ha), and we propose that this species is possibly sensitive to
the reduction in size of forest remnants. Surveys were carried out in nine forest remnants of Atlantic
rainforest located in northern Paraná State, southern Brazil. Male euglossine bees were collected with an
entomological net when visiting scent-baits, between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm, from October to December
of 2001 and 2006. A total of 360 E. violacea males were captured in the nine forest fragments studied.
The number of bees attracted to scent baits in each forest patch varied from zero to 261. A very high
association (r = 0.993) was detected between the forest patch size and the visitation rate of E. violacea males
at different sites, with the highest mean number of males visiting baits/sampling (43.5) being observed
for bees from the largest forest remnant. Although alternative hypothesis should not be discharged for
the decline in the abundance or absence of E. violacea in small forest patches, our results indicate that
populations of this euglossine species need larger forest areas for existing"
323,Bee communities (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) of small Iowa hill prairies are as diverse and rich as those of large prairie preserves,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Natural small, xeric hill prairies in forested landscapes throughout the Midwest
United States often contain high diversity and unique species of some organisms because
of their unusual landscape context and microclimate. We measured the diversity, richness,
and abundance of the bee communities of five hill prairies located in northeastern Iowa and
we compared these to values for large prairie preserves in northwestern Iowa, using a
Monte Carlo resampling approach to standardize sampling effort between habitat types.
We also measured the diversity and richness of the flowering forb communities at the hill
prairies and we quantified percentage of the landscape at a 1 km radius in different
landscape elements. Bee diversity at the five hill prairies spanned the range of diversity
values for large prairies preserves, so although the hill prairies are small ( ha), their bee
communities are not uniformly depauparate compared to larger western prairie preserves.
Bee diversity was significantly related to flowering forb diversity, and may have been
influenced by landscape features within 1 kmparticularly the percentage of agricultural
row crops and open water, which may negatively affect bee diversity at the sites. Iowas
hill prairie bee communities were largely composed of widespread eastern species,
although about 10% of the bee species have more northern or western ranges and appear to
be taking advantage of the regions unique habitat features. Given the dependence of the bee communities on the plant diversity of the sites, management of the plant community to
maintain its diversity will also likely benefit bee diversity."
324,Impacts of coffee agroforestry management on tropical bee communities,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Though it is undoubted that tropical bees are influenced by habitat composition, few studies have investigated
the relative importance of both local and landscape-level habitat parameters in supporting large
and diverse bee communities. The conservation of native bee communities within agroforestry landscapes
is particularly urgent given the importance of pollination services within these systems. In this
study, we examined tropical bee communities within a largely deforested shade coffee-growing region
in Chiapas, Mexico. We used regression tree modeling to examine the response of bee functional groups
to local and landscape-level habitat management. Our models revealed that the most predictive factors
for bee abundance and species richness were the number of tree species, the number of tree species in
flower, and the canopy cover of the local agroforestry landscape. Solitary bees were most abundant in
habitats with high canopy cover, while social bees were most abundant in habitats with greater tree species
richness. Cavity-nesting and wood-nesting bee abundance was positively affected by the amount of
canopy cover in the farm, while ground-nesting bees were most abundant in habitats with a large number
of tree species in flower. Our results demonstrate that across bee sociality groups, nesting guilds, and
tribes, the most critical factor impacting native bee communities was within-farm local vegetation management.
These results reveal the important role that agroforestry managers can have on biodiversity
conservation, and the potential contribution they can make by creating resource-rich agricultural matrices.
Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of diverse overstory tree management in supporting
native bee communities within tropical agroforestry systems."
325,Habitat Fragmentation Effects on the Orchid Bee Communities in Remnant Forests of Southeastern Brazil,Scientific article,Neotropical Entomology,"The effect of habitat fragmentation on the structure of orchid bee
communities was analyzed by the investigation of the existence of a
spatial structure in the richness and abundance of Euglossini species and
by determining the relationship between these data and environmental
factors. The surveys were carried out in four different forest fragments
and one university campus. Richness, abundance, and diversity of species
were analyzed in relation to abiotic (size of the area, extent of the
perimeter, perimeter/area ratio, and shape index) and biotic characteristics
(vegetation index of the fragment and of the matrix of each of the
locations studied). We observed a highly significant positive correlation
between the diversity index and the vegetation index of the fragment,
landscape and shape index. Our analysis demonstrated that the observed
variation could be explained mainly by the vegetation index and
the size of the fragment. Variations in relative abundance showed a
tendency toward an aggregated spatial distribution between the fragments
studied, as well as between the sampling stations within the
same habitat, demonstrating the existence of a spatial structure on a
small scale in the populations of Euglossini. This distribution will determine
the composition of species that coexist in the area after fragmentation.
These data help in understanding the differences and similarities
in the structure of communities of Euglossini resulting from forest
fragmentation."
326,Old fragments of forest inside an urban area are able to keep orchid bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) assemblages? The case of a Brazilian historical city,Scientific article,"Ecology, Behaviour and Bionomics","Retention of habitat fragments within the urban matrix can provide critical resources for the maintenance of regional biodiversity while still providing socio-economic value. Euglossini bees are important components in a community as they are important pollinators for economically valuable plants as well as hundreds of orchid species. However, some species are very sensitive to environmental impacts like urbanization. This study presents the role of antique urban fragments in a historical city in Brazil and compares it with a conservation area on the aspects of orchid bee assemblage, such as richness, composition, and abundance. Four fragments inside the city of Ouro Preto and three inside Parque Estadual do Itacolomi (PEIT) were sampled for Euglossini bees. Sorensen similarity index was used to compare community composition. The Mantel test was applied to verify the hypothesis that an urban center is a barrier for the mobility of the individuals. Fourteen Euglossini species from the region were registered. Close to 75% of the sampled bees were collected from the PEIT sampling areas. The fragments presented differences in Euglossini richness and abundance. A majority of the sampled fragments were dominated by the Eulaema cingulata Fabricius, Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, and Euglossa securigera Dressler species. We found differences on community composition between the fragments localized in PEIT and those located in the urban center. The data suggest that there is a possible flux of individuals between the sampled fragments. The various small forest fragments in Ouro Preto, primarily in backyards, may also serve as stepping stones between sampled fragments."
327,Human-Induced Disturbance Alters Pollinator Communities in Tropical Mountain Forests,Scientific article,Diversity,"Mountain forest ecosystems in the Andes are threatened by deforestation. Increasing fire frequencies lead to fire-degraded habitats that are often characterized by a persistent fern-dominated vegetation. Little is known about the consequences of these drastic changes in habitat conditions for pollinator communities. In a rapid diversity assessment, we collected individuals of two major groups of insect pollinators (bees and butterflies/moths) with pan traps and compared pollinator diversities in a spatial block design between forest interior, forest edge and adjacent fire-degraded habitats at eight sites in the Bolivian Andes. We found that bee species richness and abundance were significantly higher in fire-degraded habitats than in forest habitats, whereas species richness and abundance of butterflies/moths increased towards the forests interior. Species turnover between forest and fire-degraded habitats was very high for both pollinator groups and was reflected by an increase in the body size of bee species and a decrease in the body size of butterfly/moth species in fire-degraded habitats. We conclude that deforestation by frequent fires has profound impacts on the diversity and composition of pollinator communities. Our tentative findings suggest shifts towards bee-dominated pollinator communities in fire-degraded habitats that may have important feedbacks on the regenerating communities of insect-pollinated plant species."
328,Logging Legacies Affect Insect Pollinator Communities in Southern Appalachian Forests,Scientific article,Southeastern Naturalist,"Many temperate deciduous forests are recovering from past logging, but the
effects of logging legacies and environmental gradients on forest insect pollinators have
not been well studied. In this study, we asked how pollinator abundance and community
composition varied with distance from logging roads and elevation in old (logged >90 years
ago) and young (logged 2040 years ago) southern Appalachian forests. Insect pollinators
were sampled at 15 previously logged sites along an elevation gradient at 5 distances from
logging roads during summer 2010 and spring 2011 using pan traps. In summer, many pollinator
groups were more abundant in younger forests and closer to logging roads, likely due in part to more light availability and a greater abundance of floral resources near roads. Total bee abundance was greater near logging roads, but only in younger forests, suggesting that the role of roads in providing nectar and other resources may diminish as forests mature. In
spring, many pollinator families were less abundant at mid-distances (210 m) from roads
compared to road edges (0 m), but abundances were generally the same at 100 m from the
road as at road edges. Two important bee families, Apidae and Andrenidae, were strongly
associated with high elevations in spring. Our results suggest that logging legacies may
provide supplemental resources such as food and nesting sites to insect pollinators during
the summer months especially, with the effects of roads often extending at least 100 m into
young forests."
329,"Pollinator Interactions with Yellow Starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) across Urban, Agricultural, and Natural Landscapes",Scientific article,PLoSONE,"Pollinator-plant relationships are found to be particularly vulnerable to land use change. Yet despite extensive research in agricultural and natural systems, less attention has focused on these interactions in neighboring urban areas and its impact on pollination services. We investigated pollinator-plant interactions in a peri-urban landscape on the outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area, California, where urban, agricultural, and natural land use types interface. We made standardized observations of floral visitation and measured seed set of yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a common grassland invasive, to test the hypotheses that increasing urbanization decreases 1) rates of bee visitation, 2) viable seed set, and 3) the efficiency of pollination (relationship between bee visitation and seed set). We unexpectedly found that bee visitation was highest in urban and agricultural land use contexts, but in contrast, seed set rates in these human-altered landscapes were lower than in natural sites. An explanation for the discrepancy between floral visitation and seed set is that higher plant diversity in urban and agricultural areas, as a result of more introduced species, decreases pollinator efficiency. If these patterns are consistent across other plant species, the novel plant communities created in these managed landscapes and the generalist bee species that are favored by human-altered environments will reduce pollination services."
330,"Ecological and social drivers of coffee pollination in Santander, Colombia",Scientific report (published),"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Bees and other insects provide pollination services that are key to determining the fruit set on coffee plantations. These pollination services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors, both social and economic. To better understand these different factors, we assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in Santander, Colombia. We quantified the effect of key ecological drivers on pollinator community composition, such as the method of farm management (either conventional or organic) and the surrounding landscape composition, specifically the proximity to forest.

We found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the local pollinator fauna (open pollination) accounted for a 10.5 ± 2.0% increase in final coffee fruit set, and that the various pollinators are affected differently by the differing factors. For example, our findings indicate that conventional farm management, using synthetic inputs, can promote pollinators, especially if they are in close proximity to natural forest fragments. This is particularly true for stingless bees. Honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the conventional management of farms. Factors associated with greater numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover, lower tree densities, smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom, and younger coffee plantations. A forested landscape close to farms appears to enhance these factors, giving increased stability and resilience to the pollinating bees and insects. However we found that organic farms also support diverse pollinator communities, even if distant from forest fragments.

The contribution of honeybees to pollination value (US$129.6/ha of coffee) is greater than that of stingless bees (US$16.5/ha of coffee). Since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers and types of pollinators attracted to farms, we have analysed the statistically significant social factors that influence farmers decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices. These include the availability of technology, the type of landowner (whether married couples or individual owners), the number of years of farmers formal education, the role of institutions, membership of community organizations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm. It is hoped that the use of our holistic approach, which combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers of pollination, will help provide evidence to underpin the development of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into sustainable agricultural practices."
331,Landscape simplification decreases wild bee population services to strawberry,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Successful conservation of pollination services depends upon an understanding of the processes that
influence pollinator diversity within the landscape, as well as the relationship between pollinator
community composition and the provision of services. In this study, the influence of landscape
simplification on the composition of pollinator communities and the provisioning of pollination services
to cultivated strawberry was evaluated (Fragaria xananassa). Additionally the relative pollination
efficiency for the five most common bee genera visiting strawberry flowers was measured. Pollinators
were collected during bloom with pan traps on 14 commercial farms all growing the same strawberry
variety in the Finger Lakes Region, NY, USA. The farms were chosen to represent a gradient in the
proportion of agricultural land uses in the surrounding landscape from 0.09 to 0.60. Landscapes with
greater proportions of agricultural area had lower pollinator abundances and species richness. While
yield was positively correlated with pollinator abundance, species richness had little effect on the level of
pollination services. This conclusion was supported by the finding that visitor identity did not explain
pollination efficiency in strawberry. Our results show that a high proportion of agricultural land in the
landscape negatively impacts wild pollinators and pollination services to strawberry."

negative impact on biodiversity, little is known about how this specific type of
land conversion impacts wild pollinators.
2. In this study, we conduct an extensive survey of the wild pollinators of the
peach agroecosystem and investigate the impact of current and historic land use
at multiple spatial scales on pollinator community composition within agroeco-
logical landscapes that have recently undergone exurban development.
3. We reveal that the overall composition of the wild pollinator community is
significantly associated with current local agricultural and natural land cover.
Specifically, local agricultural land use was associated with ground-nesting bee
community composition, whereas natural lands were associated with cavity-
nesting bee composition, revealing that nesting materials drive community com-
position for these two groups in exurban habitats.
4. In contrast, community composition for butterflies and flies, which made
up the smallest proportion of our communities, were not strongly associated
with any particular land use type, likely due to their non-central place foraging
strategy.
5. Most interestingly, our results indicate that historic land use remains a sig-
nificant factor impacting the current abundance of all pollinators in the peach
agroecosystem, offering the first evidence of extinction debt in this rapidly
expanding exurban landscape"
333,Contrasting patterns in species and functional-trait diversity of bees in an agricultural landscape,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species losses will often result
in loss of trait diversity, with likely consequences for community functioning. However, the
converse need not be generally true: management approaches that succeed in retaining species
richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We evaluated this possibility using
bee communities in a California agroecosystem.
2. We examined among site patterns in bee species diversity and functional-trait diversity in
a landscape composed of a mosaic of semi-natural habitat, organic farms and conventional
farms. We sampled bees from all three habitat types and compiled a data base of life-history
(functional) traits for each species.
3. Although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms, functional
diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat. Nesting location
(below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary trait contributing to differences in functional
diversity between farms and natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability
of nesting substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including phenology and sociality,
were also associated with species occurrences or dominance in particular site types. These
patterns suggest that management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters
that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee communities.
4. Synthesis and applications. Although our results support the value of organic farming in
maintaining abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional diversity
are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice. Maintenance
of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural habitat elements to farms, is therefore
important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems"
334,Small-scale restoration in intensive agricultural landscapes supports more specialized and less mobile pollinator species,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Agriculture now constitutes 4050% of terrestrial land use globally. By enhancing habitat
suitability and connectivity, restoration within agricultural landscapes could have a major
influence on biodiversity conservation. However, habitat management within intensive agricultural
landscapes may primarily boost abundances of common, highly mobile generalists,
rather than vulnerable or endangered species. We studied pollinator community response to
small-scale habitat restoration in the intensively farmed Central Valley of California to determine
whether restoration could also promote more specialized, less common and/or less
mobile species.
2. Composition of pollinator communities was assessed in five experimental and 10 control
(unrestored) sites before and after restoration of native plant hedgerows over an 8-year period,
using a before-after control-impact design.
3. We characterized bee and fly species based on functional response traits [floral specialization,
habitat specialization, abundance, body size and sociality (bees only)] known to influence
the response to habitat change.
4. We modelled how species occurrences changed with habitat restoration over time as modulated
by their response traits.
5. We found that hedgerows not only significantly enhanced occurrences of native bee and
syrphid fly species, but that as hedgerows matured, they had a greater positive effect on species
that were more specialized in floral and nesting resources and smaller (less mobile).
6. Synthesis and applications. Unlike previous studies that suggest habitat restoration in agricultural
landscapes only benefits mobile, generalist species, our results suggest that small-scale
habitat restoration can promote species whose traits likely render them particularly vulnerable
to habitat degradation. Thus, even within highly intensive agricultural landscapes, small-scale
habitat restoration can be a conservation management tool. However, tailoring habitat
enhancements to promote certain species or guilds may be critical for their success as a conservation
intervention in agricultural landscapes."
335,"Temporal dynamics influenced by global change: bee community phenology in urban, agricultural, and natural landscapes",Scientific article,Global Change Biology,"Urbanization and agricultural intensification of landscapes are important drivers of global change, which in turn have
direct impacts on local ecological communities leading to shifts in species distributions and interactions. Here, we
illustrate how human-altered landscapes, with novel ornamental and crop plant communities, result not only in
changes to local community diversity of floral-dependent species, but also in shifts in seasonal abundance of bee
pollinators. Three years of data on the spatio-temporal distributions of 91 bee species show that seasonal patterns of
abundance and species richness in human-altered landscapes varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in
which floral resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months. These findings demonstrate that anthropogenic
environmental changes in urban and agricultural systems, here mediated through changes in plant resources
and water inputs, can alter the temporal dynamics of pollinators that depend on them. Changes in phenology of
interactions can be an important, though frequently overlooked, mechanism of global change."
336,"The Conservation biology of the Leopard Panthera pardus in Gabon: Status, threats and strategies for conservation",PhD thesis,PhD Thesis,"Tropical rainforests comprise a large part of the leopards (Panthera pardus) habitat
in Africa, but baseline knowledge of leopard ecology and responses to human disturbance in
African forests remain largely unknown. Because of low visibility in forested environments,
study methods developed for leopards in open habitats are impractical, but recent advances
in the application of camera trapping techniques to monitor tigers in India allowed this first
systematic study on leopard abundance and distribution in the African rainforest
environment. To assess the impact of bushmeat hunting on leopards, camera trap data was
collected in four rainforest sites in central Gabon exposed to varying levels of anthropogenic
disturbance. We analysed these data using capture-recapture models to estimate leopard
densities, and employed occupancy modelling to investigate the factors affecting leopard
distribution. Over survey periods of 39-62 days, 15-31 camera trap stations were sampled
that effectively covered 119-232 km2 of leopard habitat. No leopards were photographed at
the most heavily hunted site, and 24-46 leopard photographs were obtained in the remaining
areas, representing 4-15 different individuals. Population densities were estimated at 2.7-
12.1 leopards/100 km2, and occupancy modelling suggested that leopard use of an area
increased with prey abundance and distance from settlements"
337,"Bushmeat hunting in Dwesa and Cwebe Nature Reserves, Eastern Cape, South Africa",Scientific article,South African Journal of Wildlife Research,"Reports of bushmeat hunting as a threatening process are almost entirely restricted to tropical biomes and developing countries. Mammalian fauna within South Africas fenced reserves could be considered immune to such threats; however, there has been no study testing this.Transects were conducted throughout the fenced,temperate coastal indigenous forested reserves of Dwesa and Cwebe to detect sign (observations, footprints, faeces) of medium and large mammals, and evidence of poaching (snares, human footprints, bullet cartridges). I used generalized linear models of relative abundance data to identify the most likely causes of population decline and presence/absence data to identify the most likely causes of local extinction. Two of the largest mammals (white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum and eland,Tragelaphus oryx, were the only species that had distance to the reserve boundary (and hunting humans) as the most important factors affecting their distribution; however, three other ungulates avoided humans (avoided reserve boundary or roads). Highly unusual habitat use (forest restriction) was observed for several normally grassland inhabitants, illustrating the perceived risks associated with open habitats. This study illustrates that bushmeat hunting is not a threat restricted to the Third World tropics and that conservation areas require monitoring, as well as fencing, to ensure poaching does not threaten wildlife."
338,"Game Vertebrate Densities in Hunted and Nonhunted Forest Sites in Manu National Park, Peru",Authored material shared with the project,Biotropica,"Manu National Park of southern Peru is one of the most renowned protected areas in the world, yet large-bodied vertebrate surveys conducted to date have been restricted to Cocha Cashu Biological Station, a research station covering o0.06 percent of the 1.7Mha park. Manu Park is occupied by 4460 settled Matsigenka Amerindians, 300400 isolated Matsigenka, and several, little-known groups of isolated huntergatherers, yet the impact of these native Amazonians on game vertebrate populations within the park remains poorly understood. On the basis of 1495km of standardized line-transect censuses, we present density and biomass estimates for 23 mammal, bird, and reptile species for seven lowland and upland forest sites in Manu Park, including Cocha Cashu. We compare these estimates between hunted and nonhunted sites within Manu Park, and with other Neotropical forest sites. Manu Park safeguards some of the most species-rich and highest biomass assemblages of arboreal and terrestrial mammals ever recorded in Neotropical forests, most likely because of its direct Andean influence and high levels of soil fertility. Relative to Barro Colorado Island, seed predators and arboreal folivores in Manu are rare, and generalist frugivores specializing on mature fruit pulp are abundant. The impact of such a qualitative shift in the vertebrate community on the dynamics of plant regeneration, and therefore, on our understanding of tropical plant ecology, must be profound. Despite a number of external threats, Manu Park continues to serve as a baseline against which other Neotropical forests can be gauged."
339,"Forest duiker (Cephalophus spp.) abundance and hunting activities in the Kakum conservation area, Ghana",Authored material shared with the project,Journal Of Ecology and Natural Environment,"The abundance of forest duikers (Cephalophus spp.) was compared to the incidence of hunting
activities in the Kakum conservation area, Ghana. Transect surveys indicated that four duiker species
were present: Maxwells duiker (Cephalophus maxwellii), Bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), Black
duiker (Cephalophus niger), and Yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus silvicultor). The indicators of
hunting activities included the presence of empty cartridges, snares, gunshots, carbide powder,
poachers camps and arrest of poachers. Seasons fluctuations and hunting activities appear to have
effect on duiker abundance; the study could have strong evidence to establish it. A long term duiker
population monitoring program is required in the area in order to come out with strong factors affecting
duiker populations and their implications on conservation of wildlife resources."
340,Carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) at forest-farmland edges in southern Finland,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"We studied carabid beetle abundance at eight forest-farmland edges using pitfall traps across 60-m gradients
(30 m into the forest, 30 m into the adjacent farmland) in southern Finland in MayAugust 2001.
Carabid assemblages changed gradually across the studied gradients, the most drastic changes occurring
right at the edge (5 m). Forest-associated carabids were often caught in farmland habitat within 2030 m
from the edges, and open-habitat carabids were also caught in the forest patches. However, these two
groups responded to the edge in slightly different ways. Forest carabids were abundant all across the
gradient from forest interior to the edge (0 m), while open-habitat carabids showed a drastic abundance
decrease toward the forest, 510 m before the edge the abundance-change slope across the edge: gradient
was steeper for open-habitat than for forest carabids. Wing-dimorphic and long-winged carabids increased
more steeply from forest to farmland, compared to short-winged carabids. Moreover, carabids associated
with dry and moist habitat showed indications of stronger response to the edge than did eurytopic species.
The pair-wise comparisons between predatory/mixed-diet carabids and seed-eaters, spring and autumn
breeders, and day- and night-active species did not indicate edge-response differences."
341,"Oribatid mite (Acari) community structure in steppic habitats of Burgos Province, central northern Spain",Scientific article,Journal of Natural History,"This work is a study of the communities of oribatid mites in steppic areas of Burgos Province, central
northern Spain, in relation to different habitat types belonging to natural or disturbed ecosystems.
The primary objective was to find the relationship between anthropogenic use of land and several
diversity indices. Parameters such as abundance, species richness, real diversity (H9) and equitability
(J9) of the mite communities were calculated in 20 soil plots, sampled in spring and autumn 2000,
belonging to the predominant habitat types of this area: (1) cultivated lands, (2) abandoned crop
lands, (3) grasslands/pastures, and (4) natural oak forests or a pine plantation. The most widespread
species in the area as well as the most abundant taxa overall are documented, together with the
faunistic checklist of oribatid mites identified in the study. The results show a general decline in the
composition of the oribatid community, in terms of species diversity and abundance, from nondisturbed
soils to cultivated lands. The number of species (richness) was usually higher in forest soils
than in disturbed ecosystems, in which the most degraded soils showed the lowest number of species.
The community analysis shows the differences due to habitat type and ubiquitous bioindicator
species."
342,Effect of land-use heterogeneity on carabid communities at the landscape scale,Scientific article,Ecography,"Carabid beetle assemblages were studied to assess how diversity and community
structure varied along a gradient of land-use. This gradient was composed of six 1 km2
quadrats with an increasing proportion of agricultural land reflecting the
anthropogenic fragmentation and intensification of landscapes. Carabid species
richness and abundance was predicted to peak in the most heterogeneous landscape,
in accord with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), and then decline as
agricultural intensification increased. It was also predicted that the different landscapes
would support beetle communities distinct from each other. The IDH was
unsupported-in both years of this study carabid species richness and abundance was
greatest in the most intensively managed, agricultural sites. Detrended correspondence
analysis revealed a clear separation in beetle community structure between forested and
open habitats and between different forest types. Canonical correspondence analysis
revealed a significant correlation between beetle community structure and the
environment, showing distinct beetle assemblages to be significantly associated with
specific edaphic and botanical features of the land-use gradient. This study adds to
increasing evidence that landscape-scale patterns in land-use significantly affect beetle
community structure producing distinct assemblages."
343,"Effects of abandonment of subalpine hay meadows on plant and invertebrate diversity in Transylvania, Romania",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Recent changes in agriculture (intensification or abandonment) have resulted in a critical
reduction of semi-natural grasslands in Eastern Europe. Subalpine semi-natural grasslands
in Transylvania, Romania, harbour a high diversity of plants and invertebrates,
including endemics, and are considered refugia for numerous threatened open-land species.
We investigated effects of land abandonment by examining species richness, species
abundance, proportion of open-land, endemic and threatened vascular plants, gastropods,
and diurnal and nocturnal Lepidoptera in extensive hay meadows (initial stage),
and three seral stages of succession (early stage of abandoned hay meadow, naturally
growing birch forest, and mature forest) in the mountainous region of Baisoara in Transylvania.
A total of 626 species (225 vascular plants, 16 gastropods, 68 diurnal and 317
nocturnal Lepidoptera) were found in the 16 study sites (four replicates per successional
stage). The four taxonomic groups differed in their response to the abandonment of hay
meadows. Each stage of succession harboured the maximum species richness for one
taxonomic group: extensive hay meadows for vascular plants, abandoned hay meadows
for diurnal Lepidoptera, birch forests for nocturnal Lepidoptera, and mature forests for
gastropods. In all four taxonomic groups the complementarity of species composition
increased with successional age, whereas the number of characteristic open-land species
decreased with successional age. The four successional stages did not differ in proportion
of red-listed plant and diurnal Lepidoptera species. In nocturnal Lepidoptera, however,
the proportion of red-listed species increased with successional age. Furthermore, successional
stages did not differ in number of plant species endemic to the Carpathians and
Eastern Europe. Our results indicate the high conservation value of all stages of subalpine
grassland succession for the indigenous biodiversity of Transylvania. To prevent losses of
characteristic species, we suggest a rotational grassland management program that
maintains different successional stages."
344,Long-term succession of oribatid mites after conversion of croplands to grasslands,Scientific article,Applied Soil Ecology,"The paper deals with the long-term development (55 years) of oribatid communities (Acari) during grassland succession
following the conversion of arable fields. The study was carried out on a chronosequence of temperate grassland sites in the Lahn-
Dill-Bergland (Central Hesse, Germany). The space-for-time substitution method was applied. Increasing abundance at early
stages of the conversion process (until the age of 1328 years) points to release from the stress exerted by arable management.
Saturation of abundance and richness indicates strong limiting forces acting upon the oribatid community at intermediate and late
stages of succession. The continuous increase in the dominance of surface-dwelling and non-specialized species suggests a
considerable change in the nature of these limiting forces during the successional process. General Regression Model (GRM)
analysis revealed an increasing impact of external factors on the oribatid community during grassland succession, and a shift in the
major driving forces determining oribatid abundance from soil conditions to vegetation conditions and then to a combined effect of
both soil and vegetation conditions."
345,Response of collembolan communities to land-use change and grassland succession,Scientific article,Ecography,"This study focuses on the long-term changes of collembolan communities occurring after the conversion of
arable land to managed grassland. We analysed collembolan communities at grassland sites of different age that
had been gradually converted over a period of 50 yr. Abundance and biomass responded rapidly and very
positively to the conversion of arable land to grassland, while species richness was not affected. Collembolan
assemblages changed only little during grassland maturation. The impact of land-use change on community
structure was more obvious at the functional level because the colonization processes observed in our study
mostly relied on hemiedaphic species. Vegetation and soil parameters were good predictors of collembolan
community structure during development of managed grassland. The present study demonstrated that past
landscape patterns and processes like land-use conversion and subsequent succession had a considerable impact
on the present day pattern of species richness and community composition of Collembola within a landscape.
Our results strongly differ from those obtained for other invertebrate groups, highlighting on the one hand the
very diverse reactions of invertebrates to a common factor, and on the other hand the need to survey more than
one taxa in order to draw conclusions on effects of land-use change on faunistic communities."
346,The potential of grass field margin management for enhancing beetle diversity in intensive livestock farms,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1.
Declining populations of UK grassland flora and fauna have been attributed to
intensification of agricultural management practices, including changes in cutting, fertilizer,
grazing and drainage regimes. We aimed to develop field margin management
practices that could reverse declines in intensively managed grassland biodiversity that
would have application in the UK and Europe. Here we focus on one aspect of grassland
biodiversity, the beetles.
2.
In four intensively managed livestock farms in south-west England, 10-m wide field
margins in existing grasslands were managed to create seven treatments of increasing
sward architectural complexity. This was achieved through combinations of inorganic
(NPK) fertilizer, cattle grazing, and timing and height of cutting. To examine the potential
influence of complexity on faunal diversity, beetles were identified to species level
from suction samples taken between 2003 and 2005, and their assemblage structure was
related to margin management, floral assemblages and sward architecture.
3.
Beetle abundance, and species richness and evenness were influenced by margin
management treatment and its interaction with year. Correlations with sward architecture
and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses were also found. Functional
groups of the beetles showed different responses to the management treatments. In
particular, higher proportional abundances of seed/flower-feeding guilds were found
in treatments not receiving NPK fertilizer.
4.
The assemblage structure was shown to respond to margin management treatments,
sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses. The most
extensively managed treatments were characterized by distinct successional trajectories
from the control treatment.
5.
Synthesis and applications.
This study provides management options suitable for use
within agri-environment schemes intended to improve faunal diversity associated with
intensively managed lowland grasslands. Field margins receiving either no management
or a single July silage cut were shown to support greater abundances and species richness
of beetles, although subtler modifications of conventional management may also
be beneficial, for example the absence of NPK fertilizer while maintaining grazing and
silage cutting systems."
347,Plant diversity in crop fields and woody hedgerows of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of contrasting agricultural practices in organic and conventional farming (local
factors), and to evaluate the influence of surrounding landscape features (regional factors) on plant assemblages, taking into account habitat
structure. Plants were inventoried in crop fields and woody hedgerows (boundary and centre) of 16 conventional and 14 organic sites. Habitat
structure, agricultural practices and landscape characteristics were quantified for each habitat. Hedgerow boundaries contained a higher
number of plant species than adjacent habitats although many of them were exotics. However, exotics comprised a decreasing proportion of
species richness from field to hedgerow centre. Many of the exotic species were shared between crop fields and adjacent boundaries. There
was a clear difference in species richness and composition between the organic and conventional study sites. Fields and woody hedgerows
situated in organic sites consistently harboured more native and exotic plant species than those in conventional systems. Numerous species
were only found in organic hedgerows and included several long-lived herbaceous forest species. At the larger scale level, old-fields (areas
with sparse shrubs and trees re-colonizing cleared land) were the only habitats that significantly influenced the species composition of
hedgerows, particularly exotic species. Conversely, farm type was a significant predictor of native species richness."
348,The early effects of afforestation on biodiversity of grasslands in Ireland,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The target rate of afforestation in Ireland over the next 30 years is 20,000 ha
per year, which would result in an increase of the forest cover from the current 10% to
17%. In order to promote sustainable forest management practices, it is essential to know
the composition and conservation value of habitats where afforestation is planned and the
effects of subsequent planting upon biodiversity. The objectives of this study were to
investigate changes in vegetation composition and diversity of grasslands 5 years after
afforestation with Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and determine the primary ecological and
management factors responsible for these changes. Species cover, environmental and
management data were collected from 16 afforested and unplanted improved and wet
grassland site pairs in Ireland. Our results indicate that 5 years after tree planting, there
were significant changes in richness, composition, and abundance of species. Competitive
and vigorous grasses were more abundant in planted than in unplanted sites, as were
generalist species found in both open and wooded habitats, while small-stature shadesensitive
species were less abundant. Vascular plant species richness and Shannons
diversity index were higher in unplanted wet grassland, than in the planted sites. Bryophyte
species richness was higher in planted improved grassland than in unplanted sites. The
differences were primarily the result of the exclusion of grazing, ground preparation,
changes in nutrient management and drainage for afforestation. Drainage ditches provided
a temporary habitat for less competitive species, but the overall effect of drainage was to
reduce the diversity of species dependent on wet conditions. Variance partitioning showed
differences in the relative influences of environmental and management variables on
biodiversity in the two habitats, probably due to the greater pre-afforestation grazing
pressure and fertilisation levels in improved grasslands. The differences in biodiversity between planted and unplanted grasslands indicate that afforestation represents a threat to
semi-natural habitats where distinctive and highly localised plant communities could
potentially occur."
349,"Effects of exotic conifer plantations on the biodiversity of understory plants, epigeal beetles and birds in Nothofagus dombeyi forests",Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Plantations of exotic conifers are a potential threat to natural ecosystems in the Argentinean Patagonia and a major cause of native forest loss in
Chile.We examined species diversity and composition of three different functional groups: understory vascular plants, epigeal beetles, and birds, in
paired stands of relatively undisturbed Nothofagus dombeyi forest and coniferous plantations. We also characterized the structure of each stand.
Exotic plantations generated significant impacts on biodiversity, diminishing species richness, abundance and diversity, and generating
modifications in assemblage composition. Replacement of N. dombeyi forests by conifer plantations led to a homogenization of habitat structure
at the stand scale. The largest impact was detected on understory plants, followed by the beetle and bird assemblages, supporting the view that the
least vagile assemblages are most affected by habitat replacement. The most relevant modifications caused by the plantations on the structure and
composition of the studied assemblages were a reduction in evenness in plants and beetles, an increase of exotic species richness from 16 to 29% in
plants and from none to one species in birds, and a loss of rare and specialist species in all three assemblages. Our findings suggest that plantations
with more open canopy could favor biodiversity by increasing individual abundance and species richness of all three assemblages."
350,How does grazing intensity influence the diversity of plants and insects in a species-rich upland grassland on basalt soils?,Scientific article,Grass and Forage Science,"The effect of stocking rate on the species richness,
abundance and functional diversity of vascular plants,
butterflies and grasshoppers was examined in a seminatural
upland pasture in central France. Over a 5-year
period, 3Æ6-ha plots were continuously grazed by
Charolais heifers at 1Æ4 (High stocking rate), 1Æ0 (Intermediate)
and 0Æ6 (Low) livestock units (LU) ha)1. To
evaluate botanical diversity, percentage cover of all
plant species was estimated in late July in ten fixed
1 m · 1 m quadrats per plot. Butterflies were counted
on three occasions between late June and early August
along three fixed 50-m-long transects per plot using the
Pollard walk, with grasshoppers being recorded on two
occasions along the same transects. Diversity patterns of
the three taxa were affected by stocking rate. For plants,
species abundance changed more than species number.
Abundance of forbs became higher under the Low
compared with the High stocking rate. Stress-tolerant
grasses were also more abundant in plots grazed at the
Low stocking rate, while an opposite trend was
observed for competitive grasses. Butterflies consistently
responded to alterations in vegetation composition,
especially to the dynamics of nectar plants. The
species richness of grasshoppers also increased in plots
at the Low stocking rate. The Low and Intermediate
stocking rates were suitable for providing a high
diversity of the three taxonomic groups. The results
suggested that at least butterfly diversity would peak in
vegetation taller than that of vascular plants."
351,Soil fauna in sheep-grazed hill pastures under organic and conventional livestock management and in an adjacent ungrazed pasture,Scientific article,Pedobiologia,"Organic pasture management includes a focus on mixed livestock grazing, restrictions on nutrient inputs
and livestock pest control. These are all factors which influence the environment of soil invertebrates.
In this study, soil macrofauna, mesofauna and microfauna were collected from duplicate 11 and 20 year
old organic and conventional legume-based sheep-grazed pasture systems. Pastures in both systems had
received the same annual input of reactive phosphate rock and elemental sulphur and were stocked with
the same numbers of sheep. The major difference between the two systems was absence of the chemical
control of livestock pests on the organic system, resulting in lower sheep liveweights. Two ungrazed
pastures which had not received any nutrient inputs for 20+ years were also sampled as part of the study
to provide an additional contrast.
No significant differences in either the diversity or abundance of the soil invertebrate community were
found between the organic and conventional systems, despite the use of chemicals in the conventional
system. The lack of difference suggests that many of the observed and reported responses to organic
managementreflect altered nutrient inputs and grazingmanagement(which were thesamein the current
study), rather than the cessation of chemical controls in the organic system. In contrast, the invertebrate
community in the unfertilised, ungrazed pasture was distinctly different from both the grazed systems.
The ungrazed pasture had a higher diversity with more New Zealand endemic species than the grazed
pasture. This included twice as many large Oribatida as soil pore size increased. The lower litter quality
from the lack of nutrient inputs in the ungrazed pasturewasreflected in both lower earthworm abundance
and the Nematode Channel Ratio (indicative of a higher proportion of fungal- than bacterial-feeding
nematodes), than the grazed pasture.
We conclude that organic management when limited to a comparison of livestock pest control is not
beneficial to soil invertebrates. Management practices such as stocking rates and fertiliser regime, by
altering the soil physical environment and food resources, are more important in influencing invertebrate
populations in this soil. Some would argue these altered management practices are an integral part of an
organic production system."
352,"Effect of land abandonment on the vegetation of upland semi-natural grasslands in the Western Balkan Mts., Bulgaria",Scientific article,Plant Biosystems,"The area of semi-natural grasslands in Bulgaria has decreased tremendously in the past century due to agricultural
intensification or abandonment. As these grasslands host valuable biodiversity, conservation measures are needed for their
sustainable maintenance. We studied the effect of pastureland abandonment on plant communities at the Ponor Mt., a part
of the Balkan Mts., Bulgaria. Data on floristic composition, vegetation structure and several abiotic parameters were
collected in 137 randomly located 16-m2 plots in 2008. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyse how
species composition is related to abiotic and land use factors. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to test for the
effects of sheep grazing vs. abandonment on vegetation structure and composition. The main environmental factors
explaining the compositional variation were related to the altitude, sheep grazing and soil depth. Pastureland abandonment
led to an increase in vegetation height and of the richness of mesophytes and leafy plants, and red-list species. Grazed plots
had higher total species richness, more xerophytes, rosette forming and spring-flowering species. To ensure the persistence
of the species of both the open grasslands and mid-successional grassland communities, the management should be carried
out in an extensive way and with a zonation regime."
353,Grazing impacts on Auchenorrhyncha diversity and abundance on a Scottish upland estate,Scientific article,Insect Conservation and Diversity,"1. Livestock grazing impacts on insect populations in a variety of ways.
For phytophagous insects the impact is primarily a result of altering the structure and
species assemblage of vegetation. However not all species react in similar ways and
even within an order there may be winners and losers from different grazing regimes.
2. A long-term, replicated, controlled experiment, comprising four grazing treatments,
was established within an upland acid grassland area in Scotland. Auchenorrhyncha
were sampled by suction sampling and sweep-netting in the fifth year
following the start of the treatments.
3. A significant treatment effect was apparent in the suction samples with Auchenorrhyncha
abundance being three to four times higher in the ungrazed plots compared
to the other treatments. Abundance was also highest from the ungrazed plots
in the sweep net samples, but this effect was not statistically significant. Redundancy
analysis (RDA) showed that a suite of species which are typical of shaded positions
responded with increased abundance in the ungrazed plots.
4. The findings demonstrate that the assemblages found in ungrazed areas can be
vastly different to those found in even lightly grazed areas and therefore, underline
the benefits of varied grazing regimes in maximising diversity. Furthermore, the
work underlines the benefit of employing multiple sampling methods."
354,Does Cattle Grazing Affect Ant Abundance and Diversity in Temperate Grasslands?,Scientific article,Rangeland Ecology and Management,"Half of the worlds land base is grazed by domesticated livestock. Because of the important functional role of ants in grasslands,
it is important to understand the effect of livestock grazing on ant abundance and diversity. The objectives of this study were to
examine the effect of cattle grazing and site productivity on the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of ants in Lac
du Bois Grasslands Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. We hypothesized that the measured ant variables would be
lowest in grazed areas and at low site productivity. Pitfall trapping was conducted at four sites: two at each low and high site
productivity levels. At each site an ungrazed (fenced exclosure) and grazed transect was sampled during May, July, and August
of 2008. Captured ants were preserved in ethanol and identified. Eight genuses of ants were collected: Tapinoma, Camponotus,
Formica, Lasius, Aphaenogaster, Myrmica, Solinopsis, and Temnotharox. The mean number of ants per pitfall was higher at
high site productivity sites that were grazed (15.1062.96 SE) compared to high productivity sites ungrazed (3.2860.47 SE);
grazing at low productivity reduced numbers of ants from 5.07 (60.70 SE) to 2.20 (60.39 SE) (F521.806; P,0.001).
Tapinoma sessile and A. occidentalis had the greatest numbers in the pitfall traps. Species richness (F523.330, P,0.001) and
diversity (F511.764, P50.001) followed a similar trend. Because productivity and cattle grazing affect ant diversity and
abundance, and ants impact ecosystem functioning, these factors should be considered in management of grasslands."
355,"The impact of forest conversion to oil palm on arthropod abundance and biomass in Sabah, Malaysia",Scientific article,Journal of Tropical Ecology,"Deforestation rates in South-East Asia are among the highest of any tropical region, with expansion of oil
palm being one important factor. Despite this, few studies have investigated the impact of oil palm expansion on the
arthropod fauna. We report here the first study on the impact of forest conversion to oil palm on overall arthropod
abundance, biomass and composition. We compared arthropod abundance and biomass, collected from epiphytic
birds nest ferns, the canopy, and leaf litter between primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. Epiphytes,
canopy and litter all contained a lower abundance (epiphytes: 67.2%, canopy: 2.3% and litter: 77.1% reduction)
and biomass (epiphytes: 87.5%, canopy: 37.9% and litter: 72.4% reduction) of arthropods in oil palm compared with
primary forest. However, not all orders of arthropods showed the same level of decline, with some groups having higher
abundance and biomass in oil palm, resulting in an altered community composition in the epiphytes and canopy in oil
palm compared with forest. Our results show that forest conversion to oil palm impacts detrimentally on invertebrates
in all compartments of the forest ecosystem."
358,Bird species richness in a Bornean exotic tree plantation: A long-term perspective,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"To provide sustainable income from forestlands, large areas in the tropics are planted with agricultural trees, such as oil palm and rubber, and industrial trees, such as Acacia mangium and Gmelina arborea. To examine how native forest birds use such plantations, we surveyed in 2005 the avifauna at Sabah Softwoods, a plantation in southeastern Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We focused on A. mangium, Albizia (Paraserianthes falcataria), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), and logged native forest, and compared our results to those of a study conducted at the same plantation in 1982. The number of forest species in the industrial groves did not change dramatically between 1982 and 2005, even though the trees had been cropped several times and the plantation was, by 2005, completely surrounded by cleared land and far removed from primary forest. However, as is common in logged or isolated forests throughout the world, certain primary forest groups (e.g., muscicapine flycatchers) have been extirpated from the entire plantation area. The industrial groves also lacked some larger species of kingfisher, woodpeckers, and canopy frugivores. Nevertheless, numerous primary forest taxa (ca. 50% of species) were found in mature industrial tree groves. Albizia attracted the most species of birds, followed closely by Acacia. Both tree types underpinned relatively complex secondary forests that attracted forest birds. In contrast, younger groves of Acacia and Albizia held mainly open country and scrub species. Oil palm, as a remarkably simple and unusual habitat, attracted few bird species. Sustained occurrence of forest birds in all groves of exotic
trees at Sabah Softwoods was substantially enhanced by the relatively rich avifauna of the logged native
forest remaining in substantial stands throughout the plantation."
359,Reconciling Food Production and Biodiversity Conservation: Land Sharing and Land Sparing Compared,Scientific article,Science,"The question of how to meet rising food demand at the least cost to biodiversity requires the evaluation of two contrasting alternatives: land sharing, which integrates both objectives on the same land; and land sparing, in which high-yield farming is combined with protecting natural habitats from conversion to agriculture. To test these alternatives, we compared crop yields and densities of bird and tree species across gradients of agricultural intensity in southwest Ghana and northern India. More species were negatively affected by agriculture than benefited from it, particularly among species with small global ranges. For both taxa in both countries, land sparing is a more promising strategy for minimizing negative impacts of food production, at both current and anticipated future levels of production."
360,"Bird species richness and abundance in different forest types at Kakamega Forest, western Kenya",Scientific article,Ostrich,"The avifauna of differently disturbed forest types of Kakamega Afrotropical forest were compared from December 2004 to
May 2005. A total of 11 220 individual birds comprising of 129 bird species were recorded. Significant differences in abun-
dance of birds among Psidium guajava, Bischoffia javanica, mixed indigenous, regeneration, Maesopsis eminii and primary
forests was found. The Shannon index of bird diversity (H) varied from 1.31 in P. guajava to 1.56 in primary forest. There
were no significant differences in the density of the forest bird category that the different forest types supported with 22
species occurring in all the forest types. There was no significant difference (F 0.05 (59), 110 = 1.15, p = 0.26) in the bird feeding
guilds observed in the different forest types. The results indicate that disturbed and plantation forests supported a lower
diversity and abundance of birds than primary, mixed indigenous and regeneration forests. Furthermore, the results indicate
that both exotic and indigenous plantations can enhance bird diversity and abundance at sites where natural forest
succession is slow or where the indigenous forest is being threatened as in Kakamega."
361,"Small mammal diversity and density on the Bokkeveld escarpment, South Africa - implications for conservation and livestock predation",Scientific article,African Zoology,"A preliminary investigation of the diversity and density
of small mammals in four structurally distinct habitat
types in an actively-utilized farming landscape was
carried out. We sought to understand how diversity
and density are influenced by landscape structure,
habitat structure and management decisions.
Farmers in the area believe small mammals provide a
service as an alternative food source, other than
sheep, for predators. We assessed the validity of this
reported ecosystem service. A total of 10 species and
219 individuals were recorded during this survey of
3600 trap-nights, with a total trap success rate of
6.1%. Significantly more individuals were caught
during the winter than in summer. Vegetation trans-
formation had a negative impact on small mammal
diversity. Density, diversity and distribution were
correlated with vegetation and landscape structural
diversity. Management decisions that reduce vegetation
structure and cover will have a negative impact on
small mammal density and diversity. Ensuring the
conservation of small mammals may have the benefit
of providing an alternative food source to predators, a
valuable ecosystem service to farmers."
362,"Determinants of diversity in afrotropical herbivorous insects (Lepidoptera: Geometridae): plant diversity, vegetation structure or abiotic factors?",Scientific article,Journal of Biogeography,"Aim This study was conducted to investigate the potential of predicting alpha
diversity and turnover rates of a highly diverse herbivorous insect family
(Geometridae) based on vascular plant species richness and vegetation structure.
Location The study was carried out on the south-western slopes of Mount
Kilimanjaro within a wide range of habitats between 1200 and 3150 m elevation.
Methods The floristic and structural composition of the vegetation was
recorded at 48 plots of 400 m2. Geometrid moths were sampled manually at
light sources located at the plot centres. Principal components analysis,
redundancy analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore how
alpha diversity and species turnover of geometrid moths are related to vegetation
structure and plant species richness.
Results Alpha diversity of geometrid moths was significantly correlated with
species diversity patterns in the most common vascular plant families (R2 = 0.49)
and with plant structural parameters (R2 = 0.22), but not with overall floristic
diversity. Species turnover of geometrid moths was strongly linked to diversity
changes in a range of plant families (40% explained variance), less strongly to
changes in vegetation physiognomy (25%), and only weakly to overall floristic
diversity (5%). Changes in elevation were a better predictor of both alpha
diversity and species turnover of geometrid moths than any principal component
extracted from the vegetation data.
Main conclusions Vegetation composition, diversity and structure all showed
significant correlations with the diversity and species composition of geometrid
moth assemblages. Nevertheless, in most cases relationships were indirect, via
environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity, which influenced
both vegetation and moth fauna. Possible direct links between geometrid diversity
and potential food plants were much weaker. The lack of a significant correlation
between overall plant species richness and geometrid diversity indicates that
tropical geometrid moths may not be very selective in their food plant choice.
Accordingly, a clear correlation between floral diversity and herbivore species
richness must be regarded as overly simplistic, and the diversity of vascular plants
cannot universally be used as a suitable biodiversity indicator for diverse insect
taxa at higher trophic levels."
363,"The effect of ploughing and augmenting natural vegetation with commercial fynbos species on the biodiversity of Overberg Sandstone fynbos on the Agulhas Plain, South Africa",Scientific article,South African Journal of Botany,"In an attempt to reconcile wildflower cultivation with plant diversity conservation, we investigate the effect that different augmentation
techniques (including ploughing and burning) have on the plant diversity of the Fynbos Biome. We evaluated the effects of two ploughing
intensities followed by augmentation at one site, and augmentation without ploughing at another on the plant diversity in Overberg Sandstone
fynbos on the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. Results showed that plant diversity was the highest in areas which were either shallow-ploughed and
augmented or augmented only; thus these treatments appear not to have a significant negative effect on plant diversity at least in the short-term.
Deep ploughing, however, was detrimental to plant diversity. Results could be explained by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis i.e.
intermediate levels of disturbance prevent the competitive exclusion of subdominant species. The conclusion drawn from this study is that low-
intensity cultivation of commercial fynbos species can be diversity-friendly, but high-intensity disturbance practices should be avoided."
364,Habitat disturbance reduces seed dispersal of a forest interior tree in a fragmented African cloud forest,Scientific article,Oikos,"Habitat fragmentation and disturbance are known to impact animals and plants in different ways, depending on species’
characteristics and the type and scale of habitat modification involved. In contrast, direct or indirect ramifications on
mutualistic relationships between plants and animals are less clear, possibly because general patterns are confounded by
the diffuse nature of many of these interactions. Here, we examine how fragment size and/or severe disturbance of a
Kenyan mountain cloud forest affects the frugivore community and seed removal of a large-seeded, bird-dispersed tree of
the forest interior, for three consecutive years. Forest deterioration reduced avian visitation and seed removal rates
independent of fragment size, consistently so despite strong temporal variation in fruit production over the three-year
study. In disturbed forest fragments, seed removal rates were on average 3.5 times lower than in more intact ones. Strong
differences in both visitation and seed removal rates were largely attributable to shifts in frugivore assemblages,
characterized by loss or reduced abundance of the most effective seed dispersers, most of which were forest specialists.
Although some disturbed fragments benefited from visits of non-forest dependent seed dispersers, such ‘resilience’ was
not predictable or reliable in time or space. We conclude that disruption of seed disperser-seed interactions in highly
fragmented and disturbed tropical forests may be persistent in time when resiliency is inadequate, possibly posing long-
term effects on tree communities."
365,"How does grazing intensity affect different vegetation types in arid Succulent Karoo, South Africa? Implications for conservation management",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"The Knersvlakte in the Succulent Karoo Biome (South Africa) is known for its high plant diversity and
endemism. In the course of establishing a conservation area there, we assessed baseline data for future
management. We investigated the effects of grazing on the vegetation in terms of species diversity
and composition as well as reproduction of selected species. Data were sampled on four adjacent farms,
which were ungrazed, moderately or intensively grazed by sheep and goats. The data were collected in 27
quartz and 24 non-quartz plots, representing two major habitat types of the region. Within each of the
1000-m2 plots, 100 subplots of 400 cm2 size were sampled. ANOVAs revealed that species richness and
abundance of endemic species on quartz fields decreased with grazing. Abundance of annuals did not
increase significantly due to grazing. Fidelity analyses indicated that species composition differed
between grazing intensities and that the ungrazed and moderately grazed plots both contained unique
locally endemic habitat specialists. Reproduction of two endemic dwarf shrubs Drosanthemum schoenlan-
dianum and Argyroderma fissum (both Aizoaceae) increased under moderate grazing, which in the case of
D. schoenlandianum was interpreted as an effect of grazing. We attribute the low number of seedlings and
annuals on the moderately grazed farm to lower seasonal rainfall on these plots. From a conservation per-
spective, no or moderate grazing appear to be necessary to preserve plant diversity and vegetation pat-
terns, and their underlying processes."
366,Guinean biodiversity at the edge: Rodents in forest patches of southern Mali,Scientific article,Mammalian Biology,"Southern Mali mainly belongs to the Sudanian savanna bioclimatic zone, but forest patches showing
botanical affinities with Guinean humid forest remain as gallery forests or ravine forests. To character-
ize the rodent diversity of this area and check for the presence of some species of Guinean affinities
in this group, rodent assemblages were sampled in four regions of southern Mali, using trapping and
observational data in forest and surrounding habitats. Twenty-four species were recorded, comprising
a representative sample of the expected overall diversity in this group according to rarefaction curves.
Praomys rostratus was the dominant species in the most humid, closed lowland forest. Praomys daltoni
was also present in this habitat type, being all the more abundant as habitat degradation was apparent.
It became the dominant species in ravine forest on rocky substrate where P. rostratus was completely
absent. In Sudanian savanna habitats and in herbaceous and cultivated areas, Mastomys erythroleucus
dominated a diverse rodent community. A few species were found that testified for Guinean affinities
of the most humid forest patches, especially in the extreme southeast of the country (region of Sikasso).
Rodent assemblages of the Bafing and Mts Mandingues areas, in the western part of the study area,
showed the highest similarity, in relation with environmental characteristics of this region representing
an extension of the Fouta Djallon plateau in Guinea. The results obtained highlight the high biodiversity
value of this forest-savanna mosaic, and provide new arguments in favour of the preservation of West
African forest patches and their surrounding habitats."
367,A quantitative comparison of frugivorous tephritids (Diptera: Tephritidae) in tropical forests and rural areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo,Scientific article,Bulletin of Entomological Research,"Most of the current knowledge about African tephritids originates from studies
performed in agricultural areas, while information about their distribution in pristine
or moderately disturbed environments is extremely scarce. This study aims at
(i) describing levels of spatial variability of frugivorous tephritids in tropical forests
and small rural villages of the Congo River basin and (ii) verifying if human-mediated
activities, such as small-scale agriculture and trade, can affect their distribution
patterns. Four locations were sampled along a 250 km stretch of the Congo River. At
each location, pristine and disturbed habitats (i.e. tropical forests and small rural
villages, respectively) were sampled, with three replicate sites in each combination
of habitat and location. Sampling with modified McPhail traps baited with four
different attractants yielded 819 tephritid specimens of 29 species from seven genera
(Bactrocera, Carpophthoromyia, Ceratitis, Dacus, Celidodacus, Perilampsis, Trirhithrum).
The three most abundant species sampled (Dacus bivittatus, D. punctatifrons, Bactrocera
invadens) showed significant variations in abundance across locations and sites and
accounted for 98.29% of the overall dissimilarity between habitats. Assemblages
differed among locations and sites while they showed significant differences between
pristine and disturbed habitats in two out of the four locations. This study shows
that frugivorous tephritids in central Congo have remarkably patchy distributions
with differences among locations and sites representing the main source of variability.
Our data show that, in rural villages of central Democratic Republic of Congo,
human activities, such as small-scale agriculture and local commerce, are not always
sufficient to promote differences between the tephritid assemblages of villages
and those of the surrounding tropical forests."
368,"Amphibian community along elevational and habitat disturbance gradients in the Taita Hills, Kenya",Scientific article,Herpetotropicos,"We evaluated the relationship between amphibian composition along anthropogenic habitat disturbance and elevational gradients in the Taita
Hills. We tested the hypotheses that there is a clear amphibian species turnover with elevation, and that human habitat disturbance influence abundance
of amphibian reproductive strategies. Transects were used in surveying amphibians. Sampling was done in two broad habitat types (terrestrial forests/
plantations, and aquatic streams/dams). We used Kruskal-Wallis to test the differences in amphibian species richness and diversity among the habitat
types, while EstimateS program was used to estimate species diversity and abundance. Comparison of species richness was done using Sørensen
similarity index with amphibian communities as zoogeographic indicators. Multivariate cluster analysis was used to examine the community similarity in
terms of habitat type and elevation. Cluster analysis of community similarity revealed distinct species assemblages in terms of elevation and habitat type.
Amphibian species richness increased with increased habitat disturbance from forests to streams and dams but decreased with increasing elevation.
However, abundance of species with direct developing mode of reproduction decreased with increased habitat modification/disturbance. These findings
clearly demonstrate that conservation investment in protection of the Taita Hills should be directed towards terrestrial indigenous forests which are home
to the three area endemics and direct developers (Boulengerula taitana, Boulengerula niedeni and Callulina dawida). We therefore strongly support efforts
to protect a network of these indigenous forest fragments with some form of connectivity alongside the human modified habitats. Recognizing the role of
ecosystem restoration in protecting biodiversity in fragmented habitats, this study strongly supports restoration efforts involving gradually replacing exotic
forest plantations with indigenous plants."
369,Breeding Dynamics of Rodent Species Inhabiting Farm-Fallow Mosaic Fields in Central Tanzania,Scientific article,African Zoology,"The breeding dynamics of three species of rodents, Mastomys natalensis, Aethomys
chrysophilus and Gerbilliscus vicina were investigated in a seasonal environment (wet versus
dry) in Berega in the eastern parts of central Tanzania. Berega has a distinct unimodal rainfall
pattern, with most rainfall from November to April/May. We hypothesized that breeding of
rodents in central Tanzania would be confined to the wet season, when unlimited resources
would be available for reproduction. We provide evidence of breeding discontinuity in the
three species, showing that breeding was seasonally restricted to the wet season and early in
the dry season. The observed discontinuity could largely be ascribed to variation in primary
productivity between the wet and dry seasons. Reproductively active females were found in
the population as early as November, a month into the rainy season, but when early rains
occurred, some individuals were already breeding in October. Breeding was more intensive in
the latter part of the wet season (March–May) and completely ceased during the dry season.
For M. natalensis, survival was highest in the wet period and low in the dry season. The study
provides knowledge on the breeding dynamics of rodents in central Tanzania, which can help
farmers to take proactive rodent management decisions to prevent high rodent densities and
reduce crop damage in the fields. Application of control measures by the community early in
the season when populations of reproductive females is lowest will be most rewarding."
370,Two-Stage Recovery of Amphibian Assemblages Following Selective Logging of Tropical Forests,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"There is a lack of quantitative information on the effectiveness of selective-logging practices in
ameliorating effects of logging on faunal communities. We conducted a large-scale replicated field study in 3
selectively logged moist semideciduous forests in West Africa at varying times after timber extraction to assess
post logging effects on amphibian assemblages. Specifically, we assessed whether the diversity, abundance,
and assemblage composition of amphibians changed over time for forest-dependent species and those tolerant
of forest disturbance. In 2009, we sampled amphibians in 3 forests (total of 48 study plots, each 2 ha)
in southwestern Ghana. In each forest, we established plots in undisturbed forest, recently logged forest,
and forest logged 10 and 20 years previously. Logging intensity was constant across sites with 3 trees/ha
removed. Recently logged forests supported substantially more species than unlogged forests. This was due
to an influx of disturbance-tolerant species after logging. Simultaneously Simpson’s index decreased, with
increased in dominance of a few species. As time since logging increased richness of disturbance-tolerant
species decreased until 10 years after logging when their composition was indistinguishable from unlogged
forests. Simpson’s index increased with time since logging and was indistinguishable from unlogged forest 20
years after logging. Forest specialists decreased after logging and recovered slowly. However, after 20 years
amphibian assemblages had returned to a state indistinguishable from that of undisturbed forest in both
abundance and composition. These results demonstrate that even with low-intensity logging (≤3 trees/ha)
a minimum 20-year rotation of logging is required for effective conservation of amphibian assemblages in
moist semideciduous forests. Furthermore, remnant patches of intact forests retained in the landscape and
the presence of permanent brooks may aid in the effective recovery of amphibian assemblages."
371,"Population density and habitat preferences of forest duikers in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon",Scientific article,African Zoology,"We conducted a line-transect survey via direct obser-
vation to estimate the densities of forest duikers in
Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. Five 2-km
line transects were established in different vegetation
types, and each transect was walked at 1.0 km/h.
We also conducted a quick survey by walking at
c. 2.5 km/h along all transects. A detection function
was estimated separately for each species by pooling
all the data from the five transects. For Cephalophus
silvicultor, all sighting records of the two surveys were
used because there was no significant difference in
the encounter rates. In total, Philantomba monticola,
red duikers (Cephalophus spp.), and C. silvicultor
were observed 100, 80, 33 times, respectively. Their
individual densities were estimated at 16.43/km 2
(95% CI: 11.423.6), 7.1/km 2 (5.59.2), and 1.63 km 2
(1.02.8), respectively. The encounter rate for
P. monticola and C. silvicultor did not vary signifi-
cantly between the transects, while that of red duikers
was higher in the primary forest than in the young
secondary or gallery forest. The duiker densities in
our study area are among the highest in the African
rainforest. Our results indicate that quick surveys
may be an effective approach to estimate the densities
of rare species."
372,"Vegetation composition and structure influences bird species community assemblages in the highland agricultural landscape of Nyandarua, Kenya",Scientific article,Ostrich,"We examined the effects of vegetation composition and structure on bird species diversity and richness of
foraging guilds in the highland agricultural landscape of Nyandarua, Kenya. Bird point counts and vegetation
surveys were undertaken during four sampling periods. Linear mixed models were used to examine the effects of
vegetation variables on bird species diversity and richness of respective foraging guilds, and logistic generalised
linear models used to examine vegetation effects on the presence/absence of the 17 most common bird species.
Bird species diversity increased with increasing density of woody plant species and vegetation structural hetero-
geneity. Two gradients of increasing vegetation structural heterogeneity were most important in influencing bird
community composition and had positive effects on species diversity and the presence of most of the species
assessed: (1) increasing closed cover due to woody plant density, which also had positive effects on species richness
of frugivores and nectarivores, but negative effects on carnivores, and (2) increasing fallow and cultivation versus
decreasing grassland/pasture cover, which also had a positive effect on species richness of granivores and omnivores.
This study reaffirms the need to maintain a structurally rich agricultural landscape for it to support agrobiodiversity."
373,Grassland bird response to vegetation structural heterogeneity and clearing of invasive bramble,Scientific article,African Zoology,"Spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance and the subsequent heterogeneity are critical in
maintaining biodiversity within grassland ecosystems. Grassland birds have evolved within
this shifting mosaic to become reliant on specific habitat characteristics maintained under
varying levels of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Unfortunately, grasslands in
South Africa have been extensively transformed and remain poorly conserved, threatening
grassland avifauna. Mistbelt grassland is a threatened vegetation type endemic to the province
of KwaZulu-Natal, of which only 0.3% is formally protected. This study investigated seasonal
and patch type heterogeneity in a Mistbelt grassland avian community by determining avian
community structure and composition in four patch types, i.e. i) untransformed open grass-
land, ii) burnt grassland, iii) bramble-invaded and, iv) bramble-cleared grassland, during
winter and summer. Avian assemblages were significantly different between the different
patch types for each season. The bramble patch type negatively affected grassland bird species
diversity. Bramble-cleared grassland and untransformed grassland had similar vegetation
structure and avian communities in the summer, suggesting that the grassland bird community
benefitted soon after the clearing of invasive vegetation. This study provides further evidence
that bird diversity is enhanced in structurally heterogeneous grassland landscapes. Further-
more, the protection and appropriate management of privately owned Mistbelt grassland,
conserved in the form of rangeland, is an important refuge for threatened and endemic
avifauna, such as the globally-threatened blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and wattled
crane (Bugeranus carunculatus)."
374,"Effects of timber harvest on forest Lepidoptera: community, guild and species responses",Scientific article,Ecological Applications,"Two pressing questions for forestry and conservation biology are whether
periodic logging in forest ecosystems significantly changes biodiversity and whether the
changes can be mitigated through appropriate harvest methods. Such questions of timber
resource management, however, are rarely applied to nonpest insect species, particularly
in temperate forest systems. We studied the effects of timber harvest on species richness,
abundance, and community composition of forest Lepidoptera (moths). Moths were sampled
in 16 forest stands occurring in two watersheds (managed and wilderness) in southeastern
Ohio during summer 2000. Stands were chosen from one of four management categories:
clear-cut, selectively logged, unlogged, and wilderness. Specifically, we tested the following
predictions: (1) shifts in moth community composition would be affected by postharvest
changes in stand structure and floristic composition, (2) variation in species richness would
be determined by the magnitude of the logging disturbance, and (3) unlogged stands within
managed landscapes would contain different species assemblages compared to wilderness
stands.
Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed significant compositional differences
among moth communities sampled from forest stands differing in harvest regime.
Variation among moth communities was mainly attributable to postharvest changes in stand
floristic composition rather than stand structure. Postdisturbance shifts in moth community
composition were related to the magnitude of displacement of a given forest stand to earlier
successional stages. We also found that both species richness of the overall moth community
and several feeding guilds. were significantly lower in clear-cut stands, but species richness
did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged stands. Thus, selective logging
appears to be a better strategy for timber harvest when concern is for maintaining species
richness of Lepidoptera within stands. Finally, although no differences were detected in
overall species richness or abundance of moths sampled from stands in managed or wilderness
watersheds, the CCA suggested that the surrounding landscape influenced the variation
in community composition within and among forest stands. Therefore, we suggest
that the long-term maintenance of lepidopteran species diversity and community composition
within temperate deciduous forests managed for timber may ultimately depend on
successful regeneration of harvested stands to precut floristic composition as well as the
preservation of larger areas of unlogged forests."
375,Effects of Buffer-strip retention and clearcutting on land snails in Boreal Riparian Forests,Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"We investigated the short-term effects of forest clearcutting on land snails (terrestrial gastropods) in 15 forest stands along small streams in Sweden. Two different silvicultural treatments were applied at each site: clearcutting across the stream channel and buffer strips 10 m wide on each side of the stream. Additionally, we studied 10 reference sites in unlogged riparian forests along similar-sized streams. All sites were studied before logging and then 2.5 years after logging. After clearcutting the number of individuals in a 0.5-m2 sample from each site decreased on average from 107 to 87, and the mean number of species per sample decreased from 9.9 to 7.7. Most species were negatively affected, but there were also clear differences in sensitivity. There were correlations between species survival and ground moisture. At the wettest clearcut sites with an almost intact bryophyte cover, the land snails were unaffected by clearcutting. This result suggests that wet or moist forest floors can serve as refugia even at very small spatial scales (e.g., shallow hollows, crevices). If this is an important mechanism, the spatial distribution of small habitats could be important for the long-term survival of the snail fauna or other small, dispersal-limited organisms at clearcut sites. In the buffer strips, the number of individuals decreased but not the number of species, indicating that buffer-strip retention is a good practice for protecting land snails in riparian forests. The varying effectiveness of the buffer strip could partly be explained by the proportion of the remaining basal area, emphasizing that buffer strips could be even more effective if efforts are made to avoid heavy damage by windthrows."
376,"Effects of environment, habitat configuration and forest continuity on the distribution of forest plant species",Scientific article,Journal of Vegetation Science,"In present day European landscapes many forest
plant species are restricted to isolated remnants of a formerly
more or less continuous forest cover. The two major objectives
of this study were (1) to determine the relative importance
of habitat quality (mainly in terms of soil parameters),
habitat configuration (patch size and isolation) and habitat
continuity for the distribution of herbaceous forest plant species
in a highly fragmented landscape and (2) to examine if groups
of species with different habitat requirements are affected
differently. Deciduous forest patches in northwestern Germany
were surveyed for the presence of a large set of forest
species. For each patch, habitat quality, configuration and
continuity were determined. Data were analysed by Redundancy
Analysis with variation partitioning for effects on total
species composition and multivariate logistic regression for
effects on individual species, for two different data sets (baserich
and base-poor forest patches). Overall, we found strong
effects of habitat quality (particularly of soil pH, water content
and topographic heterogeneity in the base-rich forest patches;
and of calcium content and disturbance in the base-poor
patches), but only relatively weak effects of habitat configuration
and habitat continuity. However, a number of species
were positively affected by patch area and negatively affected
by patch isolation. Furthermore, the relative importance of
habitat configuration tended to be higher for species predominantly
growing in closed forests compared to species occurring
both in the forest and in the open landscape."
377,Conservation Comores 2005: Biodiversity and Resource-use Assessment and Environmental Awareness,Agency report (published),Biodiversity and Resource-use Assessment and Environmental Awareness,"The birds of the Comoro Islands were largely neglected until the first major scientific expedition was carried out by Benson in 1958 (Benson 1960). This expedition took great steps in elucidating the taxonomic status of many species. Since, work has focussed mainly on Grand Comore, with the majority of data collected in two expeditions by the Belgium Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1985 (Louette et al 1988) and 1989. These expeditions did much to identify patterns of distributions and abundances of key endemic species, distinguishing critical areas for conservation (Bijnens et al, 1987; Louette, 1988, 2000; Louette et al, 1988, 1989, 1992, 2004; Stevens et al, 1993, 1995).
Anjouan has been even more neglected than Grand Comore. Most work has focussed on the critically endangered Anjouan Scops Owl, Otus capnodes, since its rediscovery in 1992 (Safford, 1993; Moorcroft, 1995). However, patterns of species richness and distributions of endemic species remained unknown.
The work of this report sought to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of birds of the Comores; identifying the patterns of current species richness on Grand Comore and Anjouan and to compare these with that found by previous expeditions; to compare the patterns found with that of butterflies; and to identify a suitable indicator for bird species richness with which to carry out rapid biodiversity assessments. With these, appropriate strategies for conserving the biodiversity of the Comores can be suggested.
The avifauna is thought to be relatively complete, however it is possible a number of stenotopic endemic species of lower altitudes are now extinct since the complete deforestation of lower altitudes (Stevens et al 1993).
Grand Comore is the centre of endemism of the four islands. Five island endemics exist, of which four are confined to the slopes of Karthala: Otus pauliani, Humblotia flavirostris, Zosterops mouroniensis and Dicrurus fuscipennis. Nesillas brevicaudata can also be found on La Grille, a 1087m crater to the North of Karthala. There are a further four species endemic to the Comoros archipelago and 16 endemic subspecies (Butorides striatus, a coastal species, and Cyanolanius madagascarinus which has not been observed since 1982 are not included). Fodies, which were identified only to genus level, are treated here as an endemic subspecies as Foudia eminentissima dominates in forested areas and so it is expected that the majority of Fodies recorded represented this species. Finally, 16 non-endemic species may be found, which are predominately confined to the non-forested lower slopes. They are thought to have colonised only recently, since human arrival. The endemic species are thought to have arrived in a double invasion, firstly from mainland Africa, and then a second wave of Madagascan origin (Louette 2000).
In contrast, Anjouan has only one island endemic species, O. capnodes, which was rediscovered in 1992 (Safford 1993), and a further three Comorian endemics: Columba polleni, Turdus bewsheri, and Alectroenas sganzini. A population of A. sganzini also exists on Aldabra, however here it will be considered here as an endemic species to the Comoro Islands."
378,Separating the effects of forest type and elevation on the diversity of litter invertebrate communities in a humid tropical forest in Puerto Rico,Scientific article,Journal of Animal Ecology,"1.
The primary effects of climatic conditions on invertebrate litter communities, and
the secondary effects of different forest types, were distinguished by using the sierra
palm as a control in a natural experiment along an elevational gradient in the Luquillo
Mountains. These mountains have three well-defined forest types along the gradient,
with the palm occurring as stands within each forest.
2.
Palm litter samples were richer in nutrients, particularly phosphorus, than nonpalm
litter, significantly so at higher elevations where leaching would have been expected. In
nonpalm litter, mineral concentrations were significantly lower at higher elevations.
3.
Animal abundance mirrored the pattern of mineral amounts and declined significantly
in mid- and high-altitude forests, but did not decline with increasing elevation in
palm stands. A pulse of post-hurricane litterfall was reflected in the high abundance of
Coleoptera and Isoptera the following year.
4.
The species richness of communities (Margalefs index) declined with increasing elevation
in nonpalm forest litter, but was remarkably similar in palm litter at all elevations.
5.
Palm litter communities were more similar to each other (Sørensens index) than
nonpalm communities, which became less similar with increasing elevation.
6.
The differences observed from the lower slopes to the summits, in animal abundance,
species richness and the uniformity of communities, are better explained by the contribution
of forest composition to the chemical and physical nature of litter and forest
heterogeneity, rather than to direct effects of temperature and rainfall differences."
379,"Impacts of rain forest fragmentation on butterflies in northern Borneo: species richness, turnover and the value of small fragments",Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Widespread and rapid losses of tropical rain forests have made understanding the responses of species to rain forest fragmentation an area of major concern. In this study we examined the impacts of habitat fragmentation on the species richness and faunal composition of butterflies in tropical rain forests in Sabah, Borneo. We analysed patterns of both α- and β-diversity to assess the relative importance of differences in patch size, isolation and vegetation structure on the diversity and similarity of species assemblages. We used additive partitioning to assess the relative contributions of intact forest and forest remnants to overall species richness at a landscape scale and we examined which traits of species best predicted their responses to fragmentation.

2. Species richness and diversity in rain forest remnants was significantly positively related to remnant size and significantly negatively related to isolation, in keeping with theories of island biogeography. Species assemblages at different sites were significantly nested, with those species most adversely affected by forest fragmentation having a narrow range of larval host-plants and, to a lesser extent, being large-bodied. No species endemic to Borneo was recorded in forest remnants smaller than 4000 ha, but even the smallest remnant (120 ha) supported species with geographical distributions confined within Sundaland (West Malaysia and the islands of the Sunda Shelf).

3. Although assemblages were significantly nested, they departed substantially from perfect nestedness, with some species recorded only or predominantly in small, relatively depauperate remnants. As a result there was substantial β-diversity among sites, which was related to variation in both fragment size and vegetation structure. At the landscape scale, diversity within sites was less than that between sites, and the majority of the diversity between sites was related to variation in fragment size.

4. Synthesis and applications. Substantial diversity was added to the assemblage of butterflies in Bornean rain forests by virtue of species differences among fragments, which were related mainly to differences in patch size and vegetation structure. The data reported indicate that, despite having lower species richness, relatively small and isolated remnants of rain forest make a substantial contribution to regional diversity. Small isolated forest remnants are generally accorded low conservation status and given little protection, with the result that they often disappear over time because of continued anthropogenic disturbance. The results of this study indicate that the conservation value of small remnants of forest, in particular their contribution to environmental heterogeneity, should not be overlooked."
380,The diversity and conservation of plant reproductive and dispersal functional traits in human-dominated tropical landscapes,Scientific article,Journal of Ecology,"1
Human-altered landscapes dominate the planet, yet little is known about their
capacity to sustain plant functional diversity. Most conservation-orientated studies of
such landscapes focus on species diversity, whereas less attention is given to functional
traits and their conservation.
2
We examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in
three forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and riverbanks) and three deforested
habitats (pasture, roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks), each replicated in three
human-dominated landscapes in southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical traits
related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal
mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and seed size.
3
We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and
deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird and bee pollination)
and three dispersal states (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were
distributed across these landscapes.
4
Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from deforested
habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor. Forested and
deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks
and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps,
for multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between forested and
deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the
basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was
used. Bat-, bird- and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed
fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with
fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats.
5
Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations
but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities.
Patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes
than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity."
381,"Herpetofauna diversity and microenvironment correlates across a pasture-edge-interior ecotone in tropical rainforest fragments in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve of Veracruz, Mexico",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"We evaluated the relationship between amphibian and reptile diversity and microhabitat
dynamics along pastureedgeinterior ecotones in a tropical rainforest in Veracruz, Mexico.
To evaluate the main correlation patterns among microhabitat variables and species composition
and richness, 14 ecotones were each divided into three habitats (pasture, forest
edge and forest interior) with three transects per habitat, and sampled four times between
June 2003 and May 2004 using equal day and night efforts. We measured 12 environmental
variables describing the microclimate, vegetation structure, topography and distance to
forest edge and streams.
After sampling 126 transects (672 man-hours effort) we recorded 1256 amphibians
belonging to 21 species (pasture: 12, edge: 14, and interior: 13 species), and 623 reptiles
belonging to 33 species (pasture: 11, edge: 25, and interior: 22 species). There was a difference
in species composition between pasture and both forest edge and interior habitats. A
high correlation between distance to forest edge and temperature, understorey density,
canopy cover, leaf litter cover, and leaf litter depth was found. There was also a strong relationship
between the composition of amphibian and reptile ensembles and the measured
environmental variables. The most important variables related to amphibian and reptile
ensembles were canopy cover, understorey density, leaf litter cover and temperature.
Based on amphibian and reptile affinity for the habitats along the ecotone, species were
classified into five ensembles (generalist, pasture, forest, forest edge and forest interior species).
We detected six species that could indicate good habitat quality of forest interior and
their disappearance may be an indication of habitat degradation within a fragment, or that
a fragment is not large enough to exclude edge effects. Different responses to spatial and
environmental gradients and different degrees of tolerance to microclimatic changes indicated
that each ensemble requires a different conservation strategy. We propose to maintain
in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve the forest remnants in the lowlands that have
gentler slopes and a deep cover of leaf litter, a dense understorey, and high relative humidity
and low temperature, to buffer the effects of edge related environmental changes and
the invasion of species from the matrix."
382,"Relationship between anurans diversity and successional stages of a very humid low montane forest in Valle del Cauca, southwestern of Colombia",Scientific article,Caldasia,"We examined the relationship of climatic variables and vegetation parameters with
the distribution and abundance of anurans in a very humid low montane forest
in the western region of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. We sampled six transects in
three types of habitat (secondary forest, early secondary forest and shrub area),
over a period of seven months. We collected data on several forest characteristics
(vegetation cover, average heights and densities of different strata, depth of leaf litter,
air temperature, soil temperature and relative humidity) in each site. Five species of
genus Pristimantis and one of genus Eleutherodactylus were registered being the
most abundant (P. brevifrons with a total of 19 individuals, followed by P. palmeri
with 15 and P. erythropleura with 14). The distribution of species differed between
habitats and climatic variables. The abundance of the species in the secondary forest
was correlated with the soil temperature, whereas relative humidity was correlated
with species abundance in early secondary forest and shrub. We suggest the existence
of three different behaviors within the group with respect to the following structural
parameters: vegetation cover (%), average height (m) of the subarboreal (Ar) stratum,
density of this stratum (ind/m2), density (ind/m2) of the bush stratum (ar) and
thickness of the leaf litter layer (cm.). We identify three groups of species defined
according to the following criteria: group I, comprised of those species that tolerate
moderately degraded environments (P. brevifrons, P. erythropleura, E. mantipus);
group II, present in more conserved environments (P. calcaratus, P. thectopternus);
and group III comprised by P. palmeri, which is present in medium to highly degraded
environments."
383,Accessible habitat: an improved measure of the effects of habitat loss and roads on wildlife populations,Scientific article,Landscape Ecolology,"Habitat loss is known to be the main
cause of the current global decline in biodiversity,
and roads are thought to affect the persistence of
many species by restricting movement between
habitat patches. However, measuring the effects of
roads and habitat loss separately means that the
configuration of habitat relative to roads is not
considered. We present a new measure of the
combined effects of roads and habitat amount:
accessible habitat. We define accessible habitat as
the amount of habitat that can be reached from a focal
habitat patch without crossing a road, and make
available a GIS tool to calculate accessible habitat.
We hypothesize that accessible habitat will be the
best predictor of the effects of habitat loss and roads
for any species for which roads are a major barrier to
movement. We conducted a case study of the utility
of the accessible habitat concept using a data set of
anuran species richness from 27 ponds near a
motorway. We defined habitat as forest in this
example. We found that accessible habitat was not
only a better predictor of species richness than total
habitat in the landscape or distance to the motorway,
but also that by failing to consider accessible habitat
we would have incorrectly concluded that there was
no effect of habitat amount on species richness."
384,The effects of forest patch size and matrix type on changes in carabid beetle assemblages in an urbanized landscape,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"In this study we compared ground beetles (Carabidae) from a range of different forest frag-
ments along an urbanization gradient in Brussels, Belgium. We address the following ques-
tions: (i) How does the degree of urbanization in the surrounding habitat affect forest
beetles, and does it interact with the effects of patch size and distance to forest edge? (ii)
Do these factors have a different effect at the level of individual species, habitat affinity
groups or total community? During 2002 we sampled 13 forest plots in 10 forest patches,
ranging in size from 5.27 to 4383 ha. The beetles were captured using transects of pitfall
traps from the edge to a distance of 100 m into each woodland and identified to species
level. Effects of urbanization, forest size and forest edge were evaluated on total species
number, abundance and habitat affinity groups and ten abundant, widespread model cara-
bid species. Overall, the effects of urbanization, forest size and edge effects slightly influ-
enced total species richness and abundance but appeared to have a major effect on
ground beetle assemblages through species specific responses. More urbanized sites had
significantly fewer forest specialists and more generalist species. Large forest fragments
were favoured by forest specialist species while generalist species and species frequently
associated with forest (forest generalists) dominated the smaller forests. Forest edges
mainly harboured generalist species while forest specialist species were more frequent into
the forests if the forest patches were large enough, otherwise they disappeared due to the
destruction or impoverishment of their habitat. Our results show the importance of differ-
entiating between habitat affinity, especially habitat generalists versus specialists, the lat-
ter having a higher value in nature conservation, and merely the quantity of species
represented in human-dominated areas."
385,Spatio-temporal dymanics of snake diversity in four habitats with different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance in the Gorgona Island National Natural Park in the Colombian Pacific,Scientific article,Caldasia,"Due to cattle ranching and agriculture, natural environments have been transformed into fragmented landscapes. Anthropogenic disturbance affects vegetation structure and microclimate, and changes patterns of snake diversity. This study determines snakes diversity in four habitats that differ in degree of anthropogenic disturbance onGorgona Island, in the Colombian pacific. Visual encounter surveys were conducted during June-July 2001 and February-April 2004 along 31 linear transects, encountering 51 individuals belonging to 13 snake species. We determined inventory completeness to be between 60 and 78%. Highest species richness was found in the secondary forest followed by primary forest and coconut plantations (eight, six and six species, respectively). Highest species complementarity was detected between the prison and coconut plantations, and the prison and primary forest. In conserved habitats (secondary and primary forests) snake diversity doubled, while in the prison and coconut plantations snake abundance increased during the dry season. It is possible that anthropogenic disturbance negatively affects Leptophis ahaetulla, Micrurus dumerili, Oxybelis brevirostris and Tantilla longifrontalis snake species. It is important to invest more effort in snake capture in conserved environments than in disturbed habitats. Data on spatio-temporal dynamics in snake ensembles are essential to correctly focus conservation plans and management of the snake fauna in disturbed environments."
386,Diversity of vascular plant communities along a disturbance gradient in a central mid-hill community forest of Nepal,Scientific article,Banko Janakari,"The Community Forestry Program has been considered successful in improving the
environmental situation in the hills of Nepal by enhancing the vegetation coverage of
degraded sites and by improving the supply of forest products to farmers. The restoration
measures are considered sustainable if the ecosystems are self-supporting and resilient
against perturbation. A community forest (CF) in the mid-hills of Nepal has been assessed
for restoration success based on the comparison of vegetation structure and species
diversity along a disturbance gradient, using a semi-protected natural forest as a reference
site. In general, the community forest management (CFM) was able to re-establish forests
on formerly severely degraded sites. Forest operations carried out during CFM have
altered plant community composition, species richness and distribution, age class
distribution of trees and vegetation structure. As a result, the CF was being transformed
into a less diverse regular forest although the overall vascular plant diversity was retained
with sufficient niches within the understorey vegetation."
387,"Forest biodiversity gradients and the human impact in Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Patterns of biodiversity, environment and human impact were studied in 57
sample plots in an 1,178 ha forest area in a rural mountain area of Nepal that is administrated
by the Annapurna Conservation Area Project. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity
was measured or estimated for six groups of organisms: trees, shrubs, climbers, herbs,
polypores and mycorrhizal fungi, and the recorded patterns were correlated with a set of
environmental variables. Human impact in terms of fuelwood collection, selective cutting
and grazing was found to influence species diversity patterns in all organism groups.
Species richness of trees, climbers and polypores at plot level (alpha-diversity) generally
responded negatively to human impact, whereas species richness of herbs and shrubs
showed a positive relation. Species turnover (beta-diversity), measured as length of the
DCA first axis, was significantly correlated to distance to village for all species groups.
This indicates that the human impact is very important for the biodiversity patterns in the
study area, and that biodiversity connected to undisturbed forest habitats are potentially
threatened in the area. The results are discussed in the context of practical conservation. A
proposal for future management zones addressing protection of biodiversity without limiting
the local use of the forest resource is put forward."
388,Contrasting resource-dependent responses of hoverfly richness and density to landscape structure,Scientific article,Basic and Applied Ecology,"Hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) in agroecosystems have gained much attention recently because the larvae of some
species are efficient control agents of crop aphids, and adult hoverflies provide pollination services to wild flowers and
flowering crops. We assessed the density and species richness of hoverflies in 32 calcareous grasslands, which constitute
a semi-natural habitat for adult hoverflies, by means of six transect walks from April to September 2004. Our results
show that local habitat factors and landscape factors influenced hoverfly communities, and that their effects on
hoverfly richness and density were quite contrary. Hoverfly species richness was affected by factors related to resource
heterogeneity such as species richness of flowering plants, area of grassland habitat, and landscape diversity, which all
imply the availability of diverse micro- and macrohabitats for adults and larvae. Hoverfly density, in contrast,
depended on factors related to resource quantity, such as the amount of pollen and nectar resources for adults and the
amount of larval macrohabitats in the surrounding matrix. Therefore, both adult and larval habitat requirements have
to be considered when analysing hoverfly communities in agricultural landscapes. Species guilds responded to specific
land-use types such as annual crops and woodland at different spatial scales, indicating variation in species mobility
and in the degree of spillover effects among neighbouring landscape elements."
389,Hydrology and management of turloughs (temporary lakes) affect marsh fly (Sciomyzidae: Diptera) communities,Scientific article,Insect Conservation and Diversity,"1. Hydrology and management affect dipteran communities in wetlands
and they, themselves, have the potential to influence prey communities.
2. Turloughs are temporary lakes unique to Ireland. Their vegetation is ecotonal
on a dry-wet continuum and, due to differing summer management practises, shows
a diversity of vegetation lengths. Marsh flies (Sciomyzidae), a taxon that has potential
as wetland bio-indicators, were chosen to investigate management, hydrological
and prey effects on turloughs.
3. Summer collections of Sciomyzidae were made on 24 homogeneous zones
across ten turloughs. At each position that flies were collected, vegetation surveys
were conducted to utilise Ellenberg indices as surrogate environmental variables.
Winter collections of Molluscs were made on 21 zones.
4. Sciomyzidae showed maximum total abundance and species richness at sites
intermediate on the dry-wet gradient, supporting the intermediate disturbance
hypothesis.
5. Indicator species analysis gave site-specific preferences: most species favoured
the site with the longest vegetation, but the smallest species showed a significant preference
for the site with the shortest vegetation. Across the full hydrological gradient,
known terrestrial snail-killers were indicators of drier poor-grasslands and known
hygrophilous species were indicators of the wettest zones.
6. Generalised linear models for abundance of the dominant species consistently
showed negative relationships with total prey abundance. However, sciomyzid communities
showed no significant co-structure with prey communities, but did with
sampling conditions, and management  hydrological variables.
7. Sciomyzid communities change qualitatively and quantitatively with vegetation
structure and hydrology and correlative evidence for predation pressure by the dominant
species highlights the potential of Sciomyzidae to control the intermediate host
of fascioliasis."
390,Unexpected understorey community development after 30 years in ancient and post-agricultural forests,Scientific article,Journal of Ecology,"1. Land-use change is considered one of the most radical and extensive disturbances that have
influenced plant distributions and diversity patterns in forest understorey communities in much of
Europe and eastern North America. In forests growing on former agricultural land, local species
diversity and community differentiation among sites are generally reduced compared with ancient
forests (i.e. forests with no historical record of agriculture). Yet, no study has determined how the
compositional differences created by former land-use change over time as the forest sites recover
fromformer agricultural use.
2. Here, we resurveyed 78 vegetation plots (half of the plots in ancient and half in post-agricultural
forest) to demonstrate how three decades of forest development have changed the compositional
differences between post-agricultural and ancient forest sites. The impact of land-use history and
survey date was tested on two measures of species diversity and two measure of community divergence.
3. The data indicate that the imprint of former agricultural land use persisted over time, yet not
through compositional stability. Parallel and strong vegetation shifts occurred in both ancient and
post-agricultural forest: the species diversity decreased and local species cover strongly diverged,
which indicates community drift. The observed understorey changes did thus not support the commonly
accepted model of community development in post-agricultural forests, i.e. the diversity did
not increase and the vegetation did not become more similar to the ancient forest vegetation over
time. The changes in species composition were associated with an increase of common, competitive
species at the expense of ancient forest indicator species. The source populations of ancient forest
species have been gradually depleted, so the recovery of post-agricultural forests becomes even more
precarious.
4. Synthesis. While land-use history is likely to persist as the primary predictor of local species
diversity and community divergence, other environmental drivers may additionally structure forest
understorey communities and lead to biotic impoverishment and pervasive species reordering on
the time scale of only decades."
391,Land use intensity drives the local variation of lichen diversity in Mediterranean ecosystems sensitive to desertification,Scientific article,Bibliotheca Lichenologica,"Concerns for short-term effects of global changes on
biodiversity have been reported from several regions, including
Mediterranean areas highly affected by desertification processes.
Beside climate changes, human activities are the primary cause of
land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. Along a
typical Mediterranean land-use gradient in W Sardinia (Italy), many
favourable environments for lichen growth were intensively
investigated, and epiphytic and epilithic species richness and abundance
were assessed, to evaluate the response of lichen diversity to
land use intensity and other predictors related to desertification
processes. By using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS)
analysis, epilithic lichen diversity changed along several gradients: a
land use gradient, ranging from forested to non-forested sites, climatic
moisture, and management quality. Epiphytic diversity was associated
to a gradient of decreasing sensitivity to desertification (ESA index).
Based on multi-response permutation analysis the overall land use
categorization showed significant compositional dissimilarities both in
epilithic and epiphytic lichen communities between thermophilous
Quercus forests, pasture and arable lands, shrublands and garigues,
agroforestry lands, Quercus suber plantations and thermophilous
Pinus forests."
392,"Community-level diversity modelling of birds and butterflies on Anjouan, Comoro Islands",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"The Comoro Islands are a hotspot of endemicity and are of global conservation importance. However,
despite rapid and ongoing loss of the remaining natural forest habitats, no terrestrial protected areas have
been established. Here, we investigate the distribution patterns of birds and butterflies on the island of
Anjouan to identify areas important for the persistence of endemic species. Two components of the bird
and butterfly communities were investigated: species richness (a-diversity) and community dissimilarity
(b-diversity). We recorded the community composition of each taxon at multiple sites and modelled species
richness as a function of seven environmental predictors. Endemic bird richness was greatest in
mature forest at high altitudes whereas endemic butterfly richness peaked at mid-altitudes in disturbed
forest. There was low cross-taxon congruence between areas with high endemic richness; less than 2% of
the island represented areas of overlap between endemic bird and butterfly diversity hotspots. Richness
of both non-endemic birds and non-endemic butterflies was highest in non-forest habitats. Using Generalised
Dissimilarity Modelling, we found a strong distinction between mid and high altitude communities
for butterflies, and between forest and non-forest communities for birds, although butterflies exhibited
higher b-diversity than birds. Our data represent the first description of the distributions of taxa of
any kind for Anjouan, and will be used to inform current plans to implement the countrys first terrestrial
protected area."
393,Differential effects of vegetation restoration in Mediterranean abandoned cropland by secondary succession and pine plantations on bird assemblages,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Two contrasting trajectories for vegetation restoration in agricultural landscapes are secondary succession following cropland abandonment that can regenerate woodlands (passive restoration) and conversion of cropland to tree plantations (active restoration), which have mostly focused on pine species in the Mediterranean Basin. We compared the effects of these two contrasting trajectories of vegetation restoration on bird assemblages in central Spain. Vegetation structure differed in the two restoration trajectories, pine plantations attaining higher tree cover and height (31% and 4.1 m, respectively) but lower strata complexity than secondary shrubland and holm oak woodland (which attained 10% and 1.4 m of tree cover and height, respectively). Bird species richness differed in stands under active or passive restoration trajectories, the former collecting a higher total number of species (4.2 species per 0.78 ha plot) than the latter (3.5 species per plot). The number of forest species increased with vegetation maturity in both restoration trajectories, but especially in stands under active restoration. The occurrence of woodland generalist species increased and of species inhabiting open habitats decreased in actively restored stands, being some of these latter species of high conservation priority in the European context but relatively common at the regional level. Bird species inhabiting pine plantations had broader habitat breadth at the regional level than those inhabiting secondary shrublands and woodlands. Maximum regional density did not differ between both restoration trajectories, but it increased with development of the herbaceous layer only at the secondary succession trajectory. The relative importance of species of European biogeographic origin was higher in mature pine plantations (58.9% of total bird abundance) than in mature holm oak woodlands (34.4%), whereas that of Mediterranean species was considerably higher in the latter (40.1%) than in the former (20%). Bird assemblages of relatively small patches of pine plantations are unable to reflect the regional avifauna, in contrast with the relationships between local and regional assemblage characteristics that can be found in isolated natural forests. We conclude that programs of vegetation restoration should base upon a range of approaches that include passive restoration, active restoration with a variety of tree and shrub species, and mixed models to conciliate agricultural production, vegetation restoration and conservation of target species."
394,"Diversity, family dominance, life forms and ecological strategies of forest fragments compared to continuous forest in southwestern Côte d'Ivoire",Scientific article,Candollea,"Extensive agriculture and timber exploitation are the principal
causes of forest destruction in Ivory Coast. This country
has an annual deforestation rate of 1.1 to 2.9% which is the
highest in Africa. Most Ivorian forests consist of protected
areas and of forest fragments embedded in a secondary landscape
composed of a mosaic of cultivated fields, fallows
and perennial crops plantations. Southwestern Côte dIvoire
which is our study area, is one of the rare areas where we can
still find significant continuous forests blocks (classified
forests of Goin-Débé and Cavally, and Taï National Park).
This part of Ivorian forest is rich in narrow endemic species
(so-called Sassandriennes species) and is one of the hotspots
of biodiversity. Considering the floristic characteristics
of the study area, the human pressure which also extends to
protected areas, and the disastrous consequences on the biodiversity,
it becomes a critical issue to assess the impact of
forest fragmentation on floristic composition and diversity.
Results of this study indicate that impact of isolation and
further direct human disturbances on forest fragments lead
to an increase of secondary and pioneers strategies and liana
life forms. However, resilience of a high proportion of
primary species including Sassandriennes endemics in fragments
induce an increase in global richness and diversity and
demonstrate that promoting their conservation in southwestern
Ivory Coast can substantially contribute to general conservation
of plant species. Political authorities and conservation
agencies should become aware of the urgent need of
appropriate conservation policy for these forest fragments."
395,Below-ground secondary succession in tropical forests of Borneo,Scientific article,Journal of Tropical Ecology,"As the destruction and severe disturbance of primary tropical forest continues, it is important to understand
how these forests may recover from perturbations. Considerable work has been done on above-ground recovery
but below-ground processes are less well understood. To determine changes in root mass during tropical secondary
succession in lowland forests of Central Borneo, samples were taken from stands of increasing ages since abandonment
of agriculture (1, 3, 14 and 31 y) with a primary forest control (six plots from 1-y-old stands and three from all other
ages). Root mass and elemental concentrations were determined and soils were chemically analysed. There was no
increase in root mass with stand age for fine-root (< 2 mm diameter) or small-root (< 5 mm diameter) mass but there
was a trend for coarse-root mass (510 mm diameter) to increase with stand age. Negative correlations were shown
between root mass and soil nutrient status. Fine-root C concentrations increased with stand age but there was no
clear effect of stand age on fine-root N or P. Fine-root mass did not increase significantly with stand age suggesting a
rapid recovery; instead, soil nutrient status appeared to be the most important factor controlling root mass. Of the soil
nutrients measured in this study, N had a stronger control over root mass than P suggesting that this element may be
limiting during secondary succession in tropical lowland forests of Borneo."
396,Effects of anthropogenic activities on lizard communities in northern Madagascar,Scientific article,Animal Conservation,"Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot threatened by habitat loss, which is
detrimental to the future survival of forest-dwelling herpetofauna. For conserva-
tion purposes, it is essential to determine how species respond to different types
of anthropogenic habitat alteration. We conducted standardized field surveys
(a variation of visual encounter survey) to assess species richness, abundance and
diversity among forest, clear-cut and orchard habitat types in Montagne des
Francais, north Madagascar. Forest sites proved to be very different from clear-
cut and orchard sites with regards to habitat structure. Lizard species richness,
abundance and diversity were significantly lower in clear-cut sites, with only 11%
of the observed forest diversity recorded. This shift in species occurrence suggests
that lizards are particularly sensitive to this type of habitat alteration. Orchard
cultivation did not affect lizard species richness to the same extent, as 56% of the
observed forest diversity was recorded in this habitat type. Furthermore lizard
abundance was significantly higher in orchard habitat. These observations indicate
that although anthropogenic activity can have an adverse effect on the lizard fauna
of a given site, it will seldom lead to a total loss of diversity as species typical of
pristine forest (specialists) are replaced by species adapted to secondary habitats
(often generalists). Our results support the contention that anthropogenic habitat
alteration can have a strong negative influence on lizard communities. Researchers
should continue to identify which species may be lost or become more vulnerable
in future (as a result of population decline) in response to anthropogenic habitat
alteration."
397,The effects of land-use change on arthropod richness and abundance on Santa Maria Island (Azores): unmanaged plantations favour endemic beetles,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"We study how endemic, native and introduced
arthropod species richness, abundance, diversity and community
composition vary between four different habitat
types (native forest, exotic forest of Cryptomeria japonica,
semi-natural pasture and intensive pasture) and how
arthropod richness and abundance change with increasing
distance from the native forest in adjacent habitat types in
Santa Maria Island, the Azores. Arthropods were sampled in
four 150 m long transects in each habitat type. Arthropods
were identified to species level and classified as Azorean
endemic, single-island endemic (SIE), native, or introduced.
The native forest had the highest values for species richness
of Azorean endemics, SIEs and natives; and also had highest
values of Azorean endemic diversity (Fishers alpha). In
contrast, the intensive pasture had the lowest values for
endemic and native species richness and diversity, but the
highest values of total arthropod abundance and introduced
species richness and diversity. Arthropod community composition
was significantly different between the four habitat
types. In the semi-natural pasture, the number of SIE species
decreased with increasing distance from the native forest,
and in the exotic forest the abundance of both Azorean endemics
and SIEs decreased with increasing distance from
the native forest. There is a gradient of decreasing arthropod
richness and abundance from the native forest to the intensive
pasture. Although this study demonstrates the important
role of the native forest in arthropod conservation in the
Azores, it also shows that unmanaged exotic forests have
provided alternative habitat suitable for some native species
of forest specialist arthropods, particularly saproxylic
beetles."
398,Lizard assemblages in a fragmented landscape of central Chile,Scientific article,European Journal of Wildlife Research,"We studied lizard assemblages assessing abundance,
richness, and nestedness in a fragmented landscape
of central Chile including native temperate forest, forest
fragments, and commercial pine plantations. Fragmentation
and plantations increase the availability of edge
habitats triggering both the support of additional lizard
species, absent at the continuous forest, and the nestedness
of lizard assemblages, where interior habitats of forest and
plantations are nested subsets of habitat edges. A
vulnerable lizard (Liolaemus tenuis) thrives at fragments
in abundance similar to the continuous forest. Therefore,
remnants ought to be considered in the conservation of
lizard assemblages."
399,Understory Bird Communities in Amazonian Rainforest Fragments: Species Turnover through 25 Years Post-Isolation in Recovering Landscapes,Scientific article,PLoS ONE,"Inferences about species loss following habitat conversion are typically drawn from short-term surveys, which cannot
reconstruct long-term temporal dynamics of extinction and colonization. A long-term view can be critical, however, to
determine the stability of communities within fragments. Likewise, landscape dynamics must be considered, as second
growth structure and overall forest cover contribute to processes in fragments. Here we examine bird communities in 11
Amazonian rainforest fragments of 1100 ha, beginning before the fragments were isolated in the 1980s, and continuing
through 2007. Using a method that accounts for imperfect detection, we estimated extinction and colonization based on
standardized mist-net surveys within discreet time intervals (12 preisolation samples and 45 post-isolation samples).
Between preisolation and 2007, all fragments lost species in an area-dependent fashion, with loss of as few as ,10% of
preisolation species from 100-ha fragments, but up to 70% in 1-ha fragments. Analysis of individual time intervals revealed
that the 2007 result was not due to gradual species loss beginning at isolation; both extinction and colonization occurred in
every time interval. In the last two samples, 2000 and 2007, extinction and colonization were approximately balanced.
Further, 97 of 101 species netted before isolation were detected in at least one fragment in 2007. Although a small subset of
species is extremely vulnerable to fragmentation, and predictably goes extinct in fragments, developing second growth in
the matrix around fragments encourages recolonization in our landscapes. Species richness in these fragments now reflects
local turnover, not long-term attrition of species. We expect that similar processes could be operating in other fragmented systems that show unexpectedly low extinction."
400,"Diversity Pattern of Butterfly Communities (Lepidoptera, Papilionoidae) in Different Habitat Types in a Tropical Rain Forest of Southern Vietnam",Scientific article,ISRN Zoology,"Diversity of butterfly communities of a tropical rain forest of Bu Gia Map National Park in South Vietnam was studied in
four different habitat types (the natural forest, the disturbed forest, the bamboo forest, and the stream sides in the forest) in
December 2008 and April 2009. A total of 112 species with 1703 individuals of Papilionoidae (except Lycaenidae) were recorded.
The proportion of rare species tends to decrease from the natural forest to the stream sides, while the proportion of common
species tends to increase from the natural forest to the stream sides. The stream sides have the greatest individual number, while
the disturbed forest contains the greatest species number. The bamboo forest has the least species and individual numbers. The
stream side environment in the forest plays an important role in conserving butterfly abundance while the bamboo shows the
poorest butterfly diversity."
401,Biodiversity in urban ecosystems: Plants and macromycetes as indicators for conservation planning in the city of Coimbra (Portugal),Scientific article,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Urban landscapes support a high and rich diversity often occurring as unusual or unique communities. Urban green areas are a vital part of the urban landscape, providing contact with wildlife and environmental services with additional socio-ecological benefits to the overall quality of life. The composition and diversity of vascular plants and macromycetes were assessed in an urban green area of the city of Coimbra (central Portugal) comprising three landscape types (Oak-. Eucalyptus-, and Olive-stands), with historical periurban agriculture and forest uses. We recorded 287 taxa of plants, including three taxa with important ecological value (Quercus suber, Quercus faginea subsp. broteroi and Ruscus aculeatus) and 96 taxa of macromycetes. The pattern of land use resulted in the establishment of different plant and soil fungal communities' composition and diversity among these landscapes. The plant richness and diversity indices revealed similar trends within the landscape types, with the highest values found in the Olivestands due to the presence of herbaceous that decreased with tree cover density. Richness and diversity of macromycetes were higher in Oak-stands especially the symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. Although not significant, higher saprobic fungi richness and diversity values were found in the Eucalyptus-stands. Given the undoubted ecological complexity of urban green areas and the value of these ecosystems for society in terms of goods and services, it is imperative to select bioindicators that are readily accessible and reliable to design balanced urban ecosystems by linking wildlife and biological parameters to human well-being."
402,Effect of protected area category on mammal abundance in Western Ghana,Scientific article,Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES),"A comparative study of the species composition and encounter rates of mammals (>400g) in two different protected area categories was conducted in the Bia-Goaso Forest Block in western Ghana from April 2008 to February 2009. One hundred and eighty-seven line transects were systematically distributed in an extensive network of 2 wildlife reserves and 9 forest reserves. Mammal signs (droppings and tracks) belonging to twenty-three species (2 rodents; 5 primates; 6 carnivores and 10 ungulates), representing 4 Families and 17 Genera were recorded for the survey period. The most abundant species recorded were brush-tailed porcupine (Antherurus africanus 14.0%), mammal signs, marsh cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus; 13.4%), Maxwells duiker (Cephalophus maxwelli; 11.3%) and bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus; 10.2%). Large mammals, including elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), buffalo (Sycerus caffer nanus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) and leopard (Panthera pardus) had relative abundance of less than 1.0%. Mammal density was significantly greater (Mann-Whitney U test: U=3057.0, P<0.01) in wildlife reserves (31 signs per km; 66%) than forest reserves (16 signs per km; 34%). Species richness in wildlife reserves (13 species; 57%) was however not very different (U=2262.5, P>0.05) from forest reserves (10 species; 43%).The forest reserves seem to be achieving only partial success in protecting wildlife, whereas wildlife reserves seem to be considerably more effective, although not entirely successful. The results calls for renewed efforts to include more wildlife protection in the management priorities of Ghanas forest reserves."
403,"Effects of partial cutting and partial disturbance by wind and insects on stand composition, structure and growth in boreal mixedwoods",Scientific article,Forestry,"Although partial harvesting has been proposed as a measure for maintaining compositional and structural characteristics of natural old-growth stands, it has not been rigorously evaluated. The first objective of this study was to compare forest composition and structural characteristics after killing a portion of canopy trees and after partial cuts in boreal mixedwoods of eastern Canada by natural disturbances. The second objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the partial harvest treatments in meeting the silvicultural objectives of increased growth of residual stems and advances in regeneration. Higher densities of shade-intolerant species were found after partial cuts when comparedwith naturally disturbed stands. Similar diameter distributions of residual living trees and densities of shade-tolerant species were found following all disturbances. Increase in growth was similar for all height classes (<1 m, 12 m, 24 mand > 4 m) of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) advance regeneration in naturally disturbed and partially cut stands. In the overstory, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), white birch (Betula papyrifera), white spruce (Picea glauca) and balsam fir had growth increases after partial cuts, whereas black spruce (Picea mariana) did not. This study provides evidence that partial cutting in these mixedwood stands may emulate the effects of natural mortality resulting from natural partial disturbances by retaining key compositional and structural attributes and inducing increased growth rates in residual trees."
404,Organic Farming and Landscape Structure: Effects on Insect-Pollinated Plant Diversity in Intensively Managed Grasslands,Scientific article,PLOS ONE,"Parallel declines in insect-pollinated plants and their pollinators have been reported as a result of agricultural intensification.
Intensive arable plant communities have previously been shown to contain higher proportions of self-pollinated plants
compared to natural or semi-natural plant communities. Though intensive grasslands are widespread, it is not known
whether they show similar patterns to arable systems nor whether local and/or landscape factors are influential. We
investigated plant community composition in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms across Ireland in relation to
the local and landscape context. Relationships between plant groups and local factors (farming system, position in field and
soil parameters) and landscape factors (e.g. landscape complexity) were investigated. The percentage cover of unimproved
grassland was used as an inverse predictor of landscape complexity, as it was negatively correlated with habitat-type
diversity. Intensive grasslands (organic and conventional) contained more insect-pollinated forbs than non-insect pollinated
forbs. Organic field centres contained more insect-pollinated forbs than conventional field centres. Insect-pollinated forb
richness in field edges (but not field centres) increased with increasing landscape complexity (% unimproved grassland)
within 1, 3, 4 and 5 km radii around sites, whereas non-insect pollinated forb richness was unrelated to landscape
complexity. Pollination systems within intensive grassland communities may be different from those in arable systems. Our
results indicate that organic management increases plant richness in field centres, but that landscape complexity exerts
strong influences in both organic and conventional field edges. Insect-pollinated forb richness, unlike that for non-insect
pollinated forbs, showed positive relationships to landscape complexity reflecting what has been documented for bees and
other pollinators. The insect-pollinated forbs, their pollinators and landscape context are clearly linked. This needs to be
taken into account when managing and conserving insect-pollinated plant and pollinator communities."
405,High Bee and Wasp Diversity in a Heterogeneous Tropical Farming System Compared to Protected Forest,Scientific article,PLOS ONE,"It is a globally important challenge to meet increasing demands for resources and, at the same time, protect biodiversity
and ecosystem services. Farming is usually regarded as a major threat to biodiversity due to its expansion into natural areas.
We compared biodiversity of bees and wasps between heterogeneous small-scale farming areas and protected forest in
northern coastal Belize, Central America. Malaise traps operated for three months during the transition from wet to dry
season. Farming areas consisted of a mosaic of mixed crop types, open habitat, secondary forest, and agroforestry. Mean
species richness per site (alpha diversity), as well as spatial and temporal community variation (beta diversity) of bees and
wasps were equal or higher in farming areas compared to protected forest. The higher species richness and community
variation in farmland was due to additional species that did not occur in the forest, whereas most species trapped in forest
were also found in farming areas. The overall regional species richness (gamma diversity) increased by 70% with the
inclusion of farming areas. Our results suggest that small-scale farming systems adjacent to protected forest may not only
conserve, but even favour, biodiversity of some taxonomic groups. We can, however, not exclude possible declines of bee
and wasp diversity in more intensified farmland or in landscapes completely covered by heterogeneous farming systems."
406,Patterns of forest vegetation responses to edge effect as revealed by a continuous approach,Scientific article,Annals of Forest Science,"Context Understanding the variability of vegetation distribution
and its determinants is a central issue for addressing
the effects of edges on ecological processes. Recent studies
have revealed inconsistencies in the patterns of responses to
edge effects that raise important questions about their determinants.
We investigated the edge effect response patterns
by adapting a recently proposed continuous approach to the
case of small forest fragments in southwestern France.
Methods We surveyed forest understory vegetation (composition,
species richness, and percent cover) and abiotic
variables (soil temperature, moisture, pH, and canopy openness)
along 28 transects across hard forest edges. We tested
five statistical models to describe the response pattern of
each variable (1) over all transects and (2) per transect. We
then compared the response patterns as a function of the
attributes of the edge (orientation, topography, and adjacent
land cover) and forest patch size.
Results Over all transects, a general decreasing trend was
observed for all variables as the distance from the edge
increased. In the individual transects, we evidenced a large
variability in the response patterns that was not related to
edge attributes or to patch size."
407,Small mammal assemblages in fragmented shrublands of urban areas of Central Chile,Scientific article,Urban Ecosystems,"Mediterranean-type ecosystems are one of the most affected environments by
habitat loss and fragmentation due to urban development, however only few studies have
evaluated the effects of urbanization on the biodiversity of remnant fragments in these
ecosystems. This study aims to evaluate the effects of urban development over small
mammal assemblages inhabiting isolated forest fragments of an urban area of Chilean
Mediterranean zone. We compared abundance and richness of small mammal assemblages
of six remnant fragments within an urban matrix, and six fragments similar in area and
habitat characteristics with those of urban area, but surrounded by a rural matrix. We found
that small mammal assemblages differ considerably among fragments types (urban vs rural),
with lack of endemic species from urban fragments and with high proportion of introduced
rodents in urban fragments. Furthermore abundance of small mammals was higher in rural
than in urban fragments. In urban areas small mammal abundance and richness were not
correlated with any of the explanatory variables assessed (woody cover, flora heterogeneity,
fragment area, perimeter/area ratio). However in rural fragments small mammal richness was
negatively correlated with flora heterogeneity and the abundance of small mammals was
positively correlated with perimeter/area ratio. These results reveal important differences
within the effects of fragmentation over small mammal assemblages among the two types of
fragments assessed. Our findings suggest that in forest fragments isolated by urbanization,
larger areas with good quality habitats are not sufficient to maintain native small mammal
population."
408,Evaluating the effects of habitats on birds in the walnut fruit forests: a case study from Kyrgyzstan,Scientific article,Biodiversity,"Walnut fruit forests represent both a valuable hotspot of biological diversity and have significant economic value for the
livelihoods of local communities. However, the sustainable management of these forests is a complex task requiring the
successful juggling of the different interests of local stakeholders, including fulfilling their economic, social and ecological
demands. Birds were chosen as the indicator of biodiversity with which to evaluate the effects of forest management
activities. A research study was conducted in 2005 during the birds breeding season in five different habitats (primary
and secondary forests, plantation, agroforestry and brushwood) using the point sampling method. A total of 23 species
were recorded. According to the various diversity indices employed, the best habitats for species richness were areas of
agroforestry, while primary forests were found to be the best habitats in terms of species abundance. In contrast, the lowest
bird diversity was observed in plantations due to their structural homogeneity. In addition, habitat suitability was
assessed according to both horizontal and vertical structural parameters and tested using five selected indicator bird species.
The results reveal a link between birds and vegetation, with abundance of old trees, availability of deadwood and
habitat understorey density found to be the most important indicators of bird survival. Our research findings highlight
that it is imperative to protect existing primary forests which are genetic diversity hotspots for endemic species such as
Dendrocopos leucopterus. Although areas under agroforestry were primarily found to be relatively promising habitats in
terms of species richness, these intensively managed ecosystems may also be useful for simultaneously fulfilling the
needs of local people, if such projects are carefully planned and managed."

The species were collected using a standard entomological net from three habitats (forest, grassland and wetland areas) in northwest Iran in 2013. Based on the data collected, the forest area with the highest diversity indices (H' = 2.53, 14 species, and H' = 2.19, 10 species, in Chichakli and Keleybar regions respectively) had the most diverse and abundant species, followed by grassland and wetland areas. The dominant species in the study areas were Dolichopus longitarsis and D. simplex. Besides, three species (D. siculus, D. kiritshenkoi and D. plumipes) were recorded from Iran for the first time. Diagnostic characters and geographical distribution of the species occurring in the studied areas with supplementary figures are provided."
410,The arable plant diversity of intensively managed farmland: Effects of field position and crop type at local and landscape scales,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Agro-ecosystem biodiversity is threatened by increasing spatial homogenisation of intensively managed
farmland. Yet current understanding of patterns of arable plant diversity at various scales remains limited.
We evaluated the extent to which species richness of arable plants in the Rolling Pampas of Argentina is
determined by field position (fencerow, edge and centre) and crop type, at both field (local) and landscape
scales. Plant richness was assessed in maize, soybean and wheatsoybean fields across four landscape
types differing in spatial complexity, as defined by percentage area devoted to cropland. Species richness
was hierarchically nested within landscape types, field positions and crop types. Landscape richness
(-diversity, the cumulative number of species in a set of fields) was additively partitioned into two
components, one for local richness (²-diversity, the mean number of species per field) and one denoting
differences in species composition among fields (¡-diversity, where ¡ = 
-
²). Field position was the main
determinant of landscape-scale plant richness. Overall, -diversity declined from fencerows, through
field edges to field centres, but was unaffected by crop type. Spatial variation in species composition
(¡-diversity), rather than species packing within fields (²-diversity), accounted for most of the variation
in arable -diversity. Higher ¡-diversity in field edges than in field centres suggested that propagule
dispersal from fencerow vegetation may create a mass effect onto certain crop types. Shifts in -diversity
of major perennial life-forms (chamaeophytes and phanerophytes) between field positions and crop types
reflected the contrasting disturbance regimes affecting plant communities of fencerows and cultivated
fields. Our results indicate that preserving coherent and extensive fencerow networks is essential to
conserve farmland biodiversity. Moreover, maintaining landscape heterogeneity to support elevated ¡-
diversities of arable plants requires cropping systems that promote crop diversity in both space and time."
411,An investigation into bee assemblage change along an urban-rural gradient,PhD thesis,Unpublished,"Urban densification in the UK is leading to the fragmentation and isolation of natural habitats in our cities. Current research investigating bee assemblage distribution along urban-rural gradients struggles to gain synthesis, as sites, cities and regions studied vary between studies. Since bees use a variety of areas for their nesting and foraging resources over the urban-rural gradient, increasing study of the types of sites sampled provides a firmer understanding of how bee assemblages respond to urbanisation. Bees were sampled at 33 canal side and parkland sites across Birmingham, UK, with sweep netting and pan trapping undertaken between April-September in 2011 and April-September in 2012. Abundance and diversity metrics were tested for variation between land-use types using ANOVA and rarefaction, and applied to mixed-models to test for relationships with landscape type (m2 built space and agricultural land within 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, 1.5 km, 2 km, 2.5 km, 3 km, 3.5 km and 4 km of each site) and local site variables (floral availability, level of management and exposure). I found that in canal sides and parkland overall bee abundance showed a significant positive relationship with built space, whilst rarefaction indicated species richness was greater in rural areas. Furthermore, division of abundance metrics between genera and species showed increased abundance in several bumblebee species to greater built space, whilst Andrena spp. showed a negative relationship with built space. This chapter presents further evidence that the variation in bee abundance between land-use types is species-specific, supporting recent studies that indicate highly disturbed urban environments filter bee species and determine bee assemblages. This chapter also highlights the importance of site type replication within regions as these results contrast with a study of cemeteries and churchyards in the same region, underlining the importance of sampling all potential habitat sites along urban-rural gradients."
412,Forest-land use complementarity modifies community structure of a tropical herpetofauna,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Different human land uses are not uniform in their ecological effects on remnant faunas. Explicitly rec-
ognizing the relative habitat value of prevalent land uses in comparison to forest will help improve con-
servation theory and practice in human-modified landscapes. To better understand how common land
uses influence habitat quality and buffer forest fragments in tropical landscapes, we characterized reptile
and amphibian assemblages across forest-pasture and forest-peach palm (palmito) ecotones in north-
eastern Costa Rica. We found that forest remnants contained significantly greater overall richness and
abundance of reptiles and amphibians than either palmito or pasture; palmito supported greater species
richness and abundance of herpetofauna than pastures. Assemblages of reptiles and amphibians in pal-
mito also exhibited greater similarity to those found in forests than did assemblages in pasture, particu-
larly for reptiles. Species exhibited distinctive responses to forest-land use ecotones, with some species
reaching their highest abundances in non-forest habitat. Our results show that two important land uses
in Costa Rica differ in their capacity to buffer forest patches and promote landscape connectivity for rep-
tile and amphibian populations. Understanding these differences is crucial for identifying matrix environ-
ments that can complement the natural forest habitats of sensitive reptile and amphibian species."
413,The conservation value of secondary forests in the southern Brazilian Mata Atlantica from a spider perspective,Scientific article,The Journal of Arachnology,"In many tropical areas of the world, pristine forests have become rare. Nevertheless, due to shifts in the human
population the area covered by secondary forests is increasing. These forests may harbor a rich flora and fauna and are
considered to be main refuges for species of primary forests. However, this issue is far from clear. To assess the
conservation value of secondary forests in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, we compared the diversity of spiders in differently
aged secondary forests with old-growth forests. Within a larger project treating several invertebrate taxa, we sampled
spiders using a standard protocol in 24 sites of three successional stages (58, 1520, 3050 years old) and old-growth
forests (. 100 years untouched) in two nature reserves. We describe the diversity and structure of the assemblages using
morphospecies and genera and analyze richness at the genus level. Generic richness and diversity showed no differences
between successional stages; i.e., did not increase from the youngest to older forests, but guild diversity did increase. The
youngest stage showed the highest variability in generic composition, and the turnover of genera and species was strong
between the younger forests (520 years old) and forests older than 30 years. High alpha diversity, high turnover among
sites and the lack of differences in richness between stages support the value of secondary forests for species conservation in
the region studied."
414,Effect of forest fragmentation on bird species richness in Papua New Guinea,Scientific article,Journal of Field Ornithology,"Tropical forests worldwide are being fragmented at a rapid rate, causing a tremendous loss of
biodiversity. Determining the impacts of forest disturbance and fragmentation on tropical biotas is therefore a
central goal of conservation biology. We focused on bird communities in the interior (>100 m from forest edge)
of forest fragments (300, 600, and 1200 ha) in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea and compared them with
those in continuous forest. We surveyed bird communities using point counts, mist-netting, and random walks,
and measured habitat and microclimate characteristics at each site. We also surveyed leaf-dwelling arthropods,
butterflies, and ants, and obtained diet samples from birds to examine food availability and food preferences. We
recorded significantly fewer bird species per point in the 300-ha forest fragment than in other study sites. Overall, we
recorded 80, 84, and 88 species, respectively, in forest fragments, and 102 in continuous forest. Frugivores (especially
large frugivores) and insectivores had lower species richness in forest fragments than continuous forest. Our results
did not support the food scarcity hypothesis, that is, the decline of insectivorous birds in forest fragments is caused
by an impoverished invertebrate prey base. We also found no significant differences among forest fragments and
continuous forest in microclimates of forest interiors. Rather, we found that microhabitats preferred by sensitive
birds (i.e., 30% of species with the strongest preferences for continuous forest) were less common in forest fragments
(19%31% of points) than in continuous forest (86% of points). Our results suggest that changes in microhabitats
may make forest fragments unsuitable for sensitive species. However, limited dispersal capabilities could also make
some species of birds less likely to disperse and occupy fragments. In addition, impoverished food resources, size
of the forest fragment, or hunting pressure could contribute to the absence of large frugivorous birds in forest
fragments. The forest fragments in our study, preserved as village-based protected areas, were not large enough
to sustain the bird communities found in continuous forest. However, because these fragments still contained
numerous bird species, preservation of such areas can be an important component of management strategies to
conserve rainforests and birds in Papua New Guinea."
415,Effect of Small Ruminant Grazing on the Plant Community Characteristics of Semiarid Mediterranean Ecosystems,Scientific article,International Journal of Agriculture & Biology,"Rangeland degradation has been widespread and severe throughout the Syrian steppe as a result of both unfavorable environmental conditions and human induced impacts. To explore the effectiveness of management-based strategies on establishing sustainable rangeland development, we compared the response of temporarily removing grazing from rangelands ecosystems to those under a continuous heavy grazing regime. Results indicated that ungrazed sites had both higher biomass production and plant species composition than grazed sites. Ungrazed plots produced more than fourfold herbaceous biomass production than continuously grazed plots (p < 0.001). Extent of plant cover was 20% greater in ungrazed plots than grazed plots (33.5 & 13.5%, respectively). Furthermore areas protected from heavy grazing had over 200% greater species composition. Thus, protection from grazing can increase forage production and species composition, but may not necessarily improve plant species available for livestock utilization. A more balanced grazing management approach is recommended to achieve an optimal condition of biomass production (quantity), vegetation cover, quality and available forage species that contribute to proving livestock grazing conditions."
416,Haying and grazing effects on the butterfly communities of two Mediterranean-area grasslands,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Grasslands are usually the most suitable environment for butterflies, but have been also traditionally used for productive activities. This paper compares the impact of mowing and grazing on butterfly biodiversity in two S Italian (Campania) grasslands, at Campo Somma (CS) and Pianoro di Prada (PP) located at an identical altitude of 850 m. These grasslands have an area of approximately 6 ha each and are at a 3 km distance from each other. They share similar climate and are both surrounded by woods, mainly of sweet chestnut. CS is managed for haying and is mown once a year, in June. PP is used for sheep and cattle grazing. Weekly transects were made from April to September in 2008 and 2009, during the butterfly flight activity. We analysed data from eight monthly transects by KruskalWallis and MannWhitney tests. We observed 45 butterfly species at PP, and 28 at CS. Diversity indexes were significantly higher at PP, whereas evenness was similar. The monthly comparisons of species richness showed that, except for April, PP values were always significantly higher. Species abundance was significantly higher at PP in June, July and August. In all months, except in April, the ShannonWiener index was also significantly higher at PP, as was Simpsons index in May, June and September. Domi- nance index differed significantly only in May, June and September, whereas evenness was never significantly different between the two grasslands. These data show that, as concerns butterflies, the impact of mowing was much stronger than that of grazing."
417,The effects of human trampling on the microbiological properties of soil and vegetation in Mediterranean mountain areas,Scientific article,Land Degradation & Development,"Increased tourist activity and recreational use of wilderness and other protected areas has endangered zones of high environmental value. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of trampling intensity (low, high use trails and untrampled trails) and distance from the trails (on the trails, at 10 and 20 m from the trails) on the vegetation, chemical, physical and microbiological properties of a soil in Mediterranean mountain areas. Trail type and distance from the trail significantly influenced several parameters. High use trails showed lower values of plant cover and diversity of vegetation species, as well as soil respiration and some enzyme activities (phosphatase, b-glucosidase and dehydrogenase) than low use trails. In addition, the effects of trampling spatially extended further from these high use trails than from low use trails. Statistical analysis showed that some microbiological (basal respiration, dehydrogenase activity and b-glucosidase activity) and vegetal parameters (plant cover and diversity) may be established as a set of indicators for the evaluation of soil quality on these areas subjected to human trampling. We concluded that trampling significantly impacts on soil microbial processes and vegetal communities, and visitor should be restricted from entering ecologically sensitive areas due to the effects of trampling."
418,Impact of tillage system on arbuscular mycorrhiza fungal communities in the soil under Mediterranean conditions,Scientific article,Soil & Tillage Research,"A more diverse arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungal community should be more versatile and resilient to variation in environmental conditions over space and time. To evaluate the effect of no-till and conventional tillage systems, AM fungal diversity was assessed as part of a long term field experiment by sequencing of DNA, extracted from soil, that encoded the large ribosomal sub-unit and was obtained by nested-PCR. In comparison with no-till, conventional tillage decreased AM fungal diversity by 40%. Differences between treatments in the frequency of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in soil, confirm that AM fungi are differently vulnerable to soil disturbance."
419,Assessing the effects of forest management on epiphytic lichens in coppiced forests using different indicators,Scientific article,Plant Biosystems,"Epiphytic lichens are one of the taxonomic groups most sensitive to forest management. Nevertheless, they have not yet been exhaustively included in the assessment of Sustainable Forest Management. This work aimed at evaluating the effects of forest management on epiphytic lichens in coppiced forests, exploring the spatial patterns of diversity and the composition of communities. Moreover, the goal was to compare the performance of four potential indicators for monitoring the effects of forest management on epiphytic lichens: total lichen diversity, species associated with intensive management, species associated with aged coppiced woodlands and Indicator Species Ratio (ISR). In humid Mediterranean Liguria, 50 sampling units were chosen in Castanea sativa and deciduous Quercus spp. forests subjected to different forest management practices: intensively managed coppice and aged coppice/high forest. The effect of forest management was evident in terms of species composition, since it was possible to find significantly associated species for each of the two management types. At each sampling site, the four indicators were calculated using Indicator Value Analysis and compared through correspondence analysis. The ISR was shown to be a more effective indicator, being independent of floristic composition and the occurrence of rare species."
420,Butterfly and grasshopper diversity patterns in humid Mediterranean grasslands: the roles of disturbance and environmental factors,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"The present paper studies butterfly, grasshopper and vascular plant communities in ten seasonally flooded grasslands with different anthropogenic disturbance regimes (NW Greece). Disturbance intensity was assessed on the basis of disturbance frequency and type (grazing, mowing, trampling, constructions). The distribution patterns of but- terflies are regulated by humidity and elevation (Redundancy Analysis). Elevation, flower-heads abundance, low distur- bance intensity and plant species richness predict grasshopper species richness well, while the latter together with humidity predict plant species richness (Generalized Linear Models). Chorthippus lacustris, a critically endangered endemic grasshopper species, is positively associated with humid microhabitats with high flower-heads abundance. An indicator value procedure reveals four butterfly species as being typical species for habitats with a pronounced char- acter of hedgerows and tree lines. Conservation management of grassland butterflies should focus on the maintenance of the humid character of the humid grasslands as well as on the maintenance of hedgerows and tree lines. The reduction of human-induced disturbance towards occasional grazing and mowing seems to benefit both butterfly and grasshopper communities. Finally, we suggest the use of grasshoppers as surrogates for vascular plants and vice versa, given their congruent species richness patterns."
421,Comparing Dung Beetle Species Assemblages Between Protected Areas and Adjacent Pasturelands in a Mediterranean Savanna Landscape,Scientific article,Rangeland Ecology & Management,"Dung beetles are considered keystone species because of their role in decomposition, seed dispersal, and control of vertebrate parasites in grazed habitats. Despite the ecological importance of this group to pasture ecosystem functioning, still little is known about its relationship with grazing management activities. We evaluated the conservation value of protected areas for dung beetle diversity by comparing two different management conditions of Mediterranean savanna in central Spain. Four different sites with wild herbivory (red deer, roe deer) were sampled inside the Caban ̃eros National Park, and four sites with traditional agrosilvopastoral management were sampled in a sheep farm near the park. The dung beetle species richness was similar between savanna conditions, but the total dung beetle abundance and biomass were considerably greater in the park grasslands than in the grasslands of the sheep farm. Dung beetle species composition, species dominance, and abundance by functional groups from both park and farm sites were different, despite the high similarity among the sampled sites in both hydric content and dung availability. Onthophagus maki (Illiger 1803) and O. furcatus (Fabricius 1781) were the dominant species in the park, while O. furcatus, Aphodius foetidus (Herbst 1783), and Caccobius schreberi L. were the dominant species on the farm. Species richness and abundance of telecoprids were higher in the park than on the farm. Abundance of paracoprids was also higher in the park than on the farm, while no differences in species richness and abundance of endocoprids were observed between both conditions. These results suggest that management activities such as plowing and the use of veterinary substances affect soil structure and dung quality and could be important factors that alter dung beetle assemblages in terms of composition, abundance, and biomass on traditional farms."
422,Long-term responses of Mediterranean birds to forest fuel management,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. MechanicalmanagementofforestfuelsisincreasinglyusedintheEuro-Mediterraneanregionin response to the abandonment of traditional agroforestry and the concurrent increase in fire hazard. Although fuel management may have positive side effects for biodiversity, its long-term impacts remain largely unknown.
2. We used a 70-year post-management chronosequence to investigate the influence of time since fuel management and management frequency on bird assemblages in cork oak Quercus suber for- ests.
3. Fuel management strongly affected bird species richness, abundances and assemblage composi- tion, with rapid changes often occurring during the first 1020 years, followed in the next decades by a slow convergence to pre-management levels.
4. In winter, overall species richness and abundance, and that of frugivores and shrub foragers, were negatively affected by recent and recurrent management, only recovering in stands unmanaged for >50 years. In spring, insectivore abundance and the richness and abundance of shrub foragers declined immediately following management, increased to a maximum about 20 years later, and declined thereafter. Breeding granivores and ground foragers were the only groups that benefitted from fuel management. There were no overall effects on species of conservation concern, although a few species with unfavourable status benefitted from fuel management.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our study confirmed that mechanical fuel management has positive effects on some early-successional bird species of conservation concern, although its effects were limited. These benefits should be compared with the strong negative impacts on key bird species such as wintering frugivores, which play a pivotal role in ecosystems by promoting seed dispersal. To reconcile the positive and negative aspects, fuel management should be used to create heteroge- neous mosaics of forest patches encompassing a range of sizes (10100 ha) and successional stages of understorey vegetation, including stands undisturbed for >50 years. This management strategy will likely maintain conditions for a wide range of species with contrasting ecological requirements while also reducing fire hazard."
423,Forest fuel management as a conservation tool for early successional species under agricultural abandonment: The case of Mediterranean butterflies,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"In cultural landscapes there are often negative biodiversity consequences of agricultural abandonment and subsequent scrub and forest encroachment, due to homogenization and the loss of early-successional habitats. The common forestry practice of removing understory vegetation to prevent fire hazard (fuel management) probably has the side-effect of ameliorating these consequences, but it is uncertain whether it effectively restores habitats for early-successional species. Here we examine the influence of time since fuel management and management frequency on butterfly assemblages, using a chronose- quence of cork oak (Quercus suber) stands spanning about 70 years. Overall species richness increased immediately after management and abundances peaked about 23 years later, while both declined there- after for about 1020 years to pre-disturbance levels. Richness and abundances were also much higher in recurrently managed stands. Most life history groups showed successional trends similar to the overall species richness and abundances, though consistent positive effects of fuel management were only observed for species with univoltine life cycle, herbaceous layer feeding, larval overwintering, and inter- mediate body size. Individual species were largely associated with recent and recurrent management, though a few specialists occurred most often in undisturbed stands. These findings suggest that fuel man- agement at <10 years intervals is strongly positive for butterfly assemblages in landscapes under land abandonment. However, to maintain the overall forest biodiversity it is critical that patches of undis- turbed habitat are also retained at the landscape scale."
424,Composition and abundance of Anura in two forest types (natural and planted) in the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia,Scientific article,Caldasia,"Composition and abundance of anuran species were determined for a native forest
and an adjacent area of cultivated oak forest making comparisons among these
habitats. Both forests are inside the Santuario de Fauna y Flora Guanentá, Alto Río
Fonce on the limits of Santander and Boyacá. The visual encounter and search
along transects were the techniques employed to search individuals during different
hours of the day and at different months during one year. In total, 14 species (5
genera and 4 families) were registered, the genus Eleutherodactylus was the most
diverse and two new species of this genus were registered. Almost all anuran species
are endemic from Center-North area of the Cordillera Oriental, except for
Gastrotheca nicefori which has a wider distribution. There were richness and abundance
differences among forests. The native forest has a higher diversity and it
showed the highest number of individuals. Casual encounter searches allowed us
to register different species than those found along transects only for the oak
forest. In this forest the majority of species were found on the trail and not inside the
forest indicating an evident border effect and allowed us more richness detection
because it does not omit rare species. In both sampling types, E. merostictus, E.
miyatai and Eleutherodactylus uisae were the most abundant species for both
forests, all three species were present during lower rainfall months and are considered
generalist for microhabitat occupancy. Common and abundant species of this
area occupy the sown forest, but rare species were found only on forests borders or
in the interior of the native forest"
425,Limitation of nesting resources for ants in Colombian forests and coffee plantations,Scientific article,Ecological Entomology,"1. This study examines limitation of nesting resources for leaf-litter and
twig-nesting ants as a mechanism of diversity loss across an intensification gradient of
coffee production in Colombia. Twelve farms were selected and classified into four
management types: forest, polygeneric shade coffee, monogeneric shade coffee, and
sun coffee (unshaded coffee monocultures).
2. At each of the farms, four treatment subplots were established at the corners of
each of 10 25 m 2 plots: (i) twig augmentation (adding 10 empty bamboo twigs); (ii)
litter augmentation (tripling existing litter profile); (iii) twig and litter augmentation;
and (iv) no manipulation control, for a total of 480 subplots. A twig addition experiment
was also performed on coffee bushes.
3. The results showed significantly more ant colonies in the forest and monogeneric
shade coffee litter augmentation plots after 4 months. Litter-nesting ant species richness
was higher in all three shade systems than in the sun coffee. The identities of ants
nesting on coffee bushes were different from those in the soil level litter. Fewer species
nested in bamboo twigs placed in litter in the most intensive systems.
4. More ants nested in the resource addition treatments, and more ant species were
found in forested habitats; however, a single mechanism cannot explain the observed
patterns. It was concluded that a combination of bottom-up and top-down effects might
lead to the loss of associated fauna with the intensification of these agroecosystems."
426,Diversidad de escarabajos coprofagos (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) en un bosque de galeria con tres estadios de alteracion,Scientific article,"Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias, UNIVERSITAS SCIENTIARUM","In a gallery forest in the oriental flat lands of Meta-Colombia, dung beetles associated to three sections
inside a forest with different times of alteration by deforestation (50, 5 and 1 year) were studied. Pitfall
traps were used to data collection. Richness, abundance and diversity of species were calculated, during
the rain season. 2358 individuals of 22 species were captured. For the three sections Canthidium cupreum
was the most dominant species. 27,3% from the total species is specific from a section, 40,9% was found
in two of the three sections, and 31,8% is generalists. Brillouin index showed that the forest section of 5
years of alteration has the highest diversity with 1233 individuals and 16 species, followed by the forest
section of 1 year with 607 individuals and 14 species and finally the forest section of 50 years with 518
individuals and 15 species. These results indicate that a proportional relation among conservation of a
forest and dung beetles diversity does not exist, and suggests a positive correlation among transformed
areas and high diversity index results. Probably selective deforestation is contributing to conserve dung
beetles populations inside this ecosystem, and also to maintain functional processes for this kind of forests."
427,"Variation of the orchid bees community (Hymenoptera : Apidae) in three altered habitats of the Colombian ""llano"" piedmont",Scientific article,Revista de Biologia Tropical,"Orchid bees subsist in vast tropical forest areas because they maintain close relationships with particular plant species in diverse micro-habitats. Based on the relationships among the environment and biological features (food preference, morphologic and ethologic diversity), it is possible to determine habitat quality using the euglossine array. This work proposes the use of this ecological information, in addition to diversity indices, for the evaluation of environmental quality. Fifteen localities in three landscape types (urban, rural and conserved) were sampled in the eastern llanos foothill (Meta, Colombia), between March
and December of 2003 using entomological nets, and Cineol and Metil Salicylate as baits. Of the 26 species known to occur in the area, 17 were registered. Eulaema nigrita was the most frequent, while E. speciosa E.bombiformis, Euglossa magnipes, E. cybelia, E. heterosticta, E. singularis and Exaerete frontalis were mostly found in habitats rated good to acceptable. The vegetation composition and proximity of forest fragments seem to favor some species in disturbed habitats. Relative diversity of bee body shapes and sizes is proportional to habitat quality"
428,Bee Diversity (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) in a Tropical Rainforest Succession,Scientific article,Acta Biológica Colombiana,"The purposes of this work were to study the bee diversity across successional stages in
a Neotropical rainforest and to test four sampling methods. Bee diversity and richness
were studied in northeastern Medellin (Antioquia, Colombia; 900-1100 m in altitude)
over six months using a chronosequence with four successional stages (abandoned
pastures, low shrubs, secondary forest, and mature forest). Bees were intensively and
systematically sampled, using the following methods: entomological net, Malaise trap,
Methyl Salicylate, and Van Somer trap with decomposed fresh water fish. A total of
15.356 specimens were collected, belonging to four families and 287 species,
representing 62% of all bee species found in Colombia. About 50% of all individuals
sampled were stingless social bees (Apidae, Meliponini). Trigona (Trigona) fulviventris was
the most abundant species (-10%) in the survey. Augochlora and Megachile were the most
specious genera. The pasture and secondary forest showed high values of diversity and
richness and were significantly higher than those of the mature forest and low shrubs.
In all successional stages, except in the mature forest, the number of new species
collected in each sample period approached zero and the species accumulation curves
tended to stabilize as time and sampling area increased. The net was the most efficient
method in all successional stages, except in the forest, where most bee species and
individuals were collected with the Van Somer trap. However, a higher percentage
(50%) of rare species was collected with the Malaise trap. The number of new species
collected in each sampled period and the species accumulation curves suggest that our
survey was nearly sufficient to estimate the bee diversity in these early successional
stages, but insufficient to study the mature forest apifauna. Due to the high efficiency
of the Van Somer trap to attract bees in the forest, this trap should be used regularly
in additional bee surveys in tropical rain forests. We also summarize the bee surveys in
Colombia and highlight the importance of using other less common sampling methods
to study bees from tropical ecosystems."
429,Response of Ants and Their Seed Removal in Rehabilitation Areas and Forests at El Cerrejon Coal Mine in Colombia,Scientific article,Restoration Ecology,"Open-pit coal mining causes strong negative impacts on biodiversity because this activity completely removes thick
layers of soil. Focusing on ants as functional agents responding to mine site rehabilitation has proven useful
in improving restoration practices. This study sought to evaluate the success of the 20-year-old ecological rehabilitation
program at El Cerrej´on, one of the worlds largest open-pit coal mining operation located in a vulnerable
dry tropical forest region of Colombia. This study compared ant assemblages in 13 sites classified along a gradient
of rehabilitation sites aged 014 years, as well as in three forest reference areas. Two sampling methods (pitfall
traps and visual search) were conducted during three sampling periods. Seed removal by ants was also quantified
at seven of the 13 sites using seed bait from native plants. Eighty-two ant species, belonging to 29 genera, were found.
The highest number of ant species were found inside the forests. Ant species richness increased with rehabilitation
age of sites, along with higher canopy cover and milder soil temperature. Rehabilitation actions enhancing these
ecological factors might, therefore, favor the presence of wild fauna such as ants. The oldest area (14 years) was the
most similar to the forests, both in terms of functional ant groups (guilds) and dominant species. Seed movement was
highest in the 14-year-old restored area and was similar to that of the forests, suggesting that this ecological function
has been partially restored and that the movement of seed dispersal agents across the landscape would be enhanced."
430,"Vascular epiphytes in dry oak forests show resilience to anthropogenic disturbance, Cordillera Oriental, Colombia",Scientific article,Caldasia,"We compared the richness and biomass of vascular epiphytes in six seasonally semideciduous oak (Quercus humboldtii) forest fragments of varying structure, using the SVERA protocol. Bromeliads dominated epiphytic vegetation in terms of richness,
10 out of a total of 17 species, and biomass (98%), but overall epiphyte community development was poor in comparison with neotropical wet mountain forests. Epiphyte richness and biomass was similar in all fragments, except one bottom-valley fragment, despite large differences in anthropogenic-induced forest structure. We hypothesize that epiphyte resilience to disturbance in these dry oak forest fragments is due to tolerance of the local epiphyte species to desiccation, overriding micro-climatic differences between forest fragments of different structure."
431,Mixed bird flocks: patterns of activity and species composition in a region of the Central Andes of Colombia,Scientific article,Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad,"Mixed bird flocks are groups of individuals from different species that travel and forage together. Such groups are common in several bird communities around the world. We present species composition and activity patterns of mixed bird flocks in a region of the Central Andes of Colombia. We compared the number of species per flock, as well as the number of flocks among 3 different habitats. We tested hypotheses concerning the flocks daily activity and the co-occurrences of species within them. We recorded 75 species, and the species number per flock varied from 4 to 21. Our data suggest that habitat affects the number of flocks but not their species number, and that the activity of flocks is similar throughout the day. In addition, the association of birds in flocks is affected by interspecific facilitation, with some species co-occurrences found more times than expected by chance. We hypothesize that some tanager species could have a role in flock cohesion. We witnessed 2 predator attacks upon flocks, a number of agonistic interactions among flock members, and squirrels following bird flocks. Our results meet some general patterns described for mixed bird flocks."
432,Anthropogenic Disturbance and Edge Effects on Anuran Assemblages Inhabiting Cloud Forest Fragments in Colombia,Scientific article,Natureza & Conservação,"Anurans have been affected by Andean forest fragmentation and loss, leading to impoverished ensembles along the pasture-forest gradients. We evaluated edge effects on tropical cloud forest anurans in three landscapes with a different degree of anthropogenic disturbance, and their relationships with eight environmental variables. On each landscape we set up 12 permanent transects (two per habitat type: streams in pastures, pastures, the outer limit of the pastures with the forest, the internal edge of the forest, the forest interior and streams inside the forest) and surveyed them using an equal effort. After an effort of 162 man-hours we recorded a total of 251 anurans of eight species. Richness was higher in the forest (seven species) than in pasture (four species). Most species of the ensemble (75%) inhabited the forest habitats, whereas 50% of the anuran species inhabited the pasture. Slope and distance to streams influenced the distribution of all modeled Pristimantis species, although this genus exhibits direct development and doesnt require bodies of water for its reproduction. The canopy cover had a high explanatory power (through beta regressors) on the presence of anuran species in the microhabitat; whereas temperature and relative humidity did not, suggesting that temperature and relative humidity may be less important for frog distributions along pasture-forest gradients in cloud forest landscapes. The anthropogenic disturbance in the landscape, rather than the edge effects, affects the presence of two rare species (Pristimantis ptochus and Pristimantis kelephas) suggesting that these species display a high degree of sensitivity to the transformation of the cloud forest. Future cloud forest management research needs to incorporate anthropogenic disturbance effects, because it strongly interacts with edge and matrix effects, affecting the habitat quality and the persistence of species in the landscape."
433,"Seasonal variation in dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) from Serrania de Coraza, Sucre (Colombia)",Scientific article,Revista Colombiana de Ciencia Animal,"This study presents the seasonal variation of data collected from observation of a 
dung beetle community living in an area of tropical dry forest, with another living in 
an area used for cattle raising, which is located in the Serranía de Corozá Colosó 
Sucre. Over the course of one year - from March 2008 until March 2009 - data was
collected using pitfall traps and flight interception. Both of these were left in the 
field for periods of 48 hours. Some hand capture methods were also used to 
accomplish a collection of 14 samples. We observed a total of 7496 specimens, 
representing 26 species. The analysis showed positive correlations between 
precipitation, richness and abundance of the sites sampled, excepting the 
abundance in the forest zone, which was positive but not significant."
434,Factores ambientales relacionados con la presencia y abundancia de las aves de los humedales de la Sabana de Bogotá,PhD thesis,Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Thesis database,"Using GIS and high definition remote images and bird observations in 19 wetlands, I evaluated the influence of landscape and local habitat characteristics on the richness and composition of bird communities in the area and in the density and abundance of seven particular species. Wetlands either had a high proportion of vegetation cover due to eutrophication (mostly in urban landscapes) or were mostly open water with less emergent vegetation (mostly rural landscapes). Both bird richness and abundance were related to wetland size while densities were related to varied factors particular to each species. Conservation of wetland birds in the Sabana de Bogotá is possible due to the differences in both vegetation covers and landscape characteristics in the remaining wetlands. This situation calls for a regional aproximation to conservation."
435,Cross-taxon congruence of α and β diversity among five leaf litter arthropod groups in Colombia,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"In this study a and b diversity patterns of five leaf litter arthropod groups (ants, predatory ants, oribatid mites, spiders and other arachnids) were described and compared in 39 sampling patches of a transformed landscape in southwestern Colombia, that represented five vegetation types: secondary forest, riparian forest, giant bamboo forest, pasture and sugarcane crop. It was also assessed whether some taxa could be used as diversity surrogates. A total of 6,765 individuals grouped in 290 morphospecies were collected. Species richness in all groups was lower in highly transformed vegetation types (pasture, sugarcane crop) than in native ones (forests). In contrast, there were no clear tendencies of b diversity among vegetation types. Considering sampling patches, 0.142% of the variation in a diversity of one taxonomic group could be explained from the a
diversity of another, and 0.233% of the variation of b diversity of a given taxon was explained by that in other groups. Contrary to recent findings, we concluded that patterns of a diversity are more congruent than patterns of b diversity. This fact could be attributed to a sampling effect that promotes congruence in a diversity and to a lack of a clear regional ecological gradient that could promote congruent patterns of b diversity. We did not find evidence for an ideal diversity surrogate although diversity patterns of predatory ants had the greatest congruencies. These results support earlier multi-taxon evaluations in that conservation planning should not be based on only one leaf litter arthropod group."
436,Macrofungal diversity in Colombian Amazon forests varies with regions and regimes of disturbance,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Here we present the results of fungal biodiversity studies from some selected
Colombian Amazon forests in relationship to plant biodiversity and successional stages
after slash and burn agriculture. Macrofungal diversity was found to differ between forests
occurring in two regions (Araracuara vs Amacayacu) as well as between flooded forests
and terra firme forests in the Amacayacu region. Macrofungal biodiversity differed
between regeneration states of different age in the Araracuara region. Suitable substrates,
especially dead wood that occurred as a result of recent slash and burn agriculture, resulted
in the formation of many sporocarps of wood-inhabiting species. Putative ectomycorrhizal
species were found in a dipterocarp forest. Fifty two percent of the macrofungal species
could not be identified to the species level, but could be assigned to a genus, and it is likely
that a significant portion of these represent species new to science. Long term studies are
needed to obtain a comprehensive and complete understanding of the diversity and
functioning of mycobiota in Amazon forest ecosystems."
437,"Dung beetle assemblage structure (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) in three sites with differing land use in Antioquia, Colombia",Scientific article,Actualidades Biologicas,"Andean forests are subjected to strong hábitat disturbance and fragmentation due to the creating of pasture and crop
monocultures, especially coffee. In addition, there is little information available concerning the ability of these
forest relicts to maintain their biodiveristy. This study was conducted in a coffee-ranching farm in the municipality
of Tarso (Antioquia), Colombia, using dung beetles are a bioindicator group. Three inventories in three habitats
were conducted, each via a transect with nine pitfall traps baited with pig feces during 48 hours. A total of 779
individuals belonging to 13 species and 7 genera were collected. Onthophagus curvicornis (n = 196, 25,2%) and
Oxysternon conspicillatum among the habitats in terms of richness, abundance, or diversity, but they did differ in biomass. The assemblage was dominated by diggers, with some endocoprids, and no roller species, indicating the high degree of disturbance
to the forests. The coffee plantation was the habitat with the highest diversity, perhaps due to a greater food supply.
The biomass differences documented were probably a result of habitat disturbance and fragmentation, leading to
the dominance of O. conspicillatum, suggesting that the presence of this species in this area will be indispensable
for maintaining ecosystem functionality."
438,"Landscape simplification and altitude affect biodiversity, herbivory and Andean potato yield",Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. The simplification of agricultural landscapes through the increase in cropped area has caused
the loss of habitats for many species that fulfil important ecosystem services such as pest control
and production. Evidence for detrimental effects on ecosystem services is scarce, particularly in
tropical regions.
2. We studied the effect of the percentage of cropped land in the landscape and altitude in tropical
agro-ecosystems in relation to crop pest regulation and yield. In the Colombian Andes, we established
potato Solanum tuberosum plots along gradients of altitude and increasing proportion of
cropped area to assess the effects on herbivores, their natural enemies, potato production and overall
biodiversity.
3. Increasing altitude and percentage cropped land reduced the richness and abundance of herbivores
and their natural enemies, except for the specialist Guatemalan potato moth Tecia solanivora,
which showed the opposite response.
4. Potato yield was negatively affected by the presence of the Guatemalan potato moth, which
increased in density as the percentage of cropped land and altitude increased. Other herbivores and
natural enemies did not affect yield.
5. Synthesis and applications. Tropical landscapes at lower altitude or with smaller areas of
cropped land suffered less from the presence of the potato moth, which had a negative effect on
yield. Our results suggest that conservation of natural habitats like the endangered Andean
ecosystems would benefit farmers through ecosystem services such as reduced pest damage, higher
yield and increased functional biodiversity."
439,Unpublished data of the response of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in the northeastern Colombian Andes to habitat modification,Unpublished article,,"Forestry practices, mainly the clear-cutting and establishment of young plantations, are two main drivers that increase fragmentation and change forest structure in many tropical forests. The consequences of these practices on the structure and composition of carabids on Andean ecosystems are not well understood. In the northeastern Colombian Andes, we studied changes in the composition and diversity of carabid assemblages in four different types of plant coverages affected by disturbance. We found a considerable change among plant coverage types in terms of carabid composition, diversity, and abundances; where these three ecological parameters showed a strongly structure and similar patterns observed principally in boreal forests. We found that carabid diversity and abundance were higher in the regenerating forests as the oak forest and gallery forest than in the natural forest as the undisturbed forest. Stenotopic species were associated with undisturbed forest, in contrast, eurytopic species were more abundant and associated with the oak forest. Therefore, the disturbance caused by the logging involved a loss of specialist species and an increase of generalist species in the disturbed areas. The local patterns caused by the disturbance might be related to the regional distribution of carabids species. Due to strongly association of some species with particular habitats, the regional distribution of specialist and generalist species might be determined by abiotic and biotic conditions as a result of different events that lead the dispersal of carabids species."
440,Scarabaeoidea superfamily (Insecta: Coleoptera) as a bioindicator element of anthropogenic disturbance in an amazon national park,Scientific article,Revista de Biología Tropical,"Insects have been recognized to be important indicators of the quality elements of ecosystems, among others, because of their rapid response to environmental variability and ease cost-effective capture. In this work we evaluated whether beetles of the Scarabaeoidea superfamily may be used as bioindicators of anthropogenic disturbance of Amazonian terra firme rain forests, in order to provide guidelines for monitoring strategies of the Amacayacu National Park. We considered three different levels of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e. low, medium, high) in 12 transects (four in each intervention level), and caught all beetle species of this superfamily. Three interception traps, two light traps, three pitfalls and four bottle fruit traps were used per transect, as well as manual catch. In total, 593 individuals belonging to 92 species, 44 genera and seven families were collected. Scarabaeidae (n=232, 27 spp.) and Dynastidae (n=161, 26 spp.) were the families with the highest number of individuals and species, while Aphodiidae, Cetoniidae and Geotrupidae exhibited the lowest. The most abundant species per family were Ateuchus sp. (33.2%) from Scarabaeidae, Cyclocephala verticalis (55.9%) from Dynastidae, Astaena sp. (75.8%) from Melolonthidae, Ceratocanthus amazonicus (66.7%) from Ceratocanthidae y Chaetodus asuai (96.8%) from Hybosoridae. Results showed that the number of species and individuals increased with the anthropogenic disturbance. The Margalef and Shannon indexes also revealed that the highest richness and equity occurred in the high-disturbed site, respectively. Dynastidae exhibited the highest number of exclusive species per gradient, while Scarabaeidae shared most of its species. Ten species were recorded in the three disturbance levels, 26 species in two and 56 species were exclu- sive to one level. The most abundant species Chaetodus asuai (Hybosoridae) presented a significant decrease in the number of individuals as disturbance increased, while an inverse relationship occurred for C. verticalis (Dynastidae). For Astaena sp. (Melolonthidae) and Ligyrus gyas (Dynastidae) a high number of individuals was recorded and were exclusive for one forest site (low and high disturbed forest, respectively). The complete superfamily cannot be used like a single bioindicator element because it displays, in a specific level, very dif- ferent behaviors in each disturbance condition. We discuss the use of richness and diversity as indicators of disturbance, while we highlight abundance of particular taxa as a better metric for disturbance."
441,Restoration of a forest ecosystem: The effects of vegetation and dispersal capabilities on the reassembly of plant-dwelling arthropods,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Restoration of degraded forest ecosystems is critical to conservation, but it is unknown if all components can be successfully restored. Despite the obvious dependence of plant-dwelling arthropods on plants, there are few empirical tests to show if restoring the plants also restores the plant-dwelling arthropods, or if other factors inhibit recolonisation. This paper tests the congruence in reassembly trajectory between these two groups and the role of dispersal capabilities on arthropod recolonisation, using Hemiptera. Plants and arthropods were sampled along a chronosequence of individual mine pits representing increasing ages since restoration works, and surrounding unmined forest. Changes in the richness, composition and structural complexity of the vegetation are described. These data are compared to Hemiptera sampled by beating and vacuuming over 18 months. Following the initial establishment of vegetation, the richness of plant species remains at a plateau as pits age, and below that found in unmined forest. In contrast, some structural attributes of the vegetation in pits become more similar to the forest with time. As pits age, dead vegetation below 20 cm thickens and living midstorey vegetation thins. Plant species composition changes with time but is not tracking directly toward unmined forest. The abundance and richness of hemipteran species remain constant as pits age (∼74.5 species), at a similar value to that in the forest. Recolonisation by Hemiptera that are brachypterous (with permanently reduced wings) is markedly slower than for winged taxa. That said, the compositions of plant and hemipteran species follow a similar trajectory after mining (i.e., there is high congruence between the two taxa). Hemipteran species composition in the oldest pits sampled (9-year-old) is not tracking directly toward that found in unmined forest. We conclude that for plant-dwelling arthropods, the early stages of reassembly are characterised by a high abundance of a generalist species and the slow recolonisation by specialist taxa and fauna with limited dispersal abilities (e.g., brachypters). Thereafter, return to a composition similar to that prior to the disturbance depends upon the progress of vegetation reassembly. To obtain plant-dwelling arthropod assemblages characteristic of unmined forest, restoration must reinstate the plant species and structural complexity of the vegetation found in the forest (particularly long-lived species and ground covers)."
442,"Adult butterfly communities in coffee plantations around a protected area in the Western Ghats, India",Scientific article,Animal Conservation,"Although large areas of relatively undisturbed forests are essential for preserving biodiversity, opportunities for conservation in human-dominated landscapes must not be overlooked. Agroforestry systems such as shaded coffee plantations are known to be more compatible with biodiversity conservation than other, more drastic, land transformations. In recent times, however, modernization of coffee cultivation has influenced its conservation values adversely. We evaluated adult butterfly diversity in 12 coffee plantations around a protected area (PA) in the Western Ghats, India. We sampled 25 transects that varied in distance from the PA and in proportion of silver oak Grevillea robusta, an exotic timber species. We also had two transects within the PA. We used a combination of line transects and fruit bait traps to sample butterflies. Micro-climatic variables (temperature, humidity and light intensity) and other habitat variables (e.g. canopy cover, tree diversity, herb species richness) were recorded for each transect. We analyzed the effect of these variables on the abundance and species richness of butterflies, overall as well as in different families, feeding guilds and size classes. Proximity to the PA significantly influenced the abundance and richness of butterflies in coffee planta- tions, with transects close to the PA having higher abundance and richness than transects further away. Also, in terms of butterfly species composition, similarity to forest declined with increasing distance. Among the habitat variables, only canopy cover had a significant effect on abundance and richness, and the effect was negative. These patterns, with some exceptions, were also reflected for different families and feeding guilds. The proportion of silver oak had no apparent effect on butterflies. This study demonstrates that coffee plantations can act as a buffer for butterfly fauna within a certain radius of a PA. They have great potential as auxiliary tools and can significantly complement conservation efforts that are currently centered on PAs."
443,Does habitat structure influence capture probabilities? A study of reptiles in a eucalypt forest,Scientific article,Wildlife Research,"Pitfall traps are commonly used to examine differences in reptile communities among habitat types and disturbance regimes that differ in structure. However, capture rates and probabilities may be influenced by habitat structure, which invalidates comparisons of relative abundance among habitat types. To assess whether pitfall traps provide accurate reflections of density and whether habitat structure affects capture probabilities, we trapped at six sites in various jarrah-forest habitat types in south-western Australia, then intensively searched 150-m2 total-removal plots around each pitfall grid to obtain absolute densities of reptiles. Pitfall captures were significantly correlated with numbers on total-removal plots for Hemiergis initialis and Lerista distinguenda, indicating that pitfall traps provided accurate reflections of density for these species. Capture probabilities of H. initialis and L. distinguenda and all reptiles combined showed no significant correlations with any structural variables, indicating that capture probabilities were consistent across sites. We conclude that trapping provided accurate estimates of relative abundance for some species and that capture probabilities were not influenced by vegetation structure. Because many studies use trapping to estimate abundances among habitat types, we encourage researchers to investigate how vegetation structure influences capture probabilities, so that general patterns can be determined; we also suggest improvements for any future studies."
444,"Surface-active arthropods in organic vineyards, integrated vineyards and natural habitat in the Cape Floristic Region",Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"The Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa, is a biodiversity hotspot challenged by intensive wine pro- duction. Innovative approaches are being explored to opti- mize wine production without compromising biodiversity. As organic farming enhances biodiversity conservation in many other regions, the aim here was to assess the potential of organic vineyard management for conserving CFR soil surface arthropod diversity. Pitfall traps were used to sample arthropods in three study areas, each of which included an organic vineyard, an integrated vineyard and a natural vegetation reference habitat. Overall arthropod morphospecies richness was highest in natural sites, fol- lowed by organic vineyards and then integrated vineyards. The same trend was seen for predators, saprophages and phytophages. The ability of organic vineyards to sustain more morphospecies than integrated vineyards were par- tially due to higher non-crop vegetation complexity and less intense management in the organic vineyards. Arthropod assemblages were similar in organic and integrated vine- yards, while both land-uses differed greatly from natural sites. Variation among natural vegetation assemblages in different study areas was also much greater than among assemblages of cultivated sites. Organic vineyard manage- ment has the potential to make an important contribution to arthropod conservation in the CFR at the field scale. However, at the landscape scale, natural habitat supports a much wider variety of morphospecies, and the preservation of natural fragments in the vineyard landscape may be the most effective measure to increase biodiversity in the winelands."
445,Assessing Variation in Wildlife Biodiversity in the Tien Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan Using Ancillary Camera-trap Photos,Scientific article,Mountain Research and Development,"During the summer and fall of 2005 while documenting snow leopard (Panthera uncia) abundance (McCarthy et al 2008), we collected ancillary camera-trap photos taken in the Tien Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan and assessed their usefulness for biodiversity surveys of larger animal species. The study was conducted in 2 separate areas; one that had been declared a strictly protected national park, and a second that had no formal protection but was used as a hunting reserve by foreign interests. By using 22-24 pairs of cameras placed for 49 days in both areas, we photographed 9 of 13 probably occurring large (> 1 kg) mammal species identified in a country-wide review. Of the 9 species that appeared in photographs, 4 also were identified genetically from simultaneously collected scat samples. Two species identified by the genetic sample were not photographed. Photo rates differed between areas and corresponded to independent abundance estimates for snow leopards (from fecal genetic individual identification), and for argali (Ovus ammon) and Siberian ibex (Capra ibex; both from visual surveys). The photo rates of ungulates were highest, and those for large carnivores were lowest, in the ""strictly protected area,'' which suggested an effect from illicit control of predators by occupants of the surrounding villages. In contrast, in the unprotected area, where hunting was managed and local residents and visitors were few, the species diversity and photo rates for most species were higher. Our use of ancillary camera-trap photos was valuable for authenticating species presence and, sometimes, for documenting differences in species abundances between areas with different conservation histories. In addition, this study indicates the importance of continued outreach and collaboration with villagers to ensure effective wildlife conservation within Kyrgyz national parks."
446,Identifying unidirectional and dynamic habitat filters to faunal recolonisation in restored mine-pits,Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. There is increasing evidence that passive faunal recolonisation of restored areas can take decades or even centuries, reducing benefits to biodiversity fromrestoration. Thus, there is a need to develop restoration and management strategies that facilitate and accelerate faunal recolonisation. This requires identification of habitat features that act as filters to slow or prevent recolonisation and whether those filters are temporally unidirectional or dynamic.
2. We investigated successional patterns of reptiles and mammals in restored mine-pits in southwestern Australia to identify potential filters to faunal recolonisation. We sampled reptiles and small mammals using 30 trapping grids across each of four restoration ages (4, 8, 12 and 17-years old) and unmined forest and assessed vegetation structure to identify animalhabitat relationships.
3. Mammal communities in restored areas converged on unmined forest communities as restoration matured, and all species recolonised rapidly, indicating there were no filters to mammal recolonisation. In contrast, reptile communities did not converge in the same way, indicating there were filters that slowed or prevented reptile recolonisation. We identified three reptile species that were slow, or failed, to recolonise restored areas and a fourth species that rapidly recolonised but disappeared as restoration matured. We identified low coarse woody debris (CWD) volumes and high overstorey stem densities as likely filters; the former is a unidirectional filter thatwill decrease gradually over long time frames, possibly centuries, while the latter is a dynamic filter that fluctuates in its intensity over short time frames of years.
4. Synthesis and applications. Our study adds to growing evidence that filters to faunal recolonisation may be widespread in restored areas, with important implications for restoration practices. Firstly, examining individual species may more effectively identify filters than examining community successional patterns. Secondly, filters can persist over long time frames, possibly centuries, so management, such as the provision and accelerated development of CWD, may need to occur over similar time frames. Lastly, filters can be dynamic and repeated management interventions, such as thinning, may be required to overcome these filters. The growing evidence for filters suggests that facilitating faunal recolonisation is more complex than simply returning vegetation to restoration sites."
447,Sacred forests are keystone structures for forest bird conservation in southwest China's Himalayan Mountains,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Identifying and protecting ‘‘keystone structures’’ is essential to maintain biodiversity in an increasingly human-dominated world. Sacred forests, i.e. natural areas protected by local people for cultural or reli- gious regions, may be keystone structures for forest birds in the Greater Himalayas, but there is limited understanding of their use by bird communities. We surveyed birds and their habitat in and adjacent to six Tibetan sacred forests in northwest Yunnan China, a biodiversity hotspot. Our goal was to understand the ecological and conservation role of these remnant forest patches for forest birds. We found that sacred forests supported a different bird community than the surrounding matrix, and had higher bird species richness at plot, patch, and landscape scales. While we encountered a homogeneous matrix bird community outside the scared forests, the sacred forests themselves exhibited high heterogeneity, and supported at least two distinct bird communities. While bird community composition was primarily driven by the vegetation vertical structure, plots with the largest-diameter trees and native bamboo groves had the highest bird diversity, indicating that protecting forest ecosystems with old-growth characteristics is important for Himalayan forest birds. Finally, we found an increased bird use of the sacred forests and their edges during 2010, a severe drought year in Yunnan, indicating that sacred forests may serve as refuges during extreme weather years. Our results strongly indicate that sacred forests represent an important opportunity for Himalayan bird conservation because they protect a variety of habitat niches and increase bird diversity at multiple spatial scales."
448,The Potential Role of Scattered Trees for Ant Conservation in an Agriculturally Dominated Neotropical Landscape,Scientific article,Biotropica,"Although biological conservation has traditionally focused on the protection of pristine areas, it is becoming increasingly evident that efforts should also be made toward the maintenance of biological diversity in human-managed ecosystems. We evaluated the potential role of scattered, remnant trees in enhancing ant diversity in agricultural lands within a biodiversity hotspot, namely the Cerrado savan- nas of central Brazil. Ant collections were performed in, beneath, and away from the crowns of a native tree species growing in planted pastures, soy fields, and in small (<400 ha) savanna reserves. Significantly more ant species were found beneath than 30 m away from scattered trees. The magnitude of this effect was similar in soy fields and in pastures at all scales of our analyses, except at the landscape scale where the effect was comparatively greater in soy fields. Most of the species that occurred more frequently beneath than away from trees nest on ground, indicating that the conservation value of scattered trees goes beyond the mere protection of arboreal ant species. Soy plantations presented a particular species-poor ground-dwelling fauna when compared with savannas, whereas differences in the number and composition of arboreal species were less marked. In contrast, the diversity of arboreal- and ground-dwelling ants recorded in and beneath pasture trees was nearly as high as the one found in savannas. It is suggested that pasture trees can have an important value for ant conservation off reserves, particularly in regions where most of the native vegetation has already been cleared."
449,Assessing rodent community responses in disturbed environments of the Chilean Patagonia,Scientific article,Mammalia,"The effects of a perturbation gradient on a Patagonian rodent community were assessed over the course of a year by comparing the community parameters in natural and different disturbed environments in the central Chilean Patagonia. The studied habitat types were mature forest, second-growth forest, forest plantations, and agricultural grassland. We recorded eight species of sigmodontine rodents (Abrothrix longipilis, Abrothrix olivaceus, Chelemys macronyx, Geoxus valdivianus, Irenomys tarsalis, Loxodontomys micropus, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, and Reithrodon auritus). Most species experience an increment in abundance from summer to autumn, with a notable decrease in winter and spring. The grassland showed lower species abundance than the mature forest. However, we did not detect significant differences in diversity, evenness, or species richness among the forest habitats. Our results suggest that rodents basically distinguish between forested and open areas, but not the specific plant composition of each habitat. Thus, the change in land use in the central Chilean Patagonia has not significantly affected the community parameters of diversity, evenness, or species richness."
450,Human-induced disturbances influence on bird communities of coastal forests in Eastern Tanzania,Scientific article,British Journal of Applied Science & Technology,"Aims: To assess the influence of human-induced disturbances on bird communities. Study Design: Longitudinal study. Place and Duration of Study: Four forests; - Kion/Zaraninge, Kwamsisi/Kwahatibu, Msumbugwe and Gendagenda in PanganiSaadani ecosystem, from October 2010 to January 2011. Methodology: Eight permanent transects, each 500 m long stratified into forest core and forest edge habitats were used in each forest to identify types and quantify levels of human-induced disturbances, determine bird species composition, diversity and richness, and abundance. Therefore three circular plots, each 20 m radius were allocated at beginning, middle and end of each transect. The level of disturbance was assessed using four disturbance indicators; tree lopping, human trails, Pit-sawing and animal snaring while bird species were identified by sight and call. One-way Analysis of Variance was used to test for differences in bird abundance between forests. Moreover, Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (H) was calculated for each forest to assess species diversity and evenness, and Bray-Curtis Cluster analysis was used to determine similarity in bird species composition between the forests. Results: A total of 564 individuals composed of 88 bird species distributed in ten Orders were recorded. The level of Pit-sawing and lopping differed significantly between forests (P<.05) with Msumbugwe being more disturbed than the rest. Bird abundance differed significantly between the forests (P<.05) with the highest abundance occurring in Msumbugwe. As expected, species richness and diversity were greater in least disturbed forests-Kiono/Zaraninge and Kwamsisi/Kwahatibu than in the highly disturbed forest, but forest dependent species were not significantly different between the study forests. Apparently, only Pit-sawing was found to correlate with bird abundance (P<.01) whereas similarities in species composition were evident with Kion/Zaraninge and Gendagenda exhibiting much overlap. Conclusion: Increasing forest disturbances seems to negatively impact on distribution of birds thus challenging conservationists to devising sustainable forest management strategies in order to sustain bird diversity and abundances in these unique forests."
451,Does coarse woody debris density and volume influence the terrestrial vertebrate community in restored bauxite mines?,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a critical functional and structural component of forest and woodland ecosystems, providing habitat for many species, and is an important consideration in forest and woodland restoration. CWD is very slow to develop naturally so, to accelerate the return of CWD-dependent species to restored areas, CWD is commonly returned manually. However, few studies have tested the effectiveness of such a strategy. We investigated whether the provision of CVVD, heaped into 'habitat piles' of varying density (0.4-5.7 piles ha(-1)), was effective in accelerating recolonisation by reptiles, frogs and mammals into 3-year old restored bauxite mine-pits in south-western Western Australia. Both reptile and mammal communities, and the abundances of some individual species, differed significantly between unmined and restored forest but the provision of CWD had only a weak effect in accelerating recolonisation. Acritoscincus trilineatus abundance showed a weak positive relationship with habitat pile density and both Cryptoblepharus buchananii and Christinus mannoratus, species that are very rare in restoration, were recorded adjacent to habitat piles in two and one mine-pits respectively. The weak effects of CWD in accelerating recolonisation were likely due to the differences in vegetation between unmined and restored forest, resulting in restored forests being primarily inhabited by generalist species that did not require CWD, and the highest habitat pile densities being <=,6% of log densities in unmined forest, suggesting that CWD-dependent species perceived all mine-pits as having similarly low levels of CWD, compared to unmined forest. Our results suggest that the provision of CWD in restored areas is critical to accelerate recolonisation of CWD-dependent fauna, but this will require consideration of both CWD spatial connectivity and temporal continuity. Spatial connectivity would be best achieved through CWD densities that approximate those in reference ecosystems, whereas temporal continuity will be harder to achieve, particularly in systems where CWD is slow to develop, and will require the development of innovative techniques and long-term management. However, ensuring the spatial connectivity and temporal continuity of CWD in restored areas should greatly increase their biodiversity value."
452,Edge effects across boundaries between natural and restored jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests in south-western Australia,Scientific article,Austral Ecology,"Edge effects are a widespread and ubiquitous ecological phenomenon, yet they remain poorly studied across edges between restored and natural forests. To address this lack of knowledge, we studied vertebrate communities across edges between 3‐year old restored mine‐pits and adjacent unmined forest in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest of south‐western Australia. We found that mammal communities showed no edge response but reptile communities did. Overall reptile abundance and Morethia obscura abundance were higher in unmined forest along edges, Egernia napoleonis abundance was lower in unmined forest along edges, while Pogona minor abundance was lower in restored mine‐pits along edges. Predictive models were unable to predict species edge responses, due to the lack of knowledge of the ecology of jarrah forest reptiles, but proved useful in identifying potential ecological mechanisms behind observed edge responses and suggested that potential mechanisms were likely different for each species. Our study is the first to show edge responses in both habitats forming the edge between restored and natural forests, emphasizing the importance of studying both habitats forming the edge. Our results also suggest that, despite being poorly studied, edge responses are common across edges between restored and natural forest and result from a variety of ecological mechanisms. An increased understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving edge responses across edges between restored and natural forests will improve our ability to integrate restored areas into cross‐landscape management and, ultimately, improve our ability to manage landscapes for biodiversity conservation.

453,"Effects of livestock grazing and habitat characteristics on small mammal communities in the Knersvlakte, South Africa",Scientific article,Journal of Arid Environments,"We studied the influence of different livestock grazing intensities and habitat types on small mammals in the Knersvlakte, South Africa. The Knersvlakte belongs to the Succulent Karoo Biome, a biodiversity hotspot. We placed a total of 22 plots in areas of two grazing intensities (moderate and intensive) and two major habitat types (quartz fields and loamy soils). On these plots, we carried out small-mammal live trapping (90 traps during four nights) and estimated the cover of different vegetation layers. In total, 140 small mammal individuals from ten species were caught during 7920 trap nights. All species occurred on loamy soils, but only four in quartz fields. The small-mammal community on intensively-grazed plots was a subset of that on moderately-grazed plots. The most abundant species on loamy soils were Macroscelides proboscideus and Rhabdomys pumilio and in quartz fields M. proboscideus and Gerbillurus paeba. Generalised linear models revealed that habitat type had the strongest influence on abundance and diversity of small mammals. Vegetation cover mainly had indirect influences, via the habitat type, on abundance, diversity and the body condition of small mammals. Overall, the intensities of livestock grazing showed no effect on abundance and diversity."
454,"Species richness and meta-community structure of land snails along an altitudinal gradient on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea",Scientific article,Journal of Molluscan Studies,"We investigated the land-snail fauna of rain forests on the eastern slopes of Pico Biao on Bioko Island in the Gulf of Guinea. Thirty-seven plots were studied along an altitudinal transect reaching from sea level (lowland rain forest) to an altitude of 1,830 m (mossy forest). A total of 1,755 specimens were col- lected and were assigned to 68 land-snail species. Eleven species were new records for Bioko. At least 15 of the recorded species are endemic to Bioko. The degree of endemism was high in mossy forest (23%) and in lowland rain forest (20%), but lower in montane forest (8%). Species richness showed a hump- shaped distribution along the altitudinal gradient with a maximum at 500 m a.s.l. Species richness peaked in forests in which there had been selective logging more than 50 years ago, indicating that some disturbance may have beneficial effects on biodiversity. Species richness was correlated with the thickness of leaf litter. The availability and quality of suitable microhabitats is more important for the occurrence of snail species than gradients of otherwise often decisive environmental parameters like temperature, which are strongly correlated with altitude. A lack of clustering of the occurrences of dif- ferent snail species along the altitudinal gradient indicated a Gleasonian meta-community structure with individualistic responses of the various species to environmental parameters. No negative co-occur- rence patterns that might provide evidence for interspecific competition could be detected. The fre- quent coexistence of morphologically similar, and presumably ecologically equivalent, congeneric species may indicate that such equivalents do not exclude each other as predicted by the neutral theory of biodiversity. However, current knowledge about individual snail species is too scanty to exclude the possibility that niches of congeneric species differ in some details."
455,Anthropogenic disturbance changes the structure of arboreal tropical ant communities,Scientific article,Ecography,"We investigated the infiucnce of anthropogenic disturbance on the structure of
arboreal Formicidae communities in SE Asian lowland forests. Included were a
primary forest and three disturbed forests whieh had been cut for crop planting and
abandoned 5. 15, and 40 yr after agricullural use for natural regeneration. Ant
communities of at least 10 Individuals of one tree species were sainpied from each
forest type by fogging. Diversity and community structure differed clearly among
forest types. During the course of forest regeneration ant communities became more
and more similar to those ol"" the primary forest. A surrogate analysis shows thai ant
communities of the primary lores! cannot be distinguished from randomly composed
communities. This is in contrast to the theoretical expectations according to which
ant communities should be structured by interspecific competition ihat lead to a large
degree of predictability. However, a deterministic pattern of ant communities is
found in the disturbed forest. This indicates that human disturbance not only changes
the faunisiic composition of ant communities but could also change the dynamics of
the whole system. The transition from stochastic !o deterministic communities might
be of general importance for understanding the mechanisms structuring communities
in disturbed habitats."
456,"Diversity and abundance of some ground-dwelling invertebrates in plantation vs. native forests in Tasmania, Australia",Scientific article,Forest Ecology and Management,"Land snails, millipedes, carabid beetles and velvet worms (Onychophora) were methodically hand-sampled at 46 localities on paired plots in conifer or eucalypt plantations and in nearby native forest in northwest Tasmania. Native land snails and millipedes were less diverse in plantations than in native forests, and introduced land snails were several times more abundant in plantations. Many taxa, however, including a velvet worm previously considered to be threatened by plantation development, and including almost half the taxa represented by 10 or more specimens, were found at least as commonly in plantations as in native forests. Invertebrate conservation may be assisted by specific forestry operations, including windrowing, mound ploughing, and leaving waste prunings and thinnings to rot. Plantation development on cleared farmland can allow invertebrates to re-invade from adjacent bush remnants, reducing the risk of local extinctions."
457,"Exploring biological diversity, environment and local people's perspectives in forest landscapes: Methods for a multidisciplinary landscape assessment",Agency report (published),The Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"This document is intended for those interested in gathering natural resource information that
reflects the needs of local communities. We describe a multidisciplinary survey developed
with indigenous communities in the forest-rich landscapes of the Malinau watershed in East
Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). The final methods reflect a mixture of judgements,
compromises and reactions to trials over many months. We have tried to make the text useful
to readers from diverse backgrounds given the multidisciplinary nature of the procedures
described. Our experiences show that what is obvious to one is novel to another.
This is not intended as a manual. We would rather it was viewed as a summary of lessons
learned. Our reluctance to being overly prescriptive arises from both the ongoing nature of the
work and the specific context in which our methods have been developed. Only some of the
benefits and possible pitfalls of the methods described can be assessed now.
It is difficult to know what to call our methods. The title Exploring biological diversity, environment
and local peoples perspectives in forest landscapes at least describes the aim of our approach
and Methods for a multidisciplinary landscape assessment describes the content. Some
already refer to our approach as participatory biodiversity surveys, certainly shorter and clearer.
However, whether the formal portion of our methods can be considered participatoryis
debatable. Certainly, biodiversity surveys fails to describe the breadth of information gathered:
this includes many aspects not traditionally considered biodiversity. Readers may form their
own opinions.
It is important at the start to distinguish two aspects of these methods: first, the questions we
are addressing and second, the specific methods we have chosen to tackle them. The first can be promoted with little reservation. More caveats are required in presenting our methods.
We have encouraged similar studies elsewhere to develop alternative approaches and we
look forward to a wider suite of tried and tested methods in the future."
458,URBANIZATION AND SPIDER DIVERSITY: INFLUENCES OF HUMAN MODIFICATION OF HABITAT STRUCTURE AND PRODUCTIVITY,Scientific article,Ecological Society of America,"As a part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research project, we determined how land-use alteration influenced spider and harvestman diversity. We sampled spiders in six habitat types (desert parks, urban desert remnants, industrial, agricultural, xeric- and mesic-residential yards) and tested how habitat type and productivity affected spider diversity and abundance. As expected, agricultural fields and mesic yards were more productive than the other, xeric habitats. These more productive habitats were characterized by higher abundances but lower spider diversity and were dominated by Lycosidae (wolf spiders), followed by Linyphiidae (sheet-web weavers). The increase in wolf spider abundance was positively correlated with habitat productivity and negatively correlated with the abundance of other predatory arthropods that might compete with, or prey upon, wolf spiders. Temporal changes in productivity affected spider abundance. After an El-Ni (n) over tildeo winter (May 1998), spider abundance was five times higher than after an extremely dry winter (May 2000). The differences in spider abundance between agricultural fields and the four xeric habitats were profound in 2000 but moderate in 1998, suggesting an interaction between the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on spider populations. Compared with xeric habitats, the El-Ni (n) over tildeo effect was less profound in agricultural sites, suggesting that human land modification mollifies seasonal effects. We suggest that habitat structure and productivity alteration may change community structure, as the urban or agricultural habitats favor one or a few preadapted taxa over many others. Incorporation of large fragments of natural habitats into future landscape planning in urban environments may be important for conservation of rich spider communities."
459,"Influence of land use on plant community composition and diversity in Highland Sourveld grassland in the southern Drakensberg, South Africa",Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Biodiversity conservation of grasslands in the face of transformation and global climate change will depend mainly on rangelands because of insufficient conservation areas in regions suited to agriculture. Transformed vegetation (pastures, crops and plantations) is not expected to conserve much biodiversity. This study examined the impact of land use on the plant diversity and community composition of the southern Drakensberg grasslands in South Africa, which are threatened with complete transformation to pastures, crops and plantations.
2. The main land uses in this high rainfall region are: ranching or dairy production under private tenure using indigenous grassland, pastures (Eragrostis curvula, kikuyu  and ryegrass) and maize; plantation forestry; communal tenure (maize and rangelands); and conservation.
3. Plant diversity and composition were assessed using Whittaker plots. Transformed cover types were depauperate in species and ranged from kikuyu (1·4 species m2) and ryegrass (2·9), to pine plantation (3·1), E. curvula pasture (3·1), commercial maize (3·2) and communal maize (7·8). With the exception of pine plantations, these communities supported mostly exotic (50 of 70 species) or ruderal indigenous species and made little contribution to plant species conservation. Abandoned communal cropland reverted to an indigenous grassland almost devoid of exotic species within c. 20 years.
4. It was predicted that frequently cultivated sites (maize and ryegrass) would support less diversity than long-lived pastures (kikuyu and E. curvula ). This was contradicted by the relatively high species diversity of communal maize fields, which was attributed to a lack of herbicides, and the depauperate communities of kikuyu and of E. curvula pasture, which were attributed, respectively, to a dense growth form and a severe mowing regime. 
5.Pine plantations harboured fourfold more indigenous species per plot (27) than other transformed types. Species were mostly shade-tolerant grassland relics that had persisted for 12 years since planting, and some forest colonizers. Indigenous species
were unlikely to be maintained because of aggressive invasion by the exotic Rubus cuneifolius and severe disturbance associated with tree harvest and replanting.
6. The richness of indigenous grasslands was expected to differ in response to grazing pressure but they differed only in composition. Grasslands were dominated by grasses, despite the richness of herbaceous species. The dominance ofThemeda triandrawasreduced under livestock grazing in favour of more grazing-tolerant species. Exotic specieswere inconspicuous except for the dicotyledonRichardia brasiliensis, a subdominantunder communal grazing.
7.Southern Drakensberg grasslands are probably now stocked with livestock six- to35-fold higher than during pre-settlement times. A grassland protected forc.50 yearssupported twofold greater richness (101 species plot  1) than grazed grasslands, suggesting that a 150-year history of increased mammalian grazing had already reduced plant diversity.
8. Synthesis and applications. Land acquisition is costly, thus conservation of plant diversity in the southern Drakensberg requires a policy that inhibits transformation of rangelands. This can be achieved by enhancing their economic viability without changing the vegetation composition. Their inherent value must be recognized, such as for water production. The viability of commercial ranches can be improved by increasing their size. Conservation efforts need to be focused on plant taxa that only occur on unprotected rangelands."
460,"Unpublished data of diversity and similarity of butterfly communities in five different habitat types at Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam",Authored unpublished data,Unpublished data,"Diversity and similarity of butterfly communities were assessed in five different
habitat types (from natural closed forest to agricultural lands) in the mountains of
Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam for 3 years from 2002 to 2004. The line transect
count was used to record species richness and abundance of butterfly communities
in the different habitat types. For each habitat, the number of species and
individuals, and indices of species richness, evenness and diversity of butterfly
communities were calculated. The results indicated that species richness and
abundance of butterfly communities were low in the natural closed forest, higher
in the disturbed forest, highest in the forest edge, lower in the shrub habitat and
lowest in the agricultural lands. The indices of species richness, evenness and
diversity of butterfly communities were low in agricultural lands and natural
closed forest but highest in the forest edge and shrub habitats. The families
Satyridae and Amathusiidae have the greatest species richness and abundance in
the natural closed forest, with a reduction in their species richness and abundance
from the natural closed forest to the agricultural lands. Species composition of
butterfly communities was different among five different habitat types (40%), was
similar in habitats outside the forest (68%) and was similar in habitats inside the
forest (63%). Diversity and abundance of butterfly communities are not different
between the natural closed forest and the agriculture lands, but species composition
changed greatly between these habitat types. A positive correlation between
the size of species geographical distribution range and increasing habitat disturbance
was found. The most characteristic natural closed forest species have the
smallest geographical distribution range."

of their distribution: widely distributed taxa, Rif taxa, Rif and Middle Atlas taxa, Atlas taxa and taxa with

462,Saproxylic beetle assemblages of three managed oak woodlands in the Eastern Mediterranean,Scientific article,Zoology in the Middle East,"Oak woodlands belong to the natural vegetation in most Mediterranean regions but
have suffered from a long history of woodland devastation and overgrazing. The remaining woodlands
have been managed in different ways, and we expected this to have effects on the fauna associated
with trees. We investigated three different sites in the Eastern Mediterranean with flightinterception
traps to analyse the impact of woodland management on dead wood and tree structures
and the relevance for saproxylic beetle assemblages. Our results show significant differences
in trunk diameter, stem density and dead wood diversity between the three sites. Old oaks in semiopen
woodland are characterised by diverse stages of dead wood and harboured most saproxylic
species (74 species out of a total of 98) and most individuals. With regard to rarefied species richness,
we found that coppice woodland with a high stem density and medium-sized trees has the
most diverse beetle assemblage (19.7 species per 100 individuals). Species richness was in general
strongly associated with the diameter of the oaks, but, surprisingly, was also of the same level
as species numbers reported from studies in Central Europe. The large number of singletons,
which made up 40 % of the entire sample, may indicate a considerable number of species that
were not trapped. We discuss the impact of different management options on tree shape and
woodland structure, issues which are also important for the saproxylic beetle assemblage associated
with Mediterranean oaks. We conclude that oak woodlands in the Middle East  and especially
those woodlands that have been used and managed in a sustainable way  represent a valuable
resource for insect diversity."
463,"Shrew species diversity and abundance in Ziama Biosphere Reserve, Guinea: comparison among primary forest, degraded forest and restoration plots",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The aim of our study was to compare the shrew community diversity and
structure in gradients of tropical forest degradation and restoration. Four plots within each
of six habitats of the Ziama Biosphere Reserve were surveyed, including primary forest,
secondary forest, cultivated fields, recently (less than 3 years) abandoned fields, young
(1012 years) forest restoration plots, and old (34 years) restoration plots. From August to
November 2003, we pitfall-trapped 2,509 shrews representing 11 species. Shrew species
richness and composition was similar in the six habitat surveyed, while shrew species
abundance varied between habitats. Canopy height and cover, density of stems and trees
and understorey density were shown to constitute important parameters influencing the
abundance of several shrew species. After clear-cutting, restoration of key attributes of the
forest vegetation structure was possible in 1034 years, either by natural regeneration or by
planting of seedlings. The relative abundance of most shrew species was similar between
restoring forest (i.e., young restoration plots or fallows) and primary forest. Considering
the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods of forest restoration, one of the
most suitable management practices to restore forest while preserving shrew biodiversity

464,A survey of the epiphytic bryophyte flora in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula,Scientific article,"Cryptogamie, Bryologie","The epiphytic bryoflora growing on trunks of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and
Q. robur L. has been surveyed throughout an extended área in the northwest of the Iberian
Peninsula. Seventy four species are catalogued (14 liverworts and 60 mosses) with an indication
of their distribution in the área. Knowledge of the regional flora is supplemented
with a total of 44 novelties for 7 of the 8 provinces considered. Substrate affinity for several
facultative epiphytes is discussed on the basis of their frequency on bark. The distri
bution of regionally rare species such as Harpalejeunea molleri, Metzgeria fruticulosa,
M. temperata, Orthotrichum consimile, O. scanicum, O. shawii, Ulota coarctata and Zygodon

they are representative of the regional flora to assess the local significance of the different
localities and to select a list of hotspots for conservation."
465,Epiphytic bryophytes in harsh environments: the Juniperus thurifera forests,Scientific article,Journal of Bryology,"The forests of Juniperus thurifera are peculiar ecosystems that typically grow on mountains and highplateaux
of the western Mediterranean basin with dry and continental climates. Some previous
surveys suggested that these forests house a rather distinctive epiphytic bryophyte flora. Epiphytic
bryophyte communities were systematically sampled in 19 representative juniper forests, for the first time
spanning all the distribution area of this conifer. The flora consists of 44 species (32 acrocarpous mosses,
10 pleurocarpous mosses and 2 liverworts). Orthotrichum species are the most frequent and abundant in
most of the sampled localities, including some uncommon taxa such as Orthotrichum vittii which shows
a clear association with J. thurifera. Epiphytic bryophyte communities on this species were highly
homogeneous, although they can be arranged into different groups in response to environmental conditions.
Typically, the epiphytic communities of the Mediterranean juniper forests comprise a distinct combination of
xerophytic taxa that enhances the interest of these ecosystems and provides new fields for their research and
conservation."
466,Forest stand structure and composition in 96 sites along environmental gradients in the central Western Ghats of India,Scientific article,Ecology,"This data set reports woody plant species abundances in a network of 96 sampling sites spread across 22000 km2 in central Western Ghats region, Karnataka, India (74°15'  75°40' E; 15°15'  13°30' N). Due to its varied climate and diverse topography, the study area, which is part of the Western GhatsSri Lanka biodiversity hotspot, supports a wide array of non-equatorial tropical habitats including wet evergreen, moist and dry deciduous intact as well as degraded forests and scrublands. These formations, floristically moderately rich and diversified, are characterized by a lower rate of endemism than in the southern part of the Western Ghats. This data paper provides abundance and girth data for 76813 trees and lianas of 446 species collected in 96 sampling sites during 19961997. A total of 61965 individuals >10 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were recorded in 96 1-ha macroplots, while 14848 individuals <10 cm gbh but >1 m height were sampled in three 0.1-ha microplots located within each macroplot. Additional data regarding the stand structure (average canopy height, percent canopy cover, number of strata) and the level of degradation are available for the macroplots, along with environmental data derived from other sources and analyses, such as soil types, rainfall, length of the dry season, and altitude. These data have been used to produce ecological research papers as well as to elaborate conservation value maps and recommendations toward sustainable management of the forests of the central Western Ghats region."
467,Invertebrate community richness in New Zealand kiwifruit orchards under organic or integrated pest management,Scientific article,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","To compare the effects of two different forms of sustainable agriculture on native taxa, this study assessed
invertebrate communities in ten matched pairs of kiwifruit orchards managed under either organic or
integrated pest management (IPM) systems in New Zealand. Three types of trap were used to collect
as many different invertebrate taxa as possible in three trapping periods spread over the 2007/08 fruit
growing season. A total of 602 taxa were identified in the samples. Significantly more taxa were collected
from the organic orchards than the IPM orchards in all three periods. The invertebrate assemblages
collected from the two orchard types were also significantly different in both January and March 2008.
There was no significant difference in the proportions of native and endemic species collected from the
two orchard types, although up to 40% of the identified species differed between the two management
systems. Higher numbers of predators, parasitoids, herbivores, fungivores and omnivores in the organic
orchards compared with those under IPM may indicate the presence of more resilient ecosystem services
in these orchards."
468,Ecological impacts of desert plantation forests on biodiversity,Scientific article,African Journal of Ecology,"This investigation involves the comparison of the diversity
of understorey vegetation of four desert planted forests
with the adjacent desert areas. Spatial and temporal
variations in species composition and structure were
compared, and alpha and beta diversities were compared
for the field data collected from sampled sites. The diversity
of native desert species decreased from 66% in desert
areas to 44% of the total recorded plants inside the
forests. Meanwhile, the percentage of agricultural weed
species increased in forests to >twofold more than that
recorded in desert areas. Plant communities in forest
stands shared <50% of their species with adjacent vegetation
in desert stands. The percentage of variation in
species composition was >340% in some forests
compared with the desert areas. Alpha diversity and
b-diversity were significantly higher in forest stands than
in the desert. Spatial and temporal variations in species
diversity were correlated with type of tree canopy and
irrigation system. Planted forests had significant negative
effects on the diversity of native desert shrubs and trees.
Using flood irrigation and more spacing between trees
might help in conserving the floristic diversity of desert
shrubs and trees at the forest floor."
469,Collapse of an arctic bird community resulting from ungulate-induced loss of erect shrubs,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Rapid, but contrasting, changes in the extent of erect thicket-forming shrubs is presently seen in the Arctic,
either resulting from a warmer climate (increasing extent) or intensified herbivory (decreasing
extent). We investigated the impact of loss of willow shrubs on a bird community in arctic riparian sediment
plains in northern Norway subject to varying intensities of reindeer browsing. In riparian habitats
where willow thickets had been lost, bird species richness was more than halved compared to habitats
where some patches of thickets were still present. As could be expected species previously suggested
to use erect woody vegetation as nesting places and/or foraging habitats were most consistently
impacted. However, even some open ground habitat specialists appeared to be negatively impacted, possibly
due to loss of spatial spill-over effects of insects from willow thickets. To preserve low-arctic avian
biodiversity in a warming climate, management should strive to identify levels of ungulate browsing that
strike the balance between shrub-encroached and shrub-denuded arctic tundra."
470,Rainwater harvesting and arthropod biodiversity within an arid agro-ecosystem,Scientific report (published),"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","The Bedouin of South Sinai, Egypt, use a technique known as runoff agroforestry to capture rainwater
and increase the agricultural potential of the arid landscape. Utilising water that would otherwise be
lost from the vicinity allows the creation of multi-strata orchards with higher plant densities than the
surrounding environment. We used pitfall traps to compare ground arthropod communities within 15
agricultural gardens to those in the external habitat. Total arthropod abundance and species richness
were significantly higher inside the gardens, with no loss of alpha-diversity. Species level analysis of ants
revealed that six out of seven recorded species were more abundance inside the gardens. There were
significant differences in the responses of Coleopteran functional groups, with scavengers occurring in
higher numbers inside, predators higher outside, and herbivores showing no difference. There was a high
presence of the ant Monomorium venustum and the scavenger beetle Lagria sp. inside the gardens, but
no negative impacts on species accumulation rates or alpha-diversity. In conclusion, runoff agroforestry
seems to enhance local arthropod abundance, without a strong negative affect on biodiversity."
471,Multidisciplinary Landscape Assessment - Cameroon,Internet database,www.cifor.org/mla,"Understanding local forest needs in Cameroon

In the village of Nkolbibanda, 50 kilometers south of the Cameroon capital of Yaoundé, CIFOR research is providing a better understanding of the environmental needs and priorities of the communities living next to the Ottotomo Forest Reserve.
Covering an area of 2,950 hectares, the Reserve was gazetted by the French colonial government in 1930 and remains off-limits to human activities other than the occasional collecting of non-timber forest products.

The inhabitants of Nkolbibanda belong to the Ewondo ethnic group and are largely dependent upon agriculture for food and income. Their primary sources of food include shifting cultivation, some plantation crops such as cocoa and increasingly palm oil, traditional forest products and bush meats such as palm rats, porcupines and antelope.

At the time the reserve was gazetted, traditional territories were not taken into account, including those traditionally accessed by the people of Nkolbibanda. But in the past 15-20 years, the population in the area has grown considerably, putting considerable pressure on local natural resources and resulting in increasing levels of conflict between communities and the reserve management.

CIFOR has been playing a leading role in improving relations between local communities, local NGO's and forest administrators. The current Multidisciplinary Landscape Assessment (MLA) project, led by CIFOR researcher Marieke Sassen, aims to enhance this process.

""We hope the outcomes of this project will serve as a basis for improved dialogue between all stakeholders, and lead to better decisions about the management of the reserve and the surrounding area,"" Sassen said.

Using an approach developed in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, Sassen and her team of researchers undertook a survey in 2003 involving both conventional biodiversity surveys and an assessment of local people's needs and perceptions.

The MLA approach aims at enhancing the understanding between development practitioners, local policy makers and forest communities. It will also help improve policy decisions that affect the local population and enhance the long term sustainability of the forest and it's inhabitants.

Marieke and her team have used a variety of research methods to explore the importance people attach to their tropical rainforest landscape. Conducted with men and women, both young and old, these methods include different forms of meetings. For example, 'Community Meetings' help compile historical data such as land use and village history, while 'Exercise Meetings' provide a ""valuation"" of landscape elements and animal species and their uses. Other techniques include participatory Mapping Meetings and Field Surveys and require building high levels of collaboration and trust with participants.

Not surprisingly, the initial analysis of survey results has shown that the forest is the second most important landscape unit behind the village. This raises one of the most challenging aspects of CIFOR's research: how to help villagers find the right balance between improving their food production and their need to sustain forests as an important source of land and of products that can be harvested?

People are aware of forest functions. They know, for example, that trees ""protect"" the forest, how seed dispersal is necessary for tree regeneration and how certain animals play an important role in this. They also know which activities damage the forest; including many they practice themselves, like cutting down trees and burning. However, when it comes to their own activities, they feel they do not have a choice if they want to practice agriculture and sustain themselves. As one elder men said, ""That is just the way we are, we eat (something) until it is finished and then we just find something else"". Sassen says this demonstrates now people have their own ways of adapting to changing conditions.

They also blame outsiders for damage to the forest by cutting down trees illegally in the reserve and on their land, or by poaching game or using poison to catch fish. Marieke said many respondents spoke of this ""outsider"" issue, arguing that while they should not have to change their own traditional activities, certain activities by outsiders should be prohibited.

Driving the increasing level of unsustainable practices has been the dramatic rise in recent years of the price of goods associated with the cash economy. Basic essentials such as soap, petroleum, matches and children's schooling place an increasing burden on the villagers to find cash.

One of the major challenges is to develop sustainable practices within the forestry reserve. Paramount to this is ensuring constructive dialogue at all levels between stakeholders. CIFOR is assisting this by aligning the current and future needs of forest mangers and villagers, as well as assisting policy makers to work closely with stakeholders.

""We give as much information as possible to the community and provide explanations about how involvement in the research will benefit them in the long term. It is important to overcome any levels of mistrust. Sure, it's too early to give a definite thumbs up to the MLA project. But I think I can safely say CIFOR's work is improving relations between NGO's, forest managers and local villagers. I hope that by building on this and past CIFOR activities, we can influence future decisions about the management of the reserve."" MH

472,Multidisciplinary Landscape Assessment - Philippines,Internet database,www.cifor.org/mla,"Palawan, Philippines
On Palawan island in the Philippines, an MLA approach was used in the context of the EU funded project 'Leveling the Playing Field. This project aims to help stakeholders in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines achieve natural resources management. Stakeholders have different interests, goals and views on how natural resources should be managed- especially the views of traditional communities may be harder to solicit.

The MLA approach was used to assess how a Batak community from Palawan uses and perceives its natural resources. As well as revealing their perceptions about the environment, MLA provided biodiversity information on the different types of landscapes and the condition of the forests. Information was also gathered on how the Batak think about the future of these landscapes and what role they would like to play in the management of the natural resources in their territory. Local communities views should be considered in the preparation of a management plan from the very beginning."
473,Traditional agricultural gardens conserve wild plants and functional richness in arid South Sinai,Scientific article,Basic and Applied Ecology,"Maintaining agricultural diversity is important for the conservation of rare species and for preserving underlying ecosystem processes on which smallholder farmers rely. The positive effects of crop diversity are well documented in tropical systems, but the conservation potential of arid agricultural systems is less clear. This study assesses the impact of three arid agroforestry systems on plant diversity and functional richness in South Sinai, Egypt: (1) mountain orchard gardens, (2) modern town gardens and (3) low desert date-palm gardens. We surveyed plants (cultivated and wild) within gardens and control plots of natural habitat and allocated each plant eight biological traits that are recognised as being linked with major ecosystem processes. Species diversity was quantified using three measures (Hill's numbers) and total species diversity was significantly higher within gardens than in the surrounding habitat at all three levels of diversity and across the three agroforestry systems. Species similarity was high between gardens and the surrounding habitat, and there was a strong overlap in the functional traits of wild plants and cultivated non-tree species. Despite the clear presence of trees within the gardens, the community weighted trait means (CWMs) showed that chamaephyte perennials were the dominant life-forms in both the gardens and the natural habitat. Functional richness differed between the three agroforestry systems, but was significantly higher within the gardens. Functional richness has been linked to increased productivity and CWMs showed that plants within the gardens were considerably taller than outside, suggesting higher biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that Bedouin agricultural practices are not having a negative effect on the flora of the region and that the continuation of these indigenous farming practices can actively benefit rare wild plants in the region. On a wider scale, this study supports the view that smallholder farms and homegardens can be valuable tools in conservation, preserving local species and maintaining ecosystem functioning."
474,DIVERSITY PATTERNS IN THE STEPPE OF ARGENTINEAN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA:  ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS AND IMPACT OF GRAZING,Scientific book,Steppe Ecosystems,"The steppe ecosystem, mainly characterised by the presence of tussock, short grasses
and shrubs, covers 85% of the total area in Santa Cruz Province and 25% in Tierra del
Fuego Island. Most of the land in the Patagonian region has been influenced by domestic
livestock grazing for more than 100 years. This has led to a substantial modification of
the ecosystem and the original floristic patterns. Erosion and degradation processes have
occurred in several areas of Patagonia mainly due to an overestimation of the carrying
capacity of these rangelands.
In this chapter we review patterns of plant and insect diversity in relation to
environmental drivers and grazing impact in the steppe of Argentinian South Patagonia.
In Santa Cruz, results from 141 sites indicated significant interactions between grazing
and the abiotic environment (mainly water avalilability) on plant diversity. Thecomplexity of these interactions indicated the need for examining patterns of species
turnover at different spatial scales.
Analysis of the steppe vegetation patterns from 113 sites along Tierra del Fuego
Island demostrated differences related to geographical zones (North, Center, East and
South), dominant vegetation types (grasslands, peatlands or shrublands) and disturbance
impact (grazing, beavers or burned areas). Because insect diversity of Tierra del Fuego
steppes is poorly known, coleopterans were selected as potential indicators of
biodiversity using pitfalls traps in the same vegetation survey sites. We found significant
changes in ground-active beetle assemblages generated by grazing and livestock
activities, both in grassland, peatlands and shrublands. Therefore, this group of insects
could be useful indicators of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management."
475,Complementarity of indigenous flora in shrublands and grasslands in a New Zealand dryland landscape,Scientific article,New Zealand Journal of Ecology,"Succession from fire-induced grassland to secondary shrubland vegetation is occurring in parts of
deforested dry eastern South Island, New Zealand, but little is known about how the change from herbaceous
to woody vegetation alters the indigenous biota. We predicted that development of secondary shrublands would
exclude few grassland-specialist plant species and increase indigenous plant species occupancy (the extent
to which indigenous species capable of living in dryland landscapes are present) at a landscape scale. We also
predicted that taller and denser indigenous plant canopies would facilitate indigenous but not exotic plant
species at multiple scales, for example by reducing exotic grass competition or through positive plantplant
interactions. We tested our predictions by sampling vegetation in 100-ha blocks representing a gradient from
grassland to mixed intermediate grassland and shrubland to shrubland vegetation at three sites in Central
Otago. We found indigenous plant species in shrubland were complementary to those in grassland (additional
to the existing set) within and across our study sites, which led to higher indigenous species occupancy in
this dryland landscape. Grassland vegetation did not support significant numbers of indigenous plant species
complementary to those in shrubland, and we found no evidence that secondary succession displaced indigenous
plant species. Shrubland had higher diversity of indigenous plant species than grassland at multiple scales (across
sites, within 100-ha blocks and within 144-m2 plots), and had higher indigenous dominance of composition
across sites, but not at smaller (within-block and within-plot) scales. Indigenous dominance of composition
within blocks and plots was related to dominance of the physical structure of plant communities by indigenous
woody plants or tussock grasses, rather than to development of secondary shrubland alone. Reduced densities
of indigenous plant species were related to higher frequencies of exotic grass only where indigenous structural
dominance was low, indicating that competitive exclusion of indigenous plants by exotic grasses may depend
on degradation of indigenous structural dominance. We conclude that secondary succession from structurallydepleted
grassland to mixed indigenousexotic shrubland is likely to assist the conservation of indigenous plant
species in this dryland landscape."
476,Traditional forest management: Do carabid beetles respond to human-created vegetation structures in an oak mosaic landscape?,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"We studied the effects of traditional forest management practices (i.e. forest exploitation activities such as burning, cutting and livestock grazing) on carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages in Pyrenean oak forests of NW Spain. A total of 11 370 carabid individuals representing 61 species were collected by pitfall trapping from May to October 2004 in four types of traditionally managed oak ecosystems: ""dehesa"", ""mature open"", ""mature closed"" and ""young"". These four management types experienced a variety of anthropogenic activities, resulting in differences in the structure and composition of the tree and understorey vegetation layers. We showed that the four management types were quite similar at the carabid assemblage level, mainly supporting open habitat and generalist species. The ""dehesa"" system was most distinct with a higher species richness (not significantly) and with several unique species, probably travelling from the adjacent grassland. However, many species responded significantly to the type of management, depending on the habitat associations of the species. We also found strong responses of some of the species to one type of management, either positive (exclusively collected from one management type) or negatively (completely absent). Shrub cover and soil organic matter content were the main environmental variables determining the carabid assemblage structure. At the regional scale, the four management types accounted for a high carabid beetle diversity. This diversity appears to be threatened by landscape homogenization, since traditional management practices are disappearing due to recent land-use changes in the area."
477,"Diversity of soil mites (Acari: Oribatida, Mesostigmata) along a gradient of land use types in New York",Scientific article,Applied Soil Ecology,"This study explored the relationship between landscape-level factors (land use type) and the diversity of soil mites (Acari:
Oribatida, Mesostigmata) at a within-site scale, using diversity measures including point diversity (local species diversity within a single sampling point), patterns of species turnover among the sampling points, and alpha diversity (total species richness in a habitat). The land use types included corn fields, intensive short-rotation forestry plantations, two types of abandoned agricultural fields, and hardwood forests. Land use type was identified as a significant factor influencing both small-scale (within individual soil cores) and site-scale
diversity of Oribatida, which increased in the order corn!willow!abandoned fields!forests. There was no statistical relationship between land use type and abundance or diversity of Mesostigmata.
Using a bootstrapping method to generate random communities, we found that all land use types had significantly more
diverse patterns of species abundance than was expected by chance. On the other hand, the patterns of presence/absence of species were less diverse than expected by chance. Local site factors were significant in driving the patterns of diversity of soil mites at the site scale; land use type was less important. The overall structure of Oribatida and Mesostigmata assemblages was significantly related to land use type. We conclude that soil communities respond to land management on both local scales and habitat-wide scales."
478,Habitat and Grazing Influence on Terrestrial Ants in Subtropical Grasslands and Savannas of Argentina,Scientific article,Annals of the Entomological Society of America,"The maintenance of species diversity in modified and natural habitats is\na central focus of conservation biology. The Ibera Nature Reserve (INR)\nprotects highly diverse ecosystems in northeastern Argentina, including\none of the largest freshwater wetlands in South America. Livestock\ngrazing is one of the major disturbances to these ecosystems; however,\nits effect on ant diversity is poorly known. The objective of this work\nwas to study the effect of savanna versus grassland and grazing on the\nstructure and composition of subtropical terrestrial ants focusing on\nthe particular response of the native red imported fire ant, Solenopsis\ninvicta Buren. Unbaited pitfall traps were used to capture worker ants\nin 25 grazed and 20 nongrazed sites. Fifty ant species were collected.\nThe savanna showed more species, individuals, biomass, and functional\ngroups of ants than the grassland. S. invicta was the most frequently\ncaptured (61.4%) and numerically dominant species; however Camponotus\npunctulatus punctulatus Mayr showed the highest biomass. Grazing\nsimplified vegetation structure in both habitats, but its impact on\nvegetation seemed only to promote a higher total biomass especially in\nthe grassland, and/or functional groups, favoring occurrence of\nhot-climate specialists in the savanna. This study revealed that habitat\ntype strongly affected the organization of the terrestrial ant\nassemblages at the INR. However, as in other studies, we did not find\nclear evidence that habitat modification by grazing significantly\naffected terrestrial ant assemblages. The weak grazing influence could\nbe the consequence of the short enclosure time as to recover the\noriginal ant communities, the differential response of ant species to\nhabitat type, and/or the resilience of ants."
479,The impact of forest management on litter-dwelling invertebrates: a subtropical-temperate contrast,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Land use intensification in forests is a main driver of global biodiversity loss. Although historical state of land use differs between subtropical and temperate zones, gradients of land-use intensities similarly range from unmanaged to very intensively managed forests. Irrespective of similar land use forces in both climate zones, comparative studies on land use effects are still rare. Such studies are, however, promising in discov- ering more general impacts and geographical specifics of land use intensification. We studied litter-dwelling invertebrates along a gradient of increasing land use intensity in subtropical forests in Southern Brazil and temperate forests in Central Europe using similar sampling designs. Effects of land use intensity on the entire community were analyzed on the level of orders and feeding guilds. In both climate zones a similar number of indi- viduals were caught when standardizes to 100 pitfall trap days, but taxa richness was higher in the subtropics. Moreover, community composition differed between both climate zones. In both regions, land use intensity did not affect taxa richness, but invertebrate abundance was affected in opposite ways; while increasing land use intensity resulted in a decrease of invertebrate abundance in the subtropics, an increase was observed in the temperate zone and this was mostly consistent regarding different feeding guilds. Man- agement practices should take into account that the effect of land use intensity on biodi- versity can differ drastically among climatic regions."
480,A Belowground Perspective on Dutch Agroecosystems: How Soil Organisms Interact to Support Ecosystem Services,Scientific article,Advance in Ecological Research,"1. New patterns and trends in land use are becoming increasingly evident in Europe’s heavily modified landscape and else whereas sustainable agricul- ture and nature restoration are developed as viable long-term alternatives to intensively farmed arable land. The success of these changes depends on how soil biodiversity and processes respond to changes in management. To improve our understanding of the community structure and ecosystem functioning of the soil biota, we analyzed abiotic variables across 200 sites, and biological variables across 170 sites in The Netherlands, one of the most intensively farmed countries. The data were derived from the Dutch Soil Quality Network (DSQN), a long-term monitoring framework designed to obtain ecological insight into soil types (STs) and ecosystem types (ETs).
2. At the outset we describe STs and biota, and we estimate the contribution of various groups to the provision of ecosystem services. We focused on interactive effects of soil properties on community patterns and ecosystem functioning using food web models. Ecologists analyze soil food webs by means of mechanistic and statistical modelling, linking network structure to energy flow and elemental dynamics commonly based on allometric scaling.
3. We also explored how predatory and metabolic processes are constrained by body size, diet and metabolic type, and how these constraints govern the interactions within and between trophic groups. In particular, we focused on how elemental fluxes determine the strengths of ecological interactions, and the resulting ecosystem services, in terms of sustenance of soil fertility.
4. We discuss data mining, food web visualizations, and an appropriate categorical way to capture subtle interrelationships within the DSQN dataset. Sampled metazoans were used to provide an overview of below- ground processes and influences of land use. Unlike most studies to date we used data from the entire size spectrum, across 15 orders of magnitude, using body size as a continuous trait crucial for understanding ecological services.
5. Multimodality in the frequency distributions of body size represents a performance filter that acts as a buffer to environmental change. Large differences in the body-size distributions across ETs and STs were evi- dent. Most observed trends support the hypothesis that the direct influ- ence of ecological stoichiometry on the soil biota as an independent predictor (e.g. in the form of nutrient to carbon ratios), and consequently on the allometric scaling, is more dominant than either ET or ST. This provides opportunities to develop a mechanistic and physiologically ori- ented model for the distribution of species’ body sizes, where responses of invertebrates can be predicted.
6. Our results highlight the different roles that organisms play in a number of key ecosystem services. Such a trait-based research has unique strengths in its rigorous formulation of fundamental scaling rules, as well as in its verifiabili- ty by empirical data. Nonetheless, it still has weaknesses that remain to be addressed, like the consequences of intraspecific size variation, the high degree of omnivory, and a possibly inaccurate assignment to trophic groups.
7. Studying the extent to which nutrient levels influence multitrophic inter- actions and how different land-use regimes affect soil biodiversity is clearly a fruitful area for future research to develop predictive models for soil ecosystem services under different management regimes. No simi- lar efforts have been attempted previously for soil food webs, and our dataset has the potential to test and further verify its usefulness at an unprecedented space scale."
481,Ignoring ecological demands masks the real effect of urbanization: a case study of ground-dwelling spiders along a rural-urban gradient in a lowland forest in Hungary,Scientific article,Ecological Research,"We studied ground-dwelling spiders along a rural-suburban-urban forest gradient representing increasing human disturbance using pitfall traps. We tested four known and two novel hypotheses: (1) increasing disturbance hypothesis (species richness is decreasing by disturbance); (2) matrix species hypothesis (the richness of open-habitat species is increasing by disturbance); (3) opportunistic species hypothesis (the richness of generalist species is increasing by disturbance); and (4) habitat specialist hypothesis (the number of the forest specialist species is decreasing by disturbance). As a consequence of urbanization, urban forests become drier and more open; thus, according to the new hypotheses, the number of (5) xerophilous species and (6) light-preferring species are increasing in the urban area. Our result did not support the increasing disturbance hypothesis, as the overall species richness increased from the rural sites to the urban ones. As predicted, the number of both the open-habitat and the generalist species increased towards the urban sites. The number of forest specialist species was higher in the suburban area than in the rural and urban area. Both xerophilous and light-preferring species were the most numerous in the urban area, supporting the xerophilous species and the light-preferring species hypotheses. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the forest specialist species associated with the rural sites with higher amounts of decaying woods and more herbs or with the suburban sites with higher cover of leaf litter and higher relative humidity. Two generalist species and one open-habitat species were characteristic of urban sites with higher ground surface and air temperature."
482,Soil microarthropod communities from Mediterranean forest ecosystems in Central Italy under different disturbances,Scientific article,Environmental Monitoring & Assessment,"Urban areas are radically growing worldwide, causing changes in biodiversity and natural habitats. We studied the effects of urbanisation on millipede (Diplopoda) assemblages along a forested rural-suburban-urban gradient in Hungary. We tested four hypotheses: (1) intermediate disturbance hypothesis, suggesting that millipedes are the most diverse in the suburban area; (2) habitat specialist hypothesis, assuming that the number of forest specialist species decline along the rural-suburban-urban gradient; (3) synanthropic species hypothesis, suggesting that the number of synanthropic species increase along the rural-suburban-urban gradient; and (4) mean body size hypothesis, assuming that average millipede size is decreasing from the rural area towards the urban one. We studied the effects of relevant environmental factors on the abundance of millipedes. The number of millipede individuals, species richness and diversity were significantly higher in the suburban area than in the rural and urban ones, supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The ratio of forest specialist millipede individuals and species decreased significantly along the rural-urban gradient, while the ratio of synanthropic millipede individuals and species increased significantly along the gradient. The average body size of millipedes was significantly lower in the urban area compared to the rural and suburban ones. Multivariate methods revealed changes in species composition along the rural-urban gradient. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that temperature, amount of decaying wood, concentration of zinc and calcium and pH explained significant proportion of the variation in millipedes' abundance. Our results confirmed that the environmental factors and the composition of the millipede assemblages changed remarkably along the rural-suburban-urban gradient."
483,Contribution of Alpha and Beta Diversity Across Land-Use Type to the Regional Diversity of Dung Beetles in Central Sulawesi,Scientific article,HAYATI Journal of Biosciences,"The importance of spatial scale has been acknowledged as one of determining factors of species diversity in local and regional diversity. The aim of this study was to evaluate contribution of alpha and beta diversity across land-use type to gamma diversity at the margins of tropical forest in Central Sulawesi using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) as a focal group. Baited pitfall traps set in four land-use types ranging from natural forest through cacao agroforestry systems to open areas during two years of sampling (2009 and 2012). A total of 28 dung beetle species belonging to four genera were captured during the study period. The results showed that contribution of beta diversity was higher than that of alpha diversity of dung beetles. Each land-use type contributed about 56.5 to 62.5% of the total species richness (gamma diversity). The similar pattern of biodiversity between each spatial scale and during the two sampling years emphasized the large contribution of each land-use type to maintaining a high portion of the regional species richness. It suggests the importance of managing other land-use types, such as secondary forest and agroforestry as well as protecting the remaining natural forests."

Argentina pampean plains have not been an exception because of this global tendency with an agricultural border continuous advance from the east to the semiarid west. This generates a loss of biological diversity that affects a great number of organisms among which we find the ants, which play a very important role in the communities structure doing a balance between living creatures and their habitat. The aim of this work is compare the myrmecofauna associated with productive agroecosystems in the central region of Argentina, through the evaluation richness of these insects and diversity. The hypothesis of this study is to test the diversity of Formicidae in fields where little anthropogenic is greater than in agroecosystems of central Argentina. Three farms were chosen as study sites, each of them divided into two sampling sites that correspond to cultivated or natural areas. A total of 5.647 ants were collected among which three dominant species were found in all the sites: Dorymyrmex breviscapis, Solenopsis saevissima and Pheidole bergi. Significant differences were observed between the agroecosystems myrmecofauna and the natural environments."
485,Woodland remnants as an urban wildlife refuge: a cross-taxonomic assessment,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Urban nature is crucial for the quality of human life both within cities and beyond. In many developed cities, the numbers of restoration-through-revegetation projects have rapidly increased over the decades. However, the extent to which revegetated habitats perform compensatory roles for remnant habitats is poorly understood. We compared butterfly and ground beetle assemblages among three park types (five remnant parks, four newly established parks and five old established parks) and seven built-up sites in Tokyo, central Japan. Butterflies were classified into woodland or open-land and into patch-dependent or matrix-dwelling species. For both taxa, remnant parks and built-up sites had the highest and lowest species richness and abundance, respectively. Although the richness and abundance of open-land and matrix-dwelling butterflies did not differ among the three park types, those of woodland and patch-dependent species were significantly highest in remnant parks. In short, after 50 years, established parks did not attain the same insect assemblages as those in remnant parks. These results illustrate that whist revegetation is an effective and fast-acting conservation measure for generalist species (i.e., widely distributed species), this value is limited for specialists. In highly urbanised landscapes, therefore, even small remnant woodlands provide important refuges for urban wildlife. Remnant protection programs at the early stage of city development would decide the fate of urban biodiversity."
486,Millipede (Diplopoda) assemblages alter drastically by urbanisation,Scientific article,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Urban areas are radically growing worldwide, causing changes in biodiversity and natural habitats. We studied the effects of urbanisation on millipede (Diplopoda) assemblages along a forested rural-suburban-urban gradient in Hungary. We tested four hypotheses: (1) intermediate disturbance hypothesis, suggesting that millipedes are the most diverse in the suburban area; (2) habitat specialist hypothesis, assuming that the number of forest specialist species decline along the rural-suburban-urban gradient; (3) synanthropic species hypothesis, suggesting that the number of synanthropic species increase along the rural-suburban-urban gradient; and (4) mean body size hypothesis, assuming that average millipede size is decreasing from the rural area towards the urban one. We studied the effects of relevant environmental factors on the abundance of millipedes. The number of millipede individuals, species richness and diversity were significantly higher in the suburban area than in the rural and urban ones, supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The ratio of forest specialist millipede individuals and species decreased significantly along the rural-urban gradient, while the ratio of synanthropic millipede individuals and species increased significantly along the gradient. The average body size of millipedes was significantly lower in the urban area compared to the rural and suburban ones. Multivariate methods revealed changes in species composition along the rural-urban gradient. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that temperature, amount of decaying wood, concentration of zinc and calcium and pH explained significant proportion of the variation in millipedes' abundance. Our results confirmed that the environmental factors and the composition of the millipede assemblages changed remarkably along the rural-suburban-urban gradient."
487,"Asymmetrical responses of forest and ""beyond edge"" arthropod communities across a forest-grassland ecotone",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Historically, where forest habitats are deemed as the pristine landscape state, anthropogenic habitats such as managed grasslands or open spaces are often perceived to be antagonistic and of secondary conservation priority. Traditionally, studies on biodiversity responses to ecological variation, i.e. edge effect, have mostly focused on forest habitats. Yet recently there has been increased attention on communities beyond the forest edge in an effort to better understand how interactions between forests and adjacent habitats may potentially affect regional biodiversity. However, in Europe and the Mediterranean basin (a biodiversity hotspot), areas with high landscape heterogeneity and high edge density, there is a paucity of studies analysing the community responses across forest and ""beyond edge"" habitats across ecotones. In a protected area of central Italy, we investigated the responses of ground-dwelling arthropods [Araneae (spiders), Chilopoda (centipedes) and Carabidae (ground beetles)], which were differentiated into habitat-specific guilds (forest, edge and grassland species) across a forest-grassland ecotone. We investigated the extent to which a habitat edge influenced communities of arthropods associated with either the forest or grassland, and how far from the edge this effect penetrated into each habitat. Twelve 150 m-transects perpendicular to a forest-grassland edge were established and arthropods were sampled at nine progressive distances across the ecotone. An indicator species analysis was used to detect species significantly associated with forest, edge-belt or grassland habitats, which were assumed representative of the respective communities. Logistic models of indicator species richness and abundances were used to describe responses of grassland and forest communities across the ecological boundaries. We found that grassland and edge habitats had habitat specialists and higher species richness compared to the forest habitat. Moreover, the occurrence of grassland-specific species was influenced by the presence of an edge up to 15 m from the habitat border. In contrast forest-associated indicator species were not affected by proximity to the habitat edge, rather individuals typical of forest habitats tended to ""spill over"" into grassland habitats. These findings support the hypothesis that in a forest-grassland mosaic, forest species are less sensitive to an edge and influence the community beyond the forest edge and into the grassland more than the reverse, i.e. the effect was asymmetric. From these data, we estimated that a minimum grassland habitat width of 600 m is necessary for grassland species to maintain a core area that is relatively unaffected by the spillover of species from adjacent forest habitats. Incorporating the directional influences of adjacent communities on each other allows for an empirical assessment of habitat vulnerability that doesn't a priori value the conservation of one habitat over another."
488,Soil Macrofaunal Communities are Heterogeneous in Heathlands with Different Grazing Intensity,Scientific article,Pedosphere,"Moderate grazing by cattle increases the heterogeneity of soil and vegetation. This has been suggested as an ecologically sustainable mean of managing natural environments endangered by tree encroachment, such as heathlands. Our study was performed to test the impact of grazing intensity on soil macroinvertebrate communities in heterogeneous landscapes in a private property eligible to the Natura 2000 European Network of Special Protection Areas within the Brenne Natural Regional Park (Indre, France). We sampled macroinvertebrates along a broken line crossing 5 different land-use types, from pasture to pine forest, passing through a besom heath (Erica scoparia) heathland at 3 levels of cattle pressure. We hypothesized that: i) litter-dwelling (mostly arthropods and mollusks) and soil-dwelling macroinvertebrates (mostly earthworms) would respond in an opposite manner to various grazing intensities, and ii) intermediate cattle pressure (pastured heath) would increase soil and community heterogeneity. The results supported the first hypothesis, which was explained by land-use impacts mediated by soil properties. However, our results supported only partly the second hypothesis since maximum dissimilarity (whether in the composition of soil macroinvertebrate communities or in soil features) was observed in only one out of the two pastured heaths where cattle pressure was intermediate."
489,The Effects of Management Systems on Ground-Foraging Ant Diversity in Costa Rica,Scientific article,Ecological Applications,"The impacts of four different management systems on diversity of ground-foraging ants were examined to assess potential for conservation of biological diversity in human-influenced agricultural or agroforestry systems. Using a variety of indices, diversity was measured along a gradient of anthropogenically disturbed habitats. The gradient, in terms of increasing levels of disturbance, ranged from primary rain forest, abandoned cacao plantations, productive cacao plantations, to banana plantations. The primary forest and abandoned cacao plantations were situated in a reserve and the productive cacao plantations, and banana plantations were located on privately owned land within 35 km of the reserve in the Sarapiqui Valley of Costa Rica. To sample ground-foraging ants, we placed tuna baits along the ground in each habitat. Although tuna baits attract a generalist assemblage of ants that may be better able to adapt to more disturbed sites, diversity of this community was significantly reduced with increased disturbance. Ant diversity was not different for forest and abandoned cacao sites except in terms of evenness, with the forest having a more even distribution of species. Forest and abandoned cacao sites were significantly more diverse than both productive cacao and banana plantations. The latter two did not differ significantly from each other in terms of diversity, but there was considerable variability within each of these habitat types. The results of this study suggest that conservation of diversity may be possible in a ''mosaic'' of different land uses, but further studies, such as those addressing the importance of scale and nearby source populations, are necessary before management practices can be implemented."
490,"Bird communities in logged and unlogged compartments in Budongo Forest, Uganda",Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"We made 2200 point counts of birds in five compartments of the Budongo Forest Reserve in western Uganda. Two
compartments had not been logged and the others had been selectively logged in 194752, 1965, and 198286. We recorded
104 forest bird species out of a total count for the forest of 197. Species overlap of the bird communities was about 78%
between the compartments, with a lower overlap between the two unlogged compartments than between several logged and
unlogged combinations. Of the 22 species for which densities could be calculated 8 showed significant differences between
logged and unlogged forest. Not all species at low density in logged forest were forest specialists. Higher numbers of
frugivores, bark-gleaning insectivores, nectarivores and omnivores and fewer sallying insectivores and leaf-gleaning
insectivores were found in logged forest. Supporting evidence that these differences could be attributed to logging was
obtained from correlations of bird abundances with measures of forest structure or composition. Changes in forest structure
are probably particularly important for sallying insectivores; these species will be one of the groups most at risk from
logging and consequently will be useful indicators of logging impacts."
491,"Comparing biodiversity between protected areas and adjacent rangeland in xeric succulent thicket, South Africa: arthropods and reptiles",Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. Although it is widely assumed that protected areas conserve species that would not survive elsewhere, this assumption is seldom tested. The aim of the study was to determine the respective roles of a nature reserve and commercial and subsistence rangeland in preserving terrestrial arthropods and reptiles in xeric succulent thicket in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. 2. Faunal diversity on a nature reserve (the Great Fish River Reserve Complex) was compared with a historically overgrazed commercial farm, an intensively managed, conservatively stocked commercial farm and a communal grazing area. Terrestrial arthropods and reptiles were caught in paired pitfall traps inside and outside the nature reserve, specimens being sorted into recognizable taxonomic units (RTU). The taxa occurring in each land management unit were compared using RTU diversity, a hierarchical richness index (HRI), community similarity and uniqueness. 3. The nature reserve contained more RTU and a greater HRI than adjacent land for most arthropod groups, and also supported more unique taxa than the other study localities. 4. Snakes and lizards, in contrast, were almost twice as abundant in the communal grazing area as elsewhere, although reptile species diversity was similar at all localities. 5. Each individual locality contained fewer than 62% of the total number of arthropod RTU and 55% of the total reptile RTU; the communal grazing area contained only 37% of the total number of arthropod RTU collected in the study area. 6. Nineteen (73%) of the ant, 18 (69%) of the weevil, 60 (70%) of the spider and 12 (60%) of the grasshopper RTU and 10 (66%) of the reptiles were shared by the three land uses. Six new weevil species and probably several new arachnid species were collected, but all the new weevils were confined to the nature reserve. 7. The communal grazing area differed most from the nature reserve in richness and community composition, followed by the conservatively stocked commercial farm. The historically overgrazed commercial farm was most similar to the nature reserve. 8. The communal grazing area was characterized by xeric-adapted reptiles and predatory arthropods whose ranges are centred in the semi-arid parts of South Africa. In contrast, the nature reserve and commercial farms supported more mesic-adapted reptiles and herbivorous arthropods. 9. Synthesis and applications. The data show how protected areas are key to conserving those species that decrease under heavily grazed and disturbed conditions. However, they also illustrate that diverse land-use mosaics promote gamma diversity in the xeric succulent thicket of South Africa. Conservation policies that include protected space in the wider environment and conserve habitat diversity are likely to both promote regional richness and support scarce species."
492,"Forest use and vertical stratification in fruit-feeding butterflies of Sulawesi, Indonesia: impacts for conservation",Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Protected forest areas of Sulawesi are gradually being replaced by intensively used agroforestry systems and farmland, especially in lowland and sub-montane regions. Studies on the impact of these man-induced changes on biodiversity are of urgent conservation concern. We compared the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblage of a natural hill forest to that of a disturbed hill forest, representing a mosaic of old secondary forest and recently abandoned or active subsistence farms. Overall, species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site, but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest. Although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest, vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site. Comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic, but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification. This study shows that higher overall species richness does not imply higher species distinctiveness, and indicates that the contribution of land-use systems to global biodiversity should be evaluated with caution, even when relatively high species richness estimates are found."
493,"Comparison of species composition and richness between primary and secondary lucidophyllous forests in two altitudinal zones of Tsushima Island, Japan",Scientific article,Forest Ecology and Management,"In order to clarify the effects of forest management on the composition and richness of all vascular plant species in lucidophyllous (evergreen broad-leaved) forests, secondary lucidophyllous forest stands regenerating after clearcutting (ca. 40 years old), which were previously clear-cut logged in 15-20 year cycles, were compared with primary lucidophyllous forest stands in two altitudinal zones (Castanopsis zone, ca. < 350 m a.s.l.; and Quercus zone, ca. > 350 m a.s.l.) on Tsushima Island, Japan. For each altitudinal zone, the occurrence frequency of each species in the primary and secondary stands was compared using Fisher's exact test. Eighty-one species were shown to have a significant difference, accounting for about 49% of all species examined (n = 165). In both zones, many species found in the primary stands were absent or rare in the secondary stands. We classified all species into one of two groups: component species of lucidophyllous forests (lucidophyllous elements) and other species (non-lucidophyllous elements). The secondary stands had lower total species richness (the number of all species per 100 m(2)) than the primary stands, regardless of the altitudinal zone. The lower total species richness in the secondary Castanopsis zone stands reflected a decrease in the number of lucidophyllous elements, whereas the lower total species richness in the secondary Quercus zone stands primarily reflected a decrease in the number of non-lucidophyllous elements. The beta diversity between the altitudinal stand types, measured as Whittaker's index beta(w) was lower in the secondary stands than in the primary stands. This difference was primarily due to a lack of species characteristic of each altitudinal zone."
494,From forest to farmland: butterfly diversity and habitat associations along a gradient of forest conversion in Southwestern Cameroon,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"Worldwide, tropical landscapes are increasingly dominated by human land use systems and natural forest
cover is decreasing rapidly. We studied frugivorous butterflies and several vegetation parameters in 24
sampling stations distributed over near-primary forest (NF), secondary forest (SF), agroforestry and
annual culture sites in the Northeastern part of the Korup region, SW Cameroon. As in other studies, both
butterfly species richness and abundance were significantly affected by habitat modification. Butterfly
richness and abundance were highest in SF and agroforestry sites and significantly lower in NF and annual
crop sites. Butterfly species richness increased significantly with increasing tree density, but seemed to
decrease with increasing herb diversity and density in annual crop farms. A significant negative correlation
was found between butterfly geographic range and their preference for NF sites. Our results also showed
that agroforestry systems, containing remnants of natural forest, can help to sustain high site richness, but
appear to have low complementarity through loss of endemic species confined to more undisturbed habitats.
Our study also indicated that the abundance of selected restricted-range butterflies, particularly in the
family Nymphalidae, appears to be a good indicator to assess and monitor forest disturbance."
495,"The effects of various forest uses on small mammal communities in Sarawak, Malaysia",Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"The ecological effects of anthropogenic deforestation on wild animals in tropical regions are a global concern. We investigated the effects of various forest uses on small mammal communities, in Sarawak, Malaysia, by comparing 20 study plots in six forest types: fragmented primeval forest, abandoned fallow at three developmental stages (new, young, and old), rubber plantation, and primary forest. An analysis of forest microhabitat structure revealed three distinctive groups: primary forest, new fallow, and other forests. These were characterized by canopy openness, the basal area, density, and species richness of trees, and vegetation types within a 600-m radius of each plot. In total, 283 individuals of small mammals from 22 species were captured. Small mammals in new fallow formed a distinctive group in an analysis of species composition, with high emergence of human-associated rats and arboreal treeshrews. However, small mammal communities in the other five forest types did not differ considerably. Rubber plantation patches affected the populations of a rodent and a treeshrew. Our results suggest that the various forest uses studied here, except for new fallow, do not have severe effects on small mammal communities. However, the invasion of human-associated species into primary forest may cause unfavorable or unexpected consequences, such as negative effects on natural forest and animal diversity."
496,High sensitivity of montane bird communities to habitat disturbance in Peninsular Malaysia,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"over the past few decades, the montane forests of Peninsula Malaysia have been severely impacted by the cultivation of exotic crops and urban sprawl. To guide conservation initiatives, montane bird communities were studied to determine their response along a disturbance gradient with the aim of identifying key factors influencing their distribution. Habitat types surveyed included primary and secondary montane forests, a tea plantation, rural, and urban areas in Cameron Highlands and Fraser's Hill. Response variables included species richness and density quantified via point counts and mistnet surveys. Explanatory variables measured were related to vegetation structure, food abundance and land-use cover. Estimated 'true' species richness was higher for pristine and minimally disturbed sites, lower in tea plantation and lowest in heavily developed town centres. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed that both vegetation structure (e.g. canopy density) and land-use cover (e.g. proportion of forest cover) influence species distribution; certain invasive lowland birds were tolerant of extreme development and native montane birds, in general, endured only slight habitat disturbances. A simulation indicated that montane forest dependant species richness started to decline when more than 20% of the canopy cover was lost. Less than a third of the species richness remained when more than 40% of the canopy cover was cleared. The logistic regression model suggested that sensitive species nested lower, were restricted to montane habitats and foraged in mid or high canopy. The dominance of lowland invasives in highly developed urban sites reveals that homogenisation of bird communities can occur even at higher altitudes (> 1400 in a.s.l.). The results indicated that native montane birds communities are sensitive to habitat loss and degradation. Thus, any development in the highlands must proceed with minimal disturbance to montane forests, of which, keeping the canopy cover intact should be a crucial consideration."
497,Identification of ecological indicators for monitoring ecosystem health in the trans-boundary W Regional park: A pilot study,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"The sustainable management of the W Regional park and its peripheral areas is based on a trade-off between conservation and the generation of economic income for local populations. This work is a pilot study for the identification of ecological indicators to monitor ecosystem health in Sudanian Savannah ecosystems. Ecological indicators are needed to warrant the efficiency of the protection measures, particularly in the mosaic landscapes Of the peripheral areas. Two insect families (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae (Cetoniinae) and Lepj.doptera: Nymphalidae) were trapped along transects crossing landuse units submitted to various human pressures (none, hunting, traditional and intensive crops, grazing) in two countries (Burkina Faso and Benin). Plant species richness was found to be correlated with the abundance of four fruit-feeding insect species and with the fruit-feeding butterflies species richness, but not with the Cetoniinae species richness. The abundance of Nymphalidae species generally dropped with human activities, but that of Cetoniinae species followed the intermediate disturbance theory. The likely impact of the various management practises on the general ecosystem health is discussed, as is the potential value of fruitfeeding insects as bioindicators and the points that still need to be clarified."
498,Bat diversity and abundance associated with the degree of secondary succession in a tropical forest mosaic in south-eastern Mexico,Scientific article,Animal Conservation,"Under the hypothesis that bat diversity would be lower in the early stages of secondary succession and that species affected negatively by habitat modification would be more frequent in later successional stages, we evaluated how bats use 12 vegetation stands representing four stages of secondary succession, following disturbance caused by slash-and-burn agriculture and selective logging. We compared bat richness, abundance and diversity, and found that none of these variables was different among stages or rainy seasons. However, of the 10 most common bat species, two were significantly more abundant in stands at the early stages of secondary succession, while the opposite was true for three other species. Canopy cover mainly explains these patterns. Rainy season had no effect on the abundance of the common species. The results of this study indicate that although some frugivorous species were very abundant in the younger stands, the majority of the rare species were captured in older stands. The absence of rare and habitat-specialized species from young successional stages close to primary forest suggests that, for effective bat conservation in landscapes modified by human activity, areas with original vegetation should be maintained to ensure the survivorship of sensitive-to-deforestation species."
499,"The Value of Primary, Secondary, and Plantation Forests for a Neotropical Herpetofauna",Scientific article,Conservation Biology,"Plantation forests and second-growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical
forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry
options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary,
and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used
four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739
leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among
forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community
structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians
and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests
were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species
characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations
formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community
in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively
impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna.
Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence
of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest
regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by
deforestation."
500,How resilient are Andean montane forest bird communities to habitat degradation?,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The threatened forest habitats of the tropical Andes are reportedly being modified and destroyed 30% faster than their lowland tropical counterparts, but impacts on the hyper-diverse resident avifauna have received little systematic study. We present a baseline analysis of the effects of habitat modification on birds in a lower montane forest landscape in Ecuador, comparing avian community composition in landscape elements subjected to different levels of human modification: primary forest, secondary forest, edge habitat and agricultural land. We use data from a point count survey of 300 counts at 150 sites to test whether community composition and density of birds with different reported habitat preferences and foraging strategies change among landscape elements. Species richness and diversity were lowest in agricultural land, but on some measures, equally low in primary forest. Richness and diversity peaked in secondary forest and edge habitat, but ordination and density analysis revealed clear differences in their species composition. While secondary forest contained mostly forest-preferring species, edge habitat harboured a mix of forest and open-land birds. There was a clearly structured gradient in species composition across landscape elements, with densities of habitat specialists, foraging guilds and families varying considerably from primary forest to agricultural land. Agricultural land was characterised by an assemblage of widespread, abundant species very different from that in core forest habitats. As such, while the majority of montane forest birds appear resilient to a certain level of habitat modification, they cannot persist, and are displaced, where forest has been cleared outright. We argue that, for Andean montane forests, preservation of mature secondary forest offers flexibility in supplementing preserved primary forest areas to provide sufficient habitat for the persistence of this incredibly diverse but severely threatened bird community.."
501,Secondary rain forests are not havens for reptile species in tropical Mexico,Scientific article,Biotropica,"A widely accepted biodiversity crisis in the tropics has been recently challenged by claims that secondary forests will gradually restore biodiversity losses. This prediction was examined for the herpetofauna in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Quantitative sampling (108 transects) of reptiles was undertaken monthly (January-September 2004) along a vegetation gradient covering induced grasslands, and regrowth and primary rain forests. A total of 35 species was found, 14 being present in and five showing dependence on mature forests. Lizards contributed > 90 per cent of the individuals observed. Reptile abundance and snake species richness was highest in primary forests, even though the lower abundance and richness did not differ between regrowth forest and induced grasslands. Multivariate ordinations and ANOSIM tests displayed clear differences in assemblage structure among vegetation types, mainly caused by contrasting abundances of lizard species having distinctive arboreal or terrestrial habits. There was no evidence that snake assemblages differed between secondary forests and induced grasslands. Microhabitat availability had a key role in shaping species composition through the vegetation gradient. Our results dismiss the hypothesis that secondary forests can act as reservoirs of primary forest reptile diversity on the basis that many taxa depend largely on habitat quality and have specialized life-history traits, and that biological succession does not guarantee the recovery of assemblage complexity."
502,The impact of land-use change on larval insect communities: Testing the role of habitat elements in conservation,Scientific article,Ecoscience,"Conservationists have proposed that maintaining key elements of the original land-cover type in modified landscapes may mitigate the detrimental effects of land-cover change on residual species. We tested this hypothesis for aquatic insect communities in tank-forming bromeliads in forested and non-forested habitats in Costa Rica. Bromeliad tanks hold much of the standing water in this region and therefore provide an important resource for insects with aquatic larval stages. We quantified the relative importance of land-use type and the bromeliad-specific ""local"" environment on the insect community, and also the effect of land-use type on this local environment. Insect species responded to both land-use type and the local environment, with these variables explaining a total of 36% of species densities. The local environment independently explained 19% of insect densities, while land-use type explained 17%, mainly through its modification of the local environment. Local environmental conditions were strongly correlated to land-use type (r(2) = 0.64), with non-forest habitat having a higher average temperature, a greater variation in temperature, and a lower density of bromeliads. Our results indicate that the land-use type in which bromeliads occur influences the relative densities of insects by altering the local environment of bromeliads. Therefore, maintaining bromeliads under land-use conversion will not necessarily maintain the bromeliad insect community of the original forested habitat."
503,Bat diversity in the vegetation mosaic around a lowland dipterocarp forest of Borneo,Scientific article,Raffles Bulletin of Zoology,"Tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia are decreasing rapidly because of conversion to agricultural lands, which in turn leads to an increase in mosaic landscapes. Little is known about the effects of these anthropogenic changes on bat fauna or feeding behaviour. To better explore anthropogenic effects on bats (Chiroptera), we investigated the diversity and feeding habits of bats in an intact lowland dipterocarp forest and surrounding areas of varying vegetation types. The total sampling effort using mist nets (32,795 m(2)h) resulted in the capture of 495 bats, representing 28 species. Simpson's index of diversity was relatively high in primary forests (7.86) compared to secondary forests (3.38), orchards (3.65), and oil palm plantations (1.24). The capture rate of two frugivorous bats clearly differed among the four vegetation types, and these species were never caught in orchards or oil palm plantations. In addition, the capture rate of microchiropterans was notably lower in oil palm plantations than in the other three vegetation types. These results indicate that many bat species rarely use agricultural land for feeding, and these plant communities are not suitable for maintaining bat diversity. However, the data on the feeding habits of three megachiropterans that were frequently captured in orchards and oil palm plantations indicate that agricultural plants are their primary food sources. Orchards and oil palm plantations may be inadequate habitats for most frugivorous and insectivorous bats, but these plant communities may provide important food sources for certain species of megachiropterans."
504,"Deforestation and the structure of frog communities in the Humedale Terraba-Sierpe, Costa Rica",Scientific article,Zoological Science,"Loss of tropical forests is a major cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Although drastic modification of the habitat has been shown to negatively affect amphibians, we are far from a complete understanding of the response of amphibian communities to deforestation. We studied frog assemblages in a gradient of forest modification in a humid area of Costa Rica, where the primary forest has been partially converted into pasture. The study area is a mosaic of primary palm forest, abandoned pasture covered by secondary forest, and pasture. Species richness was assessed by randomized walk surveys and audio strip transects. We also measured ecological features to evaluate the relationship between landscape alteration and amphibian distribution. The study area hosted a large number of amphibian species. We focused our monitoring on six anurans: Leptodactylus labialis, Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri, E. diastema, Hyla rosenbergi, H. microcephala, and Cochranella granulosa. Three species (L. labialis, H. rosenbergi, and H. microcephala) were most abundant in pasture areas with livestock presence, while E. fitzingeri, E. diastema, and C. granulosa were associated with primary forest. Most of the variation in community structure was explained by the joint effect of forest alteration and presence of livestock. Whereas forest specialists suffer direct negative effect from deforestation, generalist species can take advantage of forest alteration and the presence of farm animals. Species that are able to take advantage of the new environmental characteristics associated with human modifications of landscapes will come to prevail in the new communities."
505,Species compensation maintains abundance and raid rates of African swarm-raiding army ants in rainforest fragments,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Habitat clearance and fragmentation is increasingly threatening the biodiversity of tropical
rainforests, however, the response of many insect species, even of key organisms, is still
little understood. Using an extensive data set spanning over four years, we analyzed the
effects of clearance and fragmentation of a Congo-Guinean rainforest in western Kenya
on the abundance and the raid rates of two species of swarm-raiding army ants, which
are considered keystone organisms of tropical rainforests. The abundance of army ants
was measured by transect monitoring and by short-term pitfall trapping while raid rates
were measured by long-term pitfall trapping over a period of five months. Dorylus wilverthi
was the most abundant army ant in undisturbed rainforest and its abundance and raid rate
strongly declined in small forest fragments. In contrast, the abundance of Dorylus molestus
increased with decreasing fragment size and compensated for the decline of D. wilverthi in
terms of abundance and ecological functionality (i.e. raiding rates). D. molestus appears to
have a higher ability of using the agricultural land surrounding the Kakamega Forest than
D. wilverthi, which may explain the species-specific differences in the susceptibility to habitat
fragmentation. Our study demonstrates that habitat fragmentation may have a differential
effect on two ecologically highly similar keystone species. Moreover, it shows that
species compensation might help in maintaining an important ecosystem function (i.e.
raiding by swarm-raiding army ants) in fragmented tropical rainforests."
506,"Assemblages of soil macrofauna across a Scottish land-use intensification gradient: influences of habitat quality, heterogeneity and area",Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1 Land-use intensification strongly influences biodiversity by altering habitat heterogeneity, the distribution of habitat types and their extent. This study explores these effects within mixed semi-natural/agricultural mosaic habitats in Scotland, examining the effect of land-use intensification on the soil macrofauna at point (m2), landscape (km2) and regional (> 1 km2) scales.
2 The soil macrofauna in six 1-km2 sampling areas (land-use units; LUU) were sampled using a combined hand-sorting and Winkler bag extraction technique. Within each LUU, 16 1-m2 samples were taken in each of 2 successive years. Each LUU had a mixture of land-use types, representing an agricultural intensification gradient.
3 The following hypotheses were tested: (i) the study area sustains a number of distinct habitats as defined by soil macrofaunal composition; (ii) a greater number of restricted range species are found in semi-natural habitats; (iii) local (point) species density is related to habitat type; (iv) overall levels of species richness per habitat at regional scales are related to species-area effects; and (v) landscape-level species density is correlated with habitat heterogeneity.
4 Initial analysis revealed five distinct habitat types: Caledonian forest (semi-natural pine forest), closed canopy woodland (pine plantation and broadleaved woodland), riparian habitats (wet woodland and grassland), pasture (improved grassland) and arable (crop fields).
5 As hypothesized, the Caledonian habitat contained a greater number of restricted-range species than the other habitats. However, conifer plantations contained more restricted range species than expected, given their anthropogenic origin. Species density per m2 was most strongly affected by habitat type. At the regional level, the size of the species pool was correlated with the size of habitat areas. There were more species overall in LUU with greater habitat heterogeneity.
6 Synthesis and applications. Caledonian pine forests have high species densities and contain species of conservation value. Mixed conifer plantations also appear to have a surprisingly high invertebrate conservation value. In contrast, intensively managed agricultural habitats have low species densities and conservation value. Generally, mixed land-use areas have higher species densities than single land-use areas. This emphasizes the need for careful management of forest systems within the matrix of agricultural habitats to maximize landscape diversity."
507,Homogenization of ant communities in mediterranean California: The effects of urbanization and invasion,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"In coastal California, the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) displaces nearly all
above ground foraging native ant species. The loss of native ants following invasion by
Argentine ants homogenizes these faunas; natural habitats invaded by L. humile have lower
beta diversity compared to comparable uninvaded areas. Argentine ant abundance in the
seasonally dry mediterranean environments of this region correlates strongly and positively
with soil moisture. For this reason, the displacement of native ants across natural
and artificial moisture gradients often resembles an edge effect, the magnitude of which
is inversely proportional to the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective
of L. humile. The direct effects of Argentine ant invasions in natural environments are
therefore amplified by inputs of urban and agricultural run off. Indirect ecological effects
of these invasions arise from the loss of large-bodied ants, arid adapted ants, and behavioral
repertoires unique to particular native ant species. Further research is needed to
quantify how these aspects of functional homogenization affect invaded communities.
The close association between L. humile and moist soils suggests that, at least in arid
regions, control strategies might be aimed at reducing urban run off in order to maintain
functionally diverse communities of native ants."
509,Evaluating the efficiency of sampling methods in assessing soil macrofauna communities in arable systems,Scientific article,European Journal of Soil Biology,"The soil fauna is often a neglected group in many large-scale studies of farmland biodiversity
due to difficulties in extracting organisms efficiently from the soil. This study assesses
the relative efficiency of the simple and cheap sampling method of handsorting against
BerleseTullgren funnel and Winkler apparatus extraction. Soil cores were taken from
grassy arable field margins and wheat fields in Cambridgeshire, UK, and the efficiencies
of the three methods in assessing the abundances and species densities of soil macroinvertebrates
were compared. Handsorting in most cases was as efficient at extracting the
majority of the soil macrofauna as the BerleseTullgren funnel and Winkler bag methods,
although it underestimated the species densities of the woodlice and adult beetles. There
were no obvious biases among the three methods for the particular vegetation types sampled
and no significant differences in the size distributions of the earthworms and beetles.
Proportionally fewer damaged earthworms were recorded in larger (25  25 cm) soil cores
when compared with smaller ones (15  15 cm). Handsorting has many benefits, including
targeted extraction, minimumdisturbance to the habitat and shorter sampling periods and
may be the most appropriate method for studies of farmland biodiversity when a high
number of soil cores need to be sampled."
510,Time-consistent rearrangement of carabid beetle assemblages by an urbanisation gradient in Hungary,Scientific article,Acta Oecologica,"To examine the impact of urbanisation on arthropod biodiversity, carabid (Coleoptera: Carabidae)
assemblages were studied over 2 years along a ruralurban gradient representing
increasing levels of human disturbance. Carabids were collected by pitfall trapping during
their whole activity period in lowland oak forest patches in and near the city of Debrecen,
Eastern Hungary, over two seasons (20012002). Carabid activity density was significantly
higher in the rural than in the two other areas, but there was no significant difference in
species richness (measured as mean number of species caught/trap). The proportion of
forest specialists significantly decreased from the rural towards the urban area, and the
proportion of forest specialist species was significantly higher in the rural and suburban
areas than in the urban one. In contrast, the relative activity density of generalist species
significantly increased along the ruralurban gradient. Both the relative number of openhabitat
species and their activity density were significantly higher in the urban forest
fragments than in the suburban and rural ones. The patterns found were consistent
between the 2 years. Multidimensional scaling indicated pronounced changes in species
composition along the gradient; the assemblages in urban forest fragments were more
variable than in the other areas. A large proportion of the variation in overall activity
density, species richness and the proportion of carabids with different habitat affinities
could be explained by structural habitat variables (percentage cover by canopy, leaf litter,
herbs and decaying wood), and prey availability."
511,The nematodes and oribatid mites as indicators of urban environment,Scientific article,Zoologiis Institutis Sromebi,"For the purpose to study of urban environment condition in Tbilisi and in its environs samples of
soil nematodes and oribatid mites were collected. In all was derteminated 44 species of nematodes and 76
species of oribatid mites. Pair faunal likeness by Jaccards coeffcient, Renconens coefficient of dominance
and Sympsons index of diversity was calculated for both groups. On the bases of this calculation clusters of
faunal likeness and dominance identities were made up for nematodes and oribatid mites."
512,"Can arable field margins be managed to enhance their biodiversity, conservation and functional value for soil macrofauna?",Scientific article,Journal of Applied Ecology,"1. The establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an agri-environment scheme
that aims to provide resources for native flora and fauna and thus increase farmland biodiversity.
These margins can be managed to target certain groups, such as farmland birds and pollinators, but
the impact of such management on the soil fauna has been poorly studied. This study assessed the
effect of seed mix and management on the biodiversity, conservation and functional value of field
margins for soil macrofauna.
2. Experimental margin plots were established in 2001 in a winter wheat field in Cambridgeshire,
UK, using a factorial design of three seed mixes and three management practices [spring cut,
herbicide application and soil disturbance (scarification)]. In spring and autumn 2005, soil cores
taken from the margin plots and the crop were hand-sorted for soil macrofauna. The Lumbricidae,
Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were identified to species and
classified according to feeding type.
3. Diversity in the field margins was generally higher than in the crop, with the Lumbricidae,
Isopoda and Coleoptera having significantly more species and/or higher abundances in the
margins. Within the margins, management had a significant effect on the soil macrofauna, with
scarified plots containing lower abundances and fewer species of Isopods. The species composition
of the scarified plots was similar to that of the crop.
4. Scarification also reduced soil- and litter-feeder abundances and predator species densities,
although populations appeared to recover by the autumn, probably as a result of dispersal from
neighbouring plots and boundary features. The implications of the responses of these feeding
groups for ecosystem services are discussed.
5. Synthesis and applications
This study shows that the management of agri-environment schemes
can significantly influence their value for soil macrofauna. In order to encourage the litter-dwelling
invertebrates that tend to be missing from arable systems, agri-environment schemes should aim to
minimize soil cultivation and develop a substantial surface litter layer. However, this may conflict
with other aims of these schemes, such as enhancing floristic and pollinator diversity."
513,"Arthropod Diversity as Affected by Agricultural Management (Organic and Conventional Farming), Plant Species, and Landscape Context",Scientific article,Ecoscience,"Arthropods were inventoried in crop fields and adjacent woody hedgerows of organic and conventional farms situated
in south-central Ontario, Canada. The objective was to assess the total abundance, family richness, and composition of
beneficial and phytophagous arthropods in the 2 farming systems and to examine the contributions of the vegetation present
and landscape features on arthropod abundance and composition. Two hundred and forty sticky traps were installed (24 sites)
and 170 sweep net collections were conducted (17 sites) in crop fields and adjacent woody hedgerows of organic
and conventional sites. A total of 30 807 individual arthropods belonging to 131 families were recorded during the study.
No spatial autocorrelation was detected among the arthropod samples. The study showed that beneficial and phytophagous
arthropod abundance differed between organic and conventional sites (only with sweep net) but family richness did not.
Beneficial arthropods were more abundant in woody hedgerows, while phytophagous arthropods were more abundant in crop
fields. This study also demonstrated a strong relationship between plant and arthropod composition. Habitats (total old field
cover, total hedgerow length, and Shannon diversity index, all within 250 m radius) in the surrounding landscape influenced
arthropod composition but were not leading factors in explaining richness and abundance. It is therefore of prime importance
to consider both local factors (management practices and local vegetation) and regional factors such as landscape features as
explanatory variables when attempting to explain biodiversity."
514,Selecting terrestrial arthropods as indicators of small-scale disturbance: A first approach in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"The growing pressure placed by human development on natural resources creates a need for quick and
precise answers about the state of conservation of different areas. Thus, identifying and making use of
ecological indicators becomes an essential task in the conservation of tropical systems. Here we assess
the effects of small-scale disturbance on terrestrial arthropods and select groups that could be used as
ecological indicators in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Arthropods were sampled within a continuous forest
in the Serra do Mar State Park, southeastern Brazil, both in disturbed and undisturbed areas of the
reserve. The abundance of exotic species was higher in the disturbed site, and this pattern seems to be
an adequate indicator of anthropogenic disturbance. Species richness of Araneae, Carabidae, Scarabaeidae,
Staphylinidae, and epigaeic Coleoptera (pooled) was higher in the undisturbed site, while that of
fruit-feeding butterflies was higher in the disturbed site. Species richness was not significantly correlated
between any pair of taxa. In contrast, species composition was significantly correlated among most
groups, and clearly discriminates the disturbed from the undisturbed site. Moreover, fruit-feeding butterflies
and epigaeic Coleoptera composition discriminated disturbed and undisturbed sites even when species
were grouped into higher taxonomic levels, which may be a way of overcoming the difficulty of
identifying arthropod species from poorly studied, species-rich ecosystems. Potential applications for
these indicators include the choice and evaluation of sites for the establishment of natural reserves, elaboration
of management plans, and the assessment of ecological impacts due to human activities, either
for the purposes of licensing or legal compensation."
517,Seasonal variation in soluble soil carbon and nitrogen across a grassland productivity gradient,Scientific article,Soil Biology & Biochemistry,"Understanding the fate and turnover of the pools that comprise dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in soil is key to determining its role in ecosystem functioning. We investigated seasonal changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations within four molecular weight (MW) size fractions across an altitudinal gradient (from lowland to montane systems), and quantified individual amino acids and amino acid constituents of oligopeptidic-N, as well as nitrate and ammonium. We tested two ideas: first, that DON is more abundant than DIN in low-productivity relative to high-productivity grassland ecosystems: and second, that the abundance of peptides and amino acids is likewise greater in low- than high-productivity grassland. The most productive site had a history of inorganic fertiliser application, and hence in this site alone DIN was more abundant than DON. Plant productivity varied 3-fold between the other sites, and DON was generally at higher concentrations in the sites of lower productivity both in absolute terms as well as relative to DIN, with a large increase observed in spring. The fraction containing the highest concentration of the DON had a MW of > 100 kDa, and in summer and autumn this fraction was more abundant at the lowest productivity site. We conclude that relationships between the abundance of DON relative to DIN and ecosystem productivity is dependent on season, and hence more complex than previously suggested, and that peptides are a dynamic and potentially nutritionally significant component of DON."
518,Impact of different land management on soil spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) in two Amazonian areas of Brazil and Colombia,Scientific article,Journal of Arachnology,"The global demand for different land-use practice commodities in the Amazonia is growing, and this region is
increasingly affected by the impacts of land management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of land-use
intensification on soil spider assemblages from six different land-use systems in Colombia and Brazil. The systems were
fallows after crops and pastures, forest, crops, pastures and plantations. Spider species richness and density decreased with
increasing farming management intensity. A principal component analysis (PCA) showed forests and fallows were
separated from systems with stronger anthropogenic soil disturbance. The relationships of ten spider guilds differed
significantly between land-uses, suggesting that they can be a reliable parameter for studies of ecological indicators."
519,The effects of four types of anthropogenic disturbances on composition and abundance of terrestrial isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea),Scientific article,Zoological,"The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is currently reduced to about 12% of its original range. Among the components
that make up its great diversity, there are species with the potential to be bioindicators, which can be very important for
conservation-oriented studies. This study compares the species composition, abundance and sex ratio of terrestrial
isopods in sites that show different anthropogenic disturbance histories and are located within four reserves in the
Atlantic Forest of southwestern Brazil. Our study explores these crustaceans as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance.
The influence of one of the following factors was explored in each protected area: 1) history of vegetation harvesting, 2)
trail management, 3) Eucalyptus planting, and 4) edge effect. A total of 2,217 individuals of six species (Atlantoscia sp.,
Benthana werneri Lemos de Castro, 1958, Pseudodiploexochus tabularis (Barnard, 1932), Pudeoniscus obscures Lemos de
Castro, 1973, Styloniscus spinosus (Patience, 1907), and Trichorhina sp.) were captured in pitfall traps. The composition
of isopod species was different between most of the contrasting sites within reserves, and was similar among the less
disturbed sites of different reserves. The total number of isopod individuals and the sex ratio were not different between
the contrasting sites within most of the reserves and only the sex ratio of Atlantoscia sp. differed between contrasting
sites of one protected area. Upon an individual analysis of each species, S. spinosus (an exotic species) was most abundant
in more disturbed sites. The distributions of B. werneri and Atlantoscia sp. over time were relatively synchronous,
except where S. spinosus was abundant. Our results also indicate that the exotic species S. spinosus may benefit from the
vegetation mosaic produced by disturbance, so differences in abundance of this species may be useful for bioindication.
A change in the spatial and temporal structure of Oniscidea communities caused by anthropogenic disturbance may
have a cascade effect on ecological cycles because terrestrial isopods play a fundamental role in nutrient cycling."
521,Biodiversity of soil macrofauna in the New Forest: a benchmark study across a national park landscape,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"The New Forest National Park is a hotspot for biodiversity in the UK. A long history of grazing by ponies in the New Forest landscape has created a diverse mosaic of habitats that are of international significance. We investigated patterns of species diversity and composition across the New Forest landscape by sampling soil, leaf litter and ground macrofauna from woodland, grassland and heathland plots across the entire landscape. We used a spatially replicated design of hand sorted soil pits, Winkler extraction of leaf litter, and pitfall traps. We concentrated on diversity patterns of the following target groups: Coleoptera, Formicidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Opiliones and Lumbricidae. The most striking difference in species assemblages is between wooded and open areas. Woodlands are the most diverse habitats and have a distinct assemblage, largely due to those leaf litter invertebrate species which are only present under a closed canopy. Open areas are less diverse, with diversity particularly low in the wet grasslands. However, the open areas do have a distinct fauna, especially in the wet and dry heaths which are home to a number of rare species, particularly of Formicidae. We discuss the potential conservation problems facing the New Forest and how these might affect soil macrofauna biodiversity in the future and conclude that climate change; over-grazing; and land use changes represent the largest threats. Although a relatively stable landscape which benefits from protection under UK law, changes in grazing intensity or management practices in the New Forest, particularly for some of the habitats of European importance (e.g. wet heathlands), could negatively affect soil macrofauna biodiversity. Climate change may also exacerbate biodiversity decline as a result of increased grazing intensity or changes in management."
524,Species diversity and life history traits in calcareous grasslands vary along an urbanization gradient,Scientific article,Biodiversity and Conservation,"Calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich plant communities in
Europe with a particularly high nature conservation value. During the past centuries their
distribution has markedly decreased, at least partly due to urbanization. Thus we investigated
the effects of urbanization on species diversity along a spatio-temporal urbanization
gradient from traditionally managed grassland to areas affected by urban developments,
which was situated in the plains northwest of Munich, Germany. Both a RLQ analysis
linking species and environmental traits, and a redundancy analysis of the plant community
features showed that soil disturbance, soil sealing and mean temperature explained most of
the environmental variation along the gradient. The species in urban habitats showed
increased insect pollination, earlier flowering and prolonged seed longevity. While
urbanization favored short-lived species with dysochorous dispersal, the reference grasslands
harbored more wind-pollinated perennials with effective vegetative spread and relatively
large, short-lived seeds. Compared to the urban sites, traditionally used grasslands
had a higher species diversity, more threatened species and a lower proportion of nonnatives.
We conclude that even under conservation management, urban habitats are not
capable of maintaining the original biodiversity. However, we also found threatened
species occurring exclusively in urban sites. Hence, urbanization decreased the area and
diversity of traditional calcareous grasslands, but it also established niches for endangered
species which are not adapted to the living conditions in calcareous grasslands."
525,Microhabitat heterogeneity enhances soil macrofauna and plant species diversity in an Ash - Field Maple woodland,Scientific article,European Journal of Soil Biology,"The high biodiversity of soil ecosystems is often attributed to their spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales, but studies on the small scale spatial distribution of soil macrofauna are few. This study investigates differences between species assemblages of soil and litter invertebrates, and plants, using multivariate ordination and indicator species analysis for eleven microhabitats in an Ash-Field Maple woodland partially converted to conifer plantation. Microhabitats are divided into standard ones representing the main body of uniform litter, and additional, localised microhabitats. Species accumulation curves suggest that for inventory work targeting additional microhabitats is more efficient but for comparative work standard microhabitats are preferred. Vegetation showed more distinctive species assemblages than soil and leaf litter invertebrates and was strongly influenced by environmental variables. Deadwood habitats were found to have a distinct composition from other microhabitats within the leaf litter comprising a high proportion of saproxylic species. An early successional microhabitat had distinct plant and soil fauna many of which had been previously associated with ruderal habitats. Seepages had a distinct earthworm fauna comprising species rarely sampled in standard soil biodiversity surveys. The leaf litter in the plantation area was overall species poor, providing support for removal of the conifers."
527,Role of urban forests as a source of diversity of carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in urbanised areas,Scientific article,Baltic Journal of Coleopterology,"We analysed the structure of ground-beetle (Col.: Carabidae) assemblages populating urban
forests which differed from one another in the composition of woody plants, soil cover with
herbaceous plants, habitat humidity, and extent of stress caused by people. Field tests were
carried out in Olsztyn, Northeastern Poland, in 2009. A total of 4,440 individuals, representing
70 species, were captured in pitfall traps. Different ecological groups of carabids were observed
depending on the distinguishing features of the analysed urban forests. Redundancy
analyses showed that anthropogenic pressure and habitat humidity had significant impact on
the formation of carabid assemblages. We observed that the variety of urban forests helped to
sustain and improve the species diversity of ground beetles. Owing to their heterogeneity,
trees and shrubs in towns provide for the presence of various ecological groups of Carabidae."
528,"Earthworms in England: distribution, abundance and habitats",Scientific report (published),Natural England Commissioned Report,"Earthworms are of immense ecological and economic importance. However, we lack
detailed understanding of the geographical distributions and habitat preferences of
the UKs 27 native species. Natural England funded the Soil Biodiversity Group
(SBG, Natural History Museum) to (1) sample earthworms in semi-natural habitats
across England, (2) compile a database of earthworm species records from all
available SBG research projects, and (3) assess the conservation status of the
British fauna.
With the assistance of a team of 16 trained volunteers from across the country, 56
sites were sampled using a standardised sampling protocol. All specimens were
identified and these results were combined with the earthworm species records from
nine previous SBG projects. The final dataset contains 7188 individual specimen
records (including immatures) of which 6309 were identified to species. These
specimens were from 1503 samples collected at 333 sites in 15 habitat types across
England and Scotland. The dataset represents the largest and most comprehensive
dataset of species records of British earthworms.
The most numerous species was Allolobophora chlorotica (34% of identified
specimens in the dataset), followed by Aporrectodea caliginosa (19%) and
Lumbricus castaneus (12%). The ten most abundant species represent 95% of all
identified specimens. Twelve species each represent less than one percent of the
dataset, while five species were not collected at all. Endogeic earthworms (species
that live in the topsoil and feed on soil) tend to be most abundant in disturbed soils
and sites with higher soil pH (arable land, field margins, pasture and amenity
grasslands). In contrast, epigeic earthworms (species that live in leaf-litter or humus
and feed on leaf-litter) are more closely associated with woodland habitats and sites
with more acid soils.
Three criteria were used to assess the conservation status of each species: local
population size, geographical range and habitat specificity. Nine species are
classified as Common, twelve as Rare, and six (Helodrilus oculatus, Lumbricus
friendi, Allolobophora cupulifera, Dendrobaena pygmaea, Eisenia andrei and
Aporrectodea limicola) as Extremely Rare. Furthermore, an examination of
published records and the NHM collections suggest that the Extremely Rare species
have each been collected fewer than ten times in the British Isles, and may therefore
warrant being classified as Vulnerable or Imperilled in conservation terms. However,
the status of these six species must be treated with caution until further research is
undertaken to determine whether they still persist at the sites where they were
previously recorded, and whether other populations in similar habitats can be found."
529,Unpublished data of macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity from Purbeck heathland restoration soil biodiversity sampling,Authored unpublished data,,"Land use change is the biggest driver of biodiversity loss worldwide, but studies of land use change rarely consider below-ground biodiversity. My PhD project aims to develop statistical models of how soil biodiversity will respond to predicted future changes in land use in the UK. It uses an integrative approach - combining new data collection and analysis of existing data collated from published papers and unpublished datasets from The Natural History Museum Soil Biodiversity Group. These data cover a range of habitats across the UK and show that pH is a major driver of earthworm distribution. However, pH is compounded by the influence of underlying geology, soil type and land-use history. The heathland restoration techniques used at the Isle of Purbeck RECARE site has resulted in a gradient of pH measures from 4.0 to 7.5 on the same soil type, providing an opportunity to study the influence of pH on earthworm diversity with less confounding factors. This can then be used as a calibration to the dataset compiled from many studies."

531,"Functional diversity and stability of litter-invertebrate communities following land-use change in Sumatra, Indonesia",Scientific article,Biological Conservation,"Tropical land-use intensification is rapidly increasing in regions that harbour high levels of biodiversity, thus posing
a serious threat to the stability and resilience of tropical ecosystems and the important ecosystem services
that they provide. We compared functional group richness and functional dispersion in litter-invertebrate communities
among four different land-use systems, ranging in intensity from primary degraded lowland forest to
oil-palm agriculture in two landscapes on Sumatra, Indonesia. We then investigated the consequences for functional
stability and community resilience by calculating functional redundancy and response diversity of sampled
communities. From primary degraded forest to intensively managed oil-palmsystems, we found a 46% decrease
in species richness and a 48% reduction in density, but weaker effects on functional group richness and an increase
in functional dispersion. Although we detected no significant alteration of response diversity, functional
redundancy of litter-invertebrate communities decreased clearly by losing 37% of functionally redundant species
due to land-use change. Our results indicate that land-use change, fromtropical rainforest to oil-palmagriculture,
can alter both taxonomic and functional diversity of litter-invertebrate communities, resulting in the loss of functional
redundancy and thus functional stability of these ecosystems. However, we also show that land-use systems
of intermediate management intensity, such as jungle-rubber agroforestry, could serve as reservoirs of
functional diversity and stability in monoculture-dominated production landscapes."
532,Oribatida diversity in different microhabitats of Mtirala National Park,Scientific article,Journal of the Acarological Society of Japan,"Faunal surveys were performed in Mtirala National Park (Georgia, Caucasus). Oribatid mites were collected from four microhabitats (soil, moss, litter, decaying wood) at 15 locations from 250 to 1000 m a.s.l. Forest types included walnut (Juglans regia) plantations, mixed chestnut (Castanea sativa) forests, and beech (Fagus orientalis) forests. Our surveys revealed 124 species of oribatid mites. One species, Feiderzetes latus (Schweizer, 1956), is new for Georgian fauna and was found only in decaying beech wood at various stages of decay. Chamobates voigtsi (Oudemans, 1902) was present in all types of habitats and dominated in soil and litter samples. Liebstadia pannonica (Willmann, 1951) was numerous in decaying wood, and Mycobatidae were abundant in moss. Other species were present in moderate quantities. Simpsons index of diversity (1D) revealed low to moderate diversity in nearly all samples, with sampling completeness of about 80%. Hierarchical cluster analyses showed the highest similarity between the soil and litter fauna, with dead wood being the most distinct, indicating special communities of oribatid mites exist there. No pattern of faunal changes along the altitudinal gradient was observed."
533,"An assessment of pollution impacts due to the oil and gas industries in the Pechora basin, north-eastern European Russia",Scientific article,Ecological Indicators,"The chemical composition of terricolous lichens, top-soil and abundance and diversity of lichen communities were assessed at eight sites in the Pechora basin during the summer of 2000 and 2001 to assess local impacts of oil and gas operations. Sites close to industrial areas were compared with areas considered to be pristine. The broad objective of the study was to identify changes in the chemistry of a suite of lichens that could be caused by pollutants from the industrial sites. In particular, increases in the ratios of K:Mg and K:Ca + Mg are indicators of acid deposition and increased N indicates increased N deposition. Lead was also measured in lichens. Other elements measured were Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn in top-soils. The Pechora basin, north-eastern European Russia, includes the north and east of the Komi Republic and a major portion of the Nenets Autonomous region. It is bounded by the Ural mountains to the east and by the Timan range to the west. The area has extensive natural resources, both renewable (e.g. forests) and non-renewable (e.g. minerals, coal, oil and gas). There were limited modifications in the chemistry of lichens and top-soils and lichen diversity close to an oil and gas industrial complex. Here, there were elevations of lead and nitrogen concentrations in lichen apices and in the apical:basal nitrogen ratio in Flavocetraria cucullata, with lower lichen diversity in epigeal and epiphytic lichens. Elevated concentrations of Ba and Ca were found in soil-ash over the 0-5 cm horizon, probably as a result of local emissions from construction activity and gas flaring, rather than from long-range transport. Virtually all other sites remained unmodified and reflected background concentrations. The ecological impacts of the measured pollution loads were low, as elemental concentrations were generally below detection limits, except for one industrial site, where there were signs of an early indicator of industrial activity."
534,Effects of stand structure and landscape characteristics on habitat use by birds and small mammals in managed boreal forest of eastern Canada,Scientific article,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,"Community structure and relative abundance of 27 species of small mammals and forest birds were compared among three types of residual forest stands and unharvested control forest (CO). Treatments were young and old mosaics (a checkerboard pattern of residual and logged forest units of 85-100 ha each) and megablocks (residual stands of 250300 ha isolated within a logged area of 2500-3000 ha). Relative abundances were also used to establish habitat use models (HUMs). We found no statistical difference in species relative abundances between treatments and COs, although small sample sizes limited statistical power. HUMs explained a large amount of variation in habitat use for 15 mammal and bird species (mean 57.4 3.5%, ranging between 22.3% and 75.7%). Variance partitioning emphasized the importance of stand structure characteristics as the principal predictors of abundance for censused species. Our results suggested that mosaics and megablocks are both suitable configurations to maintain studied species because no species exhibited lower relative abundances in such residual forest stands than COs. We suggest that residual forest stands planning should shift from a strictly landscape perspective toward a more holistic approach that considers residual forest structure as well as landscape characteristics."
535,Effects of experimental harvesting on spider (Araneae) assemblages in boreal deciduous forests,Scientific article,Canadian Entomologist,"Two large-scale forestry experiments, in Quebec (Sylviculture et amenagement forestiers ecosysystemique (SAFE)) and Alberta (Ecosystem Management by Emulating Natural Disturbance (E MEND)), were established in the late 1990s to test the effects of alternative silvicultural strategies (e.g., partial cutting) oil biodiversity in northern boreal forests. We collected spiders in pitfall traps 2 years after the application of partial-cutting treatments ill deciduous stands at EMEND and 6 years after similar treatments in deciduous stands at SAFE. Although we are aware of the challenges imposed by disparate locations and whole-scale experimental methods. our objective was to compare the effects of partial cutting oil spider assemblages (diversity and community composition), and ill doing SO, to formulate a few general Statements. Overall, 98 species (6107 individuals) were collected from Alberta and 86 species (3414 individuals) from Quebec. Of these, 44 species were common to both regions. Ordination and indicator-species analyses revealed a distinct effect of geographic separation: the spider assemblages in deciduous stands within the boreal plains ecoregion of Alberta and the boreal shield ill Quebec were distinct. However, the effects of partial cutting oil spider assemblages within each project were similar: removal of 25%-33% of trees shifted a characteristic old-growth fauna toward one more typical of clearcuts. Indicator-species analysis also revealed the dominance of wolf spider (Lycosidae) species in clearcuts Within both experiments and we present evidence that clear-Cutting homogenizes spider assemblages. Old-growth forests contain spider faunas that are easily disrupted by moderate partial Cutting. In the face of: intense harvesting practices, managing for the maintenance of biodiversity and conservation of spider faunas in northern forests will require retention of old-growth forests."

We assessed relatively long-term effects of clear-cutting on litter dwelling land snails, a group with slow active dispersal and considered to be intolerant to microclimate changes. In a pair wise design we compared snail abundance, species density, and species composition between 13 old seminatural stream-side stands and 13 matched young stands developed 40-60 years after clear-cutting. Using a standardized semi-quantitative method, we identified all snail specimens in a 1.5 l subsample of a pooled litter sample collected from small patches within a 20 x 5 m plot in each stream-side stand. From the young stands a mean of 135 shells and 9.5 species was extracted which was significantly higher than the 58.1 shells and 6.9 species found in old forests. Only two of the 16 species encountered showed a stronger affinity to old than to young forests. In short-term studies of boreal stream-side forests land snail abundance is reduced by clear-cutting. Our results indicate that this decline is transient for most species and within a few decades replaced by an increase. We suggest that local survival in moist stream-side refugia makes the land snails able to benefit from the higher pH and more abundant non-conifer litter in young than in old boreal forests. Our results highlight the importance of longer term studies as a basis for management guidelines for biodiversity conservation."
538,Can Repeated Fertilizer Applications to Young Norway Spruce enhance Avian Diversity in Intensively Managed Forests?,Scientific article,AMBIO,"Repeated fertilization of forests to increase biomass production is an environmentally controversial proposal, the effects of which we assessed on breeding birds in stands of young Norway spruce (Picea abies), in an intensively managed forest area in southern Sweden. Our results show that fertilized stands had 38% more species and 21% more individuals than unfertilized stands. Compared with stands under traditional management, the further intensification of forestry by repeated applications of fertilizers thus seemed to enhance species richness and abundance of forest birds. We cannot conclude at this stage whether the response in the bird community was caused by changes in food resources or increased structural complexity in the forest canopy due to the skid roads used for the application of the fertilizers. Future studies should focus on structural and compositional effects of fertilization processes during the entire rotation period and at assessing its effects in a landscape context."
539,Spatial distribution of meadow jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius) in logged boreal forest of northwestern Canada,Scientific article,Mammalian Biology,"Most studies of small mammal responses to habitat alterations focus on dominant species, with a resulting lack of information for rare species. jumping mice (Order Rodentia: Dipodidae) tend to be rare in small mammal trapping studies; thus, little is known of their response to habitat alterations, such as clear-cut logging. We examined the spatial distribution of meadow jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius) captured in 3 upland habitat types (forest interior, forest edge, and logged forest) in the boreal forest of southeastern Yukon, Canada. Meadow jumping mice were the third most common rodent captured, and consistently constituted 19.7% of captures in all of the habitat types. Meadow jumping mice may not be rare in some boreal mammal assemblages. Significantly less animals were captured in the forest interior compared to the forest edge or logged forest (P < 0.05). A preference or avoidance of sharp habitat edges created by logging was not detected. Logged areas may be more preferred over unlogged areas by meadow jumping mice because they provide relatively diverse and abundant food resources and cover. To provide data more useful for biodiversity conservation, we suggest that studies of small mammals in forest ecosystems deploy a variety of trap types and sample at sufficient intensity to provide information on both dominant and rare species."
540,Alternative Silvicultural Practices in Irregular Boreal Forests: Response of Beetle Assemblages,Scientific article,Silva Fennica,"In the process of implementing sustainable management in the eastern Canadian boreal forest, we tested two selection cutting methods and compared them with two widely used practices in the boreal forest: clearcutting with protection of the advanced growth and soils and irregular shelterwood cutting leaving small merchantable stems. We used old-growth irregular stands as references in comparing the impact of these silvicultural treatments on the diversity and abundance of beetles. Three groups were targeted: saproxylic flying beetles, epigaeic saproxylic beetles and epigaeic non-saproxylic beetles. A sampling design including 320 pitfall traps and 80 multidirectional flight-interception traps was deployed in 2007. A total of 26 906 beetles was captured including 407 taxa distributed among 52 families. We found that clearcutting with protection of the advanced growth and soils and irregular shelterwood cutting leaving small merchantable stems had a greater impact on beetle communities than both selection cuttings. Canopy opening as well as the presence of snags and downed woody debris appear as important attributes for several saproxylic and non-saproxylic species. Beetle communities in selection cuttings remained more similar to those found in controls; these silvicultural treatments are new tools to implement ecosystemic and sustainable management in irregular boreal forests."
541,Partial cutting does not maintain spider assemblages within the observed range of natural variability in Eastern Canadian black spruce forests,Scientific article,Forest Ecology & Management,"In boreal black-spruce forests of Eastern Canada, a cohort model of ecosystem management has been proposed whereby a combination of both partial and more intensive cutting are used to emulate old-growth stands and the re-establishment of stands following severe wildfire. As with other approaches to coarse filter conservation, partial cutting is hypothesized to maintain and potentially recreate plant and animal assemblages consistent with a range of natural variability. In this study, we used ground-dwelling spiders (Araneae) to evaluate whether partial cutting and a cohort model of ecosystem management are sufficient to preserve biodiversity found in mature and over-mature boreal black spruce stands prone to paludification. We compared the spider fauna (11,628 individuals representing 136 species) in replicated partial cuts, clear cuts and uncut control stands with a chronosequence of mature and over-mature naturally regenerated stands (94-288 years since the last fire) (25 stands in total] in the same region of the northern Clay belt in Quebec (Canada). In stands that were old-growth prior to cutting, harvesting had strong repercussions on spider assemblages that were not attenuated by less intensive, partial cutting. The most obvious changes in spider assemblages were related to increased recruitment of species that were nearly absent in uncut stands. Several cosmopolitan species that were widely distributed among stands prior to harvest increased in cut stands. Spider assemblages collected following either cutting methods were not consistent with assemblages found within the chronosequence and thus fell outside the observed range of natural variability. However we did not observe a similar recruitment effect for spider species in younger stands with relatively higher levels of retention. We demonstrate that the interaction between stand age prior to cutting, the degree of paludification as well as remnant basal area are important considerations when evaluating the efficacy of partial cutting to maintain forest spider assemblages and biodiversity at large in black-spruce stands. ""We also suggest that retention levels in partial cuts will have to be substantially increased to maintain spider communities within their range of natural variation in managed forested landscapes."" However partial cutting with higher levels of retention, particularly in younger stands, may be useful in coarse filter management particularly for establishing or accelerating spider assemblages towards those found in old-growth stands"
542,Response of breeding songbirds to vegetation management in conifer plantations established in boreal mixedwoods,Scientific article,The Forestry Chronicle,"We examined the response of breeding songbird communities 11 years after four vegetation management treatments were
applied. Post-treatment vegetation was characterized by manually interpreting large-scale aerial photography and estimating
proportional cover of eight vegetation classes. Songbird abundance was assessed by territory mapping. Using GIS layers,
number of registrations and average vegetation proportions were compared among treatments. Ordination of the relative
abundance of the 11 most frequent bird species suggested differences between Vision® and untreated areas. These
results show that effects of vegetation management on songbirds may be more persistent than previous studies suggest and that monitoring should continue"
543,Do time-lagged extinctions and colonizations change the interpretation of buffer strip effectiveness? - a study of riparian bryophytes in the first decade after logging,Scientific article,Applied Ecology,"There is a risk that short-term studies either underestimate disturbance effects because of time-lagged responses, including both time-lagged extinctions and colonizations, or overestimate them because of fast recovery. To evaluate the conservation effectiveness of tree group retention (in this case, buffer strips along streams), we studied the bryophyte community once prior to, and twice after logging, comparing one buffer and one clear-cut plot (0.1 ha) in each of 13 riparian sites. We asked whether time-lagged responses or recovery processes had dominated the period between two re-inventories, 2.5 and 10.5 years after logging, focusing both on the whole community and on species of conservation concern. Although there were examples of recovering species in both clear-cuts and buffer strips, the similarity in species composition to predisturbance conditions had decreased in the second re-inventory. Even if the buffer strips displayed more time-lagged colonizations and local extinctions over the later period compared to the clear-cuts, the overall species composition in the buffer strips was still significantly more similar to the prelogging conditions than the clear-cuts. The red-listed species had mostly declined during the first period, and the number of red-list species per plot (mostly species growing on dead wood) was rather stable at <20% of predisturbance levels in clear-cuts and <60% in buffer strips in the last re-inventory. Synthesis and applications. We show that most extinctions of red-list species occurred soon after disturbance and that the conclusions drawn from a study carried out 2.5 years after the disturbance did not change profoundly 8 years later. Although the species composition in the buffer strips continued to change over time, sensitive species survived much better in buffer strips than in clear-cuts, which supports the practice of retaining buffer strips for terrestrial species too. This knowledge should encourage managers to find ways of increasing the efficacy of this practice. One obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind, which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition."
544,Forest edge contrasts have a predictable effect on the spatial distribution of carabid beetles in urban forests,Scientific article,Journal of Insect Conservation,"Fragmented urban forest remnants are characterised by sharp edges and are bordered by various land-use types, which may have a considerable effect on the fauna and flora at forest edges, and into forest interiors. To investigate the effects of differentially contrasting edges (low vs. intermediate vs. high) on carabid beetle assemblages in urban boreal forests, we placed pitfall traps along a gradient from 6 m into three matrix types (secondary forest vs. grassland vs. asphalt) up to 60 m into urban forest patches in the cities of Vantaa and Helsinki, southern Finland. Individual species and carabid beetle assemblages were strongly affected by edge contrasts and distance from the forest edge. The strongest effect on individual species was caused by
high contrasting edges: generalist and open-habitat species were favoured or not affected while forest specialists were affected negatively. Effects of the abundances of potential prey and competitors on the carabid beetles were also evaluated. Forest and moisture-associated carabid species were negatively to neutrally associated with springtail abundances while generalist and open habitat, and dryness associated species were more positively related to springtail abundances (a potential food source). In terms of potential competitors, forest and moisture-associated carabid species were negatively and/or neutrally affected by ant and wood ant numbers, while generalist and open-habitat species were neutrally to positively associated with these taxa. It appears that carabid beetle habitat associations are more important in the responses of these beetles across edges of different
contrast than are the prey and competitor numbers collected there. We recommend the creation of soft or low-contrast
urban edges if the aim of urban management is to protect forest carabids in cities."
545,Songbird response to green-tree retention prescriptions in clearcut forests,Scientific report (published),Forest Ecology & Management,"Green-tree retention prescriptions have been proposed as a silvicultural technique for reducing the negative impacts of clearcutting on mature forest-associated species, while still promoting habitat for early-successional species. We evaluated the effectiveness of green-tree retention for conserving mature forest-associated, generalist, and early-successional songbirds in aspen stands that were 1-15 years post-harvest. We compared species occupancy estimates at sites where green-tree retention levels were exceeded (>10% canopy cover), met (3-10%), or below (<3%) recommended retention guidelines. We also compared the relative importance of these levels of green-tree retention to forest stand age in explaining songbird occurrence. With the exception of Red-eyed Vireos, our results suggest that current green-tree retention guidelines are ineffective at increasing site occupancy of mature forest-associated songbirds in aspen harvest units. Additionally, site occupancy of early-successional and generalist songbirds were unaffected by these levels of retention. Rather, site occupancy probabilities for most forest birds showed a clear association with age since harvest (1-15 years); however, the strength and direction of the association varied by species. Our research highlights the importance of considering forest stand age when assessing the impact of silvicultural prescriptions on forest songbirds. Future management objectives in aspen forests should reflect the value of clearcutting to early-successional and generalist bird species, while recognizing that green-tree retention as measured in our study does little to promote occupancy of the mature forest-associated bird community."

547,"Carabid community and its fluctuation in farmland of salinity transforming area in the North China Plain: a case study in Quzhou County, Hebei Province",Scientific article,Biodiversity Science,"In 1996 and 1997, a carabid community and its fluctuation were studied by the pitfall method in the salinity transforming area in Quzhou County, Hebei Province, China. The community consists of 19 species belonging to eight genera. Harpalus is the dominant genus and ranks the first in abundance. As a whole, the carabid fauna in this area is simple, having relatively few species and genera. The dominant species are Harpalus simplicidens, H. griseus and H. tridens. Considering the monthly fluctuation of carabid abundance, it reaches a maximum in September, and falls to a minimum in October. The fluctuation of carabids differs among different cropplanting patterns, and is affected to an extent by the changes of the landscape and agricultural activities. Field margins are shelters for carabids where they tend to gather, and these margins play a pivotal role in protecting the carabids. Carabid density in field margins is higher than that in adjacent farmlands, and the monthly fluctuation range there is also narrower."
548,"Nematode community structure under compost and chemical fertilizer management practice, in the north China plain",Scientific article,Experimental Agriculture,"A long-term field experiment was conducted at the Qu-Zhou experimental station, China Agricultural
University to study how the nematode community structure was influenced by compost and chemical
fertilizer, using no amendment as the control. Soil samples were collected from 010 cm and 10
20 cm depths. The different treatments led to a significant difference in the total number of nematodes,
bacterivores, plant parasites, omnivores-predators and nematode richness. The total number of nematodes,
bacterivores, omnivores-predators and nematode richness were found to decrease in chemical fertilizer treated
plots. Although plant parasites were more abundant under compost treatment than under chemical
fertilization, the relative abundance of plant parasites in the compost-treated plots was smaller. The
application of chemical fertilizer decreased the number of genera of bacterivores and omnivores-predators.
The numbers of total nematodes, bacterivores, plant parasites and omnivores-predators were significantly
positively correlated with the contents of total organic carbon, total N, alkali-hydrolysable N, available P
and available K. The compost-treated plots tended to have a greater diversity of nematodes than chemical
fertilizer treated plots, so there was a healthy soil ecosystem under compost treatment."
549,Effect of acetochlor and carbofuran on soil nematode communities in a Chinese soybean field,Scientific article,African Journal of Agricultural Research,"A field experiment was conducted at the Shenyang experimental station of ecology, Northeast China, to
determine the response of soil nematode communities to agrochemical applications. Four treatments
were compared including the control (CK, no agrochemicals applied), herbicide acetochlor (A),
nematicide carbofuran (F) and the combination of acetochlor and carbofuran (AF). The obtained results
indicated that the agrochemical applications could influence the soil nematode communities. In the
treatments with acetochlor and/or carbonfuran, the abundances of total nematodes and plant-parasitic
nematodes were reduced, and those of bacterivores decreased obviously at the 8th week. Forty-two
nematode genera were identified, and Acrobeloides, Pratylenchus and Helicotylenchus were dominant
and demonstrated different susceptibilities to agrochemical treatments. No significant sampling date
and treatment effects were observed in the values of enrichment index (EI) and channel index (CI).
However, the basal index (BI) and structural index (SI) were more suitable for indicating the soil
conditions with different agrochemicals in this study, and higher BI and lower SI could indicate poor
ecosystem health."
550,"Understory plant diversity assessment of Eucalyptus plantations over three vegetation types in Yunnan, China",Scientific article,New Forests,"Biodiversity in managed plantations has become an important issue for longterm
sustainability of ecosystems. The environmental effects of plantations comprised of
fast-growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated. On one hand, monocultures
have been said to exhaust resources, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Conversely, it has
been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding
forests, increasing biodiversity. In order to clarify the effects of planting Eucalyptus
trees on species composition, diversity, and functional type of understory vegetation
in Yunnan province, a field trial was implemented to compare Eucalyptus plantations (EPs)
with two other local current vegetation types (secondary evergreen forests (SEs), and
abandoned farmlands (AFs)). Each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational
ranges (low = 1,0001,400 meters above sea level (masl), medium = 1,4001,800
masl, and high = 1,8002,200 masl). Sample sites within each elevational range had
similar environmental characteristics (slope, aspect, etc.). Thus, we sampled three vegetation
types at each of three sites at each of three elevations for a total of 27 plots. We
calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to
evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges,
employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as Analyses of Variance
(ANOVA) and Indicator Species Analysis. We found that fast growing introduced
Eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area, and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the SE plots, being essentially
absent from the EP and AF plots. The understory plant diversity did not correlate with the
altitude gradient significantly. Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) have a simpler community
structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests (SEs; similar to natural state) or
abandoned farmlands (AFs). No variable significantly explained variation of the understory
shrub layer, but soil moisture-holding capacity and overstory coverage were significant in
explaining variation of the understory herb layer, suggesting that the study of soil physical
properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in Eucalyptus plantations
and other local current vegetation types."
551,Ground Beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) Assemblages of Restored Semi-natural Habitats and Intensively Cultivated Fields in Northern China,Scientific article,Restoration Ecology,"Diversity of ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages
and sub-assemblages was compared between reafforested
woodland, grassland, and intensively cultivated
fields at Chongli County in Northern China. An array of
eight pitfall traps per plot was used to sample the beetles
on four replicate plots for each habitat. Replanted
conifer woodland and semi-natural grassland harbored
very similar beetle assemblages. These had significantly
lower rarefied species numbers than the distinctly different
assemblages recorded in cultivated fields, with differences
in alpha diversity being less pronounced for large
and predatory species. Carabid activity-density levels were
higher in both woodland and grassland than in fields, with
this trend being most pronounced for predatory and large
species. To conserve high levels of gamma diversity, it
is important to maintain a mosaic of agricultural areas
and semi-natural habitats. The latter also form a potential
source for predatory species important in pest control.
It appears that woodland-specific species are rare in the
study area, or they have not been able to reach and colonize
the newly established woodland sites. It can also be
concluded that morphological and ecological traits allow
important insights into underlying ecological principles of
overall diversity patterns."
552,Terrestrial herpetofaunal assemblages in secondary forests and exotic Lophostemon confertus plantations in South China,Scientific article,New Forests,"Deforestation is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss. Globally, large areas of primary forest have
been replaced by secondary forests and plantations, and changes in tree species composition have often
led to alteration of plant and animal communities that were associated with those primary forests. Hong
Kong has experienced a long history of deforestation and may be one of the pioneers in using exotic tree
plantations for forest restoration in Asia. In this study, we sampled herpetofaunal assemblages in native,
secondary forests and exotic Lophostemon confertus plantations by transect surveys, pitfall traps, and coverboards.
Amphibians were more abundant in secondary forests than in plantations, while the abundance
of reptiles and species compositions of both amphibians and reptiles were similar in both forest types.
Body condition of the most common reptile, Sphenomorphus indicus (Indian forest skink), was similar
between secondary forests and plantations. However, higher proportions of S. indicus exhibited autotomized
or missing tails in secondary forests than in plantations, which may be related to higher percentages
of rock and wood cover on the forest floor potentially increasing the chance of escape from predators in
secondary forests. Secondary forests may provide a better habitat for herpetofauna, we suggest that
planting of a mixture of native tree species and thinning of exotic trees may be favorable management
