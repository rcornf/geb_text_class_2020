even though intensive aquaculture production of salmonids in lakes occurs in many locations around the world published studies on the survival and reproductive success of escaped cultured salmonids in freshwater ecosystems are not common a recent expansion of aquaculture in chile has led it to become the world s second largest producer of cultured salmonids we document the recent history of escaped and self sustaining salmonid populations over a wide spatial scale and a long temporal scale in chilean patagonian lakes our hypotheses are that salmonid density in lakes will be higher where there is intensive aquaculture due to greater numbers of potential escapees secondly if non native salmonids have adverse impacts on native fishes increases in the abundance of non native species should be associated with decreases in relative abundance of native species finally if the first two hypotheses are correct we anticipate that diets of salmonids may show evidence of predation on native fishes diet overlap with native species and evidence of the influence of feed from aquaculture operations in the diets of salmonids and native fishes we sampled six lakes with gill nets from to our results show that the relative abundance of free living salmonids is closely related to the level of fish farming production salmonids are the top predators and in lakes with fish farming the main prey item is native fishes the relative abundance of native fishes has decreased most likely due to predation by salmonids our study contributes to the understanding of the effects of non native salmonids in oligotrophic lakes and it provides a starting point to judge the establishment of new fish farming sites in lakes around the world,Freshwater Biology,,aquaculture non native salmonid invasions and associated declines of native fishes in northern patagonian lakes
because sea otters enhydra lutris exert a wide array of direct and indirect effects on coastal marine ecosystems throughout their geographic range we investigated the potential influence of sea otters on the ecology of bald eagles haliaeetus leucocephalus in the aleutian islands alaska usa we studied the diets productivity and density of breeding bald eagles on four islands during and when sea otters were abundant and scarce respectively bald eagles depend on nearshore marine communities for most of their prey in this ecosystem so we predicted that the recent decline in otter populations would have an indirect negative effect on diets and demography of bald eagles contrary to our predictions we found no effects on density of breeding pairs on four islands from to in contrast diets and diet diversity of bald eagles changed considerably between the two time periods likely reflecting a change in prey availability resulting from the increase and subsequent decline in sea otter populations the frequency of sea otter pups rock greenling hexagammus lagocephalus and smooth lumpsuckers aptocyclus ventricosus in the eagle s diet declined with corresponding increases in rock ptarmigan lagopus mutus glaucous winged gulls larus glaucescens atka mackerel pleurogrammus monopterygius and various species of seabirds during the period of the recent otter population decline breeding success and productivity of bald eagles also increased during this time period which may be due to the higher nutritional quality of avian prey consumed in later years our results provide further evidence of the wide ranging indirect effects of sea otter predation on nearshore marine communities and another apex predator the bald eagle although the indirect effects of sea otters are widely known this example is unique because the food web pathway transcended five species and several trophic levels in linking one apex predator to another,Ecology,,bald eagles and sea otters in the aleutian archipelago indirect effects of trophic cascades
interactions between sea otters enhydra lutris sea urchins strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and kelp were investigated following the reduction in sea otter density in prince william sound alaska after the exxon valdez oil spill in at northern knight island a heavily oiled portion of the sound sea otter abundance was reduced by a minimum of by the oil spill and from through remained at an estimated lower than in where sea otter densities were reduced there were proportionally more large sea urchins however except in some widely scattered aggregations both density and biomass of sea urchins were similar in an area of reduced sea otter density compared with an area where sea otters remained about times more abundant furthermore there was no change in kelp abundance in the area of reduced sea otter density this is in contrast to greatly increased biomass of sea urchins and greatly reduced kelp density observed following an approximate decline in sea otter abundance in the western aleutian islands the variation in community response to a reduction in sea otters may be related to the magnitude of the reduction and the non linear response by sea urchins to changes in predator abundance the number of surviving sea otters may have been high enough to suppress sea urchin populations in prince william sound but not in the aleutians alternatively differences in response may have been due to differences in the frequency or magnitude of sea urchin recruitment densities of small sea urchins were much higher in the aleutian system even prior to the reduction in sea otters suggesting a higher rate of recruitment,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,changes in sea urchins and kelp following a reduction in sea otter density as a result of the exxon valdez oil spill

the main objective of many conservation programs is to increase population size by improving a species survival and reproduction however density dependence of demographic parameters may confound this approach in this study we used a year data set on bearded vultures gypaetus barbatus in spain to evaluate the consequences of population growth on reproductive performance unlike its coefficient of variation cv mean annual productivity decreased with increasing population size after controlling for territorial heterogeneity productivity also was negatively related to the distance to the nearest conspecific breeding pair and to supplementary feeding points where floaters congregate these results suggest that vulture populations are regulated as posited by the site dependency hypothesis as the population increases average productivity decreases because progressively poorer territories are used the combined effects of the shrinkage of territories and the presence of floaters around supplementary feeding points seem to be the main causes of productivity decline and are therefore the main determinants of territory quality this has conservation implications especially concerning the role of supplementary feeding points supplementary feeding should be reviewed given that its usefulness in reducing preadult mortality has not yet been proved and its effect on productivity as our results suggest is negative,Ecological Applications,,density dependent productivity depression in pyrenean bearded vultures implications for conservation

identifying demographic changes is important for understanding population dynamics however this requires long term studies of definable populations of distinct individuals which can be particularly challenging when studying mobile cetaceans in the marine environment we collected photo identification data from years to assess the dynamics of a population of bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus restricted to the shallow m waters of little bahama bank northern bahamas this population was known to range beyond our study area so we adopted a bayesian mixture modeling approach to mark recapture to identify clusters of individuals that used the area to different extents and we specifically estimated trends in survival recruitment and abundance of a resident population with high probabilities of identification there was a high probability p of a long term decrease in the size of this resident population from a maximum of dolphins highest posterior density intervals hpdi in to a minimum of just dolphins hpdi in a decline of hpdi to this was driven by low per capita recruitment average that could not compensate for relatively low apparent survival rates average notably there was a significant increase in apparent mortality apparent mortalities vs on average in when two intense hurricanes passed over the study area with a high probability p of a drop below the average survival probability in on average as such our mark recapture approach enabled us to make useful inference about local dynamics within an open population of bottlenose dolphins this should be applicable to other studies challenged by sampling highly mobile individuals with heterogeneous space use,Ecological Applications,,photographic mark recapture analysis of local dynamics within an open population of dolphins

oil that spilled after the grounding of the exxon valdez in killed large numbers of sea otters in western prince william sound alaska usa however our boat based counts of sea otters during at oiled sites were as high or higher than boat based counts in the same area in the early s another study reported a significant decline in sea otter numbers after the spill but our reanalysis of that data produced results very similar to ours counts of otters were higher than pre spill counts in the oiled area the only detectable decline was in the northern part of the sound outside the area of oiling we suggest that otter numbers in the western sound may have been increasing during the late s masking the loss due to the spill direct evidence for such an increase is lacking because no counts were conducted during this period however for several years after the spill pup production was higher than normal which if characteristic of the period immediately pre spill could have spurred a population increase heightened pup production may have been caused by increased food supplies after the spill otters obtained more and larger clams per dive and spent less time feeding per day than in the early s we postulate that in the early s clams were still recovering from the uplift caused by the earthquake which resulted in massive clam mortality and habitat change in the western sound lingering effects of previous catastrophic events like the earthquake and even th century fur harvests have hampered attempts to assess the impacts of the oil spill on sea otter population dynamics the effects of uncontrolled and unreplicated environmental incidents even major disasters may be difficult to assess because of con founding factors,Journal of Applied Ecology,,sea otter population dynamics and the exxon valdez oil spill disentangling the confounding effects

we present a new approach to modeling two sex populations using periodic nonlinear two sex matrix models the models project the population growth rate the population structure and any ratio of interest e g operational sex ratio the periodic formulation permits inclusion of highly seasonal behavioral events a periodic product of the seasonal matrices describes annual population dynamics the model is nonlinear because mating probability depends on the structure of the population to study how the vital rates influence population growth rate population structure and operational sex ratio we used sensitivity analysis of frequency dependent nonlinear models in nonlinear two sex models the vital rates affect growth rate directly and also indirectly through effects on the population structure the indirect effects can sometimes overwhelm the direct effects and are revealed only by nonlinear analysis we find that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to female survival is negative for the emperor penguin a species with highly seasonal breeding behavior this result could not occur in linear models because changes in population structure have no effect on per capita reproduction our approach is applicable to ecological and evolutionary studies of any species in which males and females interact in a seasonal environment,The American naturalist,,mating behavior population growth and the operational sex ratio a periodic two sex model approach

the concept of site dependent population regulation combines the ideas of ideal free distribution type of habitat settlement and density dependence in a vital rate mediated by habitat heterogeneity the latter is also known as habitat heterogeneity hypothesis site dependent population regulation hypothesis predicts that increasing population density should lead to inhabitation of increasingly poor territories and decreasing per capita population growth rate an alternative mechanism for population regulation in a territorial breeding system is interference competition however this would be expected to cause a more even decrease in individual success with increasing density than site dependent regulation we tested these ideas using long term population data from a goshawk accipiter gentilis population in eastern westphalia germany goshawk territory occupancy patterns and reproduction parameters support predictions of site dependent population regulation territories that were occupied more often and earlier had a higher mean brood size fecundity did not decrease with increasing density in best territories using time series modelling we also showed that the most parsimonious model explaining per capita population growth rate included annual mean habitat quality weather during the chick rearing and autumn period and density as variables this model explained of the variation in per capita growth rate the need for including habitat quality in the time series model provides further support for the idea of site dependent population regulation in goshawk,Journal of Animal Ecology,,habitat heterogeneity affects population growth in goskawk accipiter gentilis
the effects of human caused fragmentation of boreal forest on the abundance of red fox vulpes vulpes l and pine marten martes martes l were studied by combining the finnish wildlife triangle snow track data with land use and forest resources data employing the gis two study areas each km located in northern and southern finland were selected for the investigation the extent of landscape that best explained predator abundance tracks per km h was the same about km in both species and study areas the decreasing proportion of older forest and the increasing proportions of young forest and agricultural land in the landscape positively affected track density of red fox the relationship between agricultural land and fox abundance however was characterized by a convex curve peaking at of agricultural land with the habitat classification used landscape composition explained and of the spatial variation in fox abundance in the northern and southern study area respectively the relationship between landscape composition and pine marten abundance was not as clear as in that of red fox landscape composition explained and of spatial variation in pine marten abundance in the northern and southern study area respectively in both areas a positive impact occurred with the increasing proportion of young forest in the landscape but in the northern area the negative effect of increasing proportion of agricultural land was dominant the abundances of red fox and pine marten were not negatively correlated indicating that competition or intraguild predation by red fox do not determine abundance of pine marten on a landscape scale a general increase in predation pressure by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes has been an intensively discussed conservation problem during recent years we conclude that the red fox is a species potentially able to cause elevated predation pressure in boreal landscapes fragmented by human activities but that the evidence against the pine marten is weaker,Journal of Animal Ecology,,abundances of red fox and pine marten in relation to the composition of boreal forest landscapes
the goby paragobiodon echinocephalus is an obligate associate of the branching coral stylophora pistillata population fluctuations of both species were observed over yr on the reef flat of sesoko island okinawa japan coral growth was negatively correlated with size because partial death or destruction often occurred in large corals the number and maximum size of gobies in a coral were positively correlated with coral size small corals cm diameter were seldom used while large corals cm were almost always inhabited by or more fish the goby spawned from april to november and juveniles to mm increased in summer the number of gobies and the corals occupied by gobies increased with the influx of juveniles the goby population declined during winter and spring except in a year when corals cm became abundant when the number of large corals decreased large gobies to mm decreased in number and the occupation rate of smaller corals increased mortality of marked fish mm was correlated with that of corals thus the population fluctuation of the goby was affected by both the availability of host coral and the goby s seasonal reproductive cycle,Marine Ecology Progress Series,,population dynamics of goby paragobiodon echinocephalus and host coral stylophora pistillata
we investigated the impact of a recently emerged disease devil facial tumour disease dftd on the survival and population growth rate of a population of tasmanian devils sarcophilus harrisii on the freycinet peninsula in eastern tasmania cormack jolly seber and multistate mark recapture models were employed to investigate the impact of dftd on age and sex specific apparent survival and transition rates disease impact on population growth rate was investigated using reverse time mark recapture models the arrival of dftd triggered an immediate and steady decline in apparent survival rates of adults and subadults the rate of which was predicted well by the increase in disease prevalence in the population over time transitions from healthy to diseased state increased with disease prevalence suggesting that the force of infection in the population is increasing and that the epidemic is not subsiding the arrival of dftd coincided with a marked ongoing decline in the population growth rate of the previously stable population which to date has not been offset by population compensatory responses,Journal of Animal Ecology,,the impact of disease on the survival and population growth rate of the tasmanian devil
in the montane rain forests of eastern australia at least species of endemic stream dwelling frogs have disappeared or declined sharply by more than during the past years we review available information on these declines and present eight lines of evidence that collectively suggest that a rapidly spreading epidemic disease is the most likely responsible agent the extreme virulence of the putative frog pathogen suggests it is likely exotic to australian rain forests we propose that exotic pathogens may be re sponsible for some recent declines of amphibian populations on other continents and that the intercontinen tal spread of such pathogens is greatly facilitated by human activities such as the thriving international trade in aquarium fish our hypothesis may help explain why some amphibian populations in seemingly pristine environments have mysteriously declined,Conservation Biology,,epidemic disease and the catastrophic decline of australian rain forest frogs

ecology has long been troubled by the controversy over how populations are regulated some ecologists focus on the role of environmental effects whereas others argue that density dependent feedback mechanisms are central the relative importance of both processes is still hotly debated but clear examples of both processes acting in the same population are rare key factor analysis regression of population changes on possible causal factors and time series analysis are often used to investigate the presence of density dependence but such approaches may be biased and provide no information on actual demographic rates here we report on both density dependent and density independent effects in a murid rodent pest species the multimammate rat mastomys natalensis smith using statistical capture recapture models both effects occur simultaneously but we also demonstrate that they do not affect all demographic rates in the same way we have incorporated the obtained estimates of demographic rates in a population dynamics model and show that the observed dynamics are affected by stabilizing nonlinear density dependent components coupled with strong deterministic and stochastic seasonal components,Nature,,stochastic seasonality and nonlinear density dependent factors regulate population size in an african rodent
evolutionary theory predicts that individuals in order to increase their relative fitness can evolve behaviours that are detrimental for the group or population this mismatch is particularly visible in social organisms despite its potential to affect the population dynamics of social animals this principle has not yet been applied to real life conservation social group structure has been argued to stabilize population dynamics due to the buffering effects of nonreproducing subordinates however competition for breeding positions in such species can also interfere with the reproduction of breeding pairs seychelles magpie robins copsychus sechellarum live in social groups where subordinate individuals do not breed analysis of long term individual based data and short term behavioural observations show that subordinates increase the territorial takeover frequency of established breeders such takeovers delay offspring production and decrease territory productivity individual based simulations of the seychelles magpie robin population parameterized with the long term data show that this process has significantly postponed the recovery of the species from the critically endangered status social conflict thus can extend the period of high extinction risk which we show to have population consequences that should be taken into account in management programmes this is the first quantitative assessment of the effects of social conflict on conservation,Journal of Animal Ecology,,reproductive conflict delays the recovery of an endangered social species
wild dogs lycaon pictus are highly threatened carnivores and conservation of their dwindling numbers is needed isolated populations contribute little to these conservation efforts so linking populations of dogs is a necessary goal to prevent extinction i gathered demographic information from a small population of wild dogs in hluhluwe umfolozi park kwazulu natal south africa photographs and archive records from to were used to compile information on this population demographic parameters from the released population were compared with information on wild dogs elsewhere most demographic parameters of the hluhluwe umfolozi park population were similar to published information from other populations the main difference was the effect of a single pack on population performance pack formation was unlikely unrelated animals were rare and major losses emigration and mortalities occurred increasing the number of packs by introducing more dogs would be useful but would be only a short term solution increasing the local population size and artificially linking populations in southern africa appears to be the only longer term solution to ensure the viability of wild dogs on the subcontinent,Conservation Biology,,wild dog demography in hluhluwe umfolozi park south africa
fifteen years of monitoring in the bale mountains provide a valuable time series to better understand the dynamics of populations of the endangered ethiopian wolf canis simensis in the face of epizootics and increasing human pressure line transect counts in four study areas were used to identify trends in the local abundances of wolves people livestock and domestic dogs a putative rabies reservoir estimates of wolf abundance were validated against total counts in prime wolf habitats where two local populations decimated by rabies in the early s had recovered fully by growth appeared to be regulated by negative density dependence but the rate of growth was unexpectedly low at reduced densities limitations to rapid growth including an initial gap for which data were sparse are discussed in a poorer habitat wolf abundance estimates were less reliable but indicated slight fluctuations without an overall trend a local extinction was recorded in an area of marginal habitat with this exception trends in wolf abundances were unrelated to trends in the abundance of people livestock or dogs rabies emerged as the main cause of decline for high density populations the rapidly increasing livestock grazing pressure in bale gives cause for concern calling for further research on its impacts upon long term wolf survival,Animal Conservation,,trends dynamics and resilience of an ethiopian wolf population
using years of data we examined annual variations in the reproductive performance of the red billed gull at the kaikoura peninsula new zealand and related these to changes in climate oceanography and the availability of the planktonic euphausiid nyctiphanes australis the bird s principal food in the population began to decline and between and it was reduced by adult non breeders comprised an average of of the population between and but following the decline they averaged only the age at recruitment changed markedly following the population decline of year old males bred for the first time prior to the decline whereas the corresponding figure after the decline was the proportion of females commencing to breed as a year old was not significantly different before or after the decline an increase in the availability of euphausiids increased the likelihood of breeding and the recruitment of young individuals caused earlier laying and resulted in an increase in the condition of adults egg volume of gulls laying two egg clutches clutch size and fledging success the relationship between food availability and the number of pairs that bred laying date clutch size and fledging success was significantly different prior to and after the population decline the underlying cause appears to be a compensatory density dependent mechanism that reduced interspecific competition for food the relative abundance of n australis was correlated positively with the southern oscillation index soi and the frequency of occurrence of ne winds the proportion of non breeders and mean laying date were correlated negatively with the soi and mean egg volume of two egg clutches correlated positively with the soi these results emphasize that availability of adult euphausiids is critical for red billed gulls we hypothesize that high primary productivity of inshore water near kaikoura in winter linked to a stable water column of coastal water and upwelling of additional dissolved inorganic nutrients increases the availability of adult euphausiids to the red billed gull as long as the coastal water is not replaced by offshore subtropical water intrusions of warmer low nutrient water,Journal of Animal Ecology,,the impact of climate fluctuation on food availability and reproductive performance of the planktivorous red billed gull larus novaehollandiae scopulinus

territorial behavior is expected to buffer populations against short term environmental perturbations but we have found that group living in african lions causes a complex response to long term ecological change despite numerous gradual changes in prey availability and vegetative cover regional populations of serengeti lions remained stable for to year periods and only shifted to new equilibria in sudden leaps although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories regional lion populations did not expand until short term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young the results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern of saltatory equilibria results from the lions grouping behavior,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",,ecological change group territoriality and population dynamics in serengeti lions

previous reports described an increase in population density following the removal of adult and subadult male black bears ursus americanus from a km study area near cold lake alberta the clsa this finding plays a central role in continuing debates over population regulation in bears but has been criticized because density estimates were based on assumptions that were not met moreover subsequent discussion has been predicated on conjecture that human exploitation had minimal influence on population dynamics we used improved methods of mark recapture and survival analysis with a combination of new and previously published data to resolve these issues jolly seber estimates suggest numbers of females using the clsa were relatively stable from to then more than doubled when males were captured and euthanized during numbers remained high until when they declined abruptly similarly numbers of subadult males captured annually increased disproportionately in and remained high until when they also declined changes in numbers of subadult males captured indicated changes in local density because they were not caused by changes in capture or settling rates these findings support previous descriptions of trends in bear density at cold lake however survival records of bears radiomarked during revealed heavier exploitation than previously suspected annual mortality rates of radiomarked bears ranged from to and humans caused at least of observed deaths consequently an underlying assumption of previous interpretationsthat the cold lake bear population was naturally regulated near carrying capacity no longer seems reasonable our results suggest that adult males deterred bears in other sex age groups from using the clas however we found no evidence that birth or death rates were affected thus the observed increase in local density should no be construed as a density dependent response abrupt changes in local density might not have occurred if males had been removed from a larger area encompassing the clsa,Ursus,,demographic response of black bears at cold lake alberta to the removal of adult males

wolf canis lupus relationships with wild ungulates domestic animals and humans were studied in an area of ca km at the head of the lovat river in northeastern belarus during the region was dominated by natural habitats consisting mainly of forests and bogs but also lakes and rivers the abundance of wild ungulates such as moose alces alces wild boar sus scrofa and roe deer capreolus capreolus as censused by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens declined to fold between and most probably due to uncontrolled exploitation and poaching during the numbers of ungulates began to recover wolves responded to the shortage of wild ungulates by a strong shift in feeding habits when wild ungulates were numerous wolf diet as studied by scat analysis was composed of wild ungulates of consumed biomass with small additions of medium and small sized wild animals mainly beaver castor fiber and hare lepus sp and domestic animals mainly cattle in the years when the recorded numbers of wild ungulates were at their lowest wolves preyed on domestic animals of biomass consumed wild ungulates and medium and small sized wild prey wolf damage to domestic animals head of cattle and dogs killed and wolf human interaction observations of wolves in and near villages including one attack by a rabid wolf on people were recorded in villages the rate of wolf predation on domestic animals and their appearances in villages increased exponentially with the declining biomass of wild ungulates and ceased again when wild ungulates began to recover a one year time lag in wolf response to changes in ungulate abundance was observed the numbers of wolves as estimated by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens played a weaker role in shaping wolf livestock and wolf human interaction the wolf population was strongly affected by hunting during the study wolves responded numerically with a to year time lag to the varying intensity of harvest by humans our study showed the role of the human factor in shaping wolf numbers and wolf livestock interaction in eastern europe the three major components of this relationship were the manifold decline in wild ungulate abundance which was most probably caused by uncontrolled exploitation by humans in the years of political transformation and economic regress made wolves shift to predation on domestic animals inevitably wolves were frequently seen in the rural areas people interpreted the growing rates of wolf damage and appearances near the settlements as an effect of greatly increasing numbers of wolves and demanded that authorities and hunters fight the wolf plague hunting impact on wolves increased and led to a marked reduction in wolf numbers and a decline in wolf human conflicts this scenario was most probably repeated in many areas of eastern europe during which was a decade of political and economical transformation from a management perspective we suggested that predation levels and wolf human conflicts could be reduced not only by increased wolf harvest but also by enhancing the density and diversity of wild ungulates,Wildlife Biology,,wolf canis lupus numbers diet and damage to livestock in relation to hunting and ungulate abundance in northeastern belarus during

invasive mammalian predators such as rats are now widespread on islands but hypotheses about their effects have rarely been tested circumstantial evidence from new zealand indicates that when introduced to islands pacific rats rattus exulans have negative effects on endemic plants invertebrates birds and reptiles including the tuatara sphenodon punctatus we tested the effects of pacific rats on tuatara by comparing the demographic structure and body condition of tuatara populations on three islands before and after removal of rats and on a fourth island where rats remained in the presence of rats juvenile tuatara constituted on average of the sample tuatara populations when pacific rats were removed after at least years occupancy the proportion of juvenile tuatara increased to fold and body condition of adult males and females also improved sometimes dramatically we predict that unless pacific rats are removed from taranga island the tuatara population will collapse because of low population density and the lack of juvenile recruitment our results demonstrate that when invasive species exert subtle effects on recruitment and body condition the effects on populations of long lived endemic species may only become apparent long after the invasion,Conservation Biology,,responses of tuatara sphenodon punctatus to removal of introduced pacific rats from islands
predation upon ungulates is generally considered to have a stronger regulatory effect on sedentary than migratory populations with migratory populations maintaining higher densities the blue wildebeest connochaetus taurinus is a migratory species that has suffered a general decline in numbers and distribution across its species range wildebeest suffer from a fragmented distribution together with isolation of populations in closed reserves preventing migratory movements and potentially allowing predators to benefit from a captive prey resource in pilanesberg national park south africa the declining blue wildebeest population from in to in is sedentary because the park ha is completely enclosed by fencing this population was used to model the potential effects of predation and harvesting the pilanesberg population was then compared with other wildebeest populations in southern africa the model outputs demonstrated that increased levels of predation by lions panthera leo on a captive population of prey such as wildebeest in combination with regular harvesting by park managers can drive the population towards extinction at lower levels of predation some other factor needs to act in combination with predation to drive the population into a decline during our study the lion biomass density in pilanesberg was almost three times greater than that predicted by regression models of the stable relationship between lion and prey biomass densities across african savannas furthermore the ratio of lion numbers to prey numbers was substantially higher than in most other african reserves synthesis and applications in african savannas artificial closed systems provide advantages to large predators if wildlife cropping schemes are implemented in such systems without careful monitoring and regulation of large predators then ungulate populations can decline more rapidly than managers expect,Journal of Applied Ecology,,modelling wildebeest population dynamics implications of predation and harvesting in a closed system
in a sudden mass occurrence of snake pipefish entelurus aequoreus took place in the northeastern atlantic and the abundance has been increasing since before snake pipefish were mainly found in coastal areas and have been reported only occasionally in oceanic waters the oceanic form lives free in the water column while the coastal form is found among sea weeds or in sea grass beds abundance indices numbers per hour fishing from inshore surveys have remained at the same level while those from offshore surveys show a very strong increase since the length distributions differ significantly between surveys with coastal snake pipefishes being larger although the outward appearance of the coastal pipefishes seems different from the pelagic specimens no differences were found when comparing taxonomic features apart from appearance the habitat is different for the two types of snake pipefish the oceanic specimens of snake pipefish are much leaner than the coastal specimens stomach contents of the oceanic snake pipefishes revealed remains of relatively small calanoids mean length mm the calanoid population has recently changed and is nowadays dominated by the smaller calanus helgolandicus here we put forward the hypothesis that the sudden appearance of the snake pipefish in the deeper waters is a result of the change in the average lengths of calanoids which in turn is caused by changes in the hydroclimatic environment the mass occurrence of the snake pipefish is affecting the ecosystem seabirds are feeding their chicks with them and they are also found in stomachs of fish and sea mammals,Journal of Sea Research,,mass occurrence of snake pipefish in the northeast atlantic result of a change in climate

achieving maximum productivity in remnant populations of black rhinoceros is crucial to the persistence of this species it was therefore investigated whether the black rhino population of pilanesberg national park had become regulated by resource limitation years after introduction in inter calving intervals which are not restricted to yearly time increments due to asynchronous reproduction decreased with an increase in rainfall while the percentage of male calves born increased with increasing rainfall the percentage of reproductive cows achieving maternal success increased with increasing density until rhinos km after which it decreased this positive relationship at low densities is largely due to changes in the female age structure and the adult female male ratio the age at first calving tended to increase with increasing density while mortality was not related to rainfall or density it is concluded that the pilanesberg black rhino population is showing the first signs of density dependence it is proposed that black rhino conservators should monitor the percentage of cows achieving maternal success to detect early indications of density dependent resource limitation and use this as a criteria for decisions regarding metapopulation management,Animal Conservation,,dynamics of a protected black rhino diceros bicornis population pilanesberg national park south africa

the study was conducted between and at one of the most important stopover sites for waders migrating along the southern baltic coast everyday counts and trapping were performed between mid july and the end of september this period covered almost the whole period of adult migration and a little more than a half of the total period of passage of juveniles the majority of adults passed the study area between mid july and the third decade of august after this period adults were still observed among migrated dunlins but their number was rather small in all seasons except second year dunlins migrated earlier than older birds however migration periods of both groups overlapped to a large extent first juveniles were recorded among migrating dunlins as early as in the second decade of july they belonged to the baltic subspecies c a schinzii the number of juveniles showed conspicuous increase not earlier than in the last decade of august when birds of c a alpina arrived the intra seasonal changes in numbers of adults and juveniles showed a clear wavy structure two waves seem to be the most common pattern of juvenile migration in the baltic area different factors which might influence the observed variation of migration patterns are discussed among them the most important aspects seem to be differences in migration timing between adult males and females and different geographical populations also local environmental conditions and weather situation on a route preceding a particular study site might influence the migration timing,Ring,,autumn migration dynamics of the dunlin calidris alpina at the reda mouth southern baltic
background man induced mortality of birds caused by electrocution with poorly designed pylons and power lines has been reported to be an important mortality factor that could become a major cause of population decline of one of the world rarest raptors the spanish imperial eagle aquila adalberti consequently it has resulted in an increasing awareness of this problem amongst land managers and the public at large as well as increased research into the distribution of electrocution events and likely mitigation measures methodology principal findings we provide information of how mitigation measures implemented on a regional level under the conservation program of the spanish imperial eagle have resulted in a positive shift of demographic trends in spain a years temporal data set on mortality of spanish imperial eagle was recorded including population censuses and data on electrocution and non electrocution of birds additional information was obtained from radio tracked young eagles and specific field surveys data were divided into two periods before and after the approval of a regional regulation of power line design in which established mandatory rules aimed at minimizing or eliminating the negative impacts of power lines facilities on avian populations our results show how population size and the average annual percentage of population change have increased between the two periods whereas the number of electrocuted birds has been reduced in spite of the continuous growing of the wiring network conclusions our results demonstrate that solving bird electrocution is an affordable problem if political interest is shown and financial investment is made the combination of an adequate spatial planning with a sustainable development of human infrastructures will contribute positively to the conservation of the spanish imperial eagle and may underpin population growth and range expansion with positive side effects on other endangered species,PLoS ONE,,solving man induced large scale conservation problems the spanish imperial eagle and power lines
the common hippopotamus hippopotamus amphibius can significantly influence the dynamics of ecosystems and engender serious conflicts with people but in kenya one of the species strongholds it has been little studied or monitored we surveyed the hippopotamus population in the masai mara national reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in using foot counts along km of the main rivers we counted hippopotamuses in schools comparisons with earlier surveys suggest that this population increased by between and within the reserve and although it did not increase within the reserve during long dash it increased by outside the reserve during this period against a background of deteriorating habitat conditions the overall density in was hippopotamuses km of river equivalent to a biomass of kg km of river the ratio of calves to adults was inside the reserve outside the reserve and along tributaries of the mara river implying that the population is either increasing or that its spatial distribution is being compressed because of range contraction the apparent increase in the hippopotamus population contrasts with marked contemporaneous declines in the populations of most other large mammalian herbivore species in the reserve we discuss possible reasons underlying the increase in the hippopotamus population,Oryx,,population trend and distribution of the vulnerable common hippopotamus hippopotamus amphibius in the mara region of kenya
a population of common musk turtles sternotherus odoratus was studied in georgian bay ontario near the northern limit of the species range during the summers of a total of adult males adult females and juveniles turtles were captured marked measured and released over the geographic range of s odorutus there was a positive relationship between body size and latitude the musk turtles of the georgian bay population being significantly larger than those in any of the more southerly populations the sex ratio was significantly male biased and the study population was unique in having sexual size dimorphism with significantly larger males we have hypothesized that this dimorphism has arisen through sexual selection that is being driven by the male biased sex ratio male male competition for mates is intensified and thereby selects for larger males proximately biased sex ratios and sexual size dimorphism in turtles have been attributed to differential ages and sizes at sexual maturity however we found no support for this hypothesis in our population we have attributed sexual size dimorphism to either differential growth rates after maturity or differential mortality of adults the male biased sex ratio may be due to differential movement patterns differential mortality of the sexes or the effects of ambient temperature on sex determination,Canadian Journal of Zoology,,demography sex ratio and sexual size dimorphism in a northern population of common musk turtles sternotherus odoratus

size based indicators have emerged as useful tools to analyze the status of fisheries which lack fishery dependent data over long time series such as many coral reef fisheries in this study we calculate a number of size based indicators for the haitian fishery at the remote navassa island where a reef fish visual census rvc data set is available over an year study period we also calculate the slope of the size spectrum indicator within a bayesian framework which allows for potential biases inherent in the rvc method to be accounted for in credibility intervals around parameter estimates results of our analyses suggest that stocks targeted by traps declined from to followed by a period of increase from to the slope of the size spectrum declined from to and remained constant for the remainder of the study period and this pattern was driven by a decrease in abundance of larger species targeted by hook and line analysis of the lmax spectrum also indicated a decrease in the occurrence rates of larger species throughout the study period our methods can be applied to fisheries in other areas where limited fishery independent data and no fishery dependent data are available,Fisheries Research,,inferring trends in a small scale data limited tropical fishery based on fishery independent data
the ebro delta is a wetland area in which natural ecosystems have been partially replaced by rice fields this mixed and productive landscape has allowed the establishment of a rich community of organisms the viperine snake natrix maura has traditionally been a common and abundant predator because the habitat is favorable and prey availability is high in june we conducted a demographic study to evaluate relative densities of snakes in the rice fields thirteen years later we repeated the same study in the same area and season the field work consisted of censuses of one hectare each and snakes and their potential prey green frogs and fish were counted in we found snakes animals ha these occupying of the sites frogs and fish were observed in of the censuses in no snakes were found and frogs and fish appeared in only of the samples in we also prospected sites in rice fields located next to the natural lagoons at these sites we detected a greater number of snakes of the stations several factors can explain the clear decline of the n maura population in the ebro delta rice fields the transformation and degradation of the habitat the increase in population densities of natural predators such as herons the decrease in prey availability the massive use of pollutants in the rice fields and snake death on local roads and directly by human persecution we propose that a combined effect of these factors has caused the alarming decline of this predator the observation of water snakes in rice fields near natural lagoons indicates that protected natural areas act as natural refuges for fauna with reduced mobility such as viperine snakes the recovery of the n maura population in the rice fields of the ebro delta depends on an integral change in agricultural management including the reduced use of pollutants the recovery of snake prey and the maintenance of favorable habitats to prevent predation,Acta Herpetologica,,decline of a common reptile case study of the piperine snake natrix maura in a mediterranean wetland

cyclic population dynamics is relatively common among populations of small mammals in high latitudes but is not yet established among african savanna ungulates however oscillations may be expected in large mammal populations subject to quasi periodic oscillations in regional rainfall we evaluated evidence for environmentally entrained oscillations in a large mammal predator prey system in kruger national park knp south africa where rainfall exhibits quasi periodic oscillations the evaluation is based on analysis of comparative changes in the abundance of twelve ungulate species throughout south africa s knp using population counts over the period we present evidence suggesting that i twelve ungulate populations display cyclic variability with half periods ranging between and years ii this variability was associated with lagged rainfall between and years back in the past for different ungulate species and iii the ungulate species respond in contrasting ways to rainfall with some reaching highest abundance during periods of low rainfall and others under conditions of high rainfall these findings are not consistent with the response pattern we would expect if the population oscillations were driven directly by the rainfall influence on food availability instead they seem to be an outcome of predator prey interactions which are entrained by the effect of rainfall on habitat conditions affecting the relative susceptibility of the different ungulate species to predation,African Journal of Ecology,,oscillations in large mammal populations are they related to predation or rainfall

censusing wild populations and detecting trends in population size over time is an important task in the conservation and management of wildlife we compared two methods used to monitor numbers of chamois rupicapra rupicapra and r pyrenaica in two contrasting populations and explored the relationship between the sampling effort and the repeatability of the results using resampling methods one population in the alps had been stable at a high density for several years whereas the other population located in the pyrenees was increasing exponentially following a reintroduction in both sites a long term monitoring programme based on individually marked chamois allowed us to estimate population size using capture mark recapture methods cmr in addition we calculated an index of population size as the mean number of animals observed on a foot transect surveyed repeatedly we then compared whether trends estimated by each method were consistent in the increasing population both the index and the cmr estimates revealed an exponential increase in population size in the stable population neither the index nor the cmr estimate revealed any trend in size consistent results between the index and the cmr suggest that the index could be used to monitor trends in population size resampling techniques however pointed out that the index is only reliable when calculated over a sufficient number of surveys per year in the pyrenees three in the alps and over a sufficient number of years of monitoring about five years,Wildlife Biology,,how reliable are total counts to detect trends in population size of chamois rupicapra rupicapra and r pyrenaica
effective management of ungulates requires regular estimates of population abundance but these are often expensive and hard to obtain we therefore examined if change in ratio cir estimation methods in combination with age and sex specific data on moose alces alces observed and killed could be a cheap alternative for estimating moose abundance in norway we used the large number of moose observations reported by moose hunters and estimated pre harvest adult population size based on annual changes in adult sex ratio similarly we estimated annual recruitment rate based on the proportion of calves observed during the hunting season the harvest rate and the natural mortality rate based on variation in recruitment rate and harvest rate during annual variation in abundance was correlated with two of three independent indices of moose density indicating that the cir methods provide relatively precise estimates of abundance similarly the estimated average natural mortality rate was similar to natural mortality rates of radio collared moose in scandinavia and the estimated abundance was close to what we expected based on the annual harvest however large annual variation in estimated rates of natural mortality indicated that over and underestimation of population abundance occurred for some years this was likely due to the fact that harvesting occurred during periods of moose observations because we had no independent estimates of abundance we were unable to estimate the bias hence we concluded that variation in cir abundance is a sensitive index of moose density but that more studies are needed to determine the accuracy of cir estimates as measurements of abundance future studies should focus on smaller populations with independent estimates on abundance and base cir estimation on changes in sex ratio within the hunting season to reduce the number of possible confounding effects,Wildlife Biology,,change in sex ratio as an estimator of population size for norwegian moose alces alces
we identify fishery management implications from a long term monitoring program focusing on spawning aggregations of high valued reef fish in komodo national park knp eastern indonesia management objectives of knp are not only to protect biodiversity but also to conserve spawning stocks of high valued commercial species for the replenishment of surrounding fishing grounds we monitored two sites twice monthly over five years for two species of grouper epinephelus fuscoguttatus and plectropomus areolatus one site had an aggregation of both e fuscoguttatus and p areolatus whereas the other site contained an aggregation of p areolatus only over the five years monitoring period aggregations typically formed during each full moon between september and february additionally p areolatus occasionally aggregated during new moons between april and july we observed spawning only once but because formation of aggregations were correlated to a higher incidence of behavior and signs indicative of reproduction and because most fish present were adults it is likely that the formation of aggregations was associated with spawning over the five years monitoring period there was a reduction in mean fish size of up to cm for p areolatus and a reduction in numbers of aggregating e fuscoguttatus despite limited protection initiated in both sites are still heavily fished by local artisanal fishers because the observed reductions in size and in numbers could be caused by fishing pressure managers should follow the precautionary principle by putting additional protective management in place since both species are relatively long lived at least five years of continued monitoring may be necessary to determine the outcome of management intervention the variability in timing of aggregation in respect to season and moon phase in p areolatus indicates that long term monitoring must cover the entire year and both moon phases,Environmental Biology of Fishes,,aggregations of plectropomus areolatus and epinephelus fuscoguttatus groupers serranidae in the komodo national park indonesia monitoring and implications for management

most scenarios for future climate change predict increased variability and thus increased frequency of extreme weather events to predict impacts of climate change on wild populations we need to understand whether this translates into increased variability in demographic parameters which would lead to reduced population growth rates even without a change in mean parameter values this requires robust estimates of temporal process variance for example in survival and identification of weather covariates linked to interannual variability the european shag phalacrocorax aristotelis l shows unusually large variability in population size and large scale mortality events have been linked to winter gales we estimated first year second year and adult survival based on years of ringing and dead recovery data from the isle of may scotland using recent methods to quantify temporal process variance and identify aspects of winter weather linked to survival survival was highly variable for all age groups and for second year and adult birds process variance declined strongly when the most extreme year was excluded survival in these age groups was low in winters with strong onshore winds and high rainfall variation in first year survival was not related to winter weather and process variance although high was less affected by extreme years a stochastic population model showed that increasing process variance in survival would lead to reduced population growth rate and increasing probability of extinction as in other cormorants shag plumage is only partially waterproof presumably an adaptation to highly efficient underwater foraging we speculate that this adaptation may make individuals vulnerable to rough winter weather leading to boom and bust dynamics where rapid population growth under favourable conditions allows recovery from periodic large scale weather related mortality given that extreme weather events are predicted to become more frequent species such as shags that are vulnerable to such events are likely to exhibit stronger reductions in population growth than would be expected from changes in mean climate vulnerability to extreme events thus needs to be accounted for when predicting the ecological impacts of climate change,Journal of Animal Ecology,,the demographic impact of extreme events stochastic weather drives survival and population dynamics in a long lived seabird

individual species phenologies can play an important role in the structure of lizard assemblages over short time scales data from a pitfall study carried out in the dry chaco of argentina were used to address the question of how species are distributed in their assemblage through time lizard activity and species richness were highest in the spring breeding season and declined in the cool months of the year variations in seasonal activity patterns and reproductive chronology resulted in significantly different distributions of species in every sample month not only did the species composition of the assemblage change through time but the mean size of lizards and the proportions of males females and juveniles varied significantly for several species large lizards regardless of species disappeared from the assemblage during the cool dry winter while juveniles of the large species remained active year round adults of the smallest species were also active throughout the year we propose an hypothesis based on thermoregulatory constraints of lizard body size to account for these patterns an approach focusing on the energetics and physiological ecology of individual species would be fruitful in understanding the dynamics of fluctuating lizard communities,Journal of Herpetology,,phenology of a lizard assemblage in the dry chaco of argentina

the modes of intrasexual competition interacting in many dispersed societies of nocturnal solitary foragers are still poorly understood in this study we investigate the spatial structure within a free living population of gray mouse lemurs microcebus murinus in order to test for the first time the predictions from two contrasting models of male intrasexual competition on the population level the contest competition model predicts an uneven distribution of the sexes in a population nucleus with a female biased sex ratio in the center and a male biased sex ratio in the periphery in contrast the scramble competition model predicts males and females being distributed evenly throughout their habitat with a constant sex ratio nine capture recapture periods within three consecutive mating seasons revealed a continuous male biased sex ratio in the adult population with even trapping rates for the sexes the male biased sex ratio could either be explained with postnatal female biased mortality or with a male biased natal sex ratio this male biased sex ratio was apparent in all parts of the study site indicating that the population was not subdivided into a female biased core and a male biased periphery furthermore the majority of adult males have been captured at the same as or in vicinity to females consequently a large proportion of males had spatial access to females during the mating season no signs of monopolization of females by certain dominant males could be detected these data support the predictions from the scramble competition model and the concept of a promiscuous mating system for this species,Primates,,contest versus scramble competition for mates the composition and spatial structure of a population of gray mouse lemurs microcebus murinus in north west madagascar

many studies have focused on the effects of anthropogenic habitat alterations on animals but little attention has been given to the effects of natural changes in habitat the purpose of our study was to examine the effects of flooding caused by beaver castor canadensis dams on the spatial ecology of the federally endangered spotted turtle clemmys guttata in a bog in ontario that was historically drained for peat extraction we hypothesized that home range sizes and daily distances traveled would be greater after flooding and that habitat selection would change because turtles would exploit the increase in aquatic habitats post flooding using years of mark recapture data radio telemetry and gis software we compared movements and habitat selection before and after flooding distances traveled and home range sizes were larger post flood compared to pre flood conditions indicating that turtles were opportunistically exploring the new aquatic habitat during pre flooding turtles primarily selected the drainage ditches created to facilitate peat extraction these were the only aquatic habitat available after flooding there was a strong preference for newly flooded areas and drainage ditches showing that turtles exploited the increase in available aquatic habitat our findings indicate that natural habitat alteration resulting from beaver dam flooding may be beneficial for spotted turtles although observations also suggest that nesting habitat may be limited due to the flooding and further research is needed to determine the effect of the flooding on recruitment into the population,Copeia,,the effects of flooding on the spatial ecology of spotted turtles clemmys guttata in a partially mined peatland

the bermuda petrel pterodroma cahow was thought to have become extinct early in the th century due to a combination of hunting by human colonists and predation by introduced rats cats dogs and pigs however single individuals were found on four occasions during the first half of the th century and in a small population was discovered breeding on several rocky islets in north east bermuda recovery actions began in when the population numbered just pairs dispersed among five small islets although rats extirpated one of these five colonies in the population has grown steadily to breeding pairs in we investigated the breeding phenology productivity and population size of the bermuda petrel between and each year the birds began arriving in bermuda around mid october they departed on a prebreeding exodus between november and december returning after days to lay a single egg between december and january eggs hatched from february to march after a mean sd incubation period of days and young fledged from may to june after a mean fledging period of days between and reproductive output ranged from to fledglings per annum mean annual breeding success was reasonably high relative to other procellariiformes largely due to the provision of artificial concrete nesting burrows in the population numbered breeding pairs monitoring since indicates the population has been increasing exponentially doubling approximately every years this rate of increase together with the increased incidence of storm damage is making it progressively more impracticable to construct sufficient concrete burrows on the current nesting islets to accommodate all breeding pairs the vulnerability of these sites to accelerating storm damage and erosion as a result of anthropomorphic climate change is now the greatest threat to the bermuda petrel,Bird Conservation International,,breeding biology and population increase of the endangered bermuda petrel pterodroma cahow
long term monitoring of small mammal populations is very important to understand the variations in temporal abundance on a large time scale which are related to ecological economic and epidemiological phenomena the aim of this study is to monitor the populations of the marsupials didelphis aurita and philander frenatus and the rodents nectomys squamipes akodon cursor and oligorysomys nigripes in a locality of typical brazilian rural landscape sumidouro municipality rio de janeiro state brazil a mark recapture study was conducted during five years we analyzed the population dynamics the reproduction and age structure of these species both marsupials presented higher population sizes in the end of wet period and beginning of the dry period which can be explained by the seasonal reproduction which begins in the middle of the dry period and ends in the last months of the wet period n squamipes reproduced throughout the year but mostly during rainy periods due to the close association of this rodent to resources found in the water higher survivorship and recruitment rates were in the end of the wet season the rodent a cursor had an opportunist reproduction resulting in high turnover rates survivorship increased with the effects of the dry periods o nigripes showed a clear annual pattern of population cycle with peaks during the dry season the rodents did not show potential to present outbreaks and become agricultural pests the annual population cycles of o nigripes and the unique peak of a cursor population during five years highlight attention to their importance as wild reservoirs of the hantavirus disease their ecological characteristics associated to their opportunistic behavior make these species prone to be good reservoirs of zoonoses deutsche gesellschaft fur saugetierkunde,Mammalian Biology,,a long term study of small mammal populations in a brazilian agricultural landscape
the massive reductions in amphibian populations taking place across the globe are unprecedented in modern times within the neotropics the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon however recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in central america are waning as well unfortunately very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical america here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the central amazon sampled first in and again in we find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of years at this site this conclusion differs markedly from the decline of in amphibian popu lations over years at a lowland site in costa rica to explore potential declines in lowland neotropical amphibian populations in detail we suggest that existing baseline data be comprehensively compiled and analyzed for previously sampled sites and that these sites be re sampled using comparable methodologies,Biodiversity and Conservation,,a note on amphibian decline in a central amazonian lowland forest
in the s there were large increases in the numbers of swift terns thalasseus bergii breeding in the western and eastern cape provinces of south africa which are most plausibly attributed to good recruitment and to an increase in the proportion of mature birds breeding numbers increased coincidentally with a greatly increased abundance of two of the main prey species of swift terns sardine sardinops sagax and anchovy engraulis encrasicolus and remained high as these resources decreased after numbers of swift terns breeding in the north and central portions of the western cape decreased whereas numbers breeding farther south in that province increased this followed displacements to the south and east of sardine and anchovy in southern africa swift terns show low fidelity to breeding localities which enables a rapid adjustment of the location of breeding to an altered availability of prey for two seabirds that feed mainly on sardine and anchovy but once breeding show high fidelity to colonies african penguin spheniscus demersus and cape gannet morus capensis proportions breeding in the south and east also increased but there were substantial decreases in overall numbers breeding in the western cape,Progress in Oceanography,,a recent increase of swift terns thalasseus bergii off south africa the possible influence of an altered abundance and distribution of prey

abstract this study represents the first attempt to study the population dynamics of guiana dolphins sotalia guianensis by evaluating a set of demographic parameters the population of the caravelas river estuary eastern brazil was systematically monitored through a long term mark recapture experiment abundance estimates revealed a small population dolphins comprised of resident dolphins and individuals that temporarily leave or pass through the study area temporary emigration from the estuary to adjacencies gamma se and return rate gamma were moderate and constant indicating that some dolphins use larger areas survival rate ud se and abundance were constant throughout the study period power analysis showed that the current monitoring effort has high probability of detecting abrupt population declines beta although the monitoring is not yet sensitive to subtle population trends sufficient time to identify them is feasible additional yr despite such apparent stability this population as many others inhabits waters exposed to multiple human related threats open and closed population modeling applied to photo identification data provide a robust baseline for estimating several demographic parameters and can be applied to other populations to allow further comparisons such synergistic efforts will allow a reliable definition of conservation status of this species,Marine Mammal Science,,assessing population parameters and trends of guiana dolphins sotalia guianensis an eight year mark recapture study
we estimated the minimum size of the roan antelope hippotragus equinus popula tion in the parc national de l akagera in rwanda to be at least animals based on a two and a half year study of individually recognized stable social groups data from the same study were used to estimate the annual birth rate and the survival rate of male calves female calves adult females and juvenile females and to identify factors which would result in year to year variations in survival the results of this analysis were incorporated into an age structured model of the population s dynamics which took account of demographic and environmental stochasticity this model was then used to determine the viability of the roan population in the park and to identify demographic characteristics whose occurrence could be used to predict when the population was most at risk of extinction the risk of extinction could be predicted if the number of stable groups within the park was monitored in september of each year this risk could be greatly reduced if a reciprocal arrangement was established with other protected areas such that the population in the park could be reinforced with new stable groups when the number of stable groups fell below three however the risks particularly of disease transfer associated with such reinforcement programmes should be clearly recognized,Biological Conservation,,assessing the risks of extinction for local populations of roan antelope hippotragus equinus

at sub antarctic marion island there was substantial correlation in the numbers of adults breeding at study colonies of macaroni penguins eudyptes chrysolophus over years as there was also for eastern rockhopper e chrysocome filholi over years suggesting that overwintering conditions may influence the proportions of birds breeding for both species the time of arrival of females for breeding and for rockhopper penguins the mass of females on arrival was significantly related to breeding success therefore overwintering conditions may also affect breeding success trends in breeding success between study colonies were more strongly correlated for macaroni penguins than for rockhopper penguins macaroni penguins have a greater foraging range than rockhopper penguins when breeding and may be more influenced at this stage by wider scale environmental phenomena for macaroni penguins breeding success was significantly correlated with mass of chicks at fledging for both species mass on arrival of males was significantly correlated with that of females although both species had low masses on arrival after the el nino southern oscillation event of there was no significant correlation in mass on arrival between the two species it is likely that at marion island their overwintering grounds are different,CCAMLR Science,,breeding numbers and success of eudyptes penguins at marion island and the influence of mass and time of arrival of adults

most studies examining effects of marine protected areas mpas on fish assemblages are potentially confounded either because they are once off comparisons between fished and unfished locations or because they are snapshot studies over a fixed period here we compare long term changes within fully protected tasmanian marine reserves with changes at external reference sites on an annual basis over the first ten years of protection the results highlight the importance of long term datasets for differentiating changes occurring over differing time scales notable results include a statistically significant increase in abundance of latridopsis forsteri and large fish n mm when examined across all reserves relative to controls and a fold increase in the abundance of large fish and a doubling of per site species richness of large fish within the tinderbox marine reserve relative to controls short term resident species that recruit sporadically show very different patterns in reserves compared to those that recruit regularly and have long term age class storage while several recent reviews have suggested size of mpas and duration of protection has little influence on the extent of recovery our results suggest this is not the case and that responses can be slow complex and species specific the extent of localised fishing pressure appeared to have a substantial influence on the degree of change detected potentially confounding meta analyses of recovery rates in mpas if overlooked as a relevant parameter,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,changes in fish assemblages following years of protection in tasmanian marine protected areas
in long lived animals with delayed maturity the non breeding component of the population may play an important role in buffering the effects of stochastic mortality populations of colonial seabirds often consist of more than non breeders yet because they spend much of their early life at sea we understand little about their impact on the demographic process using multistate capture mark recapture techniques we analyse a long term data set of individually identifiable common guillemots uria aalge pont to assess factors influencing their immature survival and two stage recruitment process analysis of the distribution of ringed common guillemots during the non breeding season separated by age classes revealed that all age classes were potentially at risk from four major oil spills however the youngest age class years were far more widely spread than birds years old which were more widely spread than birds aged and over therefore the chance of encountering an oil spill was age dependent a year compound survival estimate for juvenile guillemots was weakly negatively correlated with winter sea surface temperature but was not influenced by oil spills non breeder survival did not vary significantly over time in years following four oil spills juvenile recruitment was almost double the value in non oil spill years recent work from skomer island showed a doubling of adult mortality associated with major oil spills which probably reduced competition at the breeding colony allowing increased immature recruitment to compensate for these losses we discuss the implications of compensatory recruitment for assessing the impact of oil pollution incidents,Journal of Animal Ecology,,recruitment and survival of immature seabirds in relation to oil spills and climate variability

an analysis of the results of a year study of the population ecology of juvenile hatchery and wild coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch in the strait of georgia produced new information about the interannual and interseasonal fluctuations in abundance and marine survival a decline in the percentage of hatchery coho salmon was related to declines in hatchery fish abundance and marine survival wild coho salmon abundance was more stable the declining marine survival of hatchery coho salmon appeared to be related to a fixed average date of release from hatcheries and a possibility of earlier prey production the relatively stable abundance of wild coho salmon may relate to a natural trend toward earlier ocean entry dates oscillations in hatchery coho salmon percentage and abundance were related to oscillations in abundance of juvenile pink salmon o gorbuscha the impact of oscillating density affected marine survival of hatchery coho salmon more than that of wild coho salmon marine survival and abundance of hatchery and wild coho salmon in july were positively related to average fork length indicating that growth within the first few months after ocean entry affected marine survival however absolute size was not important as wild coho salmon were consistently smaller than hatchery coho salmon wild coho salmon responded to conditions in the marine ecosystem differently than hatchery coho salmon as relationships among growth survival and abundance were apparent for wild coho salmon earlier in the year than for hatchery fish the length increase between july and september was inversely related to marine survival suggesting that fish that were larger in july grew less and survived better because they were storing more lipids than smaller coho salmon the study indicated that a more experimental management strategy is needed for both hatchery and wild coho salmon,Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,,changes in the population ecology of hatchery and wild coho salmon in the strait of georgia

alpine grouses are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their adaptation to extreme conditions and to their relict distributions in the alps where global warming has been particularly marked in the last half century grouses are also currently threatened by habitat modification and human disturbance and an assessment of the impact of multiple stressors is needed to predict the fate of alpine populations of these birds in the next decades we estimated the effect of climate change and human disturbance on a rock ptarmigan population living in the western italian alps by combining an empirical population modelling approach and stochastic simulations of the population dynamics under the ab climate scenario and two different disturbance scenarios represented by the development of a ski resort through the early appearance of snow free ground in the previous spring had a favorable effect on the rock ptarmigan population probably through a higher reproductive success on the contrary delayed snowfall in autumn had a negative effect possibly due to a mismatch in time to molt to white winter plumage which increases predation risk the regional climate model protheus does not foresee any significant change in snowmelt date in the study area while the start date of continuous snow cover is expected to be significantly delayed the net effect in the stochastic projections is a more or less pronounced depending on the model used decline in the studied population the addition of extra mortality due to collision with ski lift wires led the population to fatal consequences in most projections should these results be confirmed by larger studies the conservation of alpine populations would deserve more attention to counterbalance the effects of climate change the reduction of all causes of death should be pursued through a strict preservation of the habitats in the present area of occurrence,PLoS ONE,,climate change and human disturbance can lead to local extinction of alpine rock ptarmigan new insight from the western italian alps

reintroductions provide a good opportunity to study density dependent population growth as populations can be studied at a range of densities and the change in density is not confounded with environmental conditions an understanding of density dependence is also necessary to predict dynamics of reintroduced populations under different management regimens and assess the extent to which they can be harvested for further reintroductions we monitored a north island saddleback philesturnus rufusater population for years after reintroduction to mokoia a ha island in new zealand that was made suitable for saddlebacks by eradicating introduced norway rats rattus norvegicus we modelled adult and juvenile survival using program mark and modelled numbers of young fledged per pair using proc mixed in sas with individual female as a random factor juvenile survival clearly declined as the population increased and the decline was closely correlated with the number of breeding pairs reproduction also showed a clear decline that was explained by two factors a difference in quality between territories occupied immediately after reintroduction and those occupied later and an overall decline as the number of pairs increased reproduction was also strongly affected by age and this needed to be accounted for when modelling density dependence a stochastic simulation model incorporating these dynamics closely predicted the observed population growth the equilibrium population size was insensitive to density dependence in reproduction but highly sensitive to density dependence in juvenile survival the model is being used to plan management strategies for potential reintroductions of saddlebacks to mainland areas with predator control the species is currently confined to predator free islands and one fenced mainland sanctuary,Journal of Animal Ecology,,density dependent population growth in a reintroduced population of north island saddlebacks

we assessed the effectiveness of an extensive and unprecedented wildlife reduction effort directed at a wide ranging migratory population of geese population reduction efforts that targeted several populations of light geese greater snow geese chen caerulescens atlantica lesser snow geese c c caerulescens and ross s geese c rossii began in in central and eastern north america such efforts were motivated by a broad consensus that abundance of these geese was causing serious ecological damage to terrestrial and salt marsh ecosystems in central and eastern parts of the canadian arctic and subarctic regions along hudson bay starting in february special conservation measures or in the u s a conservation order were added to the respective federal regulations that permitted hunters to take snow geese in parts of canada and the u s and ross s geese in parts of the u s during specified harvest periods outside of the hunting season these measures were accompanied by increase or removal of daily kill and possession limits and by permissions to use previously prohibited equipment for hunting these species in certain regions of the continent the intent was to reduce adult survival through increased hunting mortality which was judged to be the most cost effective approach to reversing population growth our principal goal was to assess the effectiveness of reduction efforts directed at the midcontinent population of lesser snow geese which was thought to be the most serious threat to arctic and subarctic ecosystems of the light goose populations our multiple objectives included the estimation and detection of change in the response measures of total annual harvest harvest rate survival rate and abundance using the hunting period defined as aug to jul as a point of reference we used information about hunter recoveries of leg banded snow geese and estimates of regular season harvest to estimate conservation order harvest and total annual harvest geographic and temporal distribution of recoveries by age class survival and recovery probability and abundance of snow geese each august using lincoln s method we also modeled population growth to infer the form of population response to management efforts toward that end we also proposed a method of estimating conservation order harvest and tested for differences in band reporting rate between canada and the united states overall the balance of evidence favored the conclusion that the midcontinent population has continued to grow during the conservation order although perhaps at a reduced rate we suggest that annual rate of population growth august likely provides the most reliable inference about change in the midcontinent population there was a decline in annual survival probability between these periods from about to about among snow geese from the southern nesting stratum south of n latitude thought to compose about of the midcontinent population however we detected no change in themuch larger northern nesting stratum north of nlatitude where annual survival remained at about from to thus the conclusion that this population continued to increase during the conservation order was largely consistent with the finding that a weighted survival probability for midcontinent snow geese essentially did not change between the period preceding and during the conservation order consistent with high survival rates were low harvest rates which increased from during for northern geese to only during and from to only for southern geese despite the initial increase associated with the conservation order harvest rates declined during the conservation order for geese from both strata we suggest that the higher harvest rate evident for southern geese was related to their earlier fall migration and thus earlier exposure to harvest pressure migration by more abundant northern geese was later and resulted in a higher ratio of geese to hunters additionally there was more harvest of southern geese in areas north of the canadian prairies than there was of northern geese total annual harvest increased due to the conservation order but failed to exceed million adults in any year during the assessment from to harvest of both age classes exceeded million in only of annual harvest periods since the conservation order started these lower than expected harvests of adult snow geese combined with their low harvest rates of ue during the conservation order suggested an august population size in excess of million adult snow geese since we suggest that abundance of midcontinent snow geese was seriously underestimated in the past and that this underestimate may have contributed to an overconfidence with which suggested harvest levels could achieve a goal of reduced survival and population reduction overall all populations of light geese now exceed numbers present when the conservation order was initiated we are confident that the abundance and population growth rate of midcontinent snow geese as well as by ross s and greater snow geese currently exceeds the ability of existing numbers of hunters to exert harvest pressure that is necessary to impose sufficient additivemortality and thus effectively influence population growth it remains unknown howmuch more or how much longer such populations can increase towards carrying capacity which we assume to be determined by the standing crop of arctic foods that they exploit before density dependence can measurably slow the population growth rate estimation of carrying capacity in the large northern nesting stratumis among the key research needs that we propose the situation that has emerged requires a review of perspectives about impacts of midcontinent lesser snow geese in the arctic whether initial goals behind population management are still relevant and whether alternative options from the initial array of management tools should be exercised,Wildlife Monographs,,harvest survival and abundance of midcontinent lesser snow geese relative to population reduction efforts

despite widespread global reports of declining amphibian populations supporting long term census data are few limiting opportunities to study changes in numbers and survival over time however in new zealand for the past years we studied leiopelma pakeka a threatened terrestrial frog that inhabits rocky boulder banks under forest on maud island using night sampling at least annually on two m plots we had captures of individuals on one plot grid on the other grid the mean se number of frogs found per night was on grid and on grid we used capture recapture models to estimate population size proportion of animals remaining beneath the surface and survival rate the mean se population estimate was frogs on grid and on grid over years the estimated population increased on grid and fluctuated on grid some frogs were captured on most sampling visits others less often evidently failing to emerge from cover each visit using a combination of open and closed population models we estimated the mean se proportion remaining underground was on grid and on grid our research represents one of the longest run population studies of any frog and we recorded significant longevity two males reaching and years a female years no significant differences occurred between mean annual survival rates of apparent females and males or between the two sites the number of toes clipped for individual identification had little influence on the return rate once the effect of time of first capture was removed,Austral Ecology,,how has the remnant population of the threatened frog leiopelma pakeka anura leiopelmatidae fared on maud island new zealand over the past years aec
the mathematical and statistical advances in fitting stock assessment models enabled the emergence of the paradigm of integrated analysis which fits all available data to a single model of population dynamics that traditionally has total catch as the only forcing function of the system this approach however allowed us to include in a flexible way the effect of hydrological regime as an additional forcing function we tried to achieve this flexibility by making the annual recruitment rates and spawning biomass adjustable to the attributes of the hydrological cycle data our models showed that these attributes are influential in the population dynamics of brycon hilarii of the northern pantanal and their inclusion in the models allowed best partial fits which considered fits only to the data components length and age compositions cpue of juveniles and adults than the base case without hydrological attributes the best partial fits where obtained when the attributes delay of floods and intensity of floods were forcing the spawning biomass and the annual recruitment respectively indicating that these characteristics of the population may be influenced by specific attributes of the water level the use of integrated modeling contributed with the advancement of population ecology knowledge of rheophilic fish it is recommended that freshwater fisheries management be integrated into the hydrology management,Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries,,hydrological attributes and rheophilic freshwater fish stock assessment
increasing migration into urbanized centers in the solomon islands poses a great threat to adjacent coral reef fisheries because of negative effects on the fisheries and because it further erodes customary management systems parrotfish fisheries are of particular importance because the feeding habits of parrotfish scrape and excavate coral are thought to be critical to the resilience of coral reefs and to maintaining coral reef health within marine protected areas we investigated the ecological impact of localized subsistence and artisanal fishing pressure on parrotfish fisheries in gizo town western solomon islands by analyzing the density and size distribution of parrotfish with an underwater visual census uvc recall diary i e interviews with fishers and creel surveys to independently assess changes in abundance and catch per unit effort cpue over years we then compared parrotfish data from gizo town with equivalent data from sites open to and closed to fishing in kida and nusa hope villages which have different customary management regimes results indicated a gradient of customary management effectiveness parrotfish abundance was greater in customary management areas closed to fishing especially with regard to larger fish sizes than in areas open to fishing the decline in parrotfish abundance from to in gizo was roughly the same magnitude as the difference in abundance decline between inside and outside customary management marine reserves our results highlight how weak forms of customary management can result in the rapid decline of vulnerable fisheries around urbanized regions and we present examples in which working customary management systems kinda and nusa hope can positively affect the conservation of parrotfish and reef fisheries in general in the highly biodiverse coral triangle region,Conservation Biology,,implications of urbanization for artisanal parrotfish fisheries in the western solomon islands

intraspecific competition for restricted food resources is considered to play a fundamental part in density dependence of somatic growth and other population characteristics but studies simultaneously addressing the interrelationships between population density food acquisition and somatic growth have been missing we explored the food consumption and individual growth rates of arctic charr salvelinus alpinus in a long term survey following a large scale density manipulation experiment in a subarctic lake prior to the initiation of the experiment the population density was high and the somatic growth rates low revealing a severely overcrowded and stunted fish population during the year period of stock depletion the population density of arctic charr was reduced with about resulting in an almost twofold increase in food consumption rates and enhanced individual growth rates of the fish over the decade following the density manipulation experiment the population density gradually rose to intermediate levels accompanied by corresponding reductions in food consumption and somatic growth rates the study revealed negative relationships with population density for both food consumption and individual growth rates reflecting a strong positive correlation between quantitative food intake and somatic growth rates both the growth and consumption rate relationships with population density were well described by negative power curves suggesting that large density perturbations are necessary to induce improved feeding conditions and growth rates in stunted fish populations the findings demonstrate that quantitative food consumption represents the connective link between population density and individual growth rates apparently being highly influenced by intraspecific competition for limited resources,Journal of Animal Ecology,,intraspecific competition and density dependence of food consumption and growth in arctic charr
a census of ungulates was carried out in may in the haut niger national park republic of guinea the study site was subdivided into three census blocks in which a total transects total length km were censused once by one observer densities were estimated using distance analysis we observed a total of species of ungulates nine bovidae and one suidae maxwell s duiker cephalophus maxwelli had the highest density individuals km minus sign followed by the red flanked duiker cephalophus rufilatus individuals km minus sign whereas the buffalo syncerus caffer had the lowest density individuals km minus sign compared to a census in the abundance of red flanked and maxwell s duikers significantly decreased by c whereas that of other species remained stable or increased this variation may possibly be explained by a change in the hunting pattern in the area which shifted from large scale hunting by large groups of hunters from outside the area before the park s creation to small scale poaching by local hunters the park includes a diversity of ungulate species and harbours populations of ungulates that are important at both national and regional levels we recommend therefore that the park should be considered a key area for the conservation of ungulates in west africa,Oryx,,large and medium sized ungulates in the haut niger national park republic of guinea population changes
noninvasive genetic monitoring has the potential to estimate vital rates essential for conservation and management of many species in a long term genetic capture mark recapture study using scats we evaluated temporal variation in adult survival in a wolverine gulo gulo population in southern norway in contrast to most previous studies of large mammals we found evidence for negative density dependence in adult survival in this large carnivore both sexes showed the same pattern of density dependence with higher annual survival rates in adult females than males in addition we also found an additive mortality effect of harvesting in the population resulting in the lowest adult survival rates at a combination of high population density and high harvest rate the additive effects of density and harvest on adult survival of wolverines have relevance to the conservation and management of solitary carnivores with strong intrasexual territoriality especially for species where combats among conspecifics can cause serious injury or even mortality,Biological Conservation,,large scale noninvasive genetic monitoring of wolverines using scats reveals density dependent adult survival

specific pathways of the ecological impact of invasive species remain poorly known although the spread of toxic cane toads bufo marinus through tropical australia is widely believed to have caused extensive mortality of native reptiles and mammals effects of toad ingestion on native anurans have been virtually ignored our studies on the adelaide river floodplain show that the most numerous vertebrate victims of toad invasion are native tadpoles that die when they attempt to consume toad eggs we documented episodes of mass mortality totalling tadpoles of species in five waterbodies within a single wet season shortly after the toads invaded a causal link between toad breeding and tadpole mortality is supported by observations that in at least of the waterbodies involved toads bred immediately prior to mortality events water quality was indistinguishable from that of control ponds and tadpoles placed in that water remained healthy dead tadpoles showed no sign of disease and laboratory trials showed rapid mortality in native tadpoles exposed to freshly laid toad eggs despite these high mortality rates toad invasion does not appear to threaten the viability of anuran populations because frogs often breed in ponds not used by toads and because density dependent growth and survival within tadpole communities mean that additional mortality may not reduce the total effective recruitment of metamorph frogs from a waterbody,Biological Conservation,,mass mortality of native anuran tadpoles in tropical australia due to the invasive cane toad bufo marinus

evidence for severe declines in large predatory fishes is increasing around the world because of its long history of intense fishing the mediterranean sea offers a unique perspective on fish population declines over historical timescales we used a diverse set of records dating back to the early th and mid th century to reconstruct long term population trends of large predatory sharks in the northwestern mediterranean sea we compiled time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings scientific surveys and sighting records generalized linear models were used to extract instantaneous rates of change from each data set and a meta analysis was conducted to compare population trends only of the species we considered had sufficient records for analysis hammerhead sphyrna spp blue prionace glauca mackerel isurus oxyrinchus and lamna nasus and thresher sharks alopias vulpinus declined between and relative to their former abundance according to world conservation union iucn criteria these species would be considered critically endangered so far the lack of quantitative population assessments has impeded shark conservation in the mediterranean sea our study fills this critical information gap suggesting that current levels of exploitation put large sharks at risk of extinction in the mediterranean sea possible ecosystem effects of these losses involve a disruption of top down control and a release of midlevel consumers,Conservation Biology,,loss of large predatory sharks from the mediterranean sea
our ecological and environmental program has been monitoring the climate the reproduction and the abundance of several key species of birds mammals and plants on bylot island sirmilik national park nunavut for the past years the main goal of our project is to measure changes occurring in the arctic ecosystems analyse temporal trends and evaluate to what extent these changes may be driven by climate change our results showed that the region surrounding bylot island has been experiencing a strong warming trend over the past three decades these trends were mostly detectable during the spring summer and fall from to oc for that period which is contradictory to gcm models that forecast changes to be more intense during the winter months nonetheless our long term dataset on ecological monitoring of several birds mammals and plants already show some signs of change on bylot island which could be due in part to climate change plant production in wetlands has increased by over the last years most likely a consequence of climate warming climatic variations also appear to be the most important driver of the annual production of several migratory birds such as greater snow geese as warm spring temperature increases their breeding effort and advances their breeding phenology the two lemming species found on bylot island play a key role in the food web as they are the primary prey of most tundra predators their large cyclical fluctuations in annual abundance not only affect their main predators snowy owls and foxes but also indirectly affect other species like geese through shared predator interactions other bird species such as shorebirds longspurs gulls and jaegers are likely to be influenced by fluctuating abundance of lemmings but further studies are needed to investigate this relationship we found evidence that lemming cycles have dampened in recent years and that their abundance during peak years of the cycle is much lower than in the past although this could be linked to the strong warming trend observed in the fall which could lead to poor snow conditions and low overwinter lemming survival more data are needed to test this hypothesis the proportion of fox dens with reproductive activity has decreased over the years possibly a consequence of the low abundance of lemmings recorded recently during peak years of abundance our traditional ecological knowledge study pertaining to snow geese and foxes has shown that elders knowledge can provide complementary information to our monitoring program indeed we found that traditional knowledge on foxes expanded the spatial and temporal scales of our current scientific knowledge our community workshops and public presentations proved to be valuable tools to foster communications and exchanges with the community of pond inlet on ecological studies carried out on bylot island finally we contributed to increase the capacity building of the community through the hiring of several northerners during our field activities,"\\\\ldots report, Centre d' \\\\ldots",,monitoring the environmental and ecological impacts of climate change on bylot island sirmilik national park

the processes of habitat loss and fragmentation are probably the most important threats to biodiversity it is critical that we understand the conservation value of fragments because they may represent opportunities to make important conservation gains particularly for species whose ranges are not in a protected area however our ability to understand the value of fragments for primates is limited by the fact that researchers have conducted many studies in protected areas which do not represent most fragments and studies are typically short term here we determine the long term survival probability of red procolobus pennantii and black and white colobus colobus guereza inhabiting forest fragments outside of kibale national park uganda local communities use the fragments primarily for subsistence agriculture and fuelwood we surveyed primate populations times over yr made a total inventory of all trees times contrasted behavior of groups inhabiting fragment with groups in the continuous forest and judged the conservation value of the fragments by quantifying patterns of forest use by local people of the fragments surveyed supported resident populations of colobus in were cleared in and an additional fragments were cleared by in we counted black and white colobus whereas in and we counted and individuals respectively seven fragments supported red colobus in in and in in we counted red colobus while in we saw individuals for both species activity patterns in continuous forest were similar to those in a fragment with the exception that individuals in the fragment rested more colobus in the fragment ate more mature leaves than colobus in the continuous forest did fragments supported all the fuelwood needs of an average of people who lived immediately adjacent to them and partially supported families up to farms away ca m representing people intensive harvesting for fuelwood occurred when neighboring households engaged in beer brewing an average of of the households gin distilling or charcoal production overall between and the average density of trees declined by trees ha range trees ha if current rates of clearing continue the probability that the fragments will continue to support colobus populations is low,International Journal of Primatology,,population declines of colobus in western uganda and conservation value of forest fragments
the puerto rican terrestrial frog eleutherodactylus coqui has received considerable attention in hawaii because of its rapid spread loud mating calls and its potential threat to native species thus far its invasion potential on the island of hawaii remains poorly understood critical components for determining this potential are robust estimates of abundance and vital rates across habitat types to address this lack of information we used mark recapture methods to estimate e coqui survival and abundance determine growth rates of adult male and female frogs and relate densities to elevation snout vent length svl habitat structure and invertebrate abundance mean adult e coqui density across eight sites was adults m and ranged from adults m our three year mean adult density estimates were three times greater at three of our study sites adults m than the highest long term estimates from puerto rico adults m mean individual growth rates were mm day sd n for males and mm day sd n for females frogs of similar size were found to be growing slower in hawaii than puerto rico we found no relationship between elevation and e coqui density or elevation and svl or between invertebrate abundance and e coqui density however there was a positive relationship between understory structure and e coqui density this relationship suggests that removing understory structure could reduce e coqui densities although other potential implications of this management treatment should be considered,Journal of Herpetology,,population density estimates and growth rates of eleutherodactylus coqui in hawaii
the svalbard breeding population of light bellied brent goose branta bernicla hrota wintering in sites in denmark and at lindisfarne in north east england increased from c in the early s to in the early s the increase was mainly due to years with good breeding success but probably also to improved survival in mild winters thus in cold winters it was observed that mortality of at least first winter birds increased major changes in winter site use were observed during the s the use of the danish wadden sea decreased and in consequence the brent geese arrived earlier at lindisfarne and at the main winter site mariager randers fjords in the course of winter the population now disperses to more sites and new wintering sites have been established in spring the majority of the population is concentrated in two sites in north west jutland in denmark the changed pattern of movement reflects decreases in distribution of zostera food resources and depletion of the remaining resources due to waterfowl grazing which may negatively affect condition of the geese in winter and ultimately survival on the other hand the population is now more dispersed during winter and hence less vulnerable to local environmental pertubations the wider dispersal and changed phenology have several implications for management of the population which are discussed,Biological Conservation,,population development and changes in winter site use by the svalbard light bellied brent goose branta bernicla hrota
understanding the role of feedback structure endogenous processes and exogenous climatic and environmental factors in shaping the dynamics of natural populations is a central challenge within the field of pop ulation ecology we attempted to explain the numerical fluctuations of two sympatric rodent species in agro eco systems of central argentina using royama s theoretical framework for analyzing the dynamics of populations influenced by exogenous climatic forces we found that both rodent species show a first order negative feedback structure suggesting that these populations are regulated by intra specific competition limited by food space or enemy free space in akodon azarae endogenous structure seems to be very strongly influenced by human land use represented by annual minimum normalized difference vegetation index ndvi with spring and summer rainfall having little influence upon carrying capacity calomys venustus population dynamics on the other hand seem to be more affected by local climate also with spring and summer rainfall influencing the carrying capacity of the environment but combined with spring mean temperature,Population Ecology,,population dynamics of two rodent species in agro ecosystems of central argentina intra specific competition land use and climate effects
across the vast boreal forests of north america no population cycles in clethrionomys species occur in eurasia by contrast some clethrionomys populations of the same species undergo regular year cycles we examined the effects of nutrients food competitors predators and climate on population limitation in the northern red backed vole clethrionomys rutilus pallas in the south western yukon to determine why this difference occurs from to we added food reduced large mammal predators and excluded snowshoe hares lepus americanus erxleben from large plots and found that none of these manipulations affected red backed vole abundance adding nutrients as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk fertilizer had a slight negative effect probably acting through a reduction in dwarf shrub productivity caused by competition from grasses we monitored weasel populations directly through trapping and indirectly through snow tracking predation by these vole specialists was irrelevant as a limiting factor most of the time because voles in this area do not reach the densities needed to sustain weasel populations other boreal forest mammal and bird predators did not focus on red backed voles however when red backed vole populations increased in the forest and microtus voles also increased in the meadows weasel populations increased and may have temporarily depressed red backed voles in winter we monitored one major potential food white spruce seeds but seed fall was not related to population changes in red backed voles even after mast years we assessed the impact of weather variables and the average depth of the snow pack during winter october march was correlated directly with vole demography having both direct effects in that year and delayed effects in the following year our long term trapping data indicate that clethrionomys populations fluctuated with peaks following hare peaks by years we propose that the key variable limiting these vole populations is overwinter survival and this is a function of overwinter food from berries produced during the previous summer by dwarf shrubs these shrubs may be stimulated by abundant moisture from winter snows or by periodic fertilization from large quantities of pellets produced at snowshoe hare peaks,Journal of Animal Ecology,,population limitation of the northern red backed vole in the boreal forests of northern canada

we studied both the short and long term effects of density on three life history traits of a red deer population inhabiting a temperate forest both male and female body mass increased when population density decreased but male mass changed to a greater extent than female mass density did not influence female survival irrespective of age however survival of males was lower at high density for all age classes except the prime age class pregnancy rates of primiparous females increased markedly with decreasing density whereas those of adult hinds were fairly constant and unrelated to density for both sexes of the studied life history traits we detected a long term effect of density at birth cohort effect only on body mass these results suggest that density influences life history traits in the same way as factors of environmental variation such as climate in this population we did not find any evidence for an influence of climatic conditions on life history traits of red deer both mild winters and the absence of summer droughts during the study period could account for such an absence of climatic effects we interpreted our results to show that as expected for a highly dimorphic and polygynous species such as red deer male traits showed consistently higher sensitivity to variation in density than female traits illustrating possible costs caused by sexual selection in males the female based eberhardt s model according to which increasing density should sequentially affect juvenile survival reproductive rates of primiparous females reproductive rates of adults and lastly adult survival was only partly supported because we found that pregnancy rate of primiparous females rather than juvenile survival was the most sensitive trait to variation in density we propose that including variation in male traits would improve the accuracy of models of population dynamics of large mammals at least for highly dimorphic species because the population we studied was not fenced we only measured apparent survival we discuss how dispersal in relation to the phenotypic quality of young deer might be a potential regulating factor under such conditions,Ecography,,sex and age dependent effects of population density on life history traits of red deer cervus elaphus in a temperate forest

wildlife agencies typically attempt to manage carnivore numbers in localized game management units through hunting and do not always consider the potential influences of immigration and emigration on the outcome of those hunting practices however such a closed population structure may not be an appropriate model for management of carnivore populations where immigration and emigration are important population parameters the closed population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality will reduce numbers and densities of carnivores and that low hunting mortality will increase numbers and densities by contrast the open population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality may not reduce carnivore densities because of compensatory immigration and low hunting mortality may not result in more carnivores because of compensatory emigration previous research supported the open population hypothesis with high immigration rates in a heavily hunted hunting mortality rate cougar population in northern washington we test the open population hypothesis and high emigration rates in a lightly hunted hunting mortality rate cougar population in central washington by monitoring demography from to we used a dual sex survival fecundity leslie matrix to estimate closed population growth and annual census counts to estimate open population growth the observed open population growth rate of was lower than the closed survival fecundity growth rates of deterministic and stochastic and suggests a annual emigration rate our data support the open population hypothesis for lightly hunted populations of carnivores low hunting mortality did not result in increased numbers and densities of cougars as commonly believed because of compensatory emigration,Animal Conservation,,source populations in carnivore management cougar demography and emigration in a lightly hunted population

marine turtles are a taxon of world wide conservation concern effective long term monitoring is hampered by the fact that populations are widely dispersed except during the breeding season thus most monitoring programmes focus on nesting beaches necessitating resource intensive studies often over months that could conceivably be less comprehensive and focus on more parsimonious sampling we analyse years of exhaustive monitoring data for two species of mediterranean marine turtles chelonia mydas and caretta caretta we resample using a variety of plausible sub sampling regimens to estimate the total annual nesting population we project our dataset into the future applying a range of population change rates to explore how adopting a monitoring programme based on sub sampling would for example affect our ability to detect population decline we show that accurate annual population estimates can be achieved with as few as days of survey effort providing monitoring spans the peak of nesting furthermore the modelled impact of sampling based monitoring suggests that the duration to detect population change is not increased greatly our findings have implications for all marine turtle monitoring and have applicability to other animal groups it is often considered desirable to perform exhaustive monitoring with aversion of basing policy recommendations on partial data however comprehensive long term monitoring programmes particularly in developing nations although presenting a number of advantages are often impossible accurate total annual censuses can be achieved through a variety of sub sampling regimens without sacrificing the ability to detect changes in the population trends over time in this example a solid block of at least weeks sampling that encompasses the peak of the nesting season is advised,Biological Conservation,,sampling design and its effect on population monitoring how much monitoring do turtles really need
the majority of wild sumatran tigers are believed to live in tiger conservation landscapes covering approximately km however the actual distribution of tigers across sumatra has never been accurately mapped over the past years conservation efforts focused on the sumatran tigers have increased but the population continues to decline as a result of several key threats to identify the status of the sumatran tiger distribution across the island an island wide questionnaire survey comprised of respondents from various backgrounds was conducted between may and june the survey found that sumatran tigers are positively present in habitat patches larger than km and possibly present in another in addition a review on major published studies on the sumatran tiger was conducted to identify the current conservation status of the sumatran tiger collectively these studies have identified several key factors that have contributed to the decline of sumatran tiger populations including forest habitat fragmentation and loss direct killing of tigers and their prey and the retaliatory killing of tigers due to conflict with villagers the present paper provides management authorities and the international community with a recent assessment and a base map of the actual distribution of sumatran tigers as well as a general overview on the current status and possible future conservation challenges of sumatran tiger management,Integrative Zoology,,sumatran tiger panthera tigris sumatrae a review of conservation status
changes to population and community structure can have important ecological consequences and raise conservation concerns when causes are anthropogenic however signs of stress may not always be apparent turtles are long lived and presence of adults may suggest healthy populations when lack of recruitment is actually threatening persistence we observed and captured turtles for two years in point pelee national park ontario canada and compared our results with those collected years earlier to determine if species relative abundance sex ratios and age structure changed over three decades extirpation of the spotted turtle since has altered the park s species assemblage evidence also suggests that blanding s turtles have declined sex ratios were similar between time periods for all species except for the painted turtle which has become significantly more male biased size structure for blanding s and snapping turtles shifted towards larger and presumably older age classes our results suggest that limited juvenile recruitment caused the size shift heavy predation on turtle nests from a dense raccoon population appears to be the main factor limiting recruitment despite protecting a sizable fragment of turtle habitat for a century point pelee has lost one species and only one other species has a large healthy population our study illustrates that habitat protection provides no guarantee for species persistence when multiple threats exist and highlights the necessity for monitoring populations of long lived species,Biological Conservation,,species loss and shifting population structure of freshwater turtles despite habitat protection

the issue of predator limitation of vertebrate prey populations is contentious particularly when it involves species of economic or conservation value in this paper we examine the case of raptor predation on upland passerines and waders in scotland we analysed the abundance of five wader and passerine species on an upland sporting estate in southern scotland during an eight year period when hen harrier peregrine and merlin numbers increased due to strict law enforcement the abundance of meadow pipit and skylark declined significantly during this time golden plover also showed a declining trend whereas curlew increased significantly and there was a near significant increase in lapwings contrasting the local population trends of these species with trends on nearby areas revealed higher rates of decline for meadow pipit and skylark at the site where raptors increased but no differences in trends for any of the three wader species there was a negative relationship between the number of breeding harriers and meadow pipit abundance the same year and between total annual raptor numbers and meadow pipit abundance predation rates of meadow pipit and skylark determined from observations at harrier nests suggested that predation in june was sufficient to remove up to of the june meadow pipit population and up to of the june skylark population this quasi natural experiment suggests that harrier predation limited the abundance of their main prey meadow pipit and possibly the abundance of skylark thus high densities of harriers may in theory reduce the abundance of the prey species which determine their breeding densities potentially leading to lower harrier breeding densities in subsequent years we found no evidence to suggest that raptor predation limited the populations of any of the three wader species we infer that concerns over the impact of natural densities of hen harriers on vulnerable upland waders are unjustified,Oikos,,the impact of raptors on the abundance of upland passerines and waders

amphibian declines have been documented worldwide and several have been linked to climate change but the long term data needed to detect declines are largely restricted to pond breeding species this limits our knowledge of population trends in other major groups of amphibians including stream salamanders which have their greatest diversity in north america i hypothesized that increasing air temperature and precipitation in northeastern north america caused abundance of the stream salamander gyrinophilus porphyriticus in a new hampshire population to decline between and i found a significant decline in abundance of g porphyriticus adults over this year period and no trend in larval abundance adult abundance was negatively related to annual precipitation which is predicted to increase further in the northeast due to climate change analysis of a year capture mark recapture data set for the same population showed no temporal variation in larval and adult detectability validating the abundance data and no variation in larval and adult survival however survival during metamorphosis from the larval to adult stage declined dramatically these results suggest that increasing precipitation is causing a decline in adult recruitment which if it persists will lead to local extinction a likely mechanism for the decline in adult recruitment is mortality of metamorphosing individuals during spring and fall floods which have increased in volume and frequency with the increase in precipitation more broadly this study presents strong evidence that the amphibian decline crisis extends to north america s stream salamanders and shows the critical need to collect population data on these species,Biological Conservation,,climate change is linked to long term decline in a stream salamander

five years of field observations suggest that amphibians inhabiting a sandhills community are able to circumvent a drift fence pitfall trap enclosure as they move toward and away from an ephemeral pond trespass rates varied depending on species and showed no tendency to increase or decrease as the study progressed laboratory trials confirmed that frogs easily crossed the fence by walking up the side or hopping over it frogs crossed the fence readily regardless of sex or whether the frog was an adult or juvenile although striped newts did not climb over the fence in the laboratory they may use tunnels to go under fences under field conditions other species may burrow directly under the fence a priori assumptions about a species ability to climb a fence or that trespass rates do not vary temporally or among sites are unwarranted and may lead to misinterpretations of the results from studies using drift fences and pitfall traps,Journal of Herpetology,,drift fence associated sampling bias of amphibians at a florida sandhills temporary pond

a critical variable in both ecological and conservation field studies is determining how many individuals of a species are present within a defined sampling area labor intensive techniques such as capture mark recapture and removal sampling may provide estimates of abundance but there are many logistical constraints to their widespread application many studies on terrestrial and aquatic salamanders use counts as an index of abundance assuming that detection remains constant while sampling if this constancy is violated determination of detection probabilities is critical to the accurate estimation of abundance recently a model was developed that provides a statistical approach that allows abundance and detection to be estimated simultaneously from spatially and temporally replicated counts we adapted this model to estimate these parameters for salamanders sampled over a six year period in area constrained plots in great smoky mountains national park estimates of salamander abundance varied among years but annual changes in abundance did not vary uniformly among species except for one species abundance estimates were not correlated with site covariates elevation soil and water ph conductivity air and water temperature the uncertainty in the estimates was so large as to make correlations ineffectual in predicting which covariates might influence abundance detection probabilities also varied among species and sometimes among years for the six species examined we found such a high degree of variation in our counts and in estimates of detection among species sites and years as to cast doubt upon the appropriateness of using count data to monitor population trends using a small number of area constrained survey plots still the model provided reasonable estimates of abundance that could make it useful in estimating population size from count surveys,Herpetologica,,using counts to simultaneously estimate abundance and detection probabilities in a salamander community

samples of plectropomus leopardus collected at two reefs glow and yankee that have been closed to fishing since were compared with samples collected at two reefs grub and hopkinson that were open to fishing to investigate the effects of a year closure on the size age and sex structure of leopard coralgrouper also known as coral trout populations there were no significant differences in mean size and age between protected reefs and unprotected reefs however mean size and age varied significantly between the two protected and the two unprotected reefs in the two reefs closed to fishing the population structure was dominated by the presence of a strong year class which settled in early indicating the occurrence of strong interannual fluctuations in recruitment a similar pattern was not observed on the reefs open to fishing suggesting that fishing mortality may have caused the decrease in abundance of this strong year class on the open reefs sex change occurred over a wide range of sizes and ages on the four reefs a comparison of the frequency of developmental stages between reefs indicated significant variation the two unprotected reefs had a smaller proportion of males but that seemed to be compensated for by a larger proportion of transitional stage fish and young males although the distribution of developmental stages in the populations was different the same final female male balance was achieved this suggests that for the leopard coralgrouper sex change results from a combination of developmental and behavioral processes differences in age structure were more obvious than differences in the size structure between closed and open reefs suggesting that age structure may be far more useful than size structure for comparisons of fishing effects on long lived fishes such as epinephelinae serranids comparisons of open and closed reefs based solely on mean sizes may fail to detect important differences,Fishery Bulletin,,population structure of the leopard coral grouper plectropomus leopardus on fished and unfished reefs off townsville central great barrier reef australia

penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments but they can be highly sensitive to climate change which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather oceanography and critical habitats for example in the southwest atlantic the distributional range of the ice obligate emperor and ad lie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted while the ice intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward in the southern ocean the el ni o southern oscillation and the southern annular mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem ultimately affecting penguins the interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly complicating our understanding of their future population processes penguins have long life spans which slow microevolution and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming therefore in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity however past species specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions thus the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance species with low adaptability particularly the ice obligates may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats while future sea ice contraction around antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice obligate penguins understanding the responses of the ice intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models,Global Change Biology,,penguin responses to climate change in the southern ocean

the ivory gull pagophila eburnea is a seabird that inhabits arctic oceans throughout the year often in association with polar pack ice it is rare breeding pairs globally and remains one of the most poorly known seabird species in the world canada supports breeding populations of international significance and residents of communities in the canadian high arctic currently observe fewer ivory gulls than they did in the s however no population trend data existed for this species in canada prior to this study we initiated aerial surveys in july and of most known ivory gull colonies in canada to assess current population levels forty two colonies were visited of which were new discoveries we recorded an decline in numbers of nesting ivory gulls several of the largest known colonies were completely extirpated and those that remained supported significantly fewer nesting birds than previously observed results were similar in both years despite some differences in local sea ice conditions suggesting a numerical decline in the population and not simply annual fluctuations in colony occupation declines have occurred in all habitat types and across the known canadian breeding range suggesting that causes of the decline may be related to factors occurring during migration or on wintering grounds we recommend that international efforts now be directed at assessing population status and trends of this species in other circumpolar countries,Biological Conservation,,declines in abundance and distribution of the ivory gull pagophila eburnea in arctic canada
native animals exploit resources in cities and inhabit anthropogenic structures worldwide one example of this is the little penguin eudyptula minor population nesting between boulders on the st kilda breakwater in melbourne this population is attracted by safe hiding places a lack of predators and the presence of prey however living close to urbanisation poses many threats to the colony including boating lighting noise and human visitation we investigated the effects of human disturbance by comparing the number of penguins and breeding sites in the publicly accessible region with those in the restricted region of the breakwater penguins and nest sites were not equally distributed along the breakwater with the mean number of birds and nest sites present per m section in the restricted region significantly greater typically double than the number in the publicly accessible region although the penguins show a clear preference to nest in the restricted region of the breakwater their continued presence in the publicly accessible region when nest sites are not limiting indicates that human disturbance is not incompatible with some nesting activity in a global context these results illustrate some of the benefits and costs to animals that use anthropogenically altered habitats and urban environments,Marine and Freshwater Research,,anthropogenic influence on an urban colony of the little penguin eudyptula minor
in spite of several studies showing that roe deer typically achieve higher population densities in openings or younger forest stands there do not appear to be any reporting the response of a single population to forest habitat change in this paper the results of a year study of a roe deer population which was not subject to significant levels of culling predation or ungulate competition are presented following planting with conifers which was mostly in the canopy cover increased most rapidly between and years after planting ground vegetation cover was negatively correlated with canopy cover the deer population increased from km to km between and years after planting after which it declined sharply to km a significant negative cross correlation was found between conifer canopy cover and deer density with a lag of years indicating that the decline in deer numbers lagged behind the decline in browse supply the rate of recruitment was correlated with the conifer canopy cover without any indication of a significant lag the decline in cover of the main food plant species bramble rubus fruticosus was much greater than the decline in deer density implying that the deer were forced to change their diet and perhaps also their patterns of habitat selection in response to the change in habitat structure,Forest Ecology and Management,,changes in roe deer capreolus capreolus l population density in response to forest habitat succession

catch and effort data for the period demonstrate a dramatic decline of lungfish in the tanzanian waters of lake victoria bottom trawl catches in the mwanza gulf showed a decline in catch rates from kg h in to kg h in trawling of commercial vessels in the speke gulf revealed a decline in lungfish catches from kg h in to kg h in the development of anoxia in the deeper waters of lake victoria the algal blooms and the decline of water transparency all associated with eutrophication are not likely to have contributed to the decreased catch rate however the lungfish decline may reflect the interaction of overexploitation by the fishery and a low level of nile perch predation that restricts lungfish to wetland refugia we suggest that this may have been reinforced over the past few decades by large scale conversion of wetlands to agricultural land and harvesting of nest guarding male lungfish leading to decreased recruitment of young,African Journal of Ecology,,decline of the african lungfish protopterus aethiopicus in lake victoria east africa

white stork is a convenient species for the analysis of patterns of population dynamics moreover reasons of general and synchronous number increasing remain in many respects not clear in ukraine number dynamics of the species is influenced by two factors during many years general changes in numbers and continuing expansion of the white stork to the east therefore trends differed in east regions and in other parts of the country in ukraine in has started the program of monitoring of the white stork population ornithologists and voluntary helpers take part in observations data are obtained on the net of constant study plots in different regions they let control breeding success and number dynamics in the country in total the information from plots in regions of ukraine is obtained in on from them observations were carried out during and more years on ones during years on since the obtained data are sufficient for the analysis of number dynamics considered ten years cover the period between vth and vith international white stork censuses for the analysis of population dynamics the average increment of numbers on study plots in were used since the increase of number permanently rose fig maximum of increasing was registered in and in number of the white stork has sharply decreased this year was catastrophic for the species almost in whole europe it was caused by bad conditions during wintering and spring migration already the next year population was completely restored and number increasing continued since rate of growth began to decrease and last years population was stabilized comparison of dynamics of number increasing in three large regions of ukraine fig shows that this process has firstly started in north east ukraine the greatest increase of number was registered also here in numbers changed in all three regions synchronously later this synchronism was reduced and last years changes went discordantly ceasing of number increasing after was registered also in other countries for example in germany expansion of the white stork has wave like pattern one of such waves in fact was traced during the period of observations this wave has started in ukraine with number increasing early in s enlargement of the breeding range was observed in east regions of the country at the same time the expansion livened up in russia general questions of expansion and number increasing of the white stork are discussed in ukraine the number increased first of all and to a greatest extent in optimal habitats with low population density expansion of the white stork in east europe can be considered as filling of faunistic emptiness remaining in north palearctic after the last glaciation the expansion is vectorial in east europe it goes to the east a lesser degree to the north but not to the south this phenomenon can be connected with genetic determination of direction of young birds dispersal in population near the east border of the breeding range such directed population can be formed by the natural selection mechanism is similar to genetic control of partial migration well studied by p berthold and colleagues if different directions of dispersal are equal for the population existing various genetic programs of dispersal will remain in the same ratio but if one of the directions give a preference in breeding success the part of birds with this variant of the program will increase vector of expansion can be predetermined also by other factors for example dispersal goes on the way of minimum resistance on areas having favourable conditions for breeding but with low population density of storks or full absence of them at last combination of endogenous and exogenous control of dispersal is possible breeding success of the white stork is higher in east part of the breeding range in ukraine the dnieper area and eastwards from this river and in many regions of russia this fact explains a well known contradiction storks continued advance to the east in spite of number decreasing of the species and depression of populations in many countries the east part of breeding range are all sufficient for the expansion high breeding success and predominant direction of dispersal create the necessary prerequisites for further moving eastwards in spite of the situation in other parts of the breeding range in ukraine the negative correlation between population density and breeding success of the white stork was not found probably ecological capacity of environment is far from the saturation and population density is not a limiting factor it creates prerequisites for further number increasing only on one large area in ukraine considerable number decreasing of storks was no ted they almost stopped breeding in chernobyl exclusion zone in s but it is connected not with population trends this area became unsuitable for the white stork because of evacuation of people and desolation of agricultural lands close correlation between changes of numbers and breeding success was found table it means that dynamics in both cases are caused by the same factors first of all these are conditions in wintering area their influence on eastern population of the white stork is discussed it is supposed that reasons of its rise are also connected with african wintering grounds may be global climate changes in africa have caused the improvement of food supply for wintering storks it promoted increasing the survival rate and breeding success and was an impuls for synchronous changes in numbers on the territory of whole breeding range of the european subspecies number of white stork in ukraine in is estimated at least in breeding,Berkut,,number dynamics of the white stork

the mauritius kestrel falco punctatus temminck has recovered from very low numbers in order to evaluate the severity of the population bottleneck that it experienced we have developed a method for estimating the productivity of the nests that escaped detection this method uses ringing records for mcmc estimation of parameters describing the recruitment of adults to the breeding population and the growth in productivity of undiscovered nests comparison of the estimates for the two restored populations eastern and western showed a far lower proportion of undiscovered nests in the former as predicted because of widespread use of nestboxes this served to verify the method of estimation the estimates show a steady increase in population size in contrast with field estimates indicating a recent reduction in growth the results suggest that the alarmingly low estimates of population size in two breeding pairs were accurate and that few undiscovered nests existed during the bottleneck the recovery of the population seems to have been initiated by the intensive conservation effort the most rapid period of population growth coincides with the reintroduction programme the results imply that the eastern population is much more reliant on intensive management for its future growth,Journal of Animal Ecology,,evaluating the severity of the population bottleneck in the mauritius kestrel falco punctatus from ringing records using mcmc estimation

river floodplain systems present intense temporal variations in physical chemical and biological factors these variations are closely related to alterations in water levels which have been attributed to the flood pulse as several species are strictly related to the flood pulse to fulfil their life cycle the pulse may be seen as a dispersal mechanism of species onto a floodplain in this study we determine how dam construction influenced the persistence of prochilodus lineatus population a large migratory fish species from the upper parana river floodplain data used were collected in two distinct periods from april to march and from january to december fish were collected using seining nets in six monthly in the first period and seven quarterly in the second period isolated lagoons the fraction of occupied lagoons was high in the first period higher than when flood was intense however in the second period when the flood pulse did not happen or was short the fraction of occupied lagoons sharply decreased over time from to for the first period no model fitted to data but for the second period a negative linear model named drought dependent model presented good fit r therefore it is possible to infer that long and intense flood pulses are important to maintain the persistence of p lineatus populations in the floodplain the artificial control of water levels prompted by dams disrupts this dynamic reducing persistence to critical levels,Ecology of Freshwater Fish,,persistence of fish populations in the upper parana river effects of water regulation by dams

we have used a stochastic population model with immigration to calculate extinction rates for two amphibian species the common toad bufo bufo and the crested newt triturus cristatus population models for amphibians are difficult to parameterize it was not possible to measure all the relevant parameters for the model the other parameters were obtained from other studies or estimated on the basis of similar species contour maps for persistence were generated using the model the persistence of populations associated with a pond is affected both by the pond s internal dynamics and its proximity to a source pond on a generation time scale toad ponds that were initially occupied were relatively unaffected by the proximity of a source persistence was almost certain when the average carrying capacity of a pond was greater than adult females initially unoccupied toad ponds were equally likely to persist if they lay within km of a source and could support more than adult females initially occupied newt ponds were likely to persist if they supported more than females or lay within km of a typical source pond initially unoccupied newt ponds were mainly dependent upon immigration rates very small ponds nk could persist if they lay within km of a source pond while large ponds nk only needed to be within km of a source pond this model allows us to use the data available to make predictions about the criteria which must be met by a landscape to ensure the survival of amphibian populations it offers the possibility of better predictions when the data is refined the model also suggests directions for further research such as the statistical study of environmental variation the nature of minimum viable populations for toads and the statistics of long range dispersal,Journal of Applied Ecology,,predicting the persistence of amphibian populations with the help of a spatial model

the rhesus population at tughlaqabad is characterized by moderately high natality a changing and perhaps stabilizing age structure and a declining growth rate although natality at this site has been high and relatively invariant over a year period the proportion of nonreproducing juveniles has increased necessitating a lower rate of growth the trapping of rhesus for export which was practiced in india as recently as may be largely responsible for the changing nature of the tughlaqabad age structure but this conclusion remains only conjectural,Primates,,population growth and stabilizing age structure of the tughlaqabad rhesus
although both seasonal patterns and short term variation in cpue are known to occur in most fisheries particularly small scale coastal fisheries the analysis of their underlying factors have received little attention to date when these factors become part of the local fishermen s ecological knowledge the resulting peak abundances are often intensively fished as a result of their predictability both in space and time this study conducted in the caribbean sea of north eastern colombia tests hypotheses derived from local fishermen of seasonal patterns of the demersal species lutjanus analis and the two pelagic species caranx crysos and scomberomorus cavalla and of the possible wind or swell driven aggregations of l analis arima modelling and fourier analysis were used to identify seasonal patterns from time series of monthly mean catch per unit effort available biological information and concerning l analis also data on wind speed and significant wave height anomalies were used to analyse the intra annual patterns evidence of biologically induced seasonal migrations was found for the two pelagic species concerning l analis in the windy season the timing of these aggregations and therefore peak cpue values appear correlated with the wind forcing occurring a few days before but in the last months of the wet season these peak abundances seem to be mainly related to pre spawning migrations and spawning aggregations thus we state that both kinds of events should be taken into account for the implementation of precautionary measures aimed to reduce the vulnerability to overfishing of these aggregations,Fisheries Research,,seasonal patterns of three fish species in a caribbean coastal gill net fishery biologically induced or climate related aggregations
monitoring of catch per unit effort of the tropical stumpnose rhabdosargus sarba in the st lucia marine reserve between and revealed a significant decline a similar decline was evident from shore patrol data collected by ezemvelo kwazulu natal wildlife staff in the southern areas of the greater st lucia wetland park as the distribution of fishing effort has decreased considerably since the promulgation of a beach vehicle ban in january this decline in the abundance of stumpnose has not been attributed to overfishing but rather to the closure of the mouth of the st lucia estuary and lake system the reason for this is because tropical stumpnose make extensive use of st lucia as a nursery area and since the mouth closure in june there has been no recruitment of juvenile fish into or adult fish out of the system this emphasises the importance of estuarine nursery areas and highlights the need for ongoing catch and effort monitoring,African Journal of Aquatic Science,,declining catch per unit effort of an estuarine dependent fish rhabdosargus sarba teleostei sparidae in the marine environment following closure of the st lucia estuarine system south africa

a method of validating stochastic models of population viability is proposed based on assessing the mean and variance of the predicted population size the method is illustrated with a model of the population dynamics of the mountain pygmy possum burramys parvus broom based on annual census data collected from a single population in the snowy mountains of new south wales australia between and the model incorporates density dependence in survivorship and recruitment and demographic and environmental stochasticity the model appeared to make reasonable predictions for the three populations that were used for validation provided the equilibrium population size was estimated accurately this may require that differences in habitat quality between populations be taken into account following valnation the model was given new parameters using the additional data from the three populations and the risk of population decline within the next years was assessed although populations as small as females are predicted to be relatively safe from extinction caused by stochastic processes b parvus appears vulnerable to loss of habitat and reductions in the population growth rate the approach used in this paper is one of few attempts to validate a model of population viability using field data and demonstrates that some aspects of stochastic population models can be tested,Journal of Animal Ecology,,a method for validating stochastic models of population viability a case study of the mountain pygmy possum burramys parvus

density and biomass may reveal different aspects of the dynamics of populations but most studies have focused on density or relative abundance density and biomass also may behave differently in parts of the population composed of males and females because of differences in vagility and parental care between sexes herein we explore seasonal and multiannual variation in density and biomass in a population of black eared opossums didelphis aurita females and males were analyzed separately for associations with precipitation and litterfall indicators of resource availability litterfall density and biomass were estimated from to on three ha trapping grids in an area of atlantic forest in rio de janeiro brazil density of females exhibited a significant increase during the study density and biomass of males were more variable without any significant positive trend or con elation with precipitation or litterfall seasonal and biannual patterns of precipitation were detected followed by the density and biomass of females with time lags varying from to and from to months the relative stability of biomass of females and its association with precipitation and litterfall suggests that resource availability combined with density dependent responses regulated the local population of females the local population of males may be more influenced by the stochasticity resulting from the higher vagility of males,Journal of Mammalogy,,precipitation litterfall and the dynamics of density and biomass in the black eared opossum didelphis aurita

we monitored survival reproduction and emigration of a translocated beaver castor fiber population in the netherlands for five years and used a stochastic model to assess its viability between and beavers were released in the biesbosch national park the mortality was initially high but gradually fell to normal rates however the breeding success was low and we hypothesized that this was either a temporary phenomenon the translocation hypothesis or a permanent feature the poor habitat hypothesis according to the computer simulations the isolated population was viable under the first but not under the second hypothesis in the latter case the prospects generally improved by the foundation of another population in the gelderse poort km from the biesbosch however this second habitat should be optimal for beavers in order to reduce the extinction probability of the biesbosch population to below in years the loss of genetic variability per generation was just above the applied tolerable risk but the effects of inbreeding are unknown in beavers we conclude that the beaver population in the biesbosch is not viable unless the reproductive success increases either in the biesbosch itself or in a nearby population we recommend applying such viability analyses to evaluate the likely success of any translocation,Biological Conservation,,development and viability of a translocated beaver castor fiber population in the netherlands

what to do about fisheries collapse and the decline of large fishes in marine ecosystems is a critical debate on a global scale to address one aspect of this debate a major fisheries management action the removal of gill nets in from the nearshore arena in the southern california bight degrees n degrees w to degrees n degrees w was analyzed first the impetus for the gill net ban was the crash of the commercial fishery for white seabass atractoscion nobilis sciaenidae in the early s from to catch remained at a historically low level mt when compared to landings from but increased significantly from r p to within the confidence limit of the historic california landings after the white seabass fishery crashed in the early s landings of soupfin galeorhinus galeus triakidae and leopard shark triakis semifasciata triakidae also significantly declined r p and r p respectively until the gill net closure after the closure both soupfin and leopard shark significantly increased in cpue r p and r p respectively finally giant sea bass stereolepis gigas polyprionidae the apex predatory fish in this ecosystem which was protected from commercial and recreational fishing in were not observed in a quarterly scientific scuba monitoring program from to but reappeared in in addition cpue of giant seabass increased significantly from to r p in the gill net monitoring program the trends in abundance of these fishes return were not correlated with sea surface temperature sst the pacific decadal oscillation pdo or the el nino southern oscillation enso all four species increased significantly in either commercial catch cpue or in the scuba monitoring program after the gill net closure whereas they had declined significantly crashed or were absent prior to this action this suggests that removing gill nets from coastal ecosystems has a positive impact on large marine fishes,Marine Biology,,the decline and recovery of four predatory fishes from the southern california bight
the number of recruits to the north shields kittiwake colony in n e england coulson thomas increased from to but the proportion of first breeders decreased during that time increased mortality of the breeding birds or the provision of more sites increased recruitment this implied that there was a pool of potential recruits from which the new recruits needed could be drawn in most years there appeared to be a non breeding reservoir about of each cohort returned to breed in their natal colony immatures did not suffer the same variations in mortality as did adults this finding is consistent with the premise of coulson thomas that increased adult mortality associated with the decline in numbers in the late s occurred prior to the breeding season the age of first breeding fell from to years in response to high adult mortality in the early s body weights and wing lengths of male and female recruits diminished but the body weights of male and female prospectors fluctuated little a model of colony growth is presented based on the relationship between colony size and rate of increase in expanding colonies of british kittiwakes small colonies grow faster than large ones and are proportionately more attractive to recruits small colonies cannot produce enough young during the first years and are sustained by immigration the north shields colony is not a closed system and is not currently growing it is supported by immigration there is a positive relationship between colony size and nesting density colony growth appeared to be limited by the number of attractive sites in the dense centre of the colony there were sites available on the periphery which were not used the importance to breeding of the buffering effect of the pool of potential recruits is discussed,Journal of Animal Ecology,,long term changes in recruitment to the breeding group and the quality of recruits at a kittiwake rissa tridactyla colony
the annual variability of the breeding performance of rodentivorous birds of prey has traditionally been explained in terms of annual fluctuations in rodent abundance this paper presents data from the siberian tundra showing that this relationship may not be so simple as generally thought the data consist of parameters of small mammal population fluctuations small mammal density smd average body weight species diversity and rate of change of species diversity inter specific competition and meteorological factors mean temperature and snow melt dale during every stage of the breeding cycle of the rough legged buzzard buteo lagopus the density of breeding pairs was found to be correlated with the smd whereas the total number of territorial pairs including non breeding ones could be most accurately predicted by a model incorporating both the smd and the population density of a larger competitor the snowy owl nyctea scandiaca clutch size showed no correlation with the smd the best fit multiple regression model to predict clutch size includes only small mammal diversity and its rate of change as predictive factors number of nestlings and egg losses did not show any correlation with any of the prey related or weather parameters although the total number of rough legged buzzard fledglings produced per unit area showed a significant positive correlation with the smd in a single factor regression the most accurate multiple regression model to predict overall reproductive output included only the rate of change of the small mammal species diversity the number of offspring produced by the buzzards in a given area fluctuated synchronously with the smd but the cycle was significantly more consistent in amplitude in the predator as compared to the prey,Oikos,,what determines the population density and reproductive success of rough legged buzzards buteo lagopus in the siberian tundra
a population study of the shag phalacrocorax aristotelis l started on the farne islands in and continued until many breeding individuals had originally been ringed as chicks and the majority of the population consisted of individually marked birds of known age mean annual adult survival was normally but and respectively during the red tides of and survival after the first year and second year was not affected to an important extent by age all the nest sites were ranked according to their physical characteristics and suitability for breeding only of the sites which were used during the study were considered to be entirely satisfactory a multiple regression analysis was carried out on the variation in breeding success of pairs of the total for which twelve variables were measured breeding success was much better in the years after the red tide of but the regression coefficients of the independent variables were similar it was possible to account for fifty five percent of the individual variation in the seasonal start of laying the most important factors here were age of the partners with the contribution by the male and female equal the oldest birds on the best sites started to lay weeks earlier than the youngest on the poor sites but the mean date of laying of an age class varied by as much as weeks from year to year depending on the annual differences in the dispersal of adults during the late winter clutch size on the farne islands was with hatching success of eggs incubated for the full term at variations in clutch size were responsible for only of variation in the number of young hatched most nesting losses were due to the weather especially rough seas which particularly affected the poor quality sites variation in the number of young fledged by a pair was accounted for by the quality of their chosen nest site and to a lesser extent by previous breeding experience no other factors were found to be important and those specifically excluded were direct effects of age after the first attempt to breed nest density pair status and site or mate fidelity there was a shortage of good nest sites on the farne islands and mean nest site quality declined significantly as the population increased between and the shag population increased and the shortage of nest sites progressively reduced the production of fledged young per pair this effect was especially marked among the first time breeders which arrived late each season and were forced to occupy relatively poor sites after an exceptionally high mortality of adults in caused by a red tide nest sites were not in short supply and productivity per pair greatly increased especially among the first time breeders which moved to better sites the breeding efficiency of first time breeders was compared to established breeders after excluding the effects of nest site they bred as well as established breeders the proportion of potential breeders which emigrated to the farne islands from the forth was similar to that of emigration from the farne islands of potential female recruits immigration especially of young females has been the dominant factor determining the size of the population on the farne islands during these studies and it allowed the population there to recover rapidly from the exceptional mortality caused by the red tides of females which bred for the first time between and were immigrants a computer model showed that nest site quality has been an important factor restraining the growth of the population in future nest site availability is likely to limit breeding numbers to about pairs the prolonged nesting season and the relation between nest site quality and age of the occupying pair is considered to be the result of competition for sites which are tangible assets not conventional trophies social constraints on nesting meant that some poor sites in colonies were occupied before good ones in non occupied areas but the progressive occupation of sites during the growth of the farne islands population has been efficient for the individual pairs and for the population as a whole the established birds with the highest breeding potential occupied the best sites,The Journal of Animal Ecology,,population dynamics and breeding success of the shag phalacrocorax aristotelis on the farne islands northumberland

drought is a natural disturbance that can cause widespread mortality of aquatic organisms in wetlands we hypothesized that seasonal drying of marsh surfaces i e hydrological disturbance shapes spatio temporal patterns of fish populations we tested whether population dynamics of fishes were synchronized by hydrological disturbance moran effect or distance separating study sites dispersal spatio temporal patterns were examined in local populations of five abundant species at sites sampled five times per year from to in a large oligotrophic wetland fish densities differed significantly across spatio temporal scales for all species for all species except eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki a significant portion of spatio temporal variation in density was attributed to drying events used as a covariate we observed three patterns of response to hydrological disturbance densities of bluefin killifish lucania goodei least killifish heterandria formosa and golden topminnow fundulus chrysotus were usually lowest after a dry down and recovered slowly eastern mosquitofish showed no distinct response to marsh drying i e they recovered quickly flagfish jordanella floridae density was often highest after a dry down and then declined population growth after a dry down was often asymptotic for bluefin killifish and golden topminnow with greatest asymptotic density and longest time to recovery at sites that dried infrequently fish population dynamics were synchronized by hydrological disturbance independent of distance and distance separating study sites independent of hydrological disturbance our ability to separate the relative importance of the moran effect from dispersal was strengthened by a weak association between hydrological synchrony and distance among study sites dispersal was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of flagfish whereas hydrological disturbance was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of the other species examined species varied in the relative role of the moran effect and dispersal in homogenizing their population dynamics probably as a function of life history and ability to exploit dry season refugia,Journal of Animal Ecology,,population dynamics of wetland fishes spatio temporal patterns synchronized by hydrological disturbance

using a long term data set on the fluctuations of a reintroduced swiss population of ibex we estimated the parameters in a stochastic population model with theta logistic density regulation and how the environmental stochasticity was related to different climate variables our aim was to examine quantitatively the relative effects of variation in parameters describing the expected dynamics and the environmental stochasticity as well as the uncertainties in them for the development of reliable population projections the specific growth rate r was density regulation mainly happened close to the carrying capacity k indicating that the commonly used assumption in population ecology of loglinear density regulation is not always valid annual variation in the point estimates of the environmental stochasticity was correlated with winter climate uncertainties in parameter estimates were high especially in the estimates of density regulation and r in order to examine the dynamical consequences of the estimates as well as the uncertainties in them we constructed population prediction intervals ppi a ppi is the stochastic interval that includes the unknown population size with probability analyses of factors affecting the width of the ppi showed that the form of the density regulation as well as uncertainties in model parameters should be estimated when making projections of future fluctuations of introduced populations,Ecology,,stochastic population dynamics of an introduced swiss population of the ibex
the use of population viability analysis has recently been criticized mainly because uncertainties in population predictions are often ignored we analyzed the viability of scandinavian wolverine gulo gulo populations that allow for the inclusion of uncertainties in parameter estimates and stochastic effects on population dynamics we used the insight gained from analyses of stochastic population models to quantitatively analyze different management options for the wolverine these management options were based on data from an individual based demographic study in the sarek national park sweden and data from monitoring schemes in norway and sweden stochastic components in population dynamics of the wolverine were large strong density regulation occurred around the carrying capacity according to the world conservation union the carrying capacity of populations must exceed sexually mature yr old females to be considered not vulnerable continuation of the current levels of offtake in norway will lead to extinction of the wolverine over large parts of the country hence current rates of mortality of female wolverine make the northern population endangered whereas the southern population is classified as vulnerable management plans allowing harvest of individuals should be based on a proportional threshold harvest strategy only of the surplus individuals exceeding a certain threshold for harvesting should be removed our analyses emphasized the importance of including estimates of precision in parameter estimates including stochastic factors in recommendations based on population viability analysis and examining the robustness of the conclusions against variation in crucial parameters by sensitivity analyses,Journal of Wildlife Management,,management strategies for the wolverine in scandinavia

long term population fluctuations of the fossorial form of the water vole arvicola terrestris can be reconstructed on the basis of the rewards given to vole trappers tail return statistics nine time series of at least yr of continuous data recorded during the th century in switzerland have been analysed using time series analysis and tested for direct and delayed density dependence seven of these data sets showed cyclic changes in abundance with statistically significant maxima of the periodogram for periods ranging between and yr their partial autocorrelation functions suggested the presence of both direct or delayed density dependence in the data this was confirmed by regression analysis using the nonlinear approach advocated by turchin in contrast no simple periodicity could be found in the two remaining time series nor indication for direct or delayed density dependence in their partial autocorrelation functions however direct density dependence was also statistically demonstrated in these two data sets in most cases the analyses were complicated by the presence of trends in the data the detection of density dependent regulatory effects was obscured by linear and nonlinear trends in one and two cases respectively the data support the hypothesis that time delayed and nonlinear mechanisms of population regulation operate in fossorial populations of a terrestris furthermore the data are consistent with regulatory mechanisms involving predator prey interactions while the causation of the unusually long cycle is still an open question finally the presence of trends in these time series suggests that water vole populations track some long term climatic changes in the environment,Oikos,,density dependence in time series of the fossorial form of the water vole arvicola terrestris
human activity commonly has negative impacts on wildlife often however only a single element of the life cycle is affected and it is unclear whether such effects translate into effects on population growth this is particularly true for research into the causes of global amphibian declines where experimental research focuses primarily on the aquatic larval stages but theory suggests these stages have only minor importance for population growth we used data from long term mark recapture studies of two natural populations of the salamander salamandra salamandra to confirm the predictions of population models one population remained stable i e stationary throughout the years of the study whereas the other declined to local extinction we used mark recapture models to break down population growth rate into its two main components recruitment and adult survival survival of postmetamorphic salamanderswas constant over time in the stable population whereas the declining population was characterized by a decrease in survival and constant recruitment population growth was most sensitive to variation in adult survival current amphibian research focuses on preadult stages and researchers assume recruitment is the most important determinant of population growth this may not be the case a better understanding of amphibian population dynamics is possible only through the integration of experiments theory and data from natural populations our results also suggest that amphibian conservation efforts should focus on all stages of the life cycle and their associated habitats,Conservation Biology,,demographic processes underlying population growth and decline in salamandra salamandra

historical accounts show that humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae have frequented bermuda waters which are located half way between wintering and summering grounds in the western north atlantic since the early th century there were more humpbacks present in the th th and th centuries than there are today it also appears that humpback whales utilised the bermuda area from february to may during these centuries while today they occur at bermuda for only three to four weeks in april humpbacks probably used bermuda as a breeding ground in winter during these previous centuries and it may be an area that will be repopulated during winter if and when the population recovers from over hunting using the distinctive pattern of pigmentation on the under sides of the tail flukes individual humpback whales were identified at bermuda and of these have also been seen at other locations including all the major summering and wintering grounds in the western north atlantic chi square analysis of these resightings shows that the whales occur at bermuda in the expected proportions relative to the samples from the summering and wintering grounds contemporary utilisation of bermuda by humpbacks is as a mid ocean habitat through which all members of the western north atlantic population migrate during spring there is also evidence suggesting that humpback whales feed at bermuda on deep water scattering layers during their stop over,Biological Conservation,,history migration and present status of humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae at bermuda

the great gray owl strix nebulosa breeds in northern europe mostly in older coniferous forests nest sites are usually in twig nests of large hawks sometimes on stumps and occasionally on the ground the availability and the quality of tree nest sites is generally lower in managed forests however use of artificial nests has partly compensated for declines in natural nest sites the great gray owl has increased in abundance in northern europe over the last yr it was absent almost entirely from finland from having been numerous there especially from it feeds mainly on field voles microtusa grestis which are abundant in fields and grassy areas following forest clearcuts the area of clear cuts has increased since providing more open hunting habitat and vole resources also protection of all owls and increasing positive attitude toward birds of prey has coincided with the great gray owl increases since the late s forest management practices that may benefit the great gray owl include shape of cuts which should be irregular and not broader than m perch trees left in cut areas would expand the hunting area from the forest edge,Journal of Raptor Research,,the great gray owl strix nebulosa in the changing forest environment of northern europe

declines in numbers by several wader species in britain have been linked to climate change but the mechanism for the declines has rarely been explored britain lies at the northern end of the east atlantic flyway and supports million out of the flyway s million coastal waders charadrii in winter and the purple sandpiper is one of the species whose numbers have declined here we examine the dynamics of the decline as observed in the moray firth northeast scotland investigating whether the decline was due to poorer apparent survival return rate or poorer recruitment of young birds the maximum number in the moray firth declined from in to in with some increase during winters and at the three main high tide roosts balintore lossiemouth and buckie the maximum combined number declined from to changes in survival and recruitment percentage of first year birds were examined at these roosts from captured samples which were ringed and recaptured there were no significant changes between winters in survival rates nor were there differences between the survival rates of age groups first year and adult or bill size groups which represented birds of different sex and breeding origin annual survival estimates for the three roosts ranged from to the percentage of first year birds varied among roosts and years the lowest values were during the late s early s and early s a free running population model incorporating varying percentages of first year birds and constant mortality for each roost provided a plausible explanation for the decline although modelled numbers followed the observed pattern a discrepancy in one year was carried forward in subsequent years so that the fit with the observed numbers was parallel rather than similar however it seems that the decline in numbers was largely due to poorer recruitment we discuss whether breeding success had declined whether the population had responded to changes in the local sewage treatment systems which could affect invertebrate food for purple sandpipers or whether fewer birds chose to winter in scotland the moray firth population is derived from norway and possibly canada and there is evidence that the norwegian population was disproportionately affected the reason for poor recruitment requires further study and other wader species require examination to test if poor recruitment is a common feature of decline in numbers,"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science",,local and global influences on population declines of coastal waders purple sandpiper calidris maritima numbers in the moray firth scotland

the population dynamics and exploitation of the yellow eel anguilla anguilla l stock on the swedish west coast were studied in contrast to a generally observed reduction in the recruitment of glass eels in europe including in swedish waters there was no indication of a decline in the total eel fishery yields along the swedish west coast long term records of daily catches as well as by test fishing results also shown that this stability in eel fishery yields has not been maintained by an increase in fishery effort as the catch per unit efforts in the past years have been more or less unchanged these findings implied that the number of recruits to the fishery has been rather stable possibly indicating that density dependent factors at the elver and yellow eel stages may moderate variations in glass eel recruitment total instantaneous rate of mortality was estimated from records on eel length distribution in the professional fyke net fishery the estimated total mortality rate in an isolated archipelago population on the west coast was chosen as an approximation of the instantaneous rate of natural mortality and net emigration in the west coast eel stock the differences between these two estimates could thus be regarded as the mortality that occurred due to fishing it was found that the eel fishery was very intense and most fish were caught in small sizes resulting in a low escapement rate of maturing fish,Fisheries Research,,vital population statistics of the exploited eel stock on the swedish west coast

the longnose skate raja rhina is the most commonly landed skate species in the northeast pacific ocean it also dominates survey catches in the area existing knowledge on skate biology and fisheries suggests that large skate species with late sexual maturation like the longnose skate are extremely vulnerable to overfishing and if overfished they are slow to recover historically in the us pacific coast skates have not supported directed fisheries but have been taken as bycatch in other commercially important fisheries for the past years landed catches of skates in waters off washington oregon and california have significantly increased using the stock synthesis modeling framework a population model for the longnose skate was developed to assess the current state of the stock and reconstruct its past dynamics model results indicate that the longnose skate spawning biomass has slowly declined since the current stock biomass is estimated as of its unexploited level uncertainty in regards to fishery dependent data and female maturity parameters was explored through sensitivity analyses the model results indicate that it is important to conduct species specific identification in the fishery and monitor discard of longnose skate to improve the accuracy of fishery catch data and make assessment conclusions more robust,Fisheries Research,,the population dynamics of the longnose skate raja rhina in the northeast pacific ocean
interactions between density dependent and density independent processes can lead to variation in both growth and survival rates detecting such effects however will often require sampling on an individual level and at the appropriate spatial and temporal scale this study documents substantial variation in survival and growth of stream dwelling brown trout salmo trutta from a small norwegian stream the data is based on seasonal capturerecaptures of individually marked trout on fixed stations during eight years the fish were small sized rarely reaching sizes larger than cm and ages older than seven years density varied between fish m variation in survival and recapture probabilities was analysed using program mark apparent survival the probability of being alive and present within the study area generally decreased with increasing trout density and increasing drought level measured as lowest observed water flow during both winter and summer further there was a significant interaction effect between density and water flow indicating that density dependent effects on survival predominated when environmental conditions were benign no drought while density independent processes were most important under harsh environmental conditions drought observed length at age during autumn indicated a more or less linear growth trajectory throughout life and no effect of density water flow or temperature was found however using the individual based capturerecapture data to estimated specific growth rate significant positive effects of water flow and temperature and a negative effect of density were identified thus the capturerecapture data suggest a strong potential for population regulation at the rather low densities found in this stream and regulation may occur both through effects on survival and growth,Oikos,,non additive effects of density dependent and density independent factors on brown trout vital rates

it is generally expected that exploited whale populations should rebuild following the end of whaling using photographic identification of individuals during a series of field projects we studied female and immature sperm whales physeter macrocephalus that visit the waters off the galapagos islands ecuador analysis of mark recapture data using a likelihood model indicates the population decreased at a rate of about per year c i between during the study period the animals were not hunted and were not obviously the subject of other immediate anthropogenic threats rates at which research vessels encountered whales also fell over this interval the decline seems to be due principally to migration into waters off the central and south american mainland the population also has a very low recruitment rate about calves female year as indicated by rates of observation of calves although other causes cannot be ruled out both the high emigration rate and low recruitment rate are probably related to heavy whaling in peruvian waters which ended in whales from the galapagos are moving east to fill productive but depopulated waters near the coast and the virtual elimination of large breeding males in their late twenties and older from the region has lowered pregnancy rates the case of the galapagos sperm whales strongly suggests that exploitation can continue to have substantial negative impacts on the size and recruitment rate of an animal population well outside the range of the hunt and for at least a decade after it has ended,Conservation Biology,,past and distant whaling and the rapid decline of sperm whales off the galapagos islands

population cycling is a widespread phenomenon observed across a multitude of taxa in both laboratory and natural conditions historically the theory associated with population cycles was tightly linked to pairwise consumer resource interactions and studied via deterministic models but current empirical and theoretical research reveals a much richer basis for ecological cycles stochasticity and seasonality can modulate or create cyclic behaviour in non intuitive ways the high dimensionality in ecological systems can profoundly influence cycling and so can demographic structure and eco evolutionary dynamics an inclusive theory for population cycles ranging from ecosystem level to demographic modelling grounded in observational or experimental data is therefore necessary to better understand observed cyclical patterns in turn by gaining better insight into the drivers of population cycles we can begin to understand the causes of cycle gain and loss how biodiversity interacts with population cycling and how to effectively manage wildly fluctuating populations all of which are growing domains of ecological research,Ecology letters,28633194.0,moving forward in circles challenges and opportunities in modelling population cycles

recent studies suggest that evolutionary changes can occur on a contemporary time scale hence evolution can influence ecology and vice versa to understand the importance of eco evolutionary dynamics in population dynamics we must quantify the relative contribution of ecological and evolutionary changes to population growth and other ecological processes to date however most eco evolutionary dynamics studies have not partitioned the relative contribution of plastic and evolutionary changes in traits on population community and ecosystem processes here we quantify the effects of heritable and non heritable changes in body mass distribution on survival recruitment and population growth in wild bighorn sheep ovis canadensis and compare their importance to the effects of changes in age structure population density and weather we applied a combination of a pedigree based quantitative genetics model statistical analyses on demography and a new statistical decomposition technique the geber method to a long term dataset of bighorn sheep on ram mountain canada monitored individually from to we show three main results the relative importance of heritable change in mass non heritable change in mass age structure density and climate on population growth rate changed substantially over time an increase in body mass was accompanied by an increase in population growth through higher survival and recruitment rate over the entire study period changes in the body mass distribution of ewes mostly through non heritable changes affected population growth to a similar extent as changes in age structure or in density the importance of evolutionary changes was small compared to that of other drivers of changes in population growth but increased with time as evolutionary changes accumulated evolutionary changes became increasingly important for population growth as the length of the study period considered increased our results highlight the complex ways in which ecological and evolutionary changes can affect population dynamics and illustrate the large potential effect of trait changes on population processes,Ecology,28646625.0,fluctuating effects of genetic and plastic changes in body mass on population dynamics in a large herbivore

this study investigates the gene pool of portuguese autochthonous dog breeds and their wild counterpart the iberian wolf subspecies canis lupus signatus using standard molecular markers a combination of paternal and maternal molecular markers was used to investigate the genetic composition genetic differentiation and genetic relationship of native portuguese dogs and the iberian wolf a total of unrelated dogs including breed and village dogs from portugal and other dogs from spain and north africa and iberian wolves wild and captive were analyzed for nuclear markers namely y chromosome snps y chromosome str loci autosomal str loci and a mitochondrial fragment of the control region i our data reveal new variants for the molecular markers and confirm significant genetic differentiation between iberian wolf and native domestic dogs from portugal based on our sampling no signs of recent introgression between the two subspecies were detected y chromosome data do not reveal genetic differentiation among the analyzed dog breeds suggesting they share the same patrilineal origin moreover the genetic distinctiveness of the iberian wolf from other wolf populations is further confirmed with the description of new mtdna variants for this endemism our research also discloses new molecular markers for wolf and dog subspecies assignment which might become particularly relevant in the case of forensic or noninvasive genetic studies the iberian wolf represents a relic of the once widespread wolf population in europe and our study reveals that it is a reservoir of unique genetic diversity of the grey wolf canis lupus these results stress the need for conservation plans that will guarantee the sustainability of this threatened top predator in iberia,Ecology and evolution,28649351.0,new insights into the genetic composition and phylogenetic relationship of wolves and dogs in the iberian peninsula
successful species conservation is dependent on adequate estimates of population dynamics but age specific demographics are generally lacking for many long lived iteroparous species such as large reptiles accurate demographic information allows estimation of population growth rate as well as projection of future population sizes and quantitative analyses of fitness trade offs involved in evolution of life history strategies here a long term capture recapture study was conducted from on the american crocodile crocodylus acutus in southern florida over the study period hatchlings were marked and individuals were recaptured for as many as years we estimated survival to be strongly age dependent with hatchlings having the lowest survival rates but increasing to nearly at adulthood based on mark recapture models more than of the female population were predicted to be reproductive by age years the age specific proportion of reproductive females steadily increased until age when more than of females were predicted to be reproductive population growth rate estimated from a leslie lefkovich stage class model showed a positive annual growth rate of over the study period using a prospective sensitivity analysis we revealed that the adult stage as expected was the most critical stage for population growth rate however the survival of younger crocodiles before they became reproductive also had a surprisingly high elasticity we found that variation in age specific fecundity has very limited impact on population growth rate in american crocodiles we used a comparative approach to show that the original life history strategy of american crocodiles is actually shared by other large long lived reptiles while adult survival rates always have a large impact on population growth this decreases with declining growth rates in favor of a higher elasticity of the juvenile stage crocodiles as a long lived and highly fecund species deviate from the usual association of life histories of slow species current management practices are focused on nests and hatchling survival however protection efforts that extend to juvenile crocodiles would be most effective for conservation of the species especially in an ever developing landscape,The Journal of animal ecology,28657652.0,life histories and conservation of long lived reptiles an illustration with the american crocodile crocodylus acutus
common cuckoo cuculus canorus is a charismatic bird species with a dominant presence in human culture from folklore legends to nowadays there is evidence of cuckoos being a prime candidate as a surrogate of bird diversity recent studies demonstrated that the cuckoo can predict hotspots of taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of bird communities in european countries in this study we demonstrated that the cuckoo is an excellent bioindicator at multi spatial scale extending cuckoo surrogacy from europe to asia even using three different survey methods transect square point counts comparing the new findings with results of our research in europe sites where the cuckoo is present were characterized by greater species richness while the cuckoo was absent from sites with low species richness the goodness of fit of models based on point counts ranged between and furthermore the cuckoo population trend mirrors the average population trend and climate suitability of overall bird communities in europe the common cuckoo is therefore a suitable intercontinental bioindicator of hotspots of bird richness even under climate change scenarios or in areas where the species co occurs with other cuckoo species opening a new avenue for standardized citizen science on bird biodiversity surveys worldwide,Scientific reports,28663558.0,the common cuckoo is an effective indicator of high bird species richness in asia and europe
climate change is rapidly altering many aquatic systems and life history traits and physiological diversity create differences in organism responses in addition to biological diversity habitat diversity may be expressed on small spatial scales and it is therefore necessary to account for variation among both species and locations when evaluating climate impacts on biological communities here we investigated the effects of temperature and spatial heterogeneity on long term community composition in a large boreal lake we used a five decade time series of water temperature and relative abundance of fish species captured in the littoral zone throughout the summer at discrete locations around the lake we applied a spatial dynamic factor analysis sdfa model to this time series which estimates the sensitivity of each species to changing water temperature while accounting for spatiotemporal variation this analysis described the trend in community composition at each sampling location in the lake given their different trends in temperature over time the sdfa indicated different magnitude and direction of species responses to temperature some species increased while others decreased in abundance the model also identified five unique trends in species abundance across sites and time indicating residual dynamics in abundance after accounting for temperature effects thus different regions in the lake have experienced different trajectories in community change associated with different rates of temperature change these results highlight the importance of considering habitat heterogeneity in explaining and predicting future species abundances and our model provides a means of visualizing spatially explicit temporal variation in species dynamics,Ecology,28664599.0,within lake habitat heterogeneity mediates community response to warming trends
identifying the demographic parameters e g reproduction survival dispersal that most influence population dynamics can increase conservation effectiveness and enhance ecological understanding life table response experiments ltre aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters on past demographic outcomes e g population growth rates but the vast majority of ltres and other retrospective population analyses have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates which do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates λt nt nt in time varying environments we provide an empirical means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed transient life table response experiments with integrated population models ipms ipms allow for the estimation of latent population structure and other demographic parameters that are required for transient ltre analysis and bayesian versions additionally allow for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and perturbation analyses of growth rates by integrating available monitoring data for lesser scaup over years and conducting transient ltres on ipm estimates we found that the contribution of juvenile female survival to long term variation in realized population growth rates was and times larger than that of adult female survival and fecundity respectively but a persistent long term decline in fecundity explained of the decline in abundance between and in contrast an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest recovery in lesser scaup abundance since indicating that the most important demographic drivers of lesser scaup population dynamics are temporally dynamic in addition to resolving uncertainty about lesser scaup population dynamics the merger of ipms with transient ltres will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non stationary global change,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,28675581.0,understanding the demographic drivers of realized population growth rates
over half of globally threatened animal species have experienced rapid geographic range loss identifying the parts of species distributions most vulnerable to extinction would benefit conservation planning however previous studies give little consensus on whether ranges decline to the core or edge here we build on previous work by using empirical data to examine the position of recent local extinctions within species geographic ranges addressing range position as a continuum and exploring the influence of environmental factors we aggregated point locality data for species of galliform birds across the palearctic and indo malaya into equal area half degree grid cells and used a multi species dynamic bayesian occupancy model to estimate the rates of local extinctions our model provides a novel approach to identify loss of populations from within species ranges we investigated the relationship between extinction rates and distance from range edge examining whether patterns were consistent across biogeographic realm and different categories of land use in the palearctic local extinctions occurred closer to the range edge in both unconverted and human dominated landscapes in indo malaya no pattern was found for unconverted landscapes but in human dominated landscapes extinctions tended to occur closer to the core than the edge our results suggest that local and regional factors over ride any general spatial patterns of recent local extinction within species ranges and highlight the difficulty of predicting the parts of a species distribution most vulnerable to threat,Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology,28678438.0,examining the relationship between local extinction risk and position in range

the spatial extent and intensity of artificial light at night alan has increased worldwide through the growth of urban environments there is evidence that nocturnally migrating birds are attracted to alan and there is evidence that nocturnally migrating bird populations are more likely to occur in urban areas during migration especially in the autumn here we test if urban sources of alan are responsible at least in part for these observed urban associations we use weekly estimates of diurnal occurrence and relative abundance for nocturnally migrating bird species that breed in forested environments in north america to assess how associations with distance to urban areas and alan are defined across the annual cycle migratory bird populations presented stronger than expected associations with shorter distances to urban areas during migration and stronger than expected association with higher levels of alan outside and especially within urban areas during migration these patterns were more pronounced during autumn migration especially within urban areas outside of the two migration periods migratory bird populations presented stronger than expected associations with longer distances to urban areas especially during the nonbreeding season and weaker than expected associations with the highest levels of alan outside and especially within urban areas these findings suggest that alan is associated with higher levels of diurnal abundance along the boundaries and within the interior of urban areas during migration especially in the autumn when juveniles are undertaking their first migration journey these findings support the conclusion that urban sources of alan can broadly effect migratory behavior emphasizing the need to better understand the implications of alan for migratory bird populations,Global change biology,28695706.0,seasonal associations with urban light pollution for nocturnally migrating bird populations
the damselfish chromis limbata is native to the macaronesian archipelagos azores madeira and canaries and the western coast of africa between senegal and angola during the austral summers of and the species was recorded for the first time in the south western atlantic ocean around campeche and xavier islands in florian polis santa catarina state brazil here the progression of c limbata in southern brazilian waters is described using visual counts and genetic surveys and changes in the density of the native congener chromis multilineata were also investigated underwater visual censuses of both chromis species were carried out from to chromis limbata tissue samples were collected and the mtdna control region was sequenced and compared with mtdna haplotypes from the natural range to confirm species identity compare genetic diversity and to infer connectivity between newly established brazilian populations the brazilian population of c limbata increased significantly over the past years and the effect on c multilineata is still an open question longer time series data will be necessary to clarify possible interactions the molecular analyses confirmed species identity revealed strong haplotype connectivity among brazilian study sites and showed a low genetic diversity in brazil when compared with the native populations suggesting few individuals started the invasion four hypotheses could explain this colonizing event c limbata was released by aquarium fish keepers larvae or juveniles were transported via ship ballast water the species has rafted alongside oil rigs they crossed the atlantic ocean through normal larval dispersal or naturally rafting alongside drifting objects the rafting hypotheses are favoured but all four possibilities are plausible and could have happened in combination,Journal of fish biology,28703291.0,the recent colonization of south brazil by the azores chromis chromis limbata
in km of aerial surveys and km of vessel surveys were conducted during june to november when critically endangered korean okhotsk or western gray whales eschrichtius robustus were present off the northeast coast of sakhalin island russia results of surveys in all years indicated gray whales occurred in predominantly two areas adjacent to piltun bay and offshore from chayvo bay hereafter referred to as the piltun and offshore feeding areas in the piltun feeding area the majority of whales were observed in waters shallower than m and were distributed from several hundred meters to approximately km from the shoreline in the offshore feeding area during all years the distribution of gray whales extended from southwest to northeast in waters m in depth during all years the distribution and abundance of whales changed in both the piltun and offshore feeding areas and both north south and inshore offshore movements were documented within and between feeding seasons the discovery of a significant number of whales feeding in the offshore area each year was a substantial finding of this study and raises questions regarding western gray whale abundance and population levels feeding behavior and ecology and individual site fidelity fluctuations in the number of whales observed within the piltun and offshore feeding areas and few sightings outside of these two areas indicate that gray whales move between the piltun and offshore feeding areas during their summer fall feeding season seasonal shifts in the distribution and abundance of gray whales between and within both the piltun and offshore feeding areas are thought in part to be a response to seasonal changes in the distribution and abundance of prey however the mechanism driving the movements of whales along the northeast coast of sakhalin island is likely very complex and influenced by a multitude of factors,Environmental monitoring and assessment,17703367.0,distribution and abundance of western gray whales off northeastern sakhalin island russia
dispersers are expected to assess breeding habitat quality before settlement although cues reflecting habitat quality are well studied social cues have not been as well evaluated in this paper we studied breeding habitat selection during years in a natural population of blue tits cyanistes caeruleus breeding in nest boxes our aim was to investigate if this species used conspecific density and or reproductive success of con and heterospecifics i e social cues in settlement decisions the patterns observed were consistent with the idea that juveniles when dispersing from their natal patches did not react to any of the cues that we tested in contrast breeders that dispersed seemed to respond to both conspecific mean patch reproductive success prs and breeding density of the settlement patch in the year of dispersal their response differing according to their own reproductive success indeed failed breeders moved to areas with high prs and low density relative to source patches while successful breeders behaved the opposite the comparison between juveniles and adults might be modulated by the limited time available to juveniles to gather information on prs and density at the end of the dispersing year adults lacking these time constraints however seemed to rely on these conspecific cues although limited by their own quality additionally breeders were more likely to be immigrants in patches with relatively low breeding success and density the previous year suggesting that settlement is influenced by multiple cues which may reveal information on different aspects of habitat and be available at different moments collectively our results support the importance of social cues for blue tits settlement,Die Naturwissenschaften,17487465.0,settlement decisions in blue tits difference in the use of social information according to age and individual success
bird populations have declined in many parts of the world but most of those declines can be attributed to effects of human activities e g habitat fragmentation declines in areas unaffected by human activities are not common we have been sampling bird populations at an undisturbed site in lowland forest of eastern ecuador annually since using a combination of mist nets and direct observations on two ha plots bird numbers fluctuated on both plots during the first years but did not show a consistent pattern of change since about numbers of birds on both plots have declined capture rates in were less than at the start of the study and observation rates were less both understory and canopy species declined in abundance overall insectivores showed the most pronounced declines but declines varied among trophic groups the period from onward also was a period of stronger la ni a events which at this study site are associated with increased rainfall the mechanism for the declines is not known but likely reflects a combination of reduced reproductive success coupled with reduced survival associated with changing climate,PeerJ,26339554.0,enigmatic declines in bird numbers in lowland forest of eastern ecuador may be a consequence of climate change
substantial new housing and infrastructure development planned within england has the potential to conflict with the nature conservation interests of protected sites the breckland area of eastern england the brecks is designated as a special protection area for a number of bird species including the stone curlew for which it holds more than of the uk total population we explore the effect of buildings and roads on the spatial distribution of stone curlew nests across the brecks in order to inform strategic development plans to avoid adverse effects on such european protected sites using data across all years and subsets of years over the period but restricted to habitat areas of arable land with suitable soils we assessed nest density in relation to the distances to nearest settlements and to major roads measures of the local density of nearby buildings roads and traffic levels were assessed using normal kernel distance weighting functions quasi poisson generalised linear mixed models allowing for spatial auto correlation were fitted significantly lower densities of stone curlew nests were found at distances up to m from settlements and distances up to m or more from major trunk roads the best fitting models involved optimally distance weighted variables for the extent of nearby buildings and the trunk road traffic levels the results and predictions from this study of past data suggests there is cause for concern that future housing development and associated road infrastructure within the breckland area could have negative impacts on the nesting stone curlew population given the strict legal protection afforded to the spa the planning and conservation bodies have subsequently agreed precautionary restrictions on building development within the distances identified and used the modelling predictions to agree mitigation measures for proposed trunk road developments,PloS one,24023662.0,building development and roads implications for the distribution of stone curlews across the brecks

river dwelling fish such as european graylings thymallus thymallus are susceptible to changes in climate because they can often not avoid suboptimal temperatures especially during early developmental stages we analyzed data collected in a year long population monitoring program male and female graylings were sampled about three times week during the yearly spawning season in order to follow the development of the population the occurrence of females bearing ripe eggs was used to approximate the timing of each spawning season in the last years of the study spawning season was more than weeks earlier than in the first years this shift was linked to increasing water temperatures as recorded over the last years with a temperature logger at the spawning site in early spring water temperatures rose more slowly than in later spring thus embryos and larvae were exposed to increasingly colder water at a stage that is critical for sex determination and pathogen resistance in other salmonids in summer however fry were exposed to increasingly warmer temperatures the changes in water temperatures that we found embryos larvae and fry were exposed to could be contributing to the decline in abundance that has occurred over the last years,Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology,20561001.0,shift of spawning season and effects of climate warming on developmental stages of a grayling salmonidae
we have studied a small isolated population of black grouse tetrao tetrix in the netherlands to examine the impact of isolation and reduction in numbers on genetic diversity we compared the genetic diversity in the last extant dutch population with dutch museum samples and three other black grouse populations from england austria and norway respectively representing isolated and continuous populations we found significantly lower allelic richness observed and expected heterozygosities in the present dutch population compared to the continuous populations austria and norway and also to the historical dutch population however using a bottleneck test on each population signs of heterozygosity excess were only found in the likewise isolated english population despite that strong genetic drift was evident in the present dutch population in comparison to the reference populations as assessed both in pairwise f st and structure analyses simulating the effect of a population reduction on the dutch population from onwards using census data and with the dutch museum samples as a model for the genetic diversity in the initial population revealed that the loss in number of alleles and observed heterozygosity was according to genetic drift expectations and within the standard error range of the present dutch population thus the effect of the strong decline in the number of grouse on genetic diversity was only detectable when using a reference from the past the lack of evidence for a population reduction in the present dutch population by using the program bottleneck was attributed to a rapidly found new equilibrium as a consequence of a very small effective population size,Molecular ecology,18346125.0,genetic impoverishment of the last black grouse tetrao tetrix population in the netherlands detectable only with a reference from the past

long term monitoring of bird communities provides fundamental data to build population models which are valuable instruments to biodiversity conservation the saco da fazenda aquatic avifauna was monitored monthly through three daily visual censuses from january to december adopting the monthly average number of birds as a standard measurement of abundance a total of species were registered and considering the frequency of occurrence were considered regular seasonal and occasional resident birds represented of the total species observed seasonal visitors from the north hemisphere south america visitors and a single species representing a possible new occurrence for brazil seven were classified as shorebirds were limnic waterbirds and four species were border inhabitants or visitors coming from the atlantic forest the families ardeidae scolopacidae laridae and charadriidae contributed with of the species being phalacrocorax brasilianus gmelin and larus dominicanus lichtenstein the predominant ones despite the seasonal fluctuations observed monthly average abundances of avifauna presented no differences but when comparing the year censuses data set abundances were significantly different while the diversity index showed significant differences for both monthly and annual values the evenness index showed moderate fluctuations along the sampled years remaining statistically similar but monthly distinct long term uninterrupted studies involving waterbird communities are unique and support the need to consider seasonality time of the day and the number of censuses to adequately determine population s size the continuity of such long term monitoring could give a substantial contribution to understand interactions among species and to evaluate the importance of the estuarine populations in a regional context,Revista Brasileira de Zoologia,,aquatic avifauna at saco de fazenda itajai santa catarina brazil one decade of monitoring
the beach of ilha comprida is important site in the semipalmated plover charadrius semipalmatus migration this paper analyses the seasonal occurrence of the semipalmated plover at ilha comprida and the impact of human disturbance in order to avaluate the importance of the area as a stopover site the sighted birds were counted and simultaneously they were registered the atmosphere where happened activity type that they were accomplishing and the disturbance human if there was the results show that ilha comprida areas seem to be an important stopover site during december but not during winter june july and august and the abundance of semipalmated plover may be reduced by in july the ilha comprida is stopover in the migration for the south and north and important area for foranging and rest for the charadrius semipalmatus,Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia,,distribuition of the semipalmated plover charadrius semipalmatus during on the ilha comprida beach
the most important and usually the most difficult problem in fisheries sciences assessment is the relationship between stock and recruitment the term ‘recruitment’ is referred in this study as the abundance of the earliest age at which a cohort can effectively be estimated the process of recruitment is complex and determined by density dependent and density independent factors usually stock recruitment is the empirical relationship between reproductive stock and the number of recruits produced there are several suggestions to express the stock recruitment relationship and an example of such attempts is the models of beverton and holt ricker and shepherd these models were fitted by non linear procedure to serrasalmus marginatus and s maculatus populations from the baía river the aim of the study was to determine the best model for stock recruitment relationship and the main mechanism related to it for both species competition appeared to be the limiting factor for recruitment shepherd s marginatus and ricker s maculatus were the models that presented the best fit,Acta Scientiarum.

ozotoceros bezoarticus celer the southernmost subspecies of pampas deer and endemic to the argentine pampas is seriously endangered in buenos aires province the last pampas deer population is located in the bahía samborombón region poaching and the increase in exotic species such as feral dogs and feral pigs have been suggested as the most important causes affecting the recovery of the deer population thus the aim of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in distribution and abundance of the pampas deer and the feral pig in the bahía samborombón wildlife refuge and to discuss the possible consequences of the interaction between these species six aerial surveys were conducted during a total of deer and feral pigs were counted with a slight decrease in the deer sightings and an important increase in pig sightings during the sampling period estimated density ranged between individuals km for deer and from to individuals km for pigs a negative correlation was found between densities of the two species rs p and the distributions are not mutually independent a progressive change in distribution has been detected in the pampas deer population during the last three decades this study provides evidence of the potential existence of negative interactions between pampas deer and pigs due to the critical situation of the pampas deer population a control plan for feral pigs should be developed and urgently implemented to prevent the increase and expansion of this population to the south of the samborombón bay and consequently to reduce the potential competition and predation on the existing deer population,Ecologia Austral,,spatial and numerical relationships between pampas deer ozotoceros bezoarticus celer and feral pigs sus scrofa in the bahía samborombón wildlife refuge argentina
