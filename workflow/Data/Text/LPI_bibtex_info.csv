1,"Hrabar, Halszka and du Toit, Johan T","Dynamics of a protected black rhino (Diceros bicornis) population: Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa","Achieving maximum productivity in remnant populations of black rhinoceros is crucial to the persistence of this species. It was, therefore, investigated whether the black rhino population of Pilanesberg National Park had become regulated by resource limitation 22 years after introduction in 1979. Inter-calving intervals (which are not restricted to yearly time increments, due to asynchronous reproduction) decreased with an increase in rainfall, while the percentage of male calves born increased with increasing rainfall. The percentage of reproductive cows achieving maternal success increased with increasing density until 0.085 rhinos/km2, after which it decreased. This positive relationship at low densities is largely due to changes in the female age structure and the adult female/male ratio. The age at first calving tended to increase with increasing density, while mortality was not related to rainfall or density. It is concluded that the Pilanesberg black rhino population is showing the first signs of density dependence. It is proposed that black rhino conservators should monitor the percentage of cows achieving maternal success to detect early indications of density dependent resource limitation and use this as a criteria for decisions regarding metapopulation management.",Animal Conservation,,,,,,,

When discovered, the colony comprised approximately 150 breeding pairs; these numbers were maintained until 1970, after which time the colony showed a continuous decline. By 1999 there were fewer than 20 pairs, and in 2009 high-resolution aerial photography revealed no remaining trace of the colony. Here we relate the decline and loss of the Emperor Island colony to a well-documented rise in local mean annual air temperature and coincident decline in seasonal sea ice duration. The loss of this colony provides empirical support for recent studies (Barbraud \&amp; Weimerskirch 2001; Jenouvrier et al 2005, 2009; Ainley et al 2010; Barber-Meyer et al 2005) that have highlighted the vulnerability of emperor penguins to changes in sea ice duration and distribution. These studies suggest that continued climate change is likely to impact upon future breeding success and colony viability for this species. Furthermore, a recent circumpolar study by Fretwell \&amp; Trathan (2009) highlighted those Antarctic coastal regions where colonies appear most vulnerable to such changes. Here we examine which other colonies might be at risk, discussing various ecological factors, some previously unexplored, that may also contribute to future declines. The implications of this are important for future modelling work and for understanding which colonies actually are most vulnerable.</p>",PLoS ONE,,,,,,,

7,"Ferretti, Francesco and Worm, Boris and Britten, Gregory L and Heithaus, Michael R and Lotze, Heike K",Patterns and ecosystem consequences of shark declines in the ocean,"Whereas many land predators disappeared before their ecological roles were studied, the decline of marine apex predators is still unfolding. Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here, fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and temporal scales. Yet more empirical evidence is needed to test the generality of these effects throughout the ocean.",Ecology Letters,,,,,,,

The survey of the ichthyofauna in the Marine Reserve of Tabarca Island was carried out by visual censuses with SCUBA. Inside and outside the reserve was sampled six times at random from summer 1997 to summer 1999 and in three different depths (1, 5 and 15 m) by applying transects of 150 · 5 m over the P. oceanica meadows. The data were analyzed with multivariant methodologies and with analysis of variance. The most represented families in number of species were the sparids and labrids. Mean abundance, biomass and number of species were higher inside the reserve in all studied periods. Inside the marine protected area, these variables decreased as depth increased; outside the protected area the pattern was the opposite, reaching the maximum at 15 m.",Journal of Applied Ichthyology,,,,,,,

12,"Schekkerman, Hans and Teunissen, Wolf and Oosterveld, Ernst",The effect of 'mosaic management' on the demography of black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa on farmland,"1. Like many farmland birds, the largest European population of the black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, in The Netherlands, has been declining for decades despite conservation measures including agri-environment schemes (AES). In a new experimental AES aiming to reverse this decline, collectives of farmers implemented spatially coordinated site-level habitat management ('mosaic management') including delayed and staggered mowing of fields, refuge strips and active nest protection.2. We evaluated the effectiveness of mosaic management by measuring godwit breeding success in six experimental sites and paired controls. Productivity was higher in mosaics than in controls due to fewer agricultural nest losses. Chick fledging success was poor in both treatments. Productivity compensated for adult mortality in only one AES site.3. Although creating chick habitat was a major management goal, the availability of tall grass during the fledging period did not differ between treatments, mainly because rainfall delayed mowing in all sites and study years. However, chick survival increased with the availability of tall grass among sites. Higher chick survival will thus enhance the positive effect of mosaic management in drier years, but sensitivity to weather represents a weakness of the AES design.4. Available estimates of productivity in Dutch godwits suggest a strong reduction over the past 20 years and implicate chick survival as the main driver of their decline. Earlier mowing of grassland is the main causal mechanism, but changes in vegetation structure and composition, and increased predation may also have contributed.5. Synthesis and applications. Demographic rates like breeding success are useful parameters for evaluating effects of management. Mosaic management increases the productivity of black-tailed godwits, but does not ensure long-term population viability for this flagship species of wet grassland bird communities. More stringent management prescriptions need to improve both the area and the quality (vegetation structure) of grassland mown late. Management efforts should be concentrated in areas with favourable pre-conditions in order to improve overall effectiveness.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,
13,"Webb, Jonathan K and Pike, David A and Shine, Richard","Population ecology of the velvet gecko, Oedura lesueurii in south eastern Australia: Implications for the persistence of an endangered snake","Ecological specialization, such as major dependence upon a single-prey species, can render a predator taxon vulnerable to extinction. In such cases, understanding the population dynamics of that prey type is important for conserving the predator that relies upon it. In eastern Australia, the endangered broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides feeds largely on velvet geckos (Oedura lesueurii). We studied growth, longevity and reproduction in a population of velvet geckos in Morton National Park in south-eastern Australia. We marked 458 individual geckos over a 3-year period (1992--1992) and made yearly visits to field sites from 1995--1995 to recapture marked individuals. Female geckos grew larger than males, and produced their first clutch at age 4 years. Males can mature at 2 years, but male-male combat for females probably forces males to delay reproduction until age 3 years. Females lay a single clutch of two eggs in communal nests in November, and up to 22 females deposited eggs in a single nest. Egg hatching success was high (100\%), and juveniles had high survival (76\%) during their first 6 months of life. Velvet geckos are long-lived, and the mean age of marked animals recaptured after 1995 was 6.1 years (males) and 8.4 years (females). Older females (7.5--5.5 years) were all gravid when last recaptured. Like other temperate-climate gekkonids, O. lesueurii has a 'slow' life history, and population viability could be threatened by any factors that increase egg or adult mortality. Two such factors - the removal of 'bush rocks' for urban gardens, and the overgrowth of rock outcrops by vegetation - could render small gecko populations vulnerable to extinction. In turn, the reliance of predatory broad-headed snakes on this slow-growing lizard species may increase its vulnerability to extinction.",Austral Ecology,,,,,,,

17,"Solorzano, Sofia and Castillo, Silvia and Valverde, Teresa and Avila, Lourdes",Quetzal abundance in relation to fruit availability in a cloud forest in southeastern Mexico,"The Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) is an altitudinal migrant that nests in high elevation cloud forests and migrates toward lower areas during the summer rainy season. It has been suggested that its migratory movements are related to the abundance of ripe Lauraceae fruits. We studied the quetzal diet during two consecutive years, as well as changes in fruit abundance of the plant species on which the bird feeds at El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, southeastern Mexico. The quetzal was observed feeding on 32 plant species; of these, 24 are new records in its diet. We chose 20 of these 32 species and studied their fruit phenology for two years in order to describe the relationship between fruit and quetzal abundance. Our results showed that quetzal abundance in the breeding area was correlated with the total number of fruiting species, whereas the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruiting Lauraceae species was only marginal. Additionally, a correlation test showed that quetzal abundance was marginally correlated with total fruit availability (total no. of fruits per month); however, the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruits in the Lauraceae was not significant. Our results suggest that the dynamics of food resources may be playing a major role in the quetzal's migratory behavior. Knowing the bird's diet may aid in characterizing the type of habitat adequate for its conservation. Our observations in this respect suggest that conservation efforts to preserve this bird species should concentrate on the protection of its habitat, including both breeding and nonbreeding (migration) locations.",Biotropica,,,,,,,

A 35 years temporal data set (1974--1974) on mortality of Spanish imperial eagle was recorded, including population censuses, and data on electrocution and non-electrocution of birds. Additional information was obtained from 32 radio-tracked young eagles and specific field surveys. Data were divided into two periods, before and after the approval of a regional regulation of power line design in 1990 which established mandatory rules aimed at minimizing or eliminating the negative impacts of power lines facilities on avian populations.

We surveyed the hippopotamus population in the Masai Mara National Reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in 2006 using foot counts along 155.3 km of the main rivers. We counted 4,170 hippopotamuses in 171 schools. Comparisons with earlier surveys suggest that this population increased by 169.6\% between 1971 and 1980 within the reserve and, although it did not increase within the reserve during 1980[long dash]2006, it increased by 359.4\% outside the reserve during this period against a background of deteriorating habitat conditions. The overall density in 2006 was 26.9 hippopotamuses km-1 of river, equivalent to a biomass of 26,677 kg km-1 of river. The ratio of calves to 100 adults was 9:100 inside the reserve, 10:100 outside the reserve and 6:100 along tributaries of the Mara River, implying that the population is either increasing or that its spatial distribution is being compressed because of range contraction. The apparent increase in the hippopotamus population contrasts with marked contemporaneous declines in the populations of most other large mammalian herbivore species in the Reserve. We discuss possible reasons underlying the increase in the hippopotamus population.",Oryx,,,,,,,

Logbook data collected 2004--2004 from two Oahu (Hawaii) shark cage diving operations were analysed to determine whether such voluntary records provide useful insights into shark ecology or ecotourism impacts. Operators correctly identified common shark species and documented gross seasonal cycles and long-term trends in abundance of Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and tiger sharks (Galeorcerdo cuvier). Annual cycles in shark abundance may indicate seasonal migrations, whereas long-term trends suggest gradual exclusion of smaller sandbar sharks from cage diving sites. Numerically dominant (> 98\%) Galapagos and sandbar sharks are rarely implicated in attacks on humans. Negligible impact on public safety is supported by other factors such as: (1) remoteness of the sites, (2) conditioning stimuli that are specific to the tour operations and different from inshore recreational stimuli and (3) no increase in shark attacks on the north coast of Oahu since cage diving started. Tracking studies are required to validate logbook data and to determine whether sharks associated with offshore cage diving travel into inshore areas used for in-water recreation.",Environmental Conservation,,,,,,,

This mixed and productive landscape has allowed the establishment of a rich community of organisms. The viperine snake Natrix maura has traditionally been a common and abundant predator because the habitat is favorable and prey availability is high. In June 1995, we conducted a demographic study to evaluate relative densities of snakes in the rice fields. Thirteen years later, we repeated the same study in the same area and season. The field work consisted of 29 censuses of one hectare each, and snakes and their potential prey (green frogs and fish) were counted. In 1995, we found 27 snakes (0.93 animals/ha), these occupying 48\% of the sites. Frogs and fish were observed in 23 of the 29 censuses (79\%). In 2008, no snakes were found and frogs and fish appeared in only 11 of the samples (38\%). In 2008, we also prospected 20 sites in rice fields located next to the natural lagoons. At these sites, we detected a greater number of snakes (25\% of the stations). Several factors can explain the clear decline of the N. maura population in the Ebro Delta rice fields: 1) the transformation and degradation of the habitat; 2) the increase in population densities of natural predators such as herons; 3) the decrease in prey availability; 4) the massive use of pollutants in the rice fields; and 5) snake death on local roads and directly by human persecution. We propose that a combined effect of these factors has caused the alarming decline of this predator. The observation of water snakes in rice fields near natural lagoons indicates that protected natural areas act as natural refuges for fauna with reduced mobility, such as viperine snakes. The recovery of the N. maura population in the rice fields of the Ebro Delta depends on an integral change in agricultural management, including the reduced use of pollutants, the recovery of snake prey, and the maintenance of favorable habitats to prevent predation.",Acta Herpetologica,,,,,,,

With the rapid increase of human population and the fast expansion of agriculture in the recent 350 years of Chinese history, the habitat of the deer has been greatly reduced. Habitat loss and hunting have driven the deer to the verge of extinction. The last group of 26 deer was protected at Datian Nature Reserve (DNR) which was founded in 1976. The habitat at present remains only 13.14 km2 at DNR, just 4.38--38.57\% of that of the 1950's. The deer population increased to over 1,000 individuals in 2003 under the protection of enclosure building along the boundary of DNR. Moreover, an off-site conservation approach for the deer has been launched since 1990. A total of 83 deer from DNR had been accumulatively introduced to establish off-site populations by the end of 2000. The off-site conserved populations had reached 263 by the end of 2002, of which 246 animals were born in captivity or semi-captivity. A new off-site population in the natural environment was founded by introducing 65 animals from DNR during July to December 2003. Tile deer population still however faces challenges of habitat limitation, decrease of genetic diversity, inbreeding and poaching. Conservation approaches needed to practice immediately have been proposed in this paper.",Folia Zoologica,,,,,,,
111,"Grindal, Scott D and Stefan, Carol I and Godwin-Sheppard, C","Diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of bats in the oil sands regions of Northeastern Alberta","Little is known about the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of bats in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Between 1999 and 2007, we conducted summer bat surveys in the Athabasca and Cold Lake oil sands regions of northeastern Alberta, in response to increased industrial development and a need for greater understanding of species occurrences. We used mist nets (242 sites over 157 nights) and acoustic monitoring (920 sites over 126 nights) to determine the diversity and distribution of bats in the region. We captured 577 bats, representing 5 species, including: 260 Northern Myotis (Myotis septentrionalis); 193 Little Brown Myotis (M. lucifugus); 101 Silver-haired Bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans); 12 Hoary Bats (Lasiurus cinereus); and 11 Eastern Red Bats (L. borealis). Data from AnabatTM echolocation detectors indicated the highest activity for unclassified Myotis, Little Brown Myotis, Big Brown Bats (Eptesicus fuscus)/Silver-haired Bats, and Northern Myotis. Results suggest that the Northern Myotis may be more common in northeastern Alberta than previously thought. Based on the combined capture and echolocation data, Eastern Red Bats and Hoary Bats may be more common, or have increased ranges, than previously considered. Although expected to be relatively common, our failure to capture Big Brown Bats suggests that this species may be absent from the study area. Captures of adult males for all 3 migratory bat species (Eastern Red Bats, Hoary Bats, and Silver-haired Bats) represent the most northerly records in western Canada of adult males. This paper demonstrates the value in combining short-term, localized survey data such that more regional trends in the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of bats can be better understood.",Northwestern Naturalist,,,,,,,

Carnivores can have critical impacts on ecosystems, provide economic value through tourism and are often important flagships. However, their biological traits (e.g. low density, cryptic colouration and behaviour) make them difficult to monitor and hence wildlife managers rarely have access to reliable information on population trends, and long-term information at the community level is almost completely lacking. 2. We use data from transect counts in the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania to examine trends in abundance for seven co-existing carnivore species. Distance-based transect counts between 2002 and 2005 are compared with adjusted data from fixed-width transect counts across the same area in 1977 and 1986. 3. Distance-based methods provided density indices for the seven most commonly seen carnivores: lion Panthera leo, spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta, golden jackal Canis aureus, black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, side-striped jackal Canis audustis and bat-eared fox Otocyon megalotis. Detection curves were used to correct estimates from earlier fixed-width transect counts. 4. Trend analyses detected significant declines in densities of golden and black-backed jackal and bat-eared fox, but found no significant changes in spotted hyaena, lion, cheetah and side-striped jackal. 5. Overall, despite wide confidence intervals, we show that distance-based data can be used effectively to detect long-term trends and provide critical information for conservation managers. Power analysis demonstrated that for the most frequently seen species, spotted hyaena, golden jackal and lion, abrupt declines of up to 20\% may be detectable through long-term monitoring; however, for the remaining species, declines of 50\% may only be detected half the time. 6. Synthesis and applications. Distance methods provide a tool for rapid counts and monitoring of several species of carnivores simultaneously in suitable habitats and can be combined with historical fixed-width transect counts to test for changes in density. The method can provide key information to managers on long-term population trends and sudden abrupt changes in population size across a carnivore community.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,

Much of this habitat has been lost and degraded due to human land use and expansion of the introduced Smooth Cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Yancheng National Nature Reserve (NNR) is one of three breeding and wintering areas in China. We used satellite images from 1992 to 2007 and visual interpretation combined with ground truthing to classify the land cover and quantify changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in areas of Yancheng NNR used by Saunders's Gull. The Common Seepweed habitat, in which this species nests, decreased in area by 79.1\% (27,358 ha) over 15 years, predominantly as a result of conversion to aquaculture ponds (18,929 ha), and is now centred in the south-east of Yancheng NNR. The total population size of Saunders's Gull was maintained at over 900 individuals from 1999 to 2006 in Yancheng NNR, but was only 575 in 2007, and the number of breeding sites decreased from eight in 1992 and 1994 to a single site in 2000--2000 and two sites in 2007. From 1999 to 2007, the breeding population in the core area of Yancheng NNR accounted for 94.93\% of the total population, and its nest-site spatial turnover rate was 0.84 [plus or minus] 0.08 (n = 7 years), but it tended to decrease by about 40\% in 2007 because of degradation of the Common Seepweed community. The conversion of Common Seepweed habitats to other habitat types and expansion of introduced Smooth Cordgrass were the major and direct reasons for the loss and degradation of breeding habitats of Saunders's Gull. Smooth Cordgrass habitats increased in area by 321.9\% (11,057 ha) during this period and centred on the east, gradually occupying the mudflats, except the beach from Liangduo River to the south of Yancheng NNR, where potential breeding sites for the Saunders's Gull could be located.

However, oscillations may be expected in large mammal populations subject to quasi-periodic oscillations in regional rainfall. We evaluated evidence for environmentally entrained oscillations in a large-mammal predator-prey system in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, where rainfall exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations. The evaluation is based on analysis of comparative changes in the abundance of twelve ungulate species throughout South Africa's KNP using population counts over the period 1965--1965. We present evidence suggesting that (i) twelve ungulate populations display cyclic variability with half-periods ranging between 10 and 18 years, (ii) this variability was associated with lagged rainfall between 3 and 10 years back in the past for different ungulate species, and (iii) the ungulate species respond in contrasting ways to rainfall, with some reaching highest abundance during periods of low rainfall and others under conditions of high rainfall. These findings are not consistent with the response pattern we would expect if the population oscillations were driven directly by the rainfall influence on food availability. Instead they seem to be an outcome of predator-prey interactions, which are entrained by the effect of rainfall on habitat conditions affecting the relative susceptibility of the different ungulate species to predation.",African Journal of Ecology,,,,,,,

Although some studies have measured spillover by examining gradients of fish abundance and body size across reserve boundaries, there are no such studies to date including information from before reserve establishment, thus seriously limiting interpretation of results. We measured reef fish spillover from a NTR (Itacolomis Reef, Eastern Brazil) by estimating biomass and body size across the reserve boundary before (2001) and after (2002[long dash]2005) initiation of protection. Replicate sites were sampled inside and outside the reserve, with unprotected sites included in three distance categories from the reserve boundary: 0[long dash]400, 400[long dash]800 and 800[long dash]1200 m. This latter category generally surpasses the scales over which spillover is expected to influence patterns of fish abundance outside reserves (generally <500 m), particularly for relatively sedentary fishes, thus acting as a control for the reserve effect. Habitat measurements were undertaken at the same sites, from 2003 on. Biomass of Scarus trispinosus, a major fishery resource and the dominant species in terms of biomass (37.4\% of total biomass), was lower inside the reserve area before its establishment. During this same period, no individuals of two primary target species, Mycteroperca bonaci and Sparisoma axillare, were recorded inside the reserve. Coral cover was consistently lower inside the reserve from 2003 on. Biomass and body size of M. bonaci, as well as biomass of Ocyurus chrysurus, increased continuously inside the reserve after its establishment, with no similar increases recorded in control sites. Evidences of spillover (i.e. higher biomass inside the reserve and in unprotected sites closer to its boundary) were obtained for M. bonaci, O. chrysurus and S. trispinosus, although this pattern was only marginally significant for O. chrysurus. Despite these positive signs, recovery and spillover of S. trispinosus were probably inhibited by increased poaching from 2003 on. Our results indicate that the NTR at Itacolomis Reef was established a priori on poor quality habitats. Thus, future spatial comparisons between protected and unprotected sites would underestimate changes due to protection. These findings highlight the importance of baseline information and continued monitoring for adequately understanding the effects of NTRs, as well as the need of closer collaboration between natural and social scientists in order to effectively protect high-quality habitats in the long term while accounting for the socio-economic needs of local fishing communities.",Fisheries Research (Amsterdam),,,,,,,

In 2004 and 2006, species-level monitoring at multiple sites, coupled with towed-diver surveys in 2002, 2004, and 2006 on both of these federally protected islands, revealed diverse fish, coral, macroinvertebrate, and algal assemblages. This study examines inter- and intra-island spatial and temporal differences in community composition among sites and presents baseline biological community parameters for two of the least impacted reef systems in the world. Despite similarities in species composition, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and multidimensional scaling ordinations (nMDS) suggest biological communities at the two islands are distinct with Baker Island containing a greater percent cover of branched Acroporid corals and turf algae and Howland Island containing a greater percent cover of crustose coralline red algae and small, compact genera of coral. Both islands also contained considerable cover of non-invasive macroalgae. PERMANOVA further revealed benthic and fish species composition to differ between forereef and reef shelf sites from different sides of each island. When islands were considered as a whole, temporal changes were not noted between 2004 and 2006; however, temporal changes at select sites did occur, with coral cover decreasing significantly along the west side of Baker Island from 2004 to 2006.",Biodiversity and Conservation,,,,,,,

We then analyzed resighting data from 1991 to 2001 with an open robust-design capture-mark-recapture model to estimate annual nester survival and adult abundance for this population. The expected annual survival probability was estimated at ca. 0.893 (95\% CL 0.87--87.92) and the population was estimated to be increasing ca. 13\% pa since the early 1990s. Taken together with DNA fingerprinting that identify mother-daughter relations, our findings suggest that the increase in the size of the nesting population since 1991 was probably due to an aggressive program of beach protection and egg relocation initiated more than 20 years ago. Beach protection and egg relocation provide a simple and effective conservation strategy for this Northern Caribbean nesting population as long as adult survival at sea remains relatively high.

We compared two methods used to monitor numbers of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and R. pyrenaica in two contrasting populations, and explored the relationship between the sampling effort and the repeatability of the results using resampling methods. One population in the Alps had been stable at a high density for several years, whereas the other population, located in the Pyrenees, was increasing exponentially, following a reintroduction. In both sites, a long-term monitoring programme based on individually marked chamois, allowed us to estimate population size using capture-mark-recapture methods (CMR). In addition, we calculated an index of population size as the mean number of animals observed on a foot transect surveyed repeatedly. We then compared whether trends estimated by each method were consistent. In the increasing population, both the index and the CMR estimates revealed an exponential increase in population size. In the stable population, neither the index nor the CMR estimate revealed any trend in size. Consistent results between the index and the CMR suggest that the index could be used to monitor trends in population size. Resampling techniques, however, pointed out that the index is only reliable when calculated over a sufficient number of surveys per year (10 in the Pyrenees, three in the Alps) and over a sufficient number of years of monitoring (about five years).",Wildlife Biology,,,,,,,

We therefore examined if change-in-ratio (CIR) estimation methods, in combination with age- and sex-specific data on moose Alces alces observed and killed, could be a cheap alternative for estimating moose abundance in Norway. We used the large number of moose observations reported by moose hunters and estimated pre-harvest adult population size based on annual changes in adult sex ratio. Similarly, we estimated 1) annual recruitment rate based on the proportion of calves observed during the hunting season, 2) the harvest rate, and 3) the natural mortality rate based on variation in recruitment rate and harvest rate. During 1991--1991, annual variation in abundance was correlated with two of three independent indices of moose density, indicating that the CIR methods provide relatively precise estimates of abundance. Similarly, the estimated average natural mortality rate was similar to natural mortality rates of radio-collared moose in Scandinavia, and the estimated abundance was close to what we expected based on the annual harvest. However, large annual variation in estimated rates of natural mortality indicated that over- and underestimation of population abundance occurred for some years. This was likely due to the fact that harvesting occurred during periods of moose observations. Because we had no independent estimates of abundance, we were unable to estimate the bias. Hence, we concluded that variation in CIR abundance is a sensitive index of moose density, but that more studies are needed to determine the accuracy of CIR estimates as measurements of abundance. Future studies should focus on smaller populations with independent estimates on abundance, and base CIR estimation on changes in sex ratio within the hunting season to reduce the number of possible confounding effects.",Wildlife Biology,,,,,,,

It is the only freshwater population of porpoises in the world and is currently listed as Endangered by IUCN. In November and December 2006 we used two boats and line transect methods to survey the entire current range of the population, except for two lakes (Poyang and Dongting). Sighting results were similar for both boats, so we pooled all data and analyzed them using two line transect models and a strip transect model. All models produced similar estimates of abundance (1111, 1225 and 1000). We then added independent estimates of the number of porpoises from the two lakes for a total estimate of approximately 1800 porpoises. Our findings indicate that the population continues to decline and that its distribution is becoming more fragmented. Our current estimate in the main river is slightly less than half the estimate from surveys between 1984 and 1991 (which was probably an underestimate). We also found an apparent gap in the distribution of porpoises between Yueyang and Shishou ([approximately]150 km), where sightings had previously been common. Continued threats to Yangtze finless porpoises include bycatch in unregulated and unselective fishing, habitat degradation through dredging, pollution and noise, vessel strikes and water development. Immediate protective measures are urgently needed to ensure the persistence of finless porpoises in the Yangtze River. The survey design and analytical methods developed in this study might be appropriate for surveys of cetaceans in other river systems. [copyright] 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

181,"Heritage, Scottish Natural","Distribution, abundance and population structure of bottlenose dolphins in Scottish waters","Background Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) require conservation action in response to the EU Habitats Directive, the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for Small Cetaceans. The Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation (SAC) has provided an important focus for conservation efforts but protection of Scottish bottlenose dolphins requires management of threatening activities in other areas where our knowledge of their distribution, abundance and population structure is poor. In October 2005, the Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage commissioned a collaborative project to review existing data on the occurrence of bottlenose dolphins in Scottish waters, and to conduct surveys to assess the current distribution, abundance and population structure of this species in Scottish coastal waters. AddidoDal survey work was also commissioned to better understand the winter distribution of dolphins using the Moray Firth SAC. The project was carried out as a collaboration between the University of St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit, the Scottish Association for Marine Science, the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust and the University of Aberdeen's Lighthouse Field Station, Main findings Most of the bottlenose dolphins using Scottish coastal waters occur around the west and east coasts. There are relatively few records of bottlenose dolphins on the north coast of mainland Scotland or around Orkney and Shetland. Photo-identification studies indicate that around 200--200 individual dolphins occur regularly in Scottish coastal waters, with numbers on the east coast being approximately five times higher than those on the west coast. Re-sightings of identifiable individuals demonstrate that the animals recorded during our surveys in 2006 and 2007 have used these coastal waters since studies began in 1989 on the east coast and 1995 on the west coast. Estimates of the abundance of bottlenose dolphins on the east coast were higher than previous estimates for this population. This could be because survey design in the earlier studies resulted in an estimate that was negatively biased, or because of differences in the mark-recapture models used for the two estimates, or because the population has increased over the last two decades.evidence of historic and contemporary exchange between Scottish and Irish waters. A high proportion of dolphins using the Moray Firth SAC in summer were also detected within east coast waters during winter. Passive acoustic monitoring highlighted that core areas within the SAC continued to be used during much of the winter, although at a lower level than that observed during the summer months. The following conclusions were reached: Photo-identification can provide a robust method for estimating the abundance of bottlenose dolphins throughout Scottish coastal waters. However, in areas such as the west coast, where animals are sparsely and unpredictably distributed, research surveys are best targeted through close collaboration with public reporting schemes. Only low numbers of bottlenose dolphins occur in Scottish coastal waters. Consequently, broad-scale systematic surveys provide limited power for detecting core-habitats either in winter or summer. However, this study has demonstrated that a combination of Passive Acoustic Monitoring and targeted photo-identification surveys can provide robust data on seasonal and inter-annual patterns of occurrence in particular coastal areas of interest.",,,,,,,,

We assessed the relationships among six climate factors (annual minimum temperature, annual maximum temperature, monthly mean temperature, monthly mean precipitation, monthly mean temperature during winter, and monthly mean precipitation during winter); species diversity, evenness, and richness indexes for both amphibians and reptiles; and the number of each species and egg clumps of three amphibian species. First, both the amphibian and reptile species indices evidenced sudden changes in 2007, when climate factors in Korea fluctuated substantially. Second, amphibian diversity and evenness were negatively related with annual minimum temperature. Increased monthly mean precipitation had a positive effect in mountain edge sites, but a negative effect in valley sites. Third, reptile species evenness was positively related with monthly mean precipitation. In particular, the monthly mean temperature in the winter season affected the numbers of the Dione's rat snake and the Korean tiger keelback snake. These results indicate that amphibian and reptile communities are responding to climate change in a variety of ways.",Journal of Ecology and Field Biology,,,,,,,

Although hunting was regulated, the population became stagnant in the 1980s presumably from trophy hunting that skewed the sex and age structure, as well as measurable wolf (Canis lupus) predation. Political reform in the 1990s further caused population decline due to increased and less regulated hunting, increased poaching without punishment, reduced predator control, decline in forest management, and large forest fires.

A comprehensive study of Finnish ornithological literature was undertaken, the main bird archives were worked through and additional data were gathered through personal correspondence. Thus an almost complete coverage of the published observations was obtained, augmented by many previously unpublished records. The number of observations was fairly stable up to the mid-twentieth century, the slight apparent increase being mostly due to an increase in the numbers of bird-watchers. In reality the numbers probably decreased. The peak abundance was most likely in the 1880s. The main reason for the subsequent decline was obviously overhunting. In the 1950s the Dotterel was still fairly numerous; a decrease probably started sometimes during the 1950s-1960s, although little published information is available. At the main Finnish study area (V\""{a}rri\""{o}tunturi fells) the number of breeding pairs has dropped dramatically since the early 1970s. The main reason for the recent decline is probably the use of pesticides in the wintering area . During the Finnish ornithological history the number of Dotterel have decreased to 1--1\% of the original, perhaps even more. As no exact data were available for the Dotterel it was not included in the ""Red Data Book"" of Finland. The data presented in this report suggests that it would belong at least to the category ""in need of monitoring"". The Dotterel is listed in the EC Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (Directive 79/409/EEC).",Ornis Fennica,,,,,,,

205,"Frederiksen, M and Daunt, F and Harris, M P and Wanless, S",The demographic impact of extreme events: stochastic weather drives survival and population dynamics in a long-lived seabird,"1. Most scenarios for future climate change predict increased variability and thus increased frequency of extreme weather events. To predict impacts of climate change on wild populations, we need to understand whether this translates into increased variability in demographic parameters, which would lead to reduced population growth rates even without a change in mean parameter values. This requires robust estimates of temporal process variance, for example in survival, and identification of weather covariates linked to interannual variability.2. The European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis (L.) shows unusually large variability in population size, and large-scale mortality events have been linked to winter gales. We estimated first-year, second-year and adult survival based on 43 years of ringing and dead recovery data from the Isle of May, Scotland, using recent methods to quantify temporal process variance and identify aspects of winter weather linked to survival.3. Survival was highly variable for all age groups, and for second-year and adult birds process variance declined strongly when the most extreme year was excluded. Survival in these age groups was low in winters with strong onshore winds and high rainfall. Variation in first-year survival was not related to winter weather, and process variance, although high, was less affected by extreme years. A stochastic population model showed that increasing process variance in survival would lead to reduced population growth rate and increasing probability of extinction.4. As in other cormorants, shag plumage is only partially waterproof, presumably an adaptation to highly efficient underwater foraging. We speculate that this adaptation may make individuals vulnerable to rough winter weather, leading to boom-and-bust dynamics, where rapid population growth under favourable conditions allows recovery from periodic large-scale weather-related mortality.5. Given that extreme weather events are predicted to become more frequent, species such as shags that are vulnerable to such events are likely to exhibit stronger reductions in population growth than would be expected from changes in mean climate. Vulnerability to extreme events thus needs to be accounted for when predicting the ecological impacts of climate change.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Stock-recruitment and catchability parameters were estimated by fitting the catch/effort data to the Deriso-Schnute model, using nonlinear parameter estimation. Equilibrium analysis for the fitted model suggests that the virginal stock was .apprx. 63 600 tons, of which the maximum average yield is close to 17 900 tons and would be associated with an average biomass of .apprx. 30 000 tons. To take this maximum would require approximately the present annual fishing capacity of 250 fishing boats, producing a 0.60 annual harvest rate. The present stock is at the lowest level on record; different recovery and management strategies were evaluated by computer simulations. Only .apprx. 3 years would be needed for the stock to recover to optimum equilibrium biomass with no fishing, but it is suggested that a longer recovery period, under reduced fishing effort, would be preferable.",Fisheries Research (Amsterdam),,,,,,,

Data from a pitfall study carried out in the dry Chaco of Argentina were used to address the question of how species are distributed in their assemblage through time. Lizard activity and species richness were highest in the spring breeding season and declined in the cool months of the year. Variations in seasonal activity patterns and reproductive chronology resulted in significantly different distributions of species in every sample month. Not only did the species composition of the assemblage change through time, but the mean size of lizards and the proportions of males, females, and juveniles varied significantly for several species. Large lizards, regardless of species, disappeared from the assemblage during the cool, dry winter, while juveniles of the large species remained active year round. Adults of the smallest species were also active throughout the year. We propose an hypothesis based on thermoregulatory constraints of lizard body size to account for these patterns. An approach focusing on the energetics and physiological ecology of individual species would be fruitful in understanding the dynamics of fluctuating lizard communities.",Journal of Herpetology,,,,,,,

We used 11 years (1999--1999) of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and 2.5 years (2003--2003) of radiotelemetry data from southeastern Georgia, USA, in a CMR modeling framework to estimate apparent survival, capture and transition probabilities, and evaluate factors influencing these parameters. The model-averaged estimate of overall apparent annual survival probability was 0.700 (±0.030 SE) and is comparable to that obtained from known fate analysis (radiotelemetry) at the same site. Body size positively influenced survival, regardless of sex. Capture probability differed seasonally by sex, suggesting lower capture probability for females in fall and males in winter. There was no evidence for effect of precipitation or site-specific differences in survival. Model averaged estimate of annual adult survival estimated using multistate CMR models was 0.738 ± 0.030 and 0.515 ± 0.189 for subadults. We estimated population growth rate (k) and elasticity (proportional sensitivity) of k to vital rates using a stage-structured matrix population model. Population growth rate ranged from 0.96 to 1.03 depending on the value of the probability of transitioning from subadult to adult stage. The k was proportionally most sensitive to changes in adult survival rate, followed by subadult survival.

We marked a total of 821 adult frogs over 6 years and recaptured 74 at least once between years. Between-year adult survival was sex-specific and varied between 0.06 and 0.53 for males and 0.07--07.41 for females. Adult survival was significantly associated with annual rainfall and is cause for concern if rainfall declines further in the study region as predicted by changes in the global climate. There was a significant interaction between rainfall and sex with dry weather having a stronger negative effect on males than females. Pig-nosed frogs experienced boom and bust years with a single decline more dramatic than increases. Recruitment (in situ and immigration; 0.67--67.88) was substantially more important than adult survival (0.12--12.33) in determining realised population growth. In situ recruitment was highly variable between years with 1--1\% of eggs and tadpoles released by females into the pond surviving to metamorphosis. Years of low tadpole survival were associated with high numbers of predatory tortoises.

Because nascent research efforts at other aggregation points look to NMP as a model, further analysis of existing modeling approaches is important. We have expanded upon previous studies of NMP whale sharks by estimating CMR survival and recruitment rates as functions of average total length (TL). Our analysis suggests a decline in reported values of TL coincident with marginally increasing abundance among sharks sighted in more than one year ('returning') from 1995 to 2008. We found a positive, average returning recruitment rate (e) of 1.07 yr[long dash]1 (0.99 to 1.15, 95\% CI); smaller individuals contributed in larger numbers to recruitment, allowing for population growth accompanied by a decline in median size. We subsequently explored intraseasonal population dynamics with the Open Robust Design (ORD) model structure. Our best-fit model estimated modestly increasing annual abundances between 107 (95\% CI = 90 to 124) and 159 (95\% CI = 127 to 190) for 2004 to 2007, suggesting a short-term increase in total annual abundance. The ORD also estimated an average residency time of 33 d (95\% CI = 31 to 39) and biweekly entry profiles into the study area. Overall, our techniques demonstrate how large aggregations of the species can be modeled to better understand short- and long-term population trends. These results also show the direct scientific benefit from the development of an online, collaborative data management system to increase collection of sighting data for a rare species in conjunction with ecotourism activity.",Endangered Species research,,,,,,,

Between 1998 and 2002, we showed experimentally that the small-scale provision of fresh water near the breeding colonies led to an increase in the productivity of the birds. The increase was greatest in years with low natural rainfall but was positive in all years tested. The supplementary fresh water appears to help buffer productivity against the impacts of low rainfall and its provision is now part of the ongoing conservation measures for this species.",Ibis,,,,,,,

From February 2001 to January 2004 we caught 272 snakes belonging to 20 species from the following families: Elapidae (5\%), Viperidae (10\%), and Colubridae (85\%). The assemblage had a unimodal seasonal pattern of activity, and the highest number of captures occurred between September and May. There was a positive and significant correlation between the number of captures and monthly minimum and maximum average temperatures. Recruitment was observed from January to April. During the study, the area was affected by human activities, which altered the community structure: Pseudablabes agassizii was negatively affected by habitat devastation while Liophis poecilogyrus took advantage of this. Our results reinforced the impression that Pseudablabes agassizii is a habitat specialist species. We extend the understanding of the susceptibility of this species to environmental destruction in open natural environments of South America, and propose its use as a potential bio-indicator of the Pampa biome. We also discuss the importance of conservation strategies for snakes in grasslands of southern Brazil.",Annales Zoologici Fennici,,,,,,,

Although the numbers of nesting females remained relatively constant for the first 11 survey seasons (1987--1987), inclusion of more recent data (1998--1998) in the analysis reveals a statistically significant upward trend. In particular, neophytes have shown a significant upturn in numbers, whereas the remigrant subpopulation has remained stationary. This indicates that recruitment is driving the upward trend in the total number of nesters. Predictive models based on the Poisson distribution suggest that the neophyte subpopulation will continue to grow in size by an average of 10\% per annum. Model-based predictions and their limitations are discussed. The Jumby Bay Hawksbill Project, which has monitored and protected nesting hawksbills and their eggs since the project's onset, is one among several factors that may contribute to the recent increase in nesting females.",Animal Conservation,,,,,,,

However, it is difficult to detect such impacts if the native taxa exhibit strong stochastic variations in abundance; a 'natural' population decline might be wrongly interpreted as an impact of the invader. Frillneck lizards (Chlamydosaurus kingii) are large iconic Australian agamids, and have been reported to decline following the invasion of toxic cane toads. We monitored three populations of the species in the savanna woodland of tropical Australia over a 7-year period bracketing toad arrival. One population crashed, one remained stable and one increased. Hence, studies on any single population might have inferred that cane toads have negative, negligible or positive effects on frillneck lizards. With the benefit of spatial replication, and in combination with observations of prey choice by captive lizards, our data suggest that invasive cane toads have had little or no effect on frillneck abundance.",Austral Ecology,,,,,,,

In contrast to this prediction, a population of Testudo graeca grew at the instantaneous rate r = 0.137 from 1980--1980, with a doubling time of 5 years. r was similar in both adult and 10 cm animals, showing that this high rate was not due to changes in population structure, and may thus be taken as an intrinsic rate of increase (rm). rm was higher than that of most large mammals, and suggests that sustainable harvesting would be a viable conservation strategy for chelonians if tightly regulated. Ranching or farming operations for chelonians would be even more likely to succeed, given their high fecundity.

A total of 10,604,059 hooks from 7976 sets were observed, representing 94\% of the total number of hooks fished between 2001 and 2005. Leatherbacks, Dermochelys coriacea, (n = 284) and loggerheads, Caretta caretta, (n = 59) were the most common species captured. Leatherbacks were caught in less than 4\% of the sets, with an overall mean of 0.0268 turtles per 1000 hooks. Loggerheads were caught in less than 1\% of the sets with a mean catch rate of 0.0056 turtles per 1000 hooks. Most leatherbacks (97.5\% of total) were caught between 24[degree]S and 38[degree]S, while loggerheads were caught primarily in the northern portion of the area fished, between 24[degree]19[minute]S and 25[degree]31[minute]S. All loggerheads were dehooked where appropriate and released alive. A total of two leatherbacks were found dead. Despite the low catch rate of leatherbacks, the potential impact of this fishery on the severely depleted nesting populations in the eastern Pacific could be significant when combined with other fisheries and threats in the region. The very low mortality of bycaught sea turtles observed in our study is encouraging and suggests that there are opportunities for further reducing harmful effects of swordfish longline fishing on sea turtles. Results of spatial analysis of loggerhead bycatch relative to fishing effort show that closure of the northernmost fishing area would eliminate the majority of the loggerhead bycatch.

In this study we investigate the spatial structure within a free-living population of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in order to test for the first time the predictions from two contrasting models of male intrasexual competition on the population level. The contest competition model predicts an uneven distribution of the sexes in a population nucleus with a female biased sex ratio in the center and a male biased sex ratio in the periphery. In contrast the scramble competition model predicts males and females being distributed evenly throughout their habitat with a constant sex ratio. Nine capture/recapture periods within three consecutive mating seasons revealed a continuous male biased sex ratio in the adult population with even trapping rates for the sexes. The male biased sex ratio could either be explained with postnatal female biased mortality or with a male biased natal sex ratio. This male biased sex ratio was apparent in all parts of the study site, indicating that the population was not subdivided into a female biased core and a male biased periphery. Furthermore, the majority of adult males have been captured at the same as or in vicinity to females. Consequently, a large proportion of males had spatial access to females during the mating season. No signs of monopolization of females by certain dominant males could be detected. These data support the predictions from the scramble competition model and the concept of a promiscuous mating system for this species.",Primates,,,,,,,

Here we assess the effects of coral loss versus declines in structural complexity on obligate and facultative coral feeding butterflyfishes on coral reefs in the central and western Indian Ocean. In the inner Seychelles, the abundance of the obligate coral feeding group declined markedly in response to live coral mortality (r2 = 0.48), but showed no further decline with respect to erosion of the physical matrix of the reef. Conversely, the facultative feeding group showed no decline in response to live coral loss, reflecting their feeding versatility; however they did decline in response to structural erosion of the reef framework (r2 = 0.26). There were no significant changes in either obligate or facultative corallivore abundances at a reference location (Chagos archipelago), highlighting that butterflyfish populations are stable in the absence of habitat disturbance. While specialised coral dependant fishes are highly vulnerable to coral loss caused by climate-induced coral bleaching, the structural collapse of dead coral colonies may have significant, but more variable, impacts across a wide range of fishes. If conservation and mitigation planning are to be effective, there is a clear need to better understand the mechanisms of reef structural collapse and the dynamics of system recovery following large-scale disturbance.",Biodiversity and Conservation,,,,,,,

261,"Teo, Steven L H and Block, Barbara A",Comparative Influence of Ocean Conditions on Yellowfin and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Catch from Longlines in the Gulf of Mexico,"<p>Directed fishing effort for Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), their primary spawning grounds in the western Atlantic, has been prohibited since the 1980s due to a precipitous decline of the spawning stock biomass. However, pelagic longlines targeted at other species, primarily yellowfin tuna and swordfish, continue to catch Atlantic bluefin tuna in the GOM as bycatch. Spatial and temporal management measures minimizing bluefin tuna bycatch in the GOM will likely become important in rebuilding the western Atlantic bluefin stock. In order to help inform management policy and understand the relative distribution of target and bycatch species in the GOM, we compared the spatiotemporal variability and environmental influences on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of yellowfin (target) and bluefin tuna (bycatch). Catch and effort data from pelagic longline fisheries observers (1993\^{a}€“2005) and scientific tagging cruises (1998\^{a}€“2002) were coupled with environmental and biological data. Negative binomial models were used to fit the data for both species and Akaike's Information Criterion (corrected for small sample size) was used to determine the best model. Our results indicate that bluefin CPUE had higher spatiotemporal variability as compared to yellowfin CPUE. Bluefin CPUE increased substantially during the breeding months (March-June) and peaked in April and May, while yellowfin CPUE remained relatively high throughout the year. In addition, bluefin CPUE was significantly higher in areas with negative sea surface height anomalies and cooler sea surface temperatures, which are characteristic of mesoscale cyclonic eddies. In contrast, yellowfin CPUE was less sensitive to environmental variability. These differences in seasonal variability and sensitivity to environmental influences suggest that bluefin tuna bycatch in the GOM can be reduced substantially by managing the spatial and temporal distribution of the pelagic longline effort without substantially impacting yellowfin tuna catches.</p>",PLoS ONE,,,,,,,

The current estimate of the population of the Andean condor Vultur gryphus is based on limited local counts. Simultaneous censuses of 10 condor communal roosts were therefore conducted during 2006--2006 in north-west Patagonia, Argentina, to obtain a minimum population number, to estimate the size of the local population, and to describe use of the roosts by season and age classes. I fitted the data to two asymptotic models to calculate the population of condors as a function of the number of communal roosts surveyed. In an area of c. 6,300 km2 I obtained a minimum population size of 246 individuals by direct observation, and a population estimate of 296 condors (range 260--260) by applying the models. This population, the largest known of this species, comprises 68.5\% adults and 31.5\% immatures. Condors had large aggregations in some communal roosts and used the area seasonally, increasing in numbers from autumn to spring and decreasing in summer. Longterm monitoring of communal roosts across the Andean condor's range is essential for the monitoring of this rare and vulnerable species.",Oryx,,,,,,,

The ecology of small mammals inhabiting semiarid Chile is strongly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During La Nina events in this area, dry conditions prevail and species may disappear from the thorn-scrub habitat. Conversely, El Nino events bring high rainfall, and associated pulses of food trigger small-mammal population increases. We used capture-mark-recapture to study responses of the degu (Octodon degus), a dominant small mammal, to variation in rainfall over 18 years. In response to a recent trend toward wetter conditions, degus reached record-high densities and maintained more stable numbers in the area. Underlying mechanisms involved variation in adult survival, juvenile persistence, and fecundity linked to rainfall changes during consecutive years (i.e., rainfall phases). During prolonged droughts, degus had low survival and produced fewer offspring, with low persistence. Following high rainfall, these parameters reversed; consecutive wet years resulted in further increases. Weak declines in fecundity and adult survival and high persistence of juveniles explained delayed responses to deteriorating conditions in initial dry years. If GCC leads to increased frequency of El Nino events, we anticipate greater numerical dominance of degus in semiarid Chile and possible range expansion. Furthermore, degus have strong impacts on other small mammal and some plant species, are important prey species, and are agricultural pests and disease reservoirs. Hence, GCC has the potential to dramatically influence their ecology in northern Chile and to have cascading effects on other components of this system.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

We describe the reintroductions of large carnivores (>10 kg) that have occurred in the Eastern Cape and use various criteria to assess their success. Lion Panthera leo reintroduction has been highly successful with a population of 56 currently extant in the region and problems of overpopulation arising. The African wild dog Lycaon pictus population has increased to 24 from a founder population of 11. Preliminary results for spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta also indicate success. Wild populations of leopards Panthera pardus exist on several reserves and have been supplemented by translocated individuals, although deaths of known individuals have occurred and no estimate of reproduction is available. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus reintroduction has also been less successful with 36 individuals reintroduced and 23 cubs being born but only 41 individuals surviving in 2005.

Early annual population growth rates were high ranging from 13--13\% partly due to immigration of moose from Russia and Byelorussia. However, after fully occupying forest habitat and expanding to treeless biotopes, reproductive efficiency declined. This decline was influenced by large spatial isolation of suitable habitat; 52\% of solitary males and 48\% of solitary females were in isolated biotopes during breeding. Further, 8\% of adult bulls were in herds without cows, and 21\% of cows were in herds without bulls. Although individual productivity was good, 1.3[plus or minus]0.1 /pregnant cow and 0.4/ adult cow, isolation caused low participation in breeding (38.5\% of adult cows), low number of calves (17.1\% of population), and low annual population growth rate ([approximately equal] 6\%/yr). The steppe moose population reached its maximum (n = 2776) in 1974 followed by steep decline; the decline was associated with harvests of 16.1\% in 1973 and 12.5\% in 1974, of which about 50\% were adult animals. The population reached a second peak (n = 2147) in 1982 and declined gradually until 1992. A steep, annual population decline of 25.3[plus or minus]5.8\% occurred after 1992; this decline was associated with excessive harvest beyond the annual population growth rate. Moose were extirpated from most regions of the steppe zone by the late 20th century. The current southern range of moose is limited to forest habitat, and except for a remnant population of about 80, the unique steppe population has disappeared from Ukraine.",Alces,,,,,,,
285,"Rongo, T and van Woesik, R","The effects of natural disturbances, reef state, and herbivorous fish densities on ciguatera poisoning in Rarotonga, southern Cook Islands","Ciguatera poisoning is a critical public-health issue among Pacific island nations. Accurately predicting ciguatera outbreaks has become a priority, particularly in Rarotonga in the outhern Cook Islands, which has reported the highest incidence of ciguatera poisoning globally. Since 2006, however, cases of ciguatera poisoning have declined, and in 2011 iguatera cases were the lowest in nearly 20 years. Here we examined the relationships between cases of ciguatera poisoning, from 1994 to 2011, and: (i) coral cover, used as a proxy of reef state, (ii) the densities of herbivorous fishes, and (iii) reef disturbances. We found that coral cover was not a good predictor of cases of ciguatera poisoning, but high densities of the herbivorous fish Ctenochaetus striatus and reef disturbances were both strong predictors of ciguatera poisoning. Yet these two predictors were correlated, because the densities of C. striatus increased only after major cyclones had disturbed the reefs. Since 2006, the number of cyclones has decreased considerably in Rarotonga, because of the climatic shift toward the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We suggest that fewer cyclones have led to decreases in both the densities of C. striatus and of the number of reported cases of ciguatera poisoning in Rarotonga.",Toxicon,,,,,,,

Population size, number of incoming individuals in the population, and age structure varied seasonally, reflecting the reproductive cycle of the species. The instantaneous rate of population increase did not differ from zero throughout the study. In general, the permanence rates of juveniles and adults were low, indicating a large turnover of individuals in the population, with a maximum life expectancy of three years. The sex-ratio among adults was biased toward females. Since no bias was observed among juveniles and there was no difference in adult permanence between sexes, we suggest that the biased adult sex-ratio resulted from a lower permanence of males during a short ontogenetic period, when secondary sexual characteristics develop. When compared to T. itambere, the studied population of T. torquatus attained a higher density and a greater female bias in the sex-ratio. In general, the studied population presented characteristics that, according to life history theory, should be associated with early age at maturity and polygyny: short life expectancy, high population turn over, and female biased sex-ratios.",Phyllomedusa,,,,,,,

More than 50 thousand nestings were recorded annually in 1988 and 1992, but only 10 to 15 thousand annually in 1978--1978, 1993, and 1995, with intermediate numbers of 20 to 30 thousand annually in 1987, 1989, 1991, and 1994.

Many ecosystems are characterized by pulses of dramatically higher than normal levels of foods (pulsed resources) to which animals often respond by caching foods for future use. However, the extent to which animals use cached foods and how this varies in relation to fluctuations in other foods is poorly understood in most animals. 2. Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus (L.) cache thousands of eggs annually at large goose colonies where eggs are often superabundant during the nesting period by geese. We estimated the contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets in spring and autumn, when geese were not present in the study area, by comparing stable isotope ratios ([delta]13C and [delta]15N) of fox tissues with those of their foods using a multisource mixing model in Program IsoSource. 3. The contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets was inversely related to collared lemming Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Traill) abundance; the contribution of cached eggs to overall fox diets increased from < 28\% in years when collared lemmings were abundant to 30--30\% in years when collared lemmings were scarce. 4. Further, arctic foxes used cached eggs well into the following spring (almost 1 year after eggs were acquired) - a pattern that differs from that of carnivores generally storing foods for only a few days before consumption. 5. This study showed that long-term use of eggs that were cached when geese were superabundant at the colony in summer varied with fluctuations in collared lemming abundance (a key component in arctic fox diets throughout most of their range) and suggests that cached eggs functioned as a buffer when collared lemmings were scarce.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Using data collected over 37 years in the western Italian Alps, we assessed the trends in distribution, abundance, fecundity and breeding population structure of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos. Using the spatial distribution of territory centroids in 2007, we found that the spatial distribution of eagle territories was over-dispersed up to 3 km. Although population size and total productivity increased from 1972 to 2008, the proportion of pairs that laid eggs showed a strong decline, falling to no more than 50\% after 2003. On average, 15\% of successful nests produced two fledglings, and productivity also declined over time. No significant relationship between population growth rate and total population size was detected, but the percentage of pairs that bred and breeding success showed evidence of density dependence, as they declined significantly with increasing density. Our results suggest that density dependence, operating across heterogeneous habitats, is currently regulating this population, while the carrying capacity may still be increasing. This may explain the apparent paradox of reduced breeding effort despite increasing total productivity.",Ibis,,,,,,,

Numbers of breeding birds were fluctuating quite strongly in the first 30 years of the twentieth century. From 1930 to the mid-1950s, a relatively steady decrease occurred. A minimum was reached in 1965 with 2,243 pairs. Around 1970, numbers increased quite markedly up to the mid-1990s and reached a centurial maximum with 10,138 pairs in 1996. Most recently, the numbers have dropped to only 5,681 pairs in 2005, the lowest number over the last 30 years. Some colonies have existed over long periods, others only for short periods, with often substantial and sudden changes. The distribution at sea was studied by transect counts from ships. During the reproductive period, high totals were found between the mainland coast and the islands, up to 30 km from the outer coast/island line. The seaward extent of the sandwich tern distribution coincided quite well with the 20-m depth line. Maximum foraging ranges for single colonies were estimated to be ca. 45 km for Trischen, ca. 35 km for Norderoog and ca. 30 km for both Scharhorn/Nigehorn and Juist. Overall flight ranges for all colonies were estimated at 33.8 km for 95\% of the birds. Germany has a high international responsibility for the protection of this species. Only a few colonies exist every year, making this species very vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance, pollution events and fishing activities.",Journal of Ornithology,,,,,,,

Mailed questionnaires and an extensive process of questioning local villagers and Forest Service employees about recent observations of tigers and leopards provided a basis for identifying areas of interest and delineating field routes to be surveyed. Over 600 km were covered on 67 routes by 4 teams of investigators. Responses to questionnaires and interviews, and results of field surveys suggested that 5-7 tigers occurred in eastern Heilongjiang in the 1999 winter. However, the data suggest that there no longer exists a resident, stable population anywhere in Northeast China, and that, with the possible exception of the Eastern Wandashan Mountains, no reproduction of young is occurring. These results, in concert with results from Jilin (Yang et al. 1998), indicate that Amur tigers in Northeast China exist largely as nomadic, isolated individuals, and that there is no breeding nucleus to sustain this population. We therefore conclude that the Amur tiger is on the verge of extinction in Northeast China, and that it is presently sustained by emigration of individuals from Russia. The extinction of tigers in Northeast China can only be averted if an immediate and long-term commitment is made to conservation of this subspecies in the wild. Perhaps 3-5 Far Eastern leopards still occur in eastern Heilongjiang Province. With the exception of the Laoyeling region, leopards were probably historically rare in Heilongjiang. As with the tiger, there is no evidence of a stable, resident population anywhere in Northeast China. More than the tiger, survival of this leopard subspecies is dependent on securing habitat in China. Protection of habitat in Laoyeling region of Heilongjiang can play a vital role in protecting the last population of Far Eastern leopards. Prey populations seem to be critically low in most areas surveyed. Intensive poaching appears to be the primary cause of prey depletion, and tiger recovery will be largely dependent on recovery of prey populations (red deer, wild boar, and roe deer). Removal of snares, and control of illegal hunting activities will be key for increasing prey populations. Based on surveys in Russia, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, it is assumed that two spatially separated populations of Amur tigers exist: the Tumen River Population, which occurs in southwest Primorskii Krai Russia, Jilin Province, southern Heilongjiang (Laoyeling and Zhangguangcailing), and possibly North Korea; and the Sikhote-Alin Population (of which the Wandashan tigers represent a sub-population). Conservation plans should seek to protect both populations and retain connectivity of all subpopulations within each of these populations, irrespective of provincial or international boundaries. A land-use plan is proposed to conserve these two populations of tigers in Northeast China by connecting protected areas across provincial and international boundaries with three levels of land use: strictly protected areas, tiger management zones, and ecological corridors linking management areas. If implemented, recovery of prey populations will lead to natural emigration and establishment of resident, breeding populations of tigers in Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces. It is estimated that the Tumen River Tiger Population could consist of as many as 42 tigers (including 21 resident, breeding females) across Russia, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and that 17 tigers could exist in the Wandashan-Strelnikov subpopulation. Tigers in northern Laoyeling and Pogranichny Raion Russia can only be conserved if they are linked to Southwest Primorye via an ecological corridor and tiger management lands in Northern and Southern Laoyeling. This same complex of managed lands in Laoyeling will be critical to long-term survival of the Far Eastern leopard population. Specific management guidelines are proposed for tiger management zones. The proposed land-use plan is compatible with the Project for Protection of Natural Forests enacted by the Chinese government. Immediate actions are necessary to insure the recovery of tigers in Northeast China.",,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to monitor the populations of the marsupials Didelphis aurita and Philander frenatus and the rodents Nectomys squamipes, Akodon cursor and Oligorysomys nigripes in a locality of typical Brazilian rural landscape, Sumidouro Municipality, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. A mark-recapture study was conducted during five years. We analyzed the population dynamics, the reproduction and age structure of these species. Both marsupials presented higher population sizes in the end of wet period and beginning of the dry period, which can be explained by the seasonal reproduction which begins in the middle of the dry period and ends in the last months of the wet period. N. squamipes reproduced throughout the year but mostly during rainy periods, due to the close association of this rodent to resources found in the water. Higher survivorship and recruitment rates were in the end of the wet season. The rodent A. cursor had an opportunist reproduction, resulting in high turnover rates. Survivorship increased with the effects of the dry periods. O. nigripes showed a clear annual pattern of population cycle with peaks during the dry season. The rodents did not show potential to present outbreaks and become agricultural pests. The annual population cycles of O. nigripes and the unique peak of A. cursor population during five years highlight attention to their importance as wild reservoirs of the hantavirus disease. Their ecological characteristics associated to their opportunistic behavior make these species prone to be good reservoirs of zoonoses. © 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft f\""{u}r S\""{a}ugetierkunde.",Mammalian Biology,,,,,,,

Within the Neotropics, the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon; however, recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in Central America are waning as well. Unfortunately, very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical America. Here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the Central Amazon, sampled first in 1984–1985 and again in 2007. We find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of 22 years at this site. This conclusion differs markedly from the decline of 75\% in amphibian popu- lations over 35 years at a lowland site in Costa Rica. To explore potential declines in lowland Neotropical amphibian populations in detail, we suggest that existing baseline data be comprehensively compiled and analyzed for previously sampled sites and that these sites be re-sampled using comparable methodologies.",Biodiversity and Conservation,,,,,,,

367,"Crawford, R. J M",A recent increase of swift terns Thalasseus bergii off South Africa - The possible influence of an altered abundance and distribution of prey,"In the 2000s, there were large increases in the numbers of swift terns Thalasseus bergii breeding in the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa, which are most plausibly attributed to good recruitment and to an increase in the proportion of mature birds breeding. Numbers increased coincidentally with a greatly increased abundance of two of the main prey species of swift terns, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, and remained high as these resources decreased. After 2005, numbers of swift terns breeding in the north and central portions of the Western Cape decreased, whereas numbers breeding farther south in that province increased. This followed displacements to the south and east of sardine and anchovy. In southern Africa, swift terns show low fidelity to breeding localities, which enables a rapid adjustment of the location of breeding to an altered availability of prey. For two seabirds that feed mainly on sardine and anchovy, but once breeding show high fidelity to colonies, African penguin Spheniscus demersus and Cape gannet Morus capensis, proportions breeding in the south and east also increased, but there were substantial decreases in overall numbers breeding in the Western Cape. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared changes in population growth rates based on elephant numbers and densities over 1973--1973. Population estimates and survey details extracted from published and unpublished sources allowed us to calculate growth rates. From 1973 to 1993 growth rate was positive when based on elephant numbers but did not differ from zero when calculated for densities. This discrepancy may be because of the significant increase in survey area during the same period. In contrast, none of the growth rates differed from zero for time series between 1996 and 2004, when the size of the survey area varied little. We propose two explanations for these results. The first suggests that the population did not grow, while the second proposes that the population expanded its range and increased in size. Notwithstanding, an equilibrium model best explained the variance in dry season estimates of elephant numbers for the complete time series. Such apparent density-dependence could be disrupted by any artificial reduction of numbers through culling as a management option in northern Botswana.",Oryx,,,,,,,

Annual number of owl nests showed a 3 year cyclicity, which as predicted, corresponded to the length of the vole cycle in the region. Mean annual brood size also fluctuated and was positively dependent on the vole supply during the same spring. In this region, there has also been a decline in vole numbers in recent decades, from high-amplitude cycles in the 1970s to subsequent low-amplitude cycles. Correspondingly, and as predicted, mean annual brood size of the owls also declined, although only during the third years of the vole cycle when vole supply in spring and brood size of the owls is at its highest level in high-amplitude cycles. We predict that in the long run the vole decline, associated with increasingly milder winters, and the reduction of the brood size of the owls, especially in years of high owl breeding success, will have serious implications for the population of great grey owls in Scandinavia.",Canadian Journal of Zoology,,,,,,,
397,"Jefferson, Thomas A and Hung, Samuel K",A review of the status of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in Chinese waters,"The status of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Chinese waters (including Taiwan) is reviewed. Within China, humpback dolphins range from the Vietnam border north to the mouth of the Yangtze River, and there are estimated to be about eight populations in China. Little is known of stock structure, except for a preliminary conclusion that animals in Xiamen and Hong Kong represent separate populations. Abundance has been estimated only for Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary (about 1,500 animals) and Xiamen (80 dolphins). In the early 1960s, 36 animals were killed in Xiamen Harbor, but other direct takes appear to be rare. Incidental catches are known in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary, but their impacts are not known. Only preliminary work on life history has been conducted. There appears to be a calving peak from spring to summer, and calves are about 100 cm long at birth. Scant data indicate that sexual maturity in females may occur at about 9--9 years of age, with males maturing later. Dolphins in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary have individual ranges averaging 99.5 km2, only a small portion of the population's range. Humpback dolphins in China feed on several species of demersal and estuarine fishes, with little evidence of predation on cephalopods or crustaceans. Contaminants have been evaluated in some areas, and mercury and DDT concentrations in particular appear to be high and potentially health-threatening. An assessment of trends and stranding mortality in the Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary population suggests that this stock is probably not decreasing at present. The Xiamen stock is thought to be decreasing, but its status has not been reliably assessed. Essentially, nothing is known of the status of other populations in China, and this shortcoming should be addressed as a matter of priority.",Aquatic Mammals,,,,,,,

However, determining the number of pumas responsible for creating this sign is problematic. We addressed this difficulty by categorizing physical evidence (sign) and applied this method during the Puma concolor coryi (Florida Panther) project. Three rules were used to distinguish individuals. (1) Gender was determined by track size or stride length; (2) time (freshness) was determined by known events within the past 24 hours, such as wind or rain; and (3) distance between individual track sets was used as an exclusionary tool to avoid over-counting. We evaluated accuracy by capture and by comparison to 3 other indices. This method can be adapted to count other large felines.",Southeastern Naturalist,,,,,,,

To prevent extinction, captive breeding efforts have been initiated; however, given the overall decline, it is not known to what extent levels of genetic diversity currently exist in the remaining populations. Here we document temporal genetic diversity levels during the 2000--2000 interval for the last remaining breeding colony of oriental white-backed vultures in Pakistan, and show with simulations that a much larger captive population size is required than currently maintained to prevent further loss of genetic diversity. Before this species is extinct in the wild, it is crucial that additional individuals are included in the captive population. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Florencia and Dans, Silvana L. and Garaffo, Griselda V.",Abundance and distribution of endangered Franciscana dolphins in Argentine waters and conservation implications,"This is the first study in Argentine waters on the abundance of the threatened Franciscana dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei. During 2003-2004 we carried out 17 aerial surveys using line transect sampling methodology. We observed 101 Franciscanas in 71 sightings. In northern areas density was estimated at 0.106 individual/km2. Density was lower in southern areas (0.055/km2) and declined with depth beyond 30-m isobaths (0.05/km2). A correction factor for submerged dolphins was applied to density and then extrapolated to the strip between the coastline and the 30-m isobath. Abundance in the northern area was estimated at 8,279 (4,904-13,960) individuals, while in the southern area it was estimated at 5,896 (1,928-17,999) individuals. Considering an annual mortality of about 500-800 individuals, about 3.5\%-5.6\% of the stock may be removed each year by the fishery and over the 2\% recommended by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and may not be sustainable by the population. Higher densities in coastal areas make Franciscanas more vulnerable to coastal fishing camps, which increased mortality in recent years. A remarkable finding was that while density decreases to the south, values of catch per unit effort (CPUE) increases, indicating different catchability of dolphins between areas",Marine Mammal Science,,,,,,,

For some populations, however, climate change may render particular environments more favourable, with positive effects on population growth. We used a 30-year population dataset on over 2000 Common Eiders Somateria mollissima at a colony in southwest Iceland to examine the response of this species to climate fluctuations. Eiders are strongly dependent on suitable climatic conditions for successful reproduction and survival. Temperatures in southwest Iceland, in both winter and summer, have generally increased over the past 30 years but have shown considerable fluctuation. We show that females laid earlier following mild winters and that year-to-year variation in the number of nests was related to the temperature during the breeding season 2 years previously. Milder summers could have positive effects on breeding success and offspring survival, producing an increase in nest numbers 2 years later when most Eiders recruit into the breeding population. In this part of their range, Eiders could benefit from a general warming of the climate.",Ibis,,,,,,,

The presence/absence of a species at a particular site is the simplest form of data that can be collected during ecological field studies. We used 13 years (1990--1990) of survey data to parameterize a stochastic patch occupancy model for a metapopulation of the yellow-bellied marmot in Colorado, and investigated the significance of particular patches and the influence of site quality, network characteristics and regional stochasticity on the metapopulation persistence. 2. Persistence of the yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation was strongly dependent on the high quality colony sites, and persistence probability was highly sensitive to small changes in the quality of these sites. 3. A relatively small number of colony sites was ultimately responsible for the regional persistence. However, lower quality satellite sites also made a significant contribution to long-term metapopulation persistence, especially when regional stochasticity was high. 4. The northern network of the marmot metapopulation was more stable compared to the southern network, and the persistence of the southern network depended heavily on the northern network. 5. Although complex models of metapopulation dynamics may provide a more accurate description of metapopulation dynamics, such models are data-intensive. Our study, one of the very few applications of stochastic patch occupancy models to a mammalian species, suggests that stochastic patch occupancy models can provide important insights into metapopulation dynamics using data that are easy to collect.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

442,"Allen, B M and Angliss, R P","Alaska Marine Mammal Stock Assessments, 2009","On 30 April 1994, Public Law 103-238 was enacted allowing significant changes to provisions within the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Interactions between marine mammals and commercial fisheries are addressed under three new sections. This new regime replaced the interim exemption that has regulated fisheries- related incidental takes since 1988. Section 117, Stock Assessments, required the establishment of three regional scientific review groups to advise and report on the status of marine mammal stocks within Alaska waters, along the Pacific Coast (including Hawaii), and the Atlantic Coast (including the Gulf of Mexico). This report provides information on the marine mammal stocks of Alaska under the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service. Each stock assessment includes, when available, a description of the stock’s geographic range, a minimum population estimate, current population trends, current and maximum net productivity rates, optimum sustainable population levels and allowable removal levels, and estimates of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury through interactions with commercial fisheries and subsistence hunters. These data will be used to evaluate the progress of each fishery towards achieving the MMPA’s goal of zero fishery-related mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. The Stock Assessment Reports should be considered working documents, as they are updated as new The Stock Assessment Reports were originally developed in 1995 (Small and information becomes available. DeMaster 1995). Revisions have been published for the following years: 1996 (Hill et al. 1997), 1998 (Hill and DeMaster 1998), 1999 (Hill and DeMaster 1999), 2000 (Ferrero et al. 2000), 2001 (Angliss et al. 2001), 2002 (Angliss and Lodge 2002), 2003 (Angliss and Lodge 2004), 2005 (Angliss and Outlaw 2005), 2006 (Angliss and Outlaw 2007), 2007 (Angliss and Outlaw, 2008), and 2008 (Angliss and Allen, 2009). Each stock assessment report is designed to stand alone and is updated as new information becomes available. The MMPA requires stock assessment reports to be reviewed annually for stocks designated as strategic, annually for stocks where there are significant new information available, and at least once every 3 years for all other stocks. New information for all strategic stocks (Steller sea lions, northern fur seals, Cook Inlet beluga whales, AT1 transient killer whales, harbor porpoises, sperm whales, humpback whales, fin whales, North Pacific right whales, and bowhead whales), were reviewed in 2008-2009. This review, and a review of other stocks, led to the revision of the following stock assessments for the 2009 document: Steller sea lion (western and eastern U.S. stocks), northern fur seal, harbor seal (southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea stocks), spotted seal, bearded seal, ringed seal, ribbon seal, killer whale (AT1 transient), Pacific white-sided dolphin, harbor porpoise (southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea stocks), Dall’s porpoise, sperm whale, central and western stocks of humpback whales, fin whale, North Pacific right whale, and bowhead whale. The stock assessment reports for all stocks, however, are included in this document to provide a complete reference. Those sections of each stock assessment report containing significant changes are listed in Appendix Table 1. The authors solicit any new information or comments which would improve future stock assessment reports. The U. S.

Aerial photographs provided data to compare nest densities within six vegetation types in an area where buffalo grazed throughout the study with an area where buffalo were removed midway through. Buffalo had no significant effect on the abundance or distribution of vegetation types important to geese for breeding. However, high densities of buffalo suppressed the growth of several other species, particularly the grass Hymenachne acutigluma which increasingly displaced the deep water spike-rush Eleocharis sphacelata after buffalo were removed. The annual number of nests fluctuated between 7 and 2028, apparently in response to rain. Most nests were built in the spike-rush/wildrice Eleocharis spp./Oryza rufipogon association (71\%) and in E. sphacelata (20\%). Buffalo trampling and grazing influenced the location of nests but not number. After buffalo were removed, more nests were built in deep water areas at the forest edge of the floodplain.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

In this study, we examine the effects of these interactions on the dynamics of a vulnerable bird species, the Dalmatian pelican (Pelicanus crispus). We conducted demographic analysis and population dynamics modelling of the Amvrakikos pelican population (western Greece) based on a 20-y dataset. Results indicated that annual juvenile survival probability is low (mean = 0.65) and varies according to both negative (regulation) and positive (Allee effect) density-dependent processes. In contrast, adult survival is relatively high (mean = 0.95) and less variable. Deterministic and stochastic population dynamics models based on means, inter-annual variances, and covariances between vital rates revealed that the population is increasing deterministically. Simulations of the extinction risk for the study population and also for various population sizes revealed that short-term extinction risk remains extremely low, even for very small populations of the species. However, when we considered the possibility of rare catastrophic events and their interactions with density-dependence patterns, the projected extinction risk increased dramatically, especially for small populations. Given that many European Dalmatian pelican populations are small, most of them could be at risk for local extinction. Our results illustrate the critical and general importance of considering interactions between all potential factors of extinction in population viability assessments.",Ecoscience,,,,,,,

They include management policies, market changes, the ban of the drift-net fishery, expansion of the modern purse seine fleet, and implementation of a stock recovery plan. To enhance current knowledge about the population's status, we conducted a long-term analysis (1993-2010) of scientific data and standardized catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) from the traditional trap fishery of Sardinia (Western Mediterranean, Italy), which is the last active bluefin trap fishery in the Mediterranean. We detected a significant increase of the standardized CPUE and a significant decrease in mean weight over time. Cluster analysis conducted on 29,000 specimens revealed three different size groups that were distinct by time period: the 1993-1995 period was characterized by a significant presence of large bluefin; a decrease in mean weight occurred in the 1996-2006 period; and 2007-2010 was characterized by the prevalence of young adults in the history in the trap fishery. This trend, which needs to be confirmed over longer time and spatial scales, raises some ecological questions. In particular, is the occurrence of these young adults a consequence of changes in the migratory behavior of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, or does it reflect the actual demography of this population? The results of this study emphasize that data from traditional traps provide valuable long term scientific information about population parameters through time, and thus the use of traps as monitoring stations should continue in the future. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Fisheries Research,,,,,,,

The abundances of walleye pollock larvae hatched on a given day and surviving through the early feeding stage were determined by in situ sampling and otolith analysis for 1983 and 1985 to 1991. Periods of anomalously low or high larval survival were determined by comparing observed first-feeding date distributions of survivors sampled in late May surveys with expected first-feeding date distributions from a model utilizing information on spawning time and abundance, measured egg mortality, assumed larval mortality, and survey date. The cube of the wind speed represented daily estimates of mixing for the same years; wind speeds were determined from gridded sea-level pressure data using a geotriptic wind model. When the resulting daily distributions of larval abundance and mixing were compared, 2 patterns emerged: (1) strong wind mixing events during the first-feeding period were associated with periods of lower than expected larval survival, and (2) periods of higher than expected larval survival were associated with calm with periods often bracketed by strong mixing. The results indicate that over the 8 yr of observation strong mixing events during the first-feeding period were detrimental to survival of pollock larvae.",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

A drift fence completely encircling an ephemeral pond was used to capture all adult salamanders migrating into or out of the pond, and passive integrated transponders were used to provide individual identification. The Jolly-Seber method of population estimation was used to estimate three population parameters (size, gains, and survivorship); population growth rate was also estimated. Gains varied annually, ranging from 24 6 16 to 101 6 24, and population growth rate was low (r 5 0.18 6 0.188), suggesting inconsistent recruitment. Consistent with life history parameters of long-lived, late-maturing species, survivorship (range 0.629 6 0.064 to 0.699 6 0.08) and breeding population sizes (range 189 6 24 to 260 6 16) remained essentially constant.

468,"Crump, Martha L and Hensley, Frank R and Clark, Kenneth L",Apparent Decline of the Golden Toad: Underground or Extinct?,"Bufo periglenes, the golden toad, is an endangered species endemic to Costa Rica. Every year from the early 1970s through 1987 golden toads have emerged from retreats to breed during April-June. The most recent known breeding episode occurred during April-May 1987; more than 1500 adults were observed at five breeding pools, but a maximum of 29 tadpoles metamorphosed from these sites. During April-June 1988-90, we found only 11 toads during surveys of the breeding habitat. To examine the species' apparent decline, we analyzed data on rainfall, water temperature, and pH of the breeding pools. Our baseline data on weather patterns and characteristics of the breeding habitat suggest that warmer water temperatures and less advective precipitation during dry season post-1987 may have produced adverse breeding conditions. The toads may be alive and hiding in retreats awaiting appropriate weather conditions. The apparent scarcity of toads may reflect a normal population re- sponse to an unpredictable environment. On the other hand, because other an- urans with different breeding specializations seem to be declining from the area as well, one wonders whether warmer temperatures and dry conditions could be responsible for real population declines. Because the habitat is protected and pristine, potential causes of anuran de- clines such as habitat destruction, introduced predators, and collecting seem unlikely. Measurements of pH of the breeding pools, cloud water, and precipi- tation do not suggest acid precipitation effects, although we cannot rule out the possibility of environmental degradation some time prior to our measurements. Long-term monitoring programs combined with carefully controlled field ex- periments are needed to address factors responsible for declining amphibians.",Copeia,,,,,,,

Even though intensive aquaculture production of salmonids in lakes occurs in many locations around the world published studies on the survival and reproductive success of escaped cultured salmonids in freshwater ecosystems are not common. A recent expansion of aquaculture in Chile has led it to become the world's second largest producer of cultured salmonids.   2. We document the recent history of escaped and self-sustaining salmonid populations over a wide spatial scale and a long temporal scale in Chilean Patagonian lakes. Our hypotheses are that salmonid density in lakes will be higher where there is intensive aquaculture, due to greater numbers of potential escapees. Secondly, if non-native salmonids have adverse impacts on native fishes, increases in the abundance of non-native species should be associated with decreases in relative abundance of native species. Finally, if the first two hypotheses are correct we anticipate that diets of salmonids may show evidence of predation on native fishes, diet overlap with native species, and evidence of the influence of feed from aquaculture operations in the diets of salmonids and native fishes.   3. We sampled six lakes with gill nets from 1992 to 2001. Our results show that the relative abundance of free-living salmonids is closely related to the level of fish farming production. Salmonids are the top predators and in lakes with fish farming the main prey item is native fishes. The relative abundance of native fishes has decreased, most likely due to predation by salmonids.   4. Our study contributes to the understanding of the effects of non-native salmonids in oligotrophic lakes, and it provides a starting point to judge the establishment of new fish farming sites in lakes around the world.",Freshwater Biology,,,,,,,

The population of the Caravelas River estuary, eastern Brazil, was systematically monitored through a long-term mark-recapture experiment (2002–2009). Abundance estimates revealed a small population (57–124 dolphins), comprised of resident dolphins and individuals that temporarily leave or pass through the study area. Temporary emigration from the estuary to adjacencies ($\gamma$″= 0.33 ± 0.07 SE) and return rate (1 −$\gamma$′= 0 .67) were moderate and constant, indicating that some dolphins use larger areas. Survival rate (ϕ= 0.88 ± 0.07 SE) and abundance were constant throughout the study period. Power analysis showed that the current monitoring effort has high probability of detecting abrupt population declines (1 −$\beta$= 0.9). Although the monitoring is not yet sensitive to subtle population trends, sufficient time to identify them is feasible (additional 3 yr). Despite such apparent stability, this population, as many others, inhabits waters exposed to multiple human-related threats. Open and closed population modeling applied to photo-identification data provide a robust baseline for estimating several demographic parameters and can be applied to other populations to allow further comparisons. Such synergistic efforts will allow a reliable definition of conservation status of this species.",Marine Mammal Science,,,,,,,

Data from the same study were used to estimate the annual birth rate, and the survival rate of male calves, female calves, adult females and juvenile females; and to identify factors which would result in year-to-year variations in survival. The results of this analysis were incorporated into an age-structured model of the population's dynamics which took account of demographic and environmental stochasticity. This model was then used to determine the viability of the roan population in the park and to identify demographic characteristics whose occurrence could be used to predict when the population was most at risk of extinction. The risk of extinction could be predicted if the number of stable groups within the park was monitored in September of each year. This risk could be greatly reduced if a reciprocal arrangement was established with other protected areas such that the population in the park could be reinforced with new stable groups when the number of stable groups fell below three. However, the risks-- particularly of disease transfer--associated with such reinforcement programmes should be clearly recognized.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Keith and Forsman, Eric D.",Bald eagles and sea otters in the Aleutian archipelago: Indirect effects of trophic cascades,"Because sea otters (Enhydra lutris) exert a wide array of direct and indirect effects on coastal marine ecosystems throughout their geographic range, we investigated the potential influence of sea otters on the ecology of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA. We studied the diets, productivity, and density of breeding Bald Eagles on four islands during 1993-1994 and 2000-2002, when sea otters were abundant and scarce, respectively. Bald Eagles depend on nearshore marine communities for most of their prey in this ecosystem, so we predicted that the recent decline in otter populations would have an indirect negative effect on diets and demography of Bald Eagles. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effects on density of breeding pairs on four islands from 1993-1994 to 2000-2002. In contrast, diets and diet diversity of Bald Eagles changed considerably between the two time periods, likely reflecting a change in prey availability resulting from the increase and subsequent decline in sea otter populations. The frequency of sea otter pups, rock greenling (Hexagammus lagocephalus), and smooth lumpsuckers (Aptocyclus ventricosus) in the eagle's diet declined with corresponding increases in Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and various species of seabirds during the period of the recent otter population decline. Breeding success and productivity of Bald Eagles also increased during this time period, which may be due to the higher nutritional quality of avian prey consumed in later years. Our results provide further evidence of the wide-ranging indirect effects of sea otter predation on nearshore marine communities and another apex predator, the Bald Eagle. Although the indirect effects of sea otters are widely known, this example is unique because the food-web pathway transcended five species and several trophic levels in linking one apex predator to another.",Ecology,,,,,,,

Its distribution extends to the two Endemic Bird Areas within Cameroon (Guinea Congo forest biome and Cameroon mountain arc) and its population is thought to be in decline throughout its range due to increasing habitat fragmentation and disturbance. During March-April 2003 and June and October 2007 we surveyed Grey-necked Picathartes in the north-western region of the Mbam Minkom Mountain Forest. In January-March 2006 we surveyed the entire mountain range and found go breeding and 24 potential breeding sites, mostly located on the western slopes. From the complete survey, we estimated the population at 44 breeding individuals. Populations were highest in the north-west region but had apparently declined from 40 breeding individuals in 2003 to 20 in 2007. This region accounted for 41\% of the entire population on the mountain range during the 2006 survey. The Mbam Minkom/Kala Important Bird Area was designated based on the presence of Grey-necked Picathartes but is under high pressure of imminent destruction from agricultural encroachment and illegal timber exploitation. These results have important implications for decision making in delimiting forest boundaries and core areas for protection in the development of management plans. We suggest possible remedial actions, appropriate repeatable methods for future monitoring and opportunities for community involvement in the management and conservation of the site.",,,,,,,,
511,"Crawford, R. J M and Dyer, B. M. and Cooper, J. and Underhill, L. G.","Breeding numbers and success of Eudyptes penguins at Marion Island, and the influence of mass and time of arrival of adults","At sub-Antarctic Marion Island, there was substantial correlation in the numbers of adults breeding at study colonies of macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) over 26 years, as there was also for eastern rockhopper (E. chrysocome filholi) over 22 years, suggesting that overwintering conditions may influence the proportions of birds breeding. For both species the time of arrival of females for breeding, and for rockhopper penguins the mass of females on arrival, was significantly related to breeding success. Therefore, overwintering conditions may also affect breeding success. Trends in breeding success between study colonies were more strongly correlated for macaroni penguins than for rockhopper penguins. Macaroni penguins have a greater foraging range than rockhopper penguins when breeding, and may be more influenced at this stage by wider-scale environmental phenomena. For macaroni penguins, breeding success was significantly correlated with mass of chicks at fledging. For both species, mass on arrival of males was significantly correlated with that of females. Although both species had low masses on arrival after the El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation event of 1997/98, there was no significant correlation in mass on arrival between the two species. It is likely that at Marion Island their overwintering grounds are different.",CCAMLR Science,,,,,,,

The breeding season occurred during the rising and falling water periods. The size at first sexual maturity was significantly larger for females (88.5 cm Ls) than males (81.7 cm). Both males and females reproduce for the first time between their third and fourth year. The growth characteristics were estimated using length frequency analyses. Females grew systematically larger than males, the difference being about 9\% after the first year and increasing to 12\% for ten years old individuals. Mortality estimates, calculated from different models, some taking into account the effect of body size, ranged from 0.32 to 0.42 year-1 for natural mortality and from 0.72 to 0.82 year-1 for fishing mortality, indicating high fishing pressure in the Caqueta River, higher than in the Peruvian Amazon. Resulting exploitation rates (0.63 to 0.72) pointed towards overexploitation of the species in the Caqueta.

The opening addresses some general issues of problems with conventional thinking about intelligence. The rest of the article is divided into 4 main sections. The 1st argues that conventional and some other notions of intelligence are, at best, incomplete and, at worst, wrong. The 2nd section suggests an alternative notion of successful intelligence that expands on conventional notions of intelligence. The 3rd section discusses how we have gotten to the point in psychology and society in which we draw heavily on theories and tests that are inadequate. The final section draws some conclusions about the nature of intelligence. The main conclusion is that it is time to replace conventional notions of intelligence and especially the notion of a general factor of intelligence.

In long-lived animals with delayed maturity, the non-breeding component of the population may play an important role in buffering the effects of stochastic mortality. Populations of colonial seabirds often consist of more than 50\% non-breeders, yet because they spend much of their early life at sea, we understand little about their impact on the demographic process.2. Using multistate capture-mark-recapture techniques, we analyse a long-term data set of individually identifiable common guillemots, Uria aalge Pont., to assess factors influencing their immature survival and two-stage recruitment process.3. Analysis of the distribution of ringed common guillemots during the non-breeding season, separated by age classes, revealed that all age classes were potentially at risk from four major oil spills. However, the youngest age class (0--0 years) were far more widely spread than birds 4--4 years old, which were more widely spread than birds aged 6 and over. Therefore the chance of encountering an oil spill was age-dependent.4. A 2-year compound survival estimate for juvenile guillemots was weakly negatively correlated with winter sea-surface temperature, but was not influenced by oil spills. Non-breeder survival did not vary significantly over time.5. In years following four oil spills, juvenile recruitment was almost double the value in non-oil-spill years. Recent work from Skomer Island showed a doubling of adult mortality associated with major oil spills, which probably reduced competition at the breeding colony, allowing increased immature recruitment to compensate for these losses. We discuss the implications of compensatory recruitment for assessing the impact of oil pollution incidents.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

At northern Knight Island, a heavily oiled portion of the sound, sea otter abundance was reduced by a minimum of 50\% by the oil spill, and from 1995 through 1998 remained at an estimated 66\% lower than in 1973. Where sea otter densities were reduced, there were proportionally more large sea urchins. However, except in some widely scattered aggregations, both density and biomass of sea urchins were similar in an area of reduced sea otter density compared with an area where sea otters remained about 10 times more abundant. Furthermore, there was no change in kelp abundance in the area of reduced sea otter density. This is in contrast to greatly increased biomass of sea urchins and greatly reduced kelp density observed following an approximate 90\% decline in sea otter abundance in the western Aleutian Islands. The variation in community response to a reduction in sea otters may be related to the magnitude of the reduction and the non-linear response by sea urchins to changes in predator abundance. The number of surviving sea otters may have been high enough to suppress sea urchin populations in Prince William Sound, but not in the Aleutians. Alternatively, differences in response may have been due to differences in the frequency or magnitude of sea urchin recruitment. Densities of small sea urchins were much higher in the Aleutian system even prior to the reduction in sea otters, suggesting a higher rate of recruitment.",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

The new study duplicated previous methods and used the same sampling sites and the same gear employed during February sampling periods from 1986 to 1990. Overall, the species diversity and catch rates, as well as the numbers of penaeid prawn predators had changed little over 20 years. The overall catch rate for 2005 was 37.4 g m-1 h-1, not significantly different from the overall catch rate of 32.8 g m-1 h-1 (SE 6.6) for the period from 1987 to 1989. The results are discussed in relation to environmental factors and climate change, as well as the substantial declines in prawn catches, which had fallen from over 800 tonnes per annum prior to 1998, to about 70 tonnes per annum. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A decline in the percentage of hatchery coho salmon was related to declines in hatchery fish abundance and marine survival; wild coho salmon abundance was more stable. The declining marine survival of hatchery coho salmon appeared to be related to a fixed average date of release from hatcheries and a possibility of earlier prey production. The relatively stable abundance of wild coho salmon may relate to a natural trend toward earlier ocean entry dates. Oscillations in hatchery coho salmon percentage and abundance were related to oscillations in abundance of juvenile pink salmon O. gorbuscha. The impact of oscillating density affected marine survival of hatchery coho salmon more than that of wild coho salmon. Marine survival and abundance of hatchery and wild coho salmon in July were positively related to average fork length, indicating that growth within the first few months after ocean entry affected marine survival. However, absolute size was not important, as wild coho salmon were consistently smaller than hatchery coho salmon. Wild coho salmon responded to conditions in the marine ecosystem differently than hatchery coho salmon, as relationships among growth, survival, and abundance were apparent for wild coho salmon earlier in the year than for hatchery fish. The length increase between July and September was inversely related to marine survival, suggesting that fish that were larger in July grew less and survived better because they were storing more lipids than smaller coho salmon. The study indicated that a more experimental management strategy is needed for both hatchery and wild coho salmon.",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,,,,,,,

Historically the species was more widely distributed throughout the floodplain but now most of the population is confined to five wetlands in Anhui Province and to Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, where the majority (up to 113,000 birds) occur. Within-winter counts suggest that swans congregate at Poyang Lake before dispersing to other sites later in the winter. Counts show large between-year fluctuations, but suggest declines at Shengjin and Fengsha Lakes (both in Anhui) during the last five years. Declines at Shengjin Lake are likely due to decreases in submerged vegetation (particularly tuber-producing Vallisneria, a major food item) perhaps linked to eutrophication. Range contractions throughout the floodplain may also be linked to reductions in submerged vegetation coverage elsewhere. Changes in water quality and lake hydrology post-Three Gorges Dam may have adversely affected submerged vegetation productivity. Key information needs for the effective implementation of conservation measures for Tundra Swans include: (1) annual surveys of all major wintering sites throughout each winter to establish the importance of different sites during the non-breeding period; (2) more information on swan diets at important sites; and (3) an assessment of adverse effects of water quality and lake water levels post-Three Gorges Dam on submerged vegetation productivity at Poyang Lake and other important sites.

The increase came after removal of controls on gulls and was associated with supplementary food provided at rubbish tips and fish factories. The decrease resulted from predation of up to 85\% of gull chicks hatched at some colonies by Great White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus. Pelicans also were held at a low level in the early part of the 20th century by control measures and were later provided with additional food, in the form of agricultural offal and fish in impoundments. Disturbance by humans influenced trends at some smaller gull colo- nies and it is likely there was inter-colony transfer of first breeders. Decreases at the northern gull colonies and increases in numbers to the south and east correspond to a similarly altered distribution of several species of seabird and fish off South Africa, thought attributable to environmental change. At Dassen Island, the density of gull nests remained constant as the colony doubled, but decreased by 50\% as the colony decreased, suggesting that Kelp Gulls spaced out their nests more when sub- jected to predation.

Standard monthly counts from more than 200 defined sites within the Strait of Georgia were analysed using route-regression techniques to estimate population indices and assess trends in 57 waterbird species over a 12-year period spanning the non-breeding periods from 1999–2000 to 2010–11. A power analysis was also conducted to validate the rigor of the survey design. Results indicate that the survey is detecting annual changes of 3\% or less for populations of 29 waterbirds of a wide variety of guilds. Thirty-three species showed stable populations or no trend, 22 species showed significantly declining trends, and just three species showed significant increasing trends. We evaluate these results in the context of other long-term monitoring initiatives in the Salish Sea, highlighting specific birds to watch from a conservation perspective. Among those that showed a declining trend were a guild of piscivores, including Western and Horned Grebes, Common, Red-throated and Pacific Loons, and Rhinoceros Auklet; several sea ducks (Black and White-winged Scoters, Long-tailed Duck, Barrow’s Goldeneye, Harlequin Duck); two shorebirds (Dunlin, Surfbird); and Great Blue Heron. In the stable/no trend group were 20 species for which the Salish Sea is of recognised global or continental conservation importance, including one grebe, two cormorants, eight waterfowl (including five diving ducks), three shorebirds and two gulls. Next steps in the application of the B.C.

Dolphins in this region have the highest polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations recorded for any marine mammal and these concentrations correlate to distance from a Superfund point-source in the Turtle/Brunswick River Estuary (TBRE). Currently, little is known about the population structure of dolphins in this region. This study identifies and compares baseline data on abundance, habitat use, site-fidelity, and ranging patterns of dolphins across two adjacent field sites; Brunswick, including the TBRE, and Sapelo, including the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Sapelo is relatively undeveloped and was selected for comparison to the more contaminated TBRE. Dolphin densities increased with tributary size in both sites but dolphin density and total abundance were significantly higher in Sapelo than in Brunswick.

Wan-an Island in the south-west sector of the Taiwan Straits was found to be hotter and drier than Lanyu Island located south-east of Taiwan in the Pacific Ocean. The frequency of nesting attempts and the internesting intervals were both significantly greater (mean nesting attempts: 15.4 vs. 15.2, mean internesting interval: 13.7 vs. 10.6 days) for the Wan-an nesters. Nests were deeper (69.6 vs. 69.0 cm) while the incubation duration was shorter on this island (52.1 vs. 54.7 days). Green turtles were larger on Lanyu, but deposited smaller eggs. Nests on Lanyu had higher hatching success, hatchling emergence success and clutch survival rate (hatching success; 72.2 vs. 80.76\%, hatchling emergence success; 47 vs. 64.1\%, clutch survival rate; 67.7 vs. 70.3\%). However, hatchlings on Wan-an were larger (HC; 47.6 vs. 46.6 cm. HW; 23.9 vs. 21.7 cm). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from a total of 53 nesters indicated that both rookeries are genetically distinct FST=0.673, P<0.00001), with a single haplotype characterizing the Lanyu rookery n=13). This lack of gene flow between the two rookeries is evidence for localized natal homing and is consistent with the morphological and behavioral differences that we detected between the two rookeries. These findings are surprising given the close geographic proximity of the two rookeries.

The mean number of dolphins recorded during upstream surveys was 119.4 +/- 31.8 (range 88-174), with an encounter rate of 1.8 dolphins km(-1) (range 1.4-2.8). During these surveys a rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife was also documented, including the Indian smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, gharial Gavialis gangeticus, a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 water bird species. An assessment of fisheries documented 76 fish species of which 43\% were caught exclusively in monofilament gill nets, a gear known to kill dolphins by entanglement. Eight new records of fishes preyed upon by Ganges river dolphins were identified from the stomach contents of two dolphin carcasses (Setipinna brevifilis, Osteobrama cotio cotio, Puntius sophore, Crosochelius latius, Mystus cavasius, Heteropneustus fossilis, Macrognathus pancalus, Sperata seenghala). These fishes and other species previously recorded in the diet of the dolphins composed 33.3\% of the total catch sampled in 2001-2003. Interviews of 108 fishing households revealed that literacy rates were low (29.9\%) and almost 50\% earned less than USD 411 per year. The most important conservation actions that could be taken are for national and state governments to establish civil control and promote the development of community-based fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives could enjoy ownership rights to certain river segments in exchange for employing sustainable fishing techniques that are less injurious to dolphins",Oryx,,,,,,,

Of 11 taxa documented in the 1970s, 10 were observed in the 1990s; only Tantilla planiceps, a rare form in the 1970s, was absent in the 1990s. Nine of the 11 taxa were similar in abundance across sampling periods. Juvenile Pituophis catenifer and Crotalus viridis increased dramatically in the 1990s; adult Pituophis catenifer declined, whereas adult Crotalus viridis increased. Analysis of these two taxa indicated that abundance along the transect was approximately similar in the 1970s and 1990s; snakes were most abundant in the ecotone. Snake abundance was similar for the 1970s and 1990s in spite of increased road traffic, continued off-road vehicle use and sheep and cattle grazing, and collecting for the pet-trade. Additional study will be necessary to assess the apparent stability of this snake community.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Fifty-seven species representing 30 families were collected during the course of the study. Over 90\% of each sampling period's catch was composed of five taxa or less. These taxa included Atlantic and rough silversides, Menidia menidia and Membras martinica, bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, and bay and striped anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli and Anchoa hepsetus, with the relative contributions of these taxa varying among years. Both bluefish and anchovy abundances varied by an order of magnitude among years. Size-frequency distributions indicate summer-spawned bluefish recruit to the surf zone habitat as two cohorts in August and October, respectively. Fish abundance and richness were greater at substations closest to rock groins. Taxonomic richness declined along with decreasing water temperature in the fall, but was not correlated with turbidity or tide stage (measured as minutes before or after low tide). The extensive sampling effort undertaken in this study, 2190 seine hauls that captured 295 868 fish, was examined in relation to the number and relative proportions of taxa collected. Species accumulation curves and percent similarity calculations were used to investigate the adequacy of a reduced sampling protocol in characterizing the taxonomic composition of the surf zone fish community. Calculations from eight complete sampling periods (84 seine hauls each) indicate that a reduction in sampling effort by one-half would have yielded on average 75\% of the total number of species captured with approximately 85\% similarity in relative species composition.",Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,,,,,,,

Data on total length, condition and catch per unit effort (CPUE) were derived from the>5500 fish caught, the large majority of which were measured, tagged and released. Contrary to expectation, the length frequency of the McMurdo Sound catch was dominated by fish in the upper two-thirds of the overall distribution exhibited in the industrial catch for the Ross Sea shelf. Fish length and condition increased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s and then decreased. Fish length positively correlated with Ross Sea ice extent in early spring, a relationship possibly caused by more ice encouraging larger fish to move farther south over the shelf and into the study area. Fish condition positively correlated with the amount of open water in the Ross Sea during the previous summer (Feb), perhaps reflecting greater availability of prey with the higher productivity that more open water brings. Decreasing fish size corresponds to the onset of the fishery, which targets the large individuals. CPUE was constant through 2001 and then decreased dramatically. We hypothesize that this decrease is related to the industrial fishery, which began in the 1996-97 austral summer, and concentrates effort over the ice-free Ross Sea continental slope. As a result of limited prey choices and close coupling among mesopredators of the region, Antarctic toothfish included, the fishery appears to be dramatically altering the trophic structure of the Ross Sea.",Fish and Fisheries,,,,,,,
576,"Williams, Clayton J. and Boyer, Joseph N. and Jochem, Frank J.","Microbial activity and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content in a subtropical seagrass estuary (Florida Bay): Evidence for limited bacterial use of seagrass production","Bacterial abundance, production, and extracellular enzyme activity were determined in the shallow water column, in the epiphytic community of Thalassia testudinum, and at the sediment surface along with total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in Florida Bay, a subtropical seagrass estuary. Data were statistically reduced by principle components analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling and related to T. testudinum leaf total phosphorus content and phytoplankton biomass. Each zone (i.e., pelagic, epiphytic, and surface sediment community) was significantly dissimilar to each other (Global R = 0.65). Pelagic aminopeptidase and sum of carbon hydrolytic enzyme (esterase, peptidase, and $\alpha$- and $\beta$-glucosidase) activities ranged from 8 to 284 mg N m-2 day-1 and 113-1,671 mg C m-2 day -1, respectively, and were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than epiphytic and sediment surface activities. Due to the phosphorus-limited nature of Florida Bay, alkaline phosphatase activity was similar between pelagic (51-710 mg P m-2 day-1) and sediment (77-224 mg P m -2 day-1) zones but lower in the epiphytes (1.1-5.2 mg P m-2 day-1). Total (and/or organic) C (111-311 g C m -2), N (9.4-27.2 g N m-2), and P (212-1,623 mg P m -2) content were the highest in the sediment surface and typically the lowest in the seagrass epiphytes, ranging from 0.6 to 8.7 g C m -2, 0.02-0.99 g N m-2, and 0.5-43.5 mg P m-2. Unlike nutrient content and enzyme activities, bacterial production was highest in the epiphytes (8.0-235.1 mg C m-2 day-1) and sediment surface (11.5-233.2 mg C m-2 day-1) and low in the water column (1.6-85.6 mg C m-2 day-1). At an assumed 50\% bacterial growth efficiency, for example, extracellular enzyme hydrolysis could supply 1.8 and 69\% of epiphytic and sediment bacteria carbon demand, respectively, while pelagic bacteria could fulfill their carbon demand completely by enzyme-hydrolyzable organic matter. Similarly, previously measured T. testudinum extracellular photosynthetic carbon exudation rates could not satisfy epiphytic and sediment surface bacterial carbon demand, suggesting that epiphytic algae and microphytobenthos might provide usable substrates to support high benthic bacterial production rates. PCA revealed that T. testudinum nutrient content was related positively to epiphytic nutrient content and carbon hydrolase activity in the sediment, but unrelated to pelagic variables. Phytoplankton biomass correlated positively with all pelagic components and sediment aminopeptidase activity but negatively with epiphytic alkaline phosphatase activity. In conclusion, seagrass production and nutrient content was unrelated to pelagic bacteria activity, but did influence extracellular enzyme hydrolysis at the sediment surface and in the epiphytes. This study suggests that seagrass-derived organic matter is of secondary importance in Florida Bay and that bacteria rely primarily on algal/cyanobacteria production. Pelagic bacteria seem coupled to phytoplankton, while the benthic community appears supported by epiphytic and/or microphytobenthos production. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Marine Biology,,,,,,,

At adjacent North Reef, African Penguins ceased breeding before December 1988. In 1956, 850 pairs bred there. At Possession Island, 22 441 pairs of penguins bred colonially in 1956, but there were only 360 pairs in colonies in 1995 - a decrease of 98\%. By contrast, there were 804 solitary breeding pairs in 1956 and 535 in 1995 - a decrease of 33\%. All colonies at the southern portion of Possession Island and that at North Reef were abandoned by 1986. In the central and northern portions of Possession Island colonial breeding still persists, but as numbers have decreased colonies have fragmented. Minimal recruitment to the breeding population, probably resulting from food scarcity, is considered the most likely reason for the long-term decrease in penguin numbers. When penguins were abundant, there were insufficient suitable sites for solitary breeding and most birds bred in large colonies. Sites used by solitary breeders provide shade and restrict access by predators. Colonial breeding may have facilitated sharing information on the distribution of, and group foraging on, Sardine Sardinops sagax, the main food of penguins off Namibia in the 1950s.",Marine Ornithology,,,,,,,
582,"Armitage, K B and Downhower, J F",Demography of Yellow-Bellied Marmont Populations,"Marmot (Marmota flaviventris) populations are colonial or satellite. The number of adults of colonial populations is relatively stable; fluctuations occur primarily because of changes in numbers of young and yearlings. Population trends among five colonial populations are dissimilar. Satellite populations are unstable and reproduce at a lower rate than do colonial populations. Satellite marmots are shorter resident than colonial marmots. Both colonial and satellite females usually are longer resident than males. All adult colonial males and 41 \% of adult colonial females are recruited from other places; all satellite adults are recruited from other places. Losses of colonial marmots are attributed primarily to mortality during hibernation and emigration. Predation appears to be a minor source of mortality of colonial marmots, but may be of greater significance to satellite populations. Demographic relationships of individual colonies appear to be density-independent. Dispersal of colonial animals occurs primarily among yearlings, which have a higher expectation of reaching sexual maturity than young have. The major cause of dispersal is social pressure, but social stress is not simply density-dependent. The colonial social organization is more adaptive than the more nearly solitary (= satellite).",Ecology,,,,,,,

Reintroductions provide a good opportunity to study density-dependent population growth, as populations can be studied at a range of densities and the change in density is not confounded with environmental conditions. An understanding of density dependence is also necessary to predict dynamics of reintroduced populations under different management regimens, and assess the extent to which they can be harvested for further reintroductions. 2. We monitored a North Island saddleback (Philesturnus rufusater) population for 6 years after reintroduction to Mokoia, a 135 ha island in New Zealand that was made suitable for saddlebacks by eradicating introduced Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). We modelled adult and juvenile survival using Program MARK, and modelled numbers of young fledged per pair using Proc Mixed in SAS with individual female as a random factor. 3. Juvenile survival clearly declined as the population increased, and the decline was closely correlated with the number of breeding pairs. Reproduction also showed a clear decline that was explained by two factors: a difference in quality between territories occupied immediately after reintroduction and those occupied later, and an overall decline as the number of pairs increased. Reproduction was also strongly affected by age, and this needed to be accounted for when modelling density dependence. 4. A stochastic simulation model incorporating these dynamics closely predicted the observed population growth. The equilibrium population size was insensitive to density dependence in reproduction, but highly sensitive to density dependence in juvenile survival. 5. The model is being used to plan management strategies for potential reintroductions of saddlebacks to mainland areas with predator control. The species is currently confined to predator-free islands and one fenced mainland sanctuary.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

At the flyway scale, total numbers of breeding pairs decreased by 48\% during 2000--2000, after relatively stable breeding numbers in 1991--1991. The majority of the population nest in Finland and Sweden,where the number of breeding pairs has halved over the same period. After initial declines in winter numbers between 1991 and 2000, during 2000--2000, national wintering numbers increased in the Baltic Sea, but decreased in the Wadden Sea. The annual proportion of adult females in the Danish hunting bag data decreased from ca.45\%(1982) to ca.25\%(2009) and simultaneously the proportion of firstwinter birds fell from ca. 70\% to ca. 30\%, indicating dramatic structural changes in the Danish wintering numbers.

To describe temporal changes in the relative abundance of humpback whales around Abrolhos, seven years (1998--1998) of whale count data were collected during July through to November. During one-hour-scans, observers determined group size within 9.3 km (5 n.m.) of a land-based observing station. A total Of 930 scans, comprising 7996 sightings of adults and 2044 calves were analysed using generalized linear models that included variables for time of day, day of the season, years and two-way interactions as possible predictors. The pattern observed was the gradual build-up and decline in whale counts within seasons. Patterns and peaks of adult and calf counts varied among years. Although fluctuation was observed, there was generally an increasing trend in adult counts among years. Calf counts increased only in 2004. These fluctuations may have been caused by some environmental conditions in humpback whales' summering grounds and also by changes in spatial-temporal concentrations in Abrolhos Bank. The general pattern observed within the study area mirrored what was observed in the whole Abrolhos Bank. Knowledge of the consistency with which humpback whales use this important nursing area should prove beneficial for designing future monitoring programmes especially related to whale watching activities around Abrolhos Archipelago.",Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom,,,,,,,

However, density dependence of demographic parameters may confound this approach. In this study we used a 25-year data set on Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus) in Spain to evaluate the consequences of population growth on reproductive performance. Unlike its coefficient of variation (cv), mean annual productivity decreased with increasing population size. After controlling for territorial heterogeneity, productivity also was negatively related to the distance to the nearest conspecific breeding pair and to supplementary feeding points where floaters congregate. These results suggest that vulture populations are regulated as posited by the site-dependency hypothesis: as the population increases, average productivity decreases because progressively poorer territories are used. The combined effects of the shrinkage of territories and the presence of floaters around supplementary feeding points seem to be the main causes of productivity decline and are therefore the main determinants of territory quality. This has conservation implications, especially concerning the role of supplementary feeding points. Supplementary feeding should be reviewed given that its usefulness in reducing preadult mortality has not yet been proved and its effect on productivity, as our results suggest, is negative.",Ecological Applications,,,,,,,

The most numerous species by far was the Short-tailed Shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris) followed by the Silver Gull (Larus novaehollandiae), Little Penguin ( Eudyptula minor) and Crested Tern ( Sterna bergii). Distribution within Western Port was not uniform, with pursuit divers such as cormorant and grebe species being recorded mostly in the shallow Eastern Arm. In contrast, surface-seizing (e.g. albatrosses), surface-plunging (e.g. Crested Terns), shallow-plunging ( Australasian Gannet, Morus serrator) and pursuit-plunging (e.g. shearwaters) species predominated in the deeper Western Arm of Western Port. These species were also seasonally abundant, with peak numbers for most occurring in late summer - early autumn, which coincides with the reported influx of juvenile clupeoid fish into Western Port. Average biomass ( 686 +/- 395 kg) comprised mostly Short-tailed Shearwaters, Little Penguins and Pied Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax varius).

Sage-grouse have been extirpated from British Columbia and reduced to remnant populations in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Estimates of the size of the population decline in Canada range from 66 to 92\% over the last 30 years based on currently occupied habitat. As a result, sage grouse have been listed as Endangered in both Alberta and Saskatchewan by provincial governments and federally in Canada by COSEWIC. Intensive surveys from 1994 to 1999 in both provinces suggest that the 1999 spring breeding population had declined to between 813 and 1204 individuals. The number of active lek sites has continued to decline, suggesting that some habitats have become unsuitable to support viable sage-grouse populations. Number of yearling males recruiting to leks each spring has been low, suggesting that production and overwinter survival of young are the major problems related to the decline. Low chick survival rate, with only 18\% surviving to 50 days of age, is the most likely parameter contributing to the population decline. These declines could be related to one or any combination of habitat changes, livestock grazing pressure, oil and gas developments, or climate change, all of which could lead to increased predation rates and decreased survival. It is questionable if the present population of sage-grouse in Canada is large enough to remain viable.",Canadian Field-Naturalist,,,,,,,

Fishery production was divisible into two periods, i.e. from 1984 to early 2000s and the middle to late 2000s. During the former, cycles in production were relatable to variable fishable biomass. Age structures that displayed considerable differences in age class strength reflected interannual variation in juvenile recruitment, which resulted in high variability in the strength of year classes entering the fishery. Periodic strong year classes were the major influence on fishable biomass as they passed through the population over numerous years. For the latter period, fishery statistics were conflicting as catches and effort were relatively low, whilst the estimates of catch per unit effort (CPUE) were consistently high. These statistics reflect a considerable change to the structure of the fishery that involved a reduction in number of fishers and fishing effort. The fishery statistics may indicate hyperstability, with CPUE estimates remaining high despite declining biomass because of the aggregative behaviour of the fish and the efficiency of remaining fishers.",Fisheries Management and Ecology,,,,,,,

The fox population in the southern parts of the distribution range has shown regular peaks during the whole period, whereas those in the northern and middle parts of Sweden have declined since 1982. In the northernmost county also litter sizes have decreased. These differences coincided with an absence of vole and lemming (Microtinae and Arvicolinae) peaks in the north.

Fish counts at intervals during the 6 years after the initial establishment of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve in 1975 suggested that red moki (Cheilodactylus spectabilis) had increased in abundance whereas five others had remained at approximately constant densities. A comparison of data between 1978 and 1988 also revealed few consistent differences in fish abundances. A detailed survey in 1988 between sites inside and outside the marine reserve showed no clear patterns for sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) and several fish; trends for increased abundances in the marine reserve of fish such as snapper Pagrus (=Chrysophrys) auratus, blue cod (Parapercis colias), and red moki; a very striking increase in numbers of rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) within the marine reserve; and an obvious trend for increased size of snapper in the marine reserve. Most of the trends, however, were not statistically significant, owing largely to the low power of the tests used.

Using band recoveries of birds banded (color plastic engraved bands) in Greece and in Bulgaria, as part of an international study of the population dynamics of Dalmatian Pelican, we estimated that additional mortality due to the power line would cause a decrease of between 1.3 to 3.5\% in the number of breeding pairs in Greece and Bulgaria by the time sexual maturity is reached (3 years old).

Location Ogasawara (Japan), Hawaii (USA), Great Barrier Reef (Australia), Florida (USA), Tortuguero (Costa Rica). Methods We compiled seasonal nesting activity data from all reliable continuous long-term studies (> 25 years), which comprised data series for six of the world's major green turtle rookeries. We estimated the underlying time-specific trend in these six rookery-specific nester or nest abundance series using a generalized smoothing spline regression approach. Results Estimated rates of nesting population increase ranged from c. 4--4\% per annum over the past two to three decades. These rates varied considerably among the rookeries, reflecting the level of historical exploitation. Similar increases in nesting population were also evident for many other green turtle stocks that have been monitored for shorter durations than the long-term studies presented here. Main conclusions We show that six of the major green turtle nesting populations in the world have been increasing over the past two to three decades following protection from human hazards such as exploitation of eggs and turtles. This population recovery or rebound capacity is encouraging and suggests that the green turtle is not on the brink of global extinction even though some stocks have been seriously depleted and are still below historical abundance levels. This demonstrates that relatively simple conservation strategies can have a profound effect on the recovery of once-depleted green turtle stocks and presumably the restoration of their ecological function as major marine consumers.",Global Ecology and Biogeography,,,,,,,

Hervey Bay is on the east coast of Australia and is the major southbound stop-over site for humpbacks returning to Antarctic waters from overwintenng in the Great Barner Reef (GBR) waters. Seasonal abundance estimates were denved from mark-resight profiles using a reduced form Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model (constant survival time-varying resight likelihood) that fitted the data well The bootstrap mean CJS abundance estimate over the 9 yr period from 1988 to 1996 was 855 (95\% CI: 750 to 936). Estimated humpback abundance in Hervey Bay showed significant temporal variability superimposed on an increasing linear trend estimated using tlmes series regression model bootstrapping at 6 3 \% yr-1 (95 \% CI: 2 to 11 \%). The seasonal Hervey Bay population comprised 30 to 50°( of the EAGVS southbound to Antarctic feeding grounds Estlrnated abundance increased from 554 post-yearling humpbacks in 1988 to a peak of 1040 in 1991 before dechning to 921 by the mid-1990s Standard errors of abundance estimates suggested good precision and were derived using a vanance components approach that separated sampling error from ecologically relevant variation The trends In temporal vanability and annual rate of humpback abun- dance increase were consistent with findings from an aerial surveillance study (1982 to 1996) of of the EAGVS overwinterlng In southern GBR waters The concurrence of findings monthly sightings from an independent method of abundance estimation provides confidence in the CJS model used in this study to estlmate abundance. Post-yearling survivorship was estimated from a 4 yr (1993 to 1996) photo-identification study of 517 individual humpbacks sighted at 2 seasonally sequential overwintering sites (Hervey Bay, Whitsundays) using a robust design CJS modelling approach with estimators that account for bias due to temporary emigration. A reduced form CJS model (constant survival, time-varying reslght likelihood) also fitted the data well with the mean annual survival rate for the EAGVS humpbacks estimated at 0.966 (95\% CI: 0.87 to 1.00).

Estimated whaling mortality was unsustainable from 1928 to 1972 (except during 1942-1944), depleting them from 239,000 (95\% interval 202,000-311,000) to a low of 360 (150-840) in 1973. Obtaining statistical evidence for subsequent increases has proved difficult due to their scarcity. We fitted Bayesian modeis to three sighting series (1968-2001), constraining maximum rates of increase to 12\% per annum. These models indicated that Antarctic blue whales are increasing at a mean rate of 7.3\% per annum (1.4\%- 11.6\%). Informative priors based on blue whale biology (4.3\%, SD = 1.9\%) and a Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis of increase rates in other blue whale populations (4.396, SD = 11.6\%), suggest plausible increase rates are lower (although the latter has wide intervals), but a meta-analysis of other mysticetes obtains similar rates of increase (6.7\%, SD = 4.0\%). Possible biases affecting the input abundance estimates are discussed. Although Antarctic blue whales appear to have been increasing since Soviet illegal whaling ended in 1972, they still need to be protected-their estimated 1996 population size, 1,700 (860-2,900), was just 0.7\% (0.3\%-1.3\%) of the pre-exploitation level.",Marine Mammal Science,,,,,,,

Recreational and subsistence angling in South African estuaries is a small, but relevant, sector of South Africa's diverse coastal fisheries. This paper reviews these fisheries and their effects in two estuaries. 2. The composition of angler's catches in two large Eastern Cape Province estuaries has hardly changed over a period of nearly 20 years. 3. Gill-net catches (in terms of CPUE) indicate a decline in the abundance of the most popular angling fish species, especially the spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii. 4. Regular freshwater inputs into estuaries are required to ensure a salinity gradient which is crucial for the maintenance of an abundant and diverse estuarine ichthyofaunal assemblage. 5. Present management and conservation policies are poorly defined, and the philosophy and principles of ecosystem preservation, rather than that of species preservation, should be seriously considered.

It is threatened by deforestation, but also by competition for nest sites with introduced bees, harvesting for pets, and potentially predation by introduced species. Despite these threats, we show that the Ouve´a Parakeet population increased exponentially from an estimated 617 (274–996) birds in 1993 to 2,090 (1,280–3,413) birds in 2009 (95\% confidence interval). We explain this population increase by community-based protection measures that eliminated nest poaching. We recommend that these measures are maintained, remnant forest is protected, and the introduction of rats is prevented.

The population densities of adult natterjack toads (Bufo calamita, Laurenti) were found to vary over an order of magnitude between different localities for this species in Britain. 2. Adult toad population density correlated positively with average toadlet production over the previous decade at each site. 3. Average toadlet production in turn correlated with breeding pond density at natterjack sites and the adult toad population size at one study site increased subsequent to an artificial increase of pond density. 4. Toadlet production within particular ponds was positively correlated with spawn deposition rate and there was no evidence of density-dependent regulation of toadlet production in two natterjack breeding ponds studied over several years. 5. The proportion of breeding seasons in which greater than the median number of toadlets was produced per hectare of total natterjack habitat was positively correlated with pond density at natterjack sites. 6. Taken together, these data suggest that adult natterjack population density is primarily regulated by the average rate of metamorphic success at a site, and this in turn is dependent upon stochastic rather than density-dependent processes operating at the level of the breeding ponds.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,

Species richness and abundance were not significantly associated with vegetation cover or plant biomass but were negatively correlated with seed diversity, seed biomass, and possibly small carnivore abundance. Unfortunately, small mammal diets are unknown in this ecosystem and it can be argued that carnivores are unlikely to reduce species diversity, casting doubt on the importance of these variables.

From 1983 to 1997, we surveyed a Bonelli's eagle population. Abandoned and occupied territories were compared to find differences in demographic parameters (flight rate, productivity and mortality) or habitat characteristics. Mortality was significantly higher in abandoned territories. Abandoned territories also had larger areas of forest and extensive agriculture, while occupied territories had more shrublands. Competition with Golden eagles was not a determinant of territorial abandonement but interacted with human persecution of the species.

We investigated the diet, age structure, and morphology of a population of crested terns to determine whether survival and growth were reduced for cohorts reared in years immediately following sardine mortality events. The diet of chicks and adults differed significantly. Australian anchovy (Engraulis australis) and sardine were the dominant prey in the diets of chicks, constituting an average of 36.3 and 14.6\% of individual prey items, respectively. Degens leatherjacket (Thamnoconus degeni) dominated the prey of adult terns, an average of 51.9\% of individual prey items. Age-specific information collected from banded adults indicated that the cohort reared after the first sardine mortality event in 1995 exhibited significantly lower rates of recruitment to the breeding colony than as predicted by life-table analyses, suggesting that survival was reduced in response to the absence of sardine. Females from cohorts reared <1 year after the end of each sardine mortality event (in 1996 and 1999) were smaller than other age classes, suggesting that chick growth was reduced during periods of low sardine abundance. Future data on diet and on the survival and growth of crested tern chicks could provide performance indicators for management of sardine populations and aid in the development of conservation strategies for the populations of crested tern.",ICES Journal of Marine Science,,,,,,,

The temporal distribution of nesting events per season, annual number of nests, carapace length of nesting females, clutch size, hatching success, incubation period, internesting interval, clutch frequency, observed reproductive life-span, and remigration period are reported. The study period included the nesting seasons from 1990 to 2008, but no regular beach monitoring was carried out in 1998 and 1999. Two sorts of methods were applied to the estimation of the annual number of nests in some seasons. Taking into account the estimated annual numbers of nests, the mean annual number of nests in the study period, excluding 1998-1999, was 335 (standard deviation = 139, range = 136-563, N = 17). An analysis of the available data indicates that the average nesting levels at the beginning of the study period (the first five seasons) and at its end (the last five seasons) were roughly the same. The mean curved carapace length of the nesting turtles decreased significantly during the study period, from 115.9 cm in 1990-1992 to 112.9 cm in 2006-2008. Atol das Rocas was established as a federal biological reserve in 1979, but regular sea turtle conservation activities actually started there in 1990. Since that year, the killing of nesting turtles has ceased, nesting activity by the turtles can proceed in an undisturbed fashion, and their clutches can incubate in a protected environment.",Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom,,,,,,,

Population reduction efforts that targeted several populations of light geese (greater snow geese [Chen caerulescens atlantica], lesser snow geese [C. c. caerulescens], and Ross’s geese [C. rossii]) began in 1999 in central and eastern North America. Such efforts were motivated by a broad consensus that abundance of these geese was causing serious ecological damage to terrestrial and salt marsh ecosystems in central and eastern parts of the Canadian Arctic and subarctic regions along Hudson Bay. Starting in February 1999, special conservation measures (or, in the U.S., a conservation order) were added to the respective federal regulations that permitted hunters to take snow geese (in parts of Canada and the U.S.) and Ross’s geese (in parts of the U.S.) during specified harvest periods outside of the hunting season. These measures were accompanied by increase or removal of daily kill and possession limits and by permissions to use previously prohibited equipment for hunting these species in certain regions of the continent. The intent was to reduce adult survival through increased hunting mortality, which was judged to be the most cost-effective approach to reversing population growth. Our principal goal was to assess the effectiveness of reduction efforts directed at the midcontinent population of lesser snow geese, which was thought to be the most serious threat to arctic and subarctic ecosystems of the 3 light goose populations. Our multiple objectives included the estimation and detection of change in the response measures of total annual harvest, harvest rate, survival rate, and abundance, using the 1998 hunting period (defined as 1 Aug 1998 to 31 Jul 1999) as a point of reference. We used information about hunter recoveries of leg- banded snow geese and estimates of regular-season harvest to estimate 1) conservation-order harvest and total annual harvest, 2) geographic and temporal distribution of recoveries by age class, 3) survival and recovery probability, and 4) abundance of snow geese each August using Lincoln’s (1930) method. We also modeled population growth to infer the form of population response to management efforts. Toward that end, we also proposed a method of estimating conservation-order harvest and tested for differences in band-reporting rate between Canada and the United States. Overall, the balance of evidence favored the conclusion that the midcontinent population has continued to grow during the conservation order, although perhaps at a reduced rate. We suggest that annual rate of population growth ð\^{} August, likely provides the most reliable inference about change in the midcontinent population. There was a decline in annual survival probability between these 2 periods from about 0.89 to about 0.83 among snow geese from the southern-nesting stratum (south of 608N latitude), thought to compose about 10\% of the midcontinent population.However, we detected no change in themuch larger northern-nesting stratum (north of 608Nlatitude), where annual survival remained at about 0.87 from 1989 to 2006. Thus, the conclusion that this population continued to increase during the conservation order was largely consistent with the finding that a weighted-survival probability for midcontinent snow geese essentially did not change between the period preceding (1989–1997) and during (1998–2006) the conservation order. Consistent with high survival rates were low harvest rates, which increased from 0.024 during 1989–1997 for northern geese to only 0.027 during 1998–2006 and from 0.031 to only 0.037 for southern geese. Despite the initial increase associated with the conservation order, harvest rates declined during the conservation order for geese from both strata. We suggest that the higher harvest rate evident for southern geese was related to their earlier fall migration and thus earlier exposure to harvest pressure. Migration by more abundant northern geese was later and resulted in a higher ratio of geese to hunters. Additionally, there was more harvest of southern geese in areas north of the Canadian prairies than there was of northern geese. Total annual harvest increased due to the conservation order but failed to exceed 0.75 million adults in any year during the assessment from 1989 to 2006. Harvest of both age classes exceeded 1 million in only 2 of 9 annual harvest periods since the conservation order started. These lower-than-expected harvests of adult snow geese combined with their low harvest rates of 0.048 during the conservation order suggested an August population size in excess of 15 million adult snow geese since 1998. We suggest that abundance of midcontinent snow geese was seriously underestimated in the past, and that this underestimate may have contributed to an overconfidence with which suggested harvest levels could achieve a goal of reduced survival and population reduction. Overall, all 3 populations of light geese now exceed numbers present when the conservation order was initiated. We are confident that the abundance and population growth rate of midcontinent snow geese (as well as by Ross’s and greater snow geese) currently exceeds the ability of existing numbers of hunters to exert harvest pressure that is necessary to impose sufficient additivemortality and thus effectively influence population growth. It remains unknown howmuch more or how much longer such populations can increase towards carrying capacity, which we assume to be determined by the standing crop of arctic foods that they exploit, before density dependence can measurably slow the population growth rate. Estimation of carrying capacity in the large northern nesting stratumis among the key research needs that we propose. The situation that has emerged requires a review of perspectives about impacts of midcontinent lesser snow geese in the arctic, whether initial goals behind population management are still relevant, and whether alternative options from the initial array of management tools should be exercised",Wildlife Monographs,,,,,,,

While anecdotes coming out of the region indicate that the wildlife populations remain under serious threat, little is known about their status. An aerial sample count was carried out in the Northern Central African Republic at the end of the dry season in June 2005 and covered an 85,000 km2 complex landscape containing national parks, hunting reserves and com- munity hunting areas. Results show a dramatic decline of wildlife since the previous survey in 1985. In 20 years, large mammals’ numbers decreased by 65\%, probably because of poaching and diseases brought by illegal cattle transhumance. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) and Buffon kob (Kobus kob) populations showed the greatest decline (over 80\% each), while buffalo (Syncerus caffer), roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) and Giant Lord’s Derby Eland (Taurotragus derbianus) populations seem stable or increasing over these last 20 years. The analysis of the wildlife population distribution by status of the different types of protected areas (national parks, hunting areas) showed that individual encounter rates of elephant and buffalo were lower in national parks than in neighbour- ing hunting areas, while those for roan, giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) and Buffon kob were higher in the na- tional parks.",African Journal of Ecology,,,,,,,

This study covered the period 2009--2009 and used river bank count method as in previous studies. The method involved counting indivi- duals and taking GPS locations of hippo schools. During the period 2009--2009 the population had maintained irregular cycles oscillating above and below K of 6000 and was still within carrying capacity band of 2000 individuals. The highest population size was still 6832 hippos (rounded off to 7000) and density of 42/km reached in 1984, and the lowest was 4765 hippos (rounded off to 5000) and density of 29/km recorded in 1978. Be- tween 1976--1976, and 2009--2009 the population still oscillated between 5000 - 7000 individuals, which is symptomatic of a population that had reached its asymptote. Plot of population size for the period 1976--1976 assumed a population model which was a hybrid between less accu-rate regulation and stable limit cycle. The slow-down in population growth at K and oscillations were attributed to environmental resistance. More studies are required to identify the impact of climate change on the population size and den-sity fluctuations to determine whether K will rise or drop.",Open Journal of Ecology,,,,,,,

From 1999 to 2009, the population increased at an average rate of 16.5 turtles per season. Females were individually tagged, and nesting data were derived from indirect evidence of nesting attempts (i.e. tracks) and actual turtle sightings (56 to 60\% of all encounters). Survey effort varied over the years for a variety of reasons, but the underlying trends over time are considered robust. To overcome biases associated with variable survey effort, we estimated population changes by fitting a Poisson distribution to data on numbers of times each individual was seen at this breeding site in a season. This was used to estimate unseen individuals, and hence the total number of nesting females each season. The maximum number of individuals emerging onto Cousin Island to nest within a single season was estimated to be 256 (2007 to 2008) compared to 23 in 1973. Tag returns indicate that many turtles nest on both Cousin and Cousine Islands (2 km apart), and that some inter-island nesting also occurs between Cousin and more remote islands within the Seychelles.",Endangered Species Research,,,,,,,

For coral reef-associated fisheries, however, such datasets are extremely rare. We analyse a unique 45-year set of landings data on six reef fishes of commercial importance in Cuba's coastal fisheries, together with information on management interventions, and examine the likely implications of over-fishing and management on the long-term condition of one grouper (Serranidae) and five snapper (Lutjanidae) species. The data clearly demonstrate differential responses to fishing and management according to the biology of the different species examined. In particular, those species that aggregate most predictably, and at a small number of spawning sites, are more prone to uncontrolled fishing and in need of effective management. The increase in the number and severity of management measures over the last 20 years reflects attempts to address declines in the fishery following its development prior to the 1980s. The data suggest short-lived successes, and challenges to successful management from changing socio-economic circumstances and environmental impacts. The importance of considering, in addition to landings information, social and economic factors, management history, the biology of targeted species and the implications of environmental factors in relation to resource use, trends, and management is clearly illustrated in this study. Managers should strive to document species-specific data over the long-term and aim for robust and adaptive fishery management that constantly adjusts to the range of factors that affect fishing activity, exploited species, and responses to management. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

696,"Childerhouse, Simon and Gales, Nick",Historical and modern distribution and abundance of the New Zealand sea lion Phocarctos hookeri,"This paper describes both the modern and the pristine distribution, breeding range, and relative abundance of the New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri). Archaeological data and his- torical references were used to determine the pris- tine status of the sea lion, and its present status was determined from recent scientific studies and obser- vations. The sea lion had a substantially more wide- spread distribution before the arrival of humans in New Zealand than it does today. The species used to range along the whole length of the coast, from the north of the North Island through to Stewart Is- land and the subantarctic islands. Although we have no direct estimate of pristine abundance, the present population size is clearly reduced. Subsistence and commercial killing of sea lions is the most likely cause of historical changes in distribution and abun- dance. Their pristine breeding range extended at least as far north as Nelson and may have extended to the North Island. The present breeding range is restricted to the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island. Within the last 10 years a few individuals have started to breed on mainland New Zealand and Stewart Island, which may reflect a slow recolonisation of earlier breeding grounds.

This approach, however, allowed us to include, in a flexible way, the effect of hydrological regime as an additional forcing function. We tried to achieve this flexibility by making the annual recruitment rates and spawning biomass adjustable to the attributes of the hydrological cycle data. Our models showed that these attributes are influential in the population dynamics of Brycon hilarii of the Northern Pantanal, and their inclusion in the models allowed best partial fits (which considered fits only to the data components length- and age-compositions, CPUE of juveniles and adults) than the Base-case (without hydrological attributes). The best partial fits where obtained when the attributes “delay of floods” and “intensity of floods” were forcing the spawning biomass and the annual recruitment respectively, indicating that these characteristics of the population may be influenced by specific attributes of the water level. The use of integrated modeling contributed with the advancement of population ecology knowledge of rheophilic fish. It is recommended that freshwater fisheries management be integrated into the hydrology management.",Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries,,,,,,,

Parrotfish fisheries are of particular importance because the feeding habits of parrotfish (scrape and excavate coral) are thought to be critical to the resilience of coral reefs and to maintaining coral reef health within marine protected areas. We investigated the ecological impact of localized subsistence and artisanal fishing pressure on parrotfish fisheries in Gizo Town, Western Solomon Islands, by analyzing the density and size distribution of parrotfish with an underwater visual census (UVC), recall diary (i.e., interviews with fishers), and creel surveys to independently assess changes in abundance and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) over 2 years. We then compared parrotfish data from Gizo Town with equivalent data from sites open to and closed to fishing in Kida and Nusa Hope villages, which have different customary management regimes. Results indicated a gradient of customary management effectiveness. Parrotfish abundance was greater in customary management areas closed to fishing, especially with regard to larger fish sizes, than in areas open to fishing. The decline in parrotfish abundance from 2004 to 2005 in Gizo was roughly the same magnitude as the difference in abundance decline between inside and outside customary management marine reserves. Our results highlight how weak forms of customary management can result in the rapid decline of vulnerable fisheries around urbanized regions, and we present examples in which working customary management systems (Kinda and Nusa Hope) can positively affect the conservation of parrotfish—and reef fisheries in general—in the highly biodiverse Coral Triangle region.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

During the sampling period (two distinct hydrological years), 56 fish species were identified. Anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) and barbells (Barbus species) dominated the abundances in the high inflow year (2001), but Pomatoschistus species were the most important taxa in the low inflow year (2002). Barbells and Portuguese toadfish (Halobatrachus didactylus) dominated the biomass in both years under different inflow conditions, but a reduction in barbells' biomass occurred during the low inflow year. Multivariate analysis indicated a persistent spatial structuring of the estuarine community for both years and in different seasonal periods. Changes in salinity and seston, which were mainly due to changes in freshwater input, had an important influence on the structure of the fish assemblages. In 2002, the increased salinity in the upper estuary allowed colonization by marine species of an area that usually contains freshwater, decreasing even more the habitat for indigenous freshwater species in the downstream area of the Guadiana River. There was also a decrease in the abundances of planktivorous and omnivorous fishes and an increase in carnivorous fishes during the low inflow year. As fishes in these systems are important regulators of processes in the trophic web, changes in the dominant feeding groups can have consequences on water quality, particularly in relation to the occurrence of plankton blooms. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Intraspecific competition for restricted food resources is considered to play a fundamental part in density dependence of somatic growth and other population characteristics, but studies simultaneously addressing the interrelationships between population density, food acquisition and somatic growth have been missing. 2. We explored the food consumption and individual growth rates of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus in a long-term survey following a large-scale density manipulation experiment in a subarctic lake. 3. Prior to the initiation of the experiment, the population density was high and the somatic growth rates low, revealing a severely overcrowded and stunted fish population. 4. During the 6-year period of stock depletion the population density of Arctic charr was reduced with about 75\%, resulting in an almost twofold increase in food consumption rates and enhanced individual growth rates of the fish. 5. Over the decade following the density manipulation experiment, the population density gradually rose to intermediate levels, accompanied by corresponding reductions in food consumption and somatic growth rates. 6. The study revealed negative relationships with population density for both food consumption and individual growth rates, reflecting a strong positive correlation between quantitative food intake and somatic growth rates. 7. Both the growth and consumption rate relationships with population density were well described by negative power curves, suggesting that large density perturbations are necessary to induce improved feeding conditions and growth rates in stunted fish populations. 8. The findings demonstrate that quantitative food consumption represents the connective link between population density and individual growth rates, apparently being highly influenced by intraspecific competition for limited resources.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

The study site was subdivided into three census blocks in which a total 111 transects (total length = 838.24 km) were censused once by one observer. Densities were estimated using DISTANCE analysis. We observed a total of 10 species of ungulates (nine Bovidae and one Suidae). Maxwell's duiker Cephalophus maxwelli had the highest density (3.69 individuals km[minus sign]2) followed by the red-flanked duiker Cephalophus rufilatus (2.61 individuals km[minus sign]2), whereas the buffalo Syncerus caffer had the lowest density (0.34 individuals km[minus sign]2). Compared to a census in 1997, the abundance of red-flanked and Maxwell's duikers significantly decreased (by c. 50\%) whereas that of other species remained stable or increased. This variation may possibly be explained by a change in the hunting pattern in the area, which shifted from large-scale hunting by large groups of hunters from outside the area before the Park's creation, to small-scale poaching by local hunters. The Park includes a diversity of ungulate species and harbours populations of ungulates that are important at both national and regional levels. We recommend therefore that the Park should be considered a key area for the conservation of ungulates in West Africa.",Oryx,,,,,,,

In a long-term genetic capture-mark-recapture study using scats we evaluated temporal variation in adult survival in a wolverine (Gulo gulo) population in southern Norway. In contrast to most previous studies of large mammals we found evidence for negative density dependence in adult survival in this large carnivore. Both sexes showed the same pattern of density dependence, with higher annual survival rates in adult females than males. In addition, we also found an additive mortality effect of harvesting in the population, resulting in the lowest adult survival rates at a combination of high population density and high harvest rate. The additive effects of density and harvest on adult survival of wolverines have relevance to the conservation and management of solitary carnivores with strong intrasexual territoriality, especially for species where combats among conspecifics can cause serious injury or even mortality. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

During the 1980s, almost 11,000 fish were captured, including 13 native species and 24 alien species. During the 2000s, just over 39,000 fish were captured, including 15 native species and 24 alien species. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of total fish, alien fish, and centrarchid fish were greater in the 2000s compared with the 1980s, largely because of increased centrarchid fish CPUE. These differences in CPUE were associated with the spread of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), particularly an alien aquatic macrophyte Egeria densa. Native fish CPUE declined from the 1980s to the 2000s, but there was no single factor that could explain the decline. Native fish were most abundant in the northern region during both sampling periods. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling indicated similar patterns of fish assemblage composition during the two sampling periods, with the northern and western regions characterized by the presence of native species. The separation of the northern and western regions from the other regions was most distinct in the 2000s. Our results suggest that native fish restoration efforts will be most successful in the northern portion of the Delta. Management decisions on the Delta should include consideration of possible effects on SAV in littoral habitats and the associated fish assemblages and ecological processes.",Estuaries and Coasts,,,,,,,

Most colonies showed positive growth rates from the 1960s. However, there was evidence for a decrease in the larger colonies since the early 1990s, and for lower growth rates in the smaller colonies during the 1990s. The overall population size was estimated using log linear models, and the average annual growth rate was +6.3\% for the 41-year period. Four change points were detected in the annual growth rate: +21.1\% during 1978–1985, +4.3\% during 1985–1995, −19.2\% during 1995–1999, and +10.9\% during 1999–2003. Time-series analyses of the population-size estimates and the relationship between growth rate and population size both indicated density-dependence in population growth rate. Variations in population sizes are also discussed in relation to environmental fluctuations. Our results suggest that important changes occurred over the past 10 years.",Polar Biology,,,,,,,

Although the spread of toxic cane toads (Bufo marinus) through tropical Australia is widely believed to have caused extensive mortality of native reptiles and mammals, effects of toad ingestion on native anurans have been virtually ignored. our studies on the Adelaide River floodplain show that the most numerous vertebrate victims of toad invasion are native tadpoles that die when they attempt to consume toad eggs. We documented 11 episodes of mass mortality, totalling >1300 tadpoles of 10 species, in five waterbodies within a single wet-season shortly after the toads invaded. A causal link between toad breeding and tadpole mortality is supported by observations that: (1) in at least 9 of the 11 waterbodies involved, toads bred immediately prior to mortality events; (2) water quality was indistinguishable from that of control ponds, and tadpoles placed in that water remained healthy; (3) dead tadpoles showed no sign of disease; and (4) laboratory trials showed rapid, 100\% mortality in native tadpoles exposed to freshly-laid toad eggs. Despite these high mortality rates, toad invasion does not appear to threaten the viability of anuran populations because frogs often breed in ponds not used by toads, and because density-dependent growth and survival within tadpole communities mean that additional mortality may not reduce the total effective recruitment of metamorph frogs from a waterbody.

Baseline information and monitoring of abundance and distribution is needed to determine if the conservation objectives are met in the long-term. To estimate abundance, 12,568km of non-systematic line transects conducted from 2000 to 2003, with 72 sightings, were analysed using spatial modelling methods. Transects were divided into 4,575 small segments (average 2.8km) with similar values for sightability conditions and environmental variables. The point estimate of bottlenose dolphin abundance in the area was 584 dolphins (95\% CI=278-744). The same method was applied to investigate changes in abundance since 1992 in the eastern section of the research area, where most dolphins were concentrated, stratifying by three groups of years. Point estimates were 111 dolphins for 1992-97, 537 for 1998-2000 and 279 for 2001-03. The higher abundance between 1998 and 2000 corresponded with the observation of an ‘immigrant’ group of dolphins in these years. These results highlight the importance of long-term studies to understand natural variation in abundance in a specific area subject to conservation activities.",Journal of Cetacean Research and Management,,,,,,,

Because of its long history of intense fishing, the Mediterranean Sea offers a unique perspective on fish population declines over historical timescales. We used a diverse set of records dating back to the early 19th and mid 20th century to reconstruct long-term population trends of large predatory sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We compiled 9 time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records. Generalized linear models were used to extract instantaneous rates of change from each data set, and a meta-analysis was conducted to compare population trends. Only 5 of the 20 species we considered had sufficient records for analysis. Hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.), blue (Prionace glauca), mackerel (Isurus oxyrinchus and Lamna nasus), and thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) declined between 96 and 99.99\% relative to their former abundance. According to World Conservation Union (IUCN) criteria, these species would be considered critically endangered. So far, the lack of quantitative population assessments has impeded shark conservation in the Mediterranean Sea. Our study fills this critical information gap, suggesting that current levels of exploitation put large sharks at risk of extinction in the Mediterranean Sea. Possible ecosystem effects of these losses involve a disruption of top-down control and a release of midlevel consumers.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

754,"Cadieux, Mc and Gauthier, Gilles","Monitoring the environmental and ecological impacts of climate change on Bylot Island, Sirmilik National Park","Our ecological and environmental program has been monitoring the climate, the$\backslash$nreproduction and the abundance of several key species of birds, mammals and plants on Bylot$\backslash$nIsland, Sirmilik National Park, Nunavut for the past 19 years. The main goal of our project is to$\backslash$nmeasure changes occurring in the Arctic ecosystems, analyse temporal trends, and evaluate to$\backslash$nwhat extent these changes may be driven by climate change. Our results showed that the region$\backslash$nsurrounding Bylot Island has been experiencing a strong warming trend over the past three$\backslash$ndecades. These trends were mostly detectable during the spring, summer and fall (from 2.1 to$\backslash$n4.5oC for that period), which is contradictory to GCM models that forecast changes to be more$\backslash$nintense during the winter months. Nonetheless, our long-term dataset on ecological monitoring of$\backslash$nseveral birds, mammals and plants already show some signs of change on Bylot Island, which$\backslash$ncould be due in part to climate change. Plant production in wetlands has increased by 84\% over$\backslash$nthe last 18 years, most likely a consequence of climate warming. Climatic variations also appear$\backslash$nto be the most important driver of the annual production of several migratory birds such as$\backslash$nGreater Snow Geese, as warm spring temperature increases their breeding effort and advances$\backslash$ntheir breeding phenology. The two lemming species found on Bylot Island play a key role in the$\backslash$nfood web as they are the primary prey of most tundra predators. Their large cyclical fluctuations$\backslash$nin annual abundance not only affect their main predators (Snowy Owls and foxes) but also$\backslash$nindirectly affect other species like geese through shared-predator interactions. Other bird species$\backslash$nsuch as shorebirds, longspurs, gulls and jaegers are likely to be influenced by fluctuating$\backslash$nabundance of lemmings but further studies are needed to investigate this relationship. We found$\backslash$nevidence that lemming cycles have dampened in recent years and that their abundance during$\backslash$npeak years of the cycle is much lower than in the past. Although this could be linked to the strong$\backslash$nwarming trend observed in the fall, which could lead to poor snow conditions and low overwinter$\backslash$nlemming survival, more data are needed to test this hypothesis. The proportion of fox dens with$\backslash$nreproductive activity has decreased over the years, possibly a consequence of the low abundance$\backslash$nof lemmings recorded recently during peak years of abundance. Our Traditional Ecological$\backslash$nKnowledge study pertaining to snow geese and foxes has shown that Elders knowledge can$\backslash$nprovide complementary information to our monitoring program. Indeed, we found that traditional$\backslash$nknowledge on foxes expanded the spatial and temporal scales of our current scientific knowledge.$\backslash$nOur community workshops and public presentations proved to be valuable tools to foster$\backslash$ncommunications and exchanges with the community of Pond Inlet on ecological studies carried$\backslash$nout on Bylot Island. Finally, we contributed to increase the capacity building of the community$\backslash$nthrough the hiring of several northerners during our field activities.","\ldots report, Centre d' \ldots",,,,,,,

An important component of monitoring the recovery of this species is establishing long-term baseline trends in abundance. In the absence of scientific survey data, assessing and monitoring the status of some marine species has required the utilization of fishery-dependent data. Using voluntary dockside interviews of sport fishers collected in Everglades National Park, a standardized index of abundance was created for smalltooth sawfish using the delta method. The index was developed as the product of separate generalized linear models of the proportion of positive trips and the positive catch rates on successful trips. Development of the final model included testing factors that were expected to influence the catch of smalltooth sawfish. The final model assumed a binomial distribution for the proportion of positive trips and a lognormal distribution for positive catch rates. Year was significant as a main effect in the binomial model whereas year and skill level of the fishing party were significant in the lognormal model. The relative abundance index shows a small increase in abundance at an average rate of about 5\% per year since 1989. These results indicate that the population of smalltooth sawfish in Everglades National Park has at least stabilized and may be increasing. However, additional data and analyses from multiple sources are required before definitive conclusions on the recovery of smalltooth sawfish can be established.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

758,"Angerbj\""{o}rn, Anders",Mountain hare populations on islands: effects of predation by red fox,"On islands off the west coast of Sweden the density of mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) is very high. One of the main predators on hares, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.), is only present during short periods. Data on hare density and predation by red fox and eagle owl (Bubo bubo (L.)) has been analyzed from five islands over several years. Winter mortality in years with low predation pressure was independent of hare density. But when red fox or eagle owl were present on islands (i.e., high predation pressure) winter mortality became density dependent. Thus, at low density, winter mortality did not increase through red fox predation. But at densities up to two hares/ha, predation pressure was increasing and could be limiting for these populations. At still higher hare density predation pressure became less intensive. The functional response for foxes preying on hares showed a type II or a sigmoid type III response pattern. In normal summers, the population increase due to reproduction was at least two-fold. When a fox was present there was instead a sharp decrease in hare numbers. Fox predation had a stronger effect in summer than in winter. By switching between islands and mainland areas from winter to summer, a fox can stabilize fluctuations in hare numbers on the islands. This is dependent on how often the ice permits a fox to reach an island and the lack of numerical response by predators. ¬¨¬© 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Oecologia,,,,,,,

A total of 1072 individuals were identified, with 40 individuals being sighted off both islands. There were 15 docu- mented transits between islands within seasons; 9 whales traveled northwest (from Hawaii to Kauai), whereas 6 whales traveled southeast (Kauai to Hawaii). S\~{}mulation data indicated that these transit- direction proportions did not deviate from random expectations (p = 0.76); therefore, there was no directional trend to movement between the islands. The shortest observed transit was 8 d, indicating that whales can move throughout the island chain in short periods. Males were significantly overrep- resented in inter-island recaptures (p < 0.001), and we suggest that males actively engaged in courtship behaviors are more wide-ranging. Whales did not show a significant trend to be captured off the same island in different years (p = 0.08 for Kauai, p = 0.12 for Hawaii); however, recaptures were few, power was relatively low, and 1 test approached significance. The observed number of within-sea- son, between-island recaptures was significantly less than expected as determined by random sirnula- tions (p = 0.013 for Kauai, p = 0.008 for Hawaii), indicating that, during a season, whales are more likely to be recaptured off the isldnd of \~{}nitial capture. There was also evidence suggesting that sub-groups of whales moved among tht. lslands in loose aggregations within seasons, the number of pairs of indi- viduals captured off both islands within 7 d of each other was significantly greater than expected in random simulations (p = 0.038). We conclude that complete random mixing of whales among the islands is unlikely, and should not be assumed in the context of mark-recapture abundance estimation. Larger samples with greater coverage of the Hawaiian lslands and higher recapture probability will be needed to elucidate movement patterns of the population.

761,"Heide-J\o rgensen, M. P.",Narwhal: Monodon monoceros,"Newborn narwhals are evenly gray or dark-brownish gray. While nursing for 1-2 years, the coloration changes gradually to a dark background color with white patches that give a mottled appearance. The most conspicuous feature of the narwhal is the up to 3-m long spiraled tusk. Six pairs of maxillary and two pairs of mandibulary dental papillae are present in early narwhal embryos, but only two maxillary pairs persist and develop. In males the right elongated maxillary tooth and in females both maxillary teeth remain inside the skull, sometimes just protruding through an opening in the maxillary bone. There is a great variability in the shape and the dimensions of the protruding tusk. Some tusks are fairly straight and others are corkscrew-like; some are thin and fragile, whereas others are short and thick. Narwhals have not been observed using their tusks for fighting or other aggressive behavior. The main reason the narwhal remained a legendary animal for so long may be because of its preference for remote and inaccessible habitats, usually in areas over deep water that are covered with heavy pack ice during dark winter months. Killer whales and polar bears are the only predators on narwhals. Narwhals are usually found in small groups of 5-10 whales, migrating together. The narwhal is the animal behind the legend about the mysterious unicorn: a horse-like creature with a spiraled horn protruding from the forehead. The horn was supposed to have healing abilities, and the wild and shy animal could only be captured with a virgin as bait. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, very few undisturbed beaches remain along the Atlantic coast, and these areas represent unique habitats that can help decipher the impacts of development on various species. We monitored nesting patterns and hatching success of three sea turtle species (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, and Dermochelys coriacea) from 1985 to 2003 on Canaveral National Seashore, an uninhabited 38.3 km stretch of beach in Florida. We monitored the number of nests deposited annually, hatching success, predation rates, and spatial nesting patterns. Clutch sizes varied within, but not among years, most likely due to variation in size of nesting females rather than climate change or resource availability. The number of nests increased over the study period for all three species, indicating growing populations. Higher numbers of nests were deposited on the southern end of our beach than on the northern end. Hatching success did not vary by species, but was dependent on nest-protection effort, which increased during the study period. Protecting more nests with wire screens resulted in lower predation rates. We did not find any evidence suggesting that predators are using nest markers to locate eggs, even after using the same method of marking nests for 19 years. Our conservation efforts have lowered predation levels through increased screening effort, and over time the number of nests laid increased for each species. Collecting baseline data on nesting patterns in undisturbed locations will allow comparisons to be made on nesting trends and patterns at geographically close, but disturbed, localities. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Sightings of right whales were recorded along predetermined transects through each region, while both in situ and remotely sensed oceanographic measurements were collected. Sampling with plankton nets and an optical plankton counter confirmed that right whales in these regions feed on Calanus finmarchicus copepodite stage 5 (C5). Spatial variability in right whale occurrence was associated with water depth and the depth of the bottom mixed layer. C. finmarchicus C5 aggregated over the deepest water depths in both regions, and within these areas, right whales occurred where the bottom mixed layer forced discrete layers of C. finmarchicus C5 to occur shallower in the water column (allowing more efficient foraging). Annual increases in right whale occurrence appeared to be associated with decreases in sea surface temperature (SST) in both regions; however, this observation merits caution in light of the short duration of the study (3 yr). There was also evidence to suggest that both spatial and interannual variability in right whale occurrence in Roseway Basin may be associated with SST gradient, a proxy for ocean fronts.

Annual winter counts show a steady growth in the last twenty years. Swans arrive in Japan from mid-October onwards, and up to 32,000 Whooper Swans and 31,000 Bewick's Swans have been recorded in mid-winter in the late 1990s. This is more than 50\% of the East Asian populations of these two species. In addition, 150 feral Mute Swans (Cygnus olor) reside in Japan throughout the year. There is a long tradition of providing rice and bread for swans in Japan, and the number of supplementary feeding sites has increased since 1980. Food for swans and other waterfowl is now distributed at nearly 300 locations; about 55\% of the wintering swans are found at these sites.

The data encom- passed a synchronous fluctuation of lagomorphs and porcupines. Fisher populations appeared to have a delayed, positive numerical response with a lag of 2 years to changing lagomorph abundance, but they also appeared to switch to an unmeasured, alternate prey during the lagomorph low. This finding suggests that fishers are gen- eralist predators that should have a stabilizing effect on the predator–prey system.",Journal of Mammalogy,,,,,,,

Ground and aerial surveys confirmed that waterbuck, topi, warthog, lion and spotted hyaena populations are all in decline and that this should be a cause for concern.

Standardized interviews with hunters were held in 110 villages in Guinea Bissau and 60 villages in Guinea, and field surveys were carried out to validate interviewee responses. Results suggest that elephants are mainly restricted to an area between the Corubal River (Guinea Bissau) and the Kogon River (Guinea) and that elephants occur only seasonally in Guinea. Based on the number, geographical localization and interpretation of observed tracks, our estimate of the minimum number of elephants in Guinea Bissau is 4–10 animals. We did not observe any signs of young elephants. The most immediate threat to elephants is a road scheme between Guinea Bissau and Guinea that cuts through elephant range. The future of elephants in this region depends on the capacity of the two countries to manage their common elephant population jointly. In particular, the creation of a transboundary park is urgently needed.",Oryx,,,,,,,

788,"Boersma, P. Dee",Penguins as Marine Sentinels,"From the tropics to Antarctica, penguins depend on predictable regions of high ocean productivity where their prey aggregate. Increases in precipitation and reductions in sea ice associated with climate warming are affecting penguins. The largest breeding colony of Patagonian (Magellanic) penguins, at Punta Tombo, Argentina, had approximately 200,000 breeding pairs in October 2006—a decline of 22\%since 1987. In the 1980s and 1990s, petroleum pollution was a major source of Patagonian penguin mortality. In 1994, tanker lanes were moved 40 kilometers (km) farther off the coast of Chubut, and the dumping of ballast water and the oiling of penguins are now rare. However, penguins are swimming 60 kmfarther north fromtheir nests during incubation than they did a decade ago, very likely reflecting shifts in prey in response to climate change and reductions in prey abundance caused by commercial fishing. These temperate penguin species, marine sentinels for southern oceans, demonstrate that new challenges are confronting their populations. Keywords:",BioScience,,,,,,,

Recent studies of this population off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, have produced a photographic dataset that was utilized for the first markrecapture assessment of western gray whale abundance. Given encounter histories of 129 individually identified whales spanning 25 monthly capture occasions from 1997 to 2003, a closed capture estimator was employed to estimate the number of individuals using the study area in each year. Temporary emigration probabilities were then applied to the closed capture estimates to enumerate the total population size of whales off northeastern Sakhalin Island. Total abundances from 1997 to 2003 were estimated as 64 [plus or minus] 5.1 (SE), 55 to 75 (95\% CI); 75 [plus or minus] 4.9, 66 to 85; 86 [plus or minus] 3.1, 80 to 93; 77 [plus or minus] 4.7, 68 to 87; 91 [plus or minus] 3.4, 84 to 98; 98 [plus or minus] 4.1, 90 to 106; and 99 [plus or minus] 4.9, 90 to 109, respectively. These abundance estimates, particularly the last values in the series, most likely approximate the size of the entire western gray whale population. For comparison to the trend in the abundance estimates, life history data were used to estimate the growth rate of the population. Depending on the range of potential fecundity values incorporated, the resulting growth rate estimates indicate an annual population increase that is between 2.5 and 3.2\%. The extremely small population size and slow rate of increase documented here further highlight concern about the viability of this critically endangered population.",Endangered Species Research,,,,,,,

794,"Bradford, Amanda L.",Population Assessment of Western North Pacific Gray Whales (Eschrichtius Robustus),"Two geographically and genetically distinct populations of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) occur in the North Pacific, referred to as the eastern and western populations. Subjected to intensive modern commercial whaling during portions of the 19th and 20th centuries, the western population was proposed to be extinct during the early 1970’s. This population presently remains in small numbers and is considered one of the world’s most endangered populations of large whales. The need for increased conservation efforts indicates the appropriateness of a quantitative western gray whale population assessment. Since 1997, ongoing studies of western gray whales have resulted in a photographic dataset that can be used for mark-recapture survival estimation. A robust design model was fitted to 116 individual whale encounter histories spanning 22 monthly capture occasions from 1997 to 2002. Constant non-calf and calf (first-year post-weaning) survival and random temporary emigration were assumed. Models incorporating individual heterogeneity in residency patterns and higher temporary emigration probabilities for younger whales provided better fits to the data. Non-calf and calf survival were estimated as 0.952 (SE=0.0151, 95\% CI=0.912-0.975) and 0.709 (SE=0.1178, 95\% CI=0.443-0.882), respectively. These survival estimates and other life history parameters were utilized in conjunction with the Lotka equation to calculate the 1997-2002 population growth rate of western gray whales. A Monte Carlo simulation method was employed (n=10,000 trials) to account for uncertainty in the life history parameters. A range of possible fecundity values was examined to estimate a conservative, intermediate, and liberal rate of population growth. These growth rates were estimated as 0.026 (SD=0.0190, 5th-95th Percentiles=-0.008-0.054), 0.031 (SD=0.0194, 5th- 95th Percentiles=-0.003-0.061), and 0.036 (SD=0.0198, 5th-95th Percentiles=0.001-0.066), respectively. Each calculated growth rate and historical catch data were fitted to the generalized logistic equation in a 20th century back calculation of the western gray whale population. A Bayesian statistical method and the Sample-Importance-Resample algorithm (n1=2,000,000 initial samples; n2=5,000 resamples) were used to estimate model parameters and indices of population status. Back calculation results suggest that the western gray whale population is currently growing at its maximum net recruitment rate, the carrying capacity of the population is undefined, the population is currently at most between 8-9\% of its original size, and the population has been highly depleted for over half of the 20th century. Current threats and low-density population effects could inhibit the recovery of western gray whales, emphasizing the necessity of concerted international protection and conservation planning for this critically endangered population.",,,,,,,,

Historical data indicate that northern dusky salamanders were once widespread and common in ANP. We conducted intensive surveys for stream salamanders during 2000-2003 and observed only two adult northern dusky salamanders on one stream. No eggs or larvae were observed. Although the cause of the observed population decline is unknown, we identify multiple potential stressors including stocking of predatory fishes, fungal pathogens, substrate embeddedness, and widespread pollution (i.e., from atmospheric pollutants) of surface waters at ANP. Our data suggest that ANP streams may no longer be suitable for northern dusky salamanders. This investigation is the first to document the decline of a stream dwelling amphibian species in a national park (i.e., areas that are not subject to obvious habitat loss or major changes in land use) with widespread mercury contamination of its surface waters. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is critical that we understand the conservation value of fragments, because they may represent opportunities to make important conservation gains, particularly for species whose ranges are not in a protected area. However, our ability to understand the value of fragments for Primates is limited by the fact that researchers have conducted many studies in protected areas, which do not represent most fragments, and studies are typically short term. Here we determine the long-term survival probability of red (Procolobus pennantii) and black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) inhabiting forest fragments outside of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Local communities use the fragments primarily for subsistence agriculture and fuelwood. We surveyed primate populations 3 times over 8 yr, made a total inventory of all trees 2 times, contrasted behavior of groups inhabiting 1 fragment with groups in the continuous forest, and judged the conservation value of the fragments by quantifying patterns of forest use by local people. Of the 20 fragments surveyed, 16 supported resident populations of colobus in 1995, 2 were cleared in 2000, and an additional 2 fragments were cleared by 2003. In 1995 we counted 165 black-and-white colobus, whereas in 2000 and 2003, we counted 119 and 75 individuals, respectively. Seven fragments supported red colobus in 1995, 11 in 2000, and 9 in 2003. In 2000 we counted 159 red colobus, while in 2003, we saw 145 individuals. For both species, activity patterns in continuous forest were similar to those in a fragment, with the exception that individuals in the fragment rested more. Colobus in the fragment ate more mature leaves than colobus in the continuous forest did. Fragments supported all the fuelwood needs of an average of 32 people who lived immediately adjacent to them, and partially supported families up to 3 farms away (ca. 400 m), representing 576 people. Intensive harvesting for fuelwood occurred when neighboring households engaged in beer brewing (an average of 9.6\% of the households), gin distilling (8.8\%), or charcoal production (14.5\%). Overall, between 2000 and 2003, the average density of trees declined by 14 trees/ha (range 0--0 trees/ha). If current rates of clearing continue, the probability that the fragments will continue to support colobus populations is low.",International Journal of Primatology,,,,,,,

Thus far, its invasion potential on the Island of Hawaii remains poorly understood. Critical components for determining this potential are robust estimates of abundance and vital rates across habitat types. To address this lack of information, we used mark-recapture methods to estimate E. coqui survival and abundance, determine growth rates of adult male and female frogs, and relate densities to elevation, snout-vent length (SVL), habitat structure, and invertebrate abundance. Mean adult E. coqui density across eight sites was 62 ± 12 adults/100 m² and ranged from 6-138 adults/100 m². Our three-year mean adult density estimates were three times greater at three of our study sites (100 adults/100 m² than the highest long-term estimates from Puerto Rico (33 adults/100 m²). Mean individual growth rates were 0.0078 mm/day (± 0.007 SD, N= 87) for males and 0.0097 mm/day (± 0.009 SD, N = 11) for females. Frogs of similar size were found to be growing slower in Hawaii than Puerto Rico. We found no relationship between elevation and E. coqui density or elevation and SVL or between invertebrate abundance and E. coqui density. However, there was a positive relationship between understory structure and E. coqui density. This relationship suggests that removing understory structure could reduce E. coqui densities, although other potential implications of this management treatment should be considered.",Journal of Herpetology,,,,,,,

The increase was mainly due to years with good breeding success, but probably also to improved survival in mild winters. Thus, in cold winters it was observed that mortality, of at least first-winter birds, increased. Major changes in winter site use were observed during the 1980s; the use of the Danish Wadden Sea decreased, and in consequence, the brent geese arrived earlier at Lindisfarne and at the main winter site, Mariager-Randers Fjords. In the course of winter the population now disperses to more sites and new wintering sites have been established; in spring the majority of the population is concentrated in two sites in north-west Jutland in Denmark. The changed pattern of movement reflects decreases in distribution of Zostera food resources and depletion of the remaining resources due to waterfowl grazing, which may negatively affect condition of the geese in winter and ultimately survival. On the other hand, the population is now more dispersed during winter and hence less vulnerable to local environmental pertubations. The wider dispersal and changed phenology have several implications for management of the population which are discussed.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

We attempted to explain the numerical fluctuations of two sympatric rodent species in agro-eco- systems of central Argentina using Royama’s theoretical framework for analyzing the dynamics of populations influenced by exogenous climatic forces. We found that both rodent species show a first-order negative feedback structure, suggesting that these populations are regulated by intra-specific competition (limited by food, space, or enemy-free space). In Akodon azarae endogenous structure seems to be very strongly influenced by human land-use represented by annual minimum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), with spring and summer rainfall having little influence upon carrying capacity.

811,"Boonstra, Rudy and Krebs, Charles J",Population limitation of the northern red-backed vole in the boreal forests of northern Canada,"1. Across the vast boreal forests of North America, no population cycles in Clethrionomys species occur. In Eurasia, by contrast, some Clethrionomys populations of the same species undergo regular 3--3-year cycles. We examined the effects of nutrients, food, competitors, predators and climate on population limitation in the northern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus Pallas) in the south-western Yukon to determine why this difference occurs.2. From 1986 to 1996 we added food, reduced large mammal predators and excluded snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) from large plots and found that none of these manipulations affected red-backed vole abundance. Adding nutrients as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilizer had a slight negative effect, probably acting through a reduction in dwarf shrub productivity caused by competition from grasses.3. We monitored weasel populations directly through trapping and indirectly through snow tracking. Predation by these vole specialists was irrelevant as a limiting factor most of the time because voles in this area do not reach the densities needed to sustain weasel populations. Other boreal forest mammal and bird predators did not focus on red-backed voles. However, when red-backed vole populations increased in the forest and Microtus voles also increased in the meadows, weasel populations increased and may have temporarily depressed red-backed voles in winter.4. We monitored one major potential food, white spruce seeds, but seed fall was not related to population changes in red-backed voles, even after mast years.5. We assessed the impact of weather variables, and the average depth of the snow pack during winter (October-March) was correlated directly with vole demography, having both direct effects in that year and delayed effects in the following year.6. Our long-term trapping data (1973--1973) indicate that Clethrionomys populations fluctuated, with peaks following hare peaks by 2--2 years.7. We propose that the key variable limiting these vole populations is overwinter survival, and this is a function of overwinter food from berries produced during the previous summer by dwarf shrubs. These shrubs may be stimulated by abundant moisture from winter snows or by periodic fertilization from large quantities of pellets produced at snowshoe hare peaks.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Census data provided estimates of population density at the end of the wet season (December) and indices of per-capita food intake and annual recruitment. Year-to-year changes in density of as much as 5- to 8-fold were observed at Lutz over 19 yr and of 2- to 3-fold were observed over 4 yr at other sites. Changes in population density at 11 BCI sites were synchronous over 1983-1986, while population density fluctuated independently at non-BCI sites. Populations of A. limifrons exhibited significantly greater generation-to- generation variability than populations of West Indian Anolis and of lizards in temperate- zone habitats (mostly arid lands in North America). An index of per-capita food intake was negatively related to density both for temporal comparisons at Lutz and for spatial comparisons among sites. The relative number of young individuals at the end of the wet season was negatively related to population density and positively related to an estimate of food intake. Partial correlations indicated that the positive association between the relative number of young individuals in the population and food intake was independent of the negative association between food intake and population density. Recruitment was thus depressed when density was high and enhanced when food was relatively abundant. Despite the potential for density-dependent regulation, Anolis limifrons populations are highly unstable, presumably because of random perturbations of the environment. Rainfall is implicated causally although population density was only weakly associated with rain- fall-density at BCI was positively associated with rainfall during the dry season and negatively associated with rainfall during the wet season and with total annual rainfall. Population attributes that contribute to instability are rapid population turnover and a middle-level trophic position in a complex food web.",Ecology,,,,,,,

The two questions that need to be answered when considering an ESA listing are; (1) Is the entity a species under the ESA and if so (2) is the “species” in danger of extinction or likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range? Green sturgeon genetic analyses showed strong differentiation between northern and southern populations, and therefore, the species was divided into Northern and Southern Distinct Population Segments (DPSs). The Northern DPS includes populations in the Rogue, Klamath-Trinity, and Eel rivers, while the Southern DPS only includes a single population in the Sacramento River. The principal risk factors for green sturgeon include loss of spawning habitat, harvest, and entrainment. The Northern DPS is not considered to be in danger of extinction or likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future. The loss of spawning habitat is not large enough to threaten this DPS, although the Eel River has been severely impacted by sedimentation due to poor land use practices and floods. The two main spawning populations in the Rogue and Klamath-Trinity rivers occupy separate basins reducing the potential for loss of the DPS through catastrophic events. Harvest has been substantially reduced and green sturgeon in this DPS do not face substantial entrainment loss. However there are significant concerns due to lack of information, flow and temperature issues, and habitat degradation. The Southern DPS is considered likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future. Green sturgeon in this DPS are concentrated into one spawning area outside of their natural habitat in the Sacramento River, making them vulnerable to catastrophic extinction. Green sturgeon spawning areas have been lost from the area above Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and Oroville Dam on the Feather River. Entrainment of individuals into water diversion projects is an additional source of risk, and the large decline in numbers of green sturgeon entrained since 1986 causes additional concern.",Environmental Biology of Fishes,,,,,,,

We determined relative abundance of active frogs along transects established in the Caribbean National Forest (El Yunque), Carite Forest, San Lorenzo, and in the vicinity of San Juan. Three species (Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti, E. jasperi, and E. eneidae) are presumed to be extinct and eight populations of six different species of endemic Eleutherodactylus are significantly declining at elevations above 400 m. Of the many suspected causes of amphibian declines around the world, we focused on climate change and disease. Temperature and precipitation data from 1970\&\#8211;2000 were analyzed to determine the general pattern of oscillations and deviations that could be correlated with amphibian declines. We examined a total of 106 tissues taken from museum specimens collected from 1961\&\#8211;1978 and from live frogs in 2000. We found chytrid fungi in two species collected at El Yunque as early as 1976, this is the first report of chytrid fungus in the Caribbean. Analysis of weather data indicates a significant warming trend and an association between years with extended periods of drought and the decline of amphibians in Puerto Rico. The 1970\&\#39;s and 1990\&\#39;s, which represent the periods of amphibian extirpations and declines, were significantly drier than average. We suggest a possible synergistic interaction between drought and the pathological effect of the chytrid fungus on amphibian populations.",Herpetologica,,,,,,,

Here, we present results from the first whale shark population study in the Western Hemisphere and describe the inherent difficulties of assessing populations using catch-independent methods in free-ranging sharks. From 1998 to 2003, we identified 106 whale sharks using their distinctive scars and spot patterns following 521 encounters at a predictable seasonal aggregation on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef linked to snapper spawning aggregations at Gladden Spit, Belize. Encountered sharks measured a mean total length of 6.3 m [plus or minus] 1.7 m S.D. and a range of 3.0--0.7 m (n = 317). Sexual and size segregation is suggested: 31 \% of encountered sharks (n = 162) were sexed, of which 86\% were immature males. Between 1999 and 2002, 70 sharks were tagged with 72 conventional tags and measured sharks (n = 63) possessed a mean length of 6.0 m [plus or minus] 1.6 m S.D. (range 3.0--0.7 m). Growth rates for three resighted sharks ranged from an estimated 0.03--03.70 m year-1. Resightings of tagged sharks elsewhere on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef indicate that the population is not resident at Gladden Spit and is shared with two other sites possessing seasonal aggregations: Isla Contoy, Mexico and Utila, Honduras. Monitoring whale shark populations at Gladden Spit and the other aggregation sites on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef underpins the region's lucrative and burgeoning whale shark tourism and is key to their local and international conservation.

This paper reports on field work carried out on Adams I. in the Aucklands Islands group during January and February most years between 1991 and 1997. Over this seven-year period, the average annual number of pairs nesting on Adams I. was 5831. This is the first reliable estimate of the size of the population. Evidence of population changes on the Auckland Is is reviewed. Annual adult survival has been estimated for three years and averaged 97\%; females have a 2\% lower rate than males. D. .e. gibsoni were easily sexed by measurements. Productivity over five breeding seasons averaged 67\%.

During 633 surveys totalling 21,276 km of effort, observations of cetaceans and other marine species spotted in a study area of 480 km2 were systematically recorded. Common dolphin encounter rates declined 25-fold across the study period, steadily decreasing from 2.18 encounters/100 km in 1997 to 0.09 encounters/100 km in 2004. Encounter rates of tuna also declined significantly. Swordfish encounter rates dropped from 1.03 encounters/100 km in 1997 to 0-0.12 in 1998-2004. Encounter rates of bottlenose dolphins did not show significant trends. The decline of high-order marine predators feeding on epipelagic prey was consistent with the hypothesis of prey depletion, likely resulting from intensive exploitation of local fish stocks, particularly anchovies and sardines. The catholic feeding habits and opportunistic behaviour of bottlenose dolphins may allow them to withstand the effects of overfishing at their present low density. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Year-round, some 260 botos occurred in or near the 225-km2 Mamiraua varzea floodplain lake system, of which half were permanent residents by our definition. Seasonal variation in water levels influenced distribution between habitats but not the overall number of botos. Ninety percent of marked botos encountered within the lake system were permanent residents. There appeared to be a cline in site fidelity between those that always live in or near the system and those that visit at intervals of years. We estimated that 270 botos were ""significant users"" of the lake system (i.e., occurred within it for sufficient periods in a year to be observed at least once) and that many others visited for short periods. Individuals moved many tens to hundreds of kilometres along the rivers, but there was no broad-scale seasonal migration. The boto population of the central Amazon, at least, may be structured on the basis of floodplain lake systems, with extensive animal movement between systems. We estimate that 13 000 botos occur in the 11240 km2 Mamirauna Sustainable Development Reserve, which covers an estimated 11\%-18\% of varzea habitat in Brazil.",Canadian Journal of Zoology,,,,,,,

A striking example is the red knot (Calidris canutus rufa) population wintering in Tierra del Fuego, which undertakes marathon 30,000 km hemispheric migrations annually. In spring, migrant birds forage voraciously on horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay in the eastern USA before departing to breed in Arctic polar deserts. From 1997 to 2002 an increasing proportion of knots failed to reach threshold departure masses of 180-200 g, possibly because of later arrival in the Bay and food shortage from concurrent over-harvesting of crabs. Reduced nutrient storage, especially in late-arriving birds, possibly combined with reduced sizes of intestine and liver during refuelling, had severe fitness consequences for adult survival and recruitment of young in 2000-2002. From 1997 to 2002 known survivors in Delaware Bay were heavier at initial capture than birds never seen again, annual survival of adults decreased by 37\% between May 2000 and May 2001, and the number of second-year birds in wintering flocks declined by 47\%. Population size in Tierra del Fuego declined alarmingly from 51,000 to 27,000 in 2000-2002, seriously threatening the viability of this subspecies.

The Poor Knights and 2 reference locations, Cape Brett and the Mokohinau Islands, were sampled biannually for 4 yr using baited underwater video (BUV). Following the implementation of full marine reserve status at the Poor Knights in October 1998, snapper showed significant increases in abundance and biomass relative to fished control locations. This was particularly apparent for large snapper (>270 mm), whose numbers increased rapidly to levels 7.4 times higher in the final survey compared to the initial pre-reserve survey, and total snapper biomass increased by 818\%. There was no significant increase in the abundance, biomass or size of snapper at the reference locations over this time. There was a strong seasonal trend in snapper abundance, with higher numbers in autumn (March/April) compared to spring (September/October). The daily batch fecundity was 11 to 18 times higher at the Poor Knights compared to the reference locations. Once fishing ceased in previously partially protected areas, a rapid recovery of snapper ensued, suggesting that partial fishing regulations are ineffective for protecting targeted species. The speed of increase in snapper density resulted from the immigration of adult fish into the reserve, rather than from within-reserve recruitment.",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

In this paper, we examine the status and trends of the land bird fauna of Saipan Island based on three island-wide surveys conducted in 1982, 1997, and 2007. During this period, the human population on Saipan increased more than four-fold and much of the island has been developed. The surveys employed standard point-transect methods based on Distance Sampling. Remarkably, we found nearly all species of land birds - 11 native species and three introduced species - to be common or abundant. The exception was the Micronesian Megapode Megapodius laperouse, a historically rare species that was not observed on the 2007 survey, although it does persist on Saipan and other Mariana islands. A comparison of species densities among the three surveys showed that seven species, mainly fruit and seedeaters, had increased and three species of insectivorous birds had decreased - Rufous Fantail Rhipidura rufifrons, Nightingale Reed-warbler Acrocephalus luscinia, and Golden White-eye Cleptornis marchei. Of these three, Nightingale Reed-warbler is listed as ‘Endangered’ on the IUCN Red List and as an Endangered Species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Reed-warbler densities on Saipan decreased by more than half between 1982 and 2007. Although point transect sampling worked well for this species, density estimates and trends assessment could be improved by reallocating sampling stations among habitats and by more frequent sampling.",Bird Conservation International,,,,,,,

In December 2008, it was estimated that some 65 000 pairs of king penguins were incubating eggs at Marion Island, the larger of the two islands in the group, and 2 000 pairs at Prince Edward Island. At Marion Island from 1987 to 2008, there was no long-term trend in numbers of king penguin chicks that survived to the end of the winter period, but there was considerable fluctuation in chick production in the 1990s. It was roughly estimated that on average 88\% of king penguin chicks survived the winter period (from April to September/October). Numbers of gentoo penguins at Marion Island decreased from more than 1 300 pairs in the mid-1990s to fewer than 800 pairs in 2003, and then increased to almost 1 100 pairs in 2008 as breeding success improved. Between 1994/1995 and 2008/2009, numbers of macaroni and southern rockhopper penguins at Marion Island decreased by about 30\% and 70\% respectively. In 2008/2009, some 290 000 pairs of macaroni penguins bred at this island, mostly in two large colonies where there was a progressive decrease in the density of nests. At both these colonies, decreases in numbers breeding followed outbreaks of disease. Inadequate breeding success has influenced the decreases of macaroni and rockhopper penguins. In 2008/2009, some 42 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins bred at Marion Island and 12 000 pairs of macaroni penguins and 38 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins at Prince Edward Island.",African Journal of Marine Science,,,,,,,

In this study long-term changes were examined in the reef community at Tiahura Reef, on the northern coast of Moorea, which had been subject to many and varied disturbances over the last 25 years. Tiahura Reef was subject to an outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) in 1980--1980, causing significant declines in the abundance of scleractinian corals and butterflyfishes. By 2003, the abundance of corals and butterflyfishes had returned to former levels, but despite this apparent recovery, the species composition of coral communities and butterflyfish assemblages was very different from those recorded in 1979. Ongoing disturbances (including further outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, cyclones, and coral bleaching events) appear to have prevented recovery of many important coral species (notably, Acropora spp.), which has had subsequent effects on the community structure of coral-feeding butterflyfishes. This study shows that recurrent disturbances may have persistent effects on the structure and dynamics of natural communities.",Coral Reefs,,,,,,,

The overall mortality rate among the females monitored was 47\% within one year of release. The first month following the release (February) was critical for the success of the operation as 35\% of introduced animals died within this time span. It appears that stress was a major cause of mortality at this time, but traumatic deaths caused by drowning, collision with cars, and falling off cliffs were also frequent. The survival rate increased to 0.9 in spring, summer and early fall and decreased again during late fall and early winter. The high mortality rate occurring during this period may be explained by an increased mobility resulting from disturbance from wild boar Sus scrofa hunting. After the reintroduction, the animals stayed close to the release site (50\% within 2.4 km, and 75\% within 4 km), though the adults established themselves at longer distances than the young. The dispersion pattern of the females was not uniform throughout the study area: they preferentially settled down northwest of the release site, which may be explained by the topography of our study area and by the absence of human structures (roads, canals) in this area.",Wildlife Biology,,,,,,,

Similar declines have occurred elsewhere in the Subantarctic. (2) Using detailed data on recaptures of birds ringed as chicks in 1958, 1962, 1963 and 1972 onwards, we examine the relative importance of changes in breeding success, breeding frequency and survival and recruitment rates to the decline since 1976. (3) Breeding success (average 64\%) has increased by 1.2\% per annum, with increases in hatching and fledging success about equally responsible. Breeding frequency has remained constant, except that higher breeding success means more birds breeding biennially. Of successful breeders, 72\%, 8\% and 6\% breed 2, 3 and more years later, respectively; of unsuccessful birds, 68\%, 14\% and 6\% breed 1, 2 and more years later. (4) Recruitment to the breeding population has decreased from 36\% (of a cohort) in the 1960s to 30\% nowadays; average age of first breeding has also decreased. (5) Adult survival averages 94\%; females have a 2\% significantly lower rate than males; survival in the 1960s was probably 1-2\% higher. (6) A demographic model is developed which closely matches the observed changes and gives rates of population decrease between 0.9 and 1.1\% per annum. (7) The causes of the population decrease must operate mainly outside the breeding season (because of high breeding success); the few recoveries of birds of known status support this. Earlier suggestions that incidental mortality due to fishing activity in lower latitudes is important are strongly reinforced by new data (direct observations, ringing recoveries) on birds killed during long-line fishing for tuna.

The reproduction during high adder density and low food availability was compared with that seven years later in the same population during low adder density and high food availability. Female length was similar but weight status (mass/length 2.56) was significantly higher during high prey density. Female mass loss when giving birth and clutch mass were significantly higher during high availa- bility of food, but relative clutch mass and relative mass loss were similar in the two situations. However, the variance in relative clutch mass was significantly lower with high prey density. Clutch size and mass per young were significantly higher during high prey density. During high food availability there were significant positive correlations between female length (\~{} age) and birth mass loss, female length and clutch mass, female length and clutch size, clutch mass and mass per young and between relative clutch mass and mass per young. During low food availability there were significant positive correlations between clutch mass and clutch size and relative clutch mass and clutch size. A significant negative correlation was found between female length and relative mass loss. This study do not conform entirely to general theories on reproductive adaptations to varying food availability (r-K strategies). During high prey density both more and heavier young were produced than during scarcity of food. A high correlation of reproductive parameters during high food availability indi- cates a maximal utilization of reproductive capacity in most females, while the lack of such correlations during low food availability indicates a varying access to food and fat storage possibility among females.",Amphibia-Reptilia,,,,,,,

Feces fromnetted bats were analyzed, and the recapture rate determined. Although both species share a set of food plants, and fruits from early successional forest contribute about half of their diet, C. brachyotis, the smaller of the two species, ate a significantly greater proportion of fruits from early successional forest than C. sphinx. The latter ate a significantly greater proportion of fruit species in larger size classes.More C. brachyotis were captured in early successional forest in almost every month, while C. sphinx is more common in old-growth forest.However, the capture rate of C. sphinx increased in early successional forest in the mid-dry season when its preferred fruits become available. The recapture rate of C. brachyotis in early successional forest was significantly higher than that of C. sphinx, and the reverse situation was observed in old-growth forest.Male C. sphinx had a significantly higher recapture rate in early successional forest than females.

Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) are implicated in extinctions, range restrictions and declines of vulnerable endemic faunas throughout the Pacific. However, research into the behavioural and ecological modifications that enable native species to persist in the presence of Pacific rats is scant. We examined the population structure, behaviour and microhabitat use of Duvaucel's geckos (Hoplodactylus duvauceiii; radio-telemetry), and Pacific rats (spool-and-line tracking) on three New Zealand offshore islands with different histories of rat incursions and eradication: (1) Green island, historically rat-free, (2) Korapuki, from which rats were eradicated 20 years ago, and (3) Ohinau, before and 6 months after rat eradication. Although Pacific rats and Duvaucel's geckos shared habitat at a broad spatial scale, little overlap in micro-habitat use existed where they were sympatric. In the presence of rats, Duvaucel's gecko capture rates and recruitment were reduced. However, 6 months after rat eradication, and prior to any recruitment, capture rates of adult geckos increased fourfold and geckos were using a greater proportion of habitat preferred by rats. Thus, we provide strong empirical evidence that Pacific rats ecologically displace Duvaucel's geckos. Highly plastic spatial avoidance behaviour by native prey species in response to the presence of introduced rodents may enable geckos to persist in sympatry with rodents at least in the short-term.

Combining photo-identification data collected between September 2007 and 2009 with mark-recapture and Pollock's robust design models, we assessed abundance within seasons and survival and temporary emigration rates of dolphins between seasons. We also reanalyzed a previous data set collected during 1989–1991, and Cormack-Jolly-Seber models were applied to estimate survival rates for each of the study periods. The abundance of marked “cooperative” dolphins varied between seasons from 18 (CI: 17–24) to 21 (CI: 20–24). The total abundance varied from 59 in the winter of 2008 (CI: 49–72) to 50 in the autumn of 2009 (CI: 40–62). The annual adult survival was estimated to be 0.917 (CI: 0.876–0.961), close to that estimated from data collected in the 1990s (0.941; CI: 0.888–0.998). The emigration probability was low (0.031; CI: 0.011–0.084) and different capture probabilities between the “cooperative” and “noncooperative” dolphins indicated a degree of behavioral segregation. The precision of our estimates is likely to provide sufficient power to detect population change, but we recommend a precautionary management approach to protect this vulnerable dolphin community and its unique cooperative feeding tradition.",Marine Mammal Science,,,,,,,

887,"Bonenfant, Christophe and Gaillard, Jean-Michel and Klein, Francois and Loison, Anne",Sex- and age-dependent effects of population density on life history traits of red deer Cervus elaphus in a temperate forest,"We studied both the short- and long-term effects of density on three life history traits of a red deer population inhabiting a temperate forest. Both male and female body mass increased when population density decreased, but male mass changed to a greater extent than female mass. Density did not influence female survival irrespective of age, however, survival of males was lower at high density for all age classes except the prime-age class. Pregnancy rates of primiparous females increased markedly with decreasing density, whereas those of adult hinds were fairly constant and unrelated to density. For both sexes, of the studied life history traits we detected a long-term effect of density at birth (cohort effect) only on body mass. These results suggest that density influences life history traits in the same way as factors of environmental variation such as climate. In this population we did not find any evidence for an influence of climatic conditions on life history traits of red deer. Both mild winters and the absence of summer droughts during the study period could account for such an absence of climatic effects. We interpreted our results to show that 1) as expected for a highly dimorphic and polygynous species such as red deer, male traits showed consistently higher sensitivity to variation in density than female traits, illustrating possible costs caused by sexual selection in males, 2) the female-based Eberhardt's model according to which increasing density should sequentially affect juvenile survival, reproductive rates of primiparous females, reproductive rates of adults and lastly adult survival was only partly supported because we found that pregnancy rate of primiparous females rather than juvenile survival was the most sensitive trait to variation in density. We propose that including variation in male traits would improve the accuracy of models of population dynamics of large mammals, at least for highly dimorphic species. Because the population we studied was not fenced, we only measured apparent survival. We discuss how dispersal, in relation to the phenotypic quality of young deer, might be a potential regulating factor under such conditions.",Ecography,,,,,,,

This change follows a major environmental regime-shift in the late 1970s and subsequent dominance of the ecosystem by long-lived predatory flatfishes and cod. An exploratory life table of data on stage-specific abundances was constructed to analyze decadal-scale changes in population demographics. Prior to the mid-1980s, recruitment was correlated with larval mortality, which was largely influenced by environmental conditions. After the mid-1980s, the larval mortality/recruitment relationship eroded, and there was a trend for greater juvenile mortality coinciding with an increase in the abundance of predatory flatfishes and cod. Control of recruitment appears to have shifted in recent years from environmental effects on larvae to biological control of juveniles. Ecosystem change and regime status need to be considered when evaluating mechanisms underlying fish-population dynamics.",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

As noted by Barnes in the mid 1990s there 'is a desperate need for better information on forest elephant distribution and numbers'. (Barnes, et al., 1995). The authors note population estimates given in the latest issue of the African Elephant Database (actually African Elephant Status Report, 2002) provide the best available data , and suggest implementation of the MIKE programme should 'increasingly help fill the information void across the range of forest elephants'. They note that estimates for Central Africa are quite speculative while populations in West Africa are better known, but actual numbers are small and very fragmented - a situation that is made quite apparent in WCMC's Global Forest Watch maps (p1196) illustrating 'Cumulative Areas in Forest Concession' in Gabon between 1957-1999 and 'Extent of Logging Concessions and Protected Areas' in Cameroon between 1959-2002. Although 'significant funding has been obtained in recent years' much more is required including more precise population survey methodologies. Their conclusion notes three points of interest: efforts should concentrate on protecting elephants in large protected areas 'where the chances of long term success are highest'; measurements to monitor the performance of conservation efforts need to be improved; and, surveys and monitoring programmes should be implemented across the forest elephant range to identify areas containing significant populations, and better understand trends in both population size and illegal killing at the regional level.

The study was conducted in a rural area of the Atlantic Forest, in Sumidouro, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The population sizes, age structure and reproduction were studied for the four most common species in the study area. The overall diversity was 1.67 and ranged between 0.8 to 1.67. The species richness was 13 considering the whole study. The most abundant species were the rodents Nectomys squamipes (n = 133), Akodon cursor (n = 74), Oligoryzomys nigripes (n = 25) and the marsupials Didelphis aurita (n = 58) and Philander frenatus (n = 50). Seven other rodents were captured once: Necromys lasiurus, Akodon montensis, Sooretamys angouya, Oecomys catherine, Oxymycterus judex, Euryzygomatomys spinosus and Trinomys iheringi. There were higher peaks for diversity and species richness during the winter (dry) months, probably due to higher food availability. The marsupials had a seasonal reproduction with highest population sizes at the end of the rainy seasons. Nectomys squamipes reproduced mostly during rainy periods. Akodon cursor reproduced predominantly in the winter with the highest population peaks occurring during this season. The analysis of the population dynamics of the rodent species indicated that no species behaved as an agricultural pest, probably due to the heterogeneous landscape of high rotativity of vegetable cultivation. Rodent populations were more susceptible to the removal procedure than marsupial ones.",Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia,,,,,,,

However, such a closed population structure may not be an appropriate model for management of carnivore populations where immigration and emigration are important population parameters. The closed population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality will reduce numbers and densities of carnivores and that low hunting mortality will increase numbers and densities. By contrast, the open population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality may not reduce carnivore densities because of compensatory immigration, and low hunting mortality may not result in more carnivores because of compensatory emigration. Previous research supported the open population hypothesis with high immigration rates in a heavily hunted (hunting mortality rate=0.24) cougar population in northern Washington. We test the open population hypothesis and high emigration rates in a lightly hunted (hunting mortality rate=0.11) cougar population in central Washington by monitoring demography from 2002 to 2007. We used a dual sex survival/fecundity Leslie matrix to estimate closed population growth and annual census counts to estimate open population growth. The observed open population growth rate of 0.98 was lower than the closed survival/fecundity growth rates of 1.13 (deterministic) and 1.10 (stochastic), and suggests a 12--12\% annual emigration rate. Our data support the open population hypothesis for lightly hunted populations of carnivores. Low hunting mortality did not result in increased numbers and densities of cougars, as commonly believed because of compensatory emigration.",Animal Conservation,,,,,,,

We sampled 60 sites across >900 km in northern and central Ontario, Canada, from 2001 to 2004 to assess spatial and temporal trends in abundance and population growth of small mammals. We tested alternative predictions for 3 causes of synchrony: dispersal, predation, and correlated environmental perturbations (the Moran effect). During 25,680 trap nights, Myodes gapperi, Tamias striatus, and Peromyscus maniculatus were the most commonly captured species. Populations of all 3 species fluctuated markedly during the 4 years of sampling, but fluctuations appeared to occur over a relatively small spatial extent (<200 km for all species). No pairwise combination of species exhibited positive interspecific synchrony, suggesting that nomadic predation was not synchronizing declines among species. Our data were most consistent with the dispersal hypothesis or a Moran effect caused through synchronous food crops.",Journal of Mammalogy,,,,,,,

Effective long-term monitoring is hampered by the fact that populations are widely dispersed except during the breeding season. Thus most monitoring programmes focus on nesting beaches, necessitating resource intensive studies, often over months, that could conceivably, be less comprehensive and focus on more parsimonious sampling. We analyse 11 years of exhaustive monitoring data for two species of Mediterranean marine turtles (Chelonia mydas and Caretta caretta). We resample using a variety of plausible sub-sampling regimens to estimate the total annual nesting population. We project our dataset into the future applying a range of population change rates to explore how adopting a monitoring programme based on sub-sampling would, for example, affect our ability to detect population decline. We show that accurate annual population estimates can be achieved with as few as 14 days of survey effort providing monitoring spans the peak of nesting. Furthermore, the modelled impact of sampling-based monitoring suggests that the duration to detect population change is not increased greatly. Our findings have implications for all marine turtle monitoring and have applicability to other animal groups. It is often considered desirable to perform exhaustive monitoring, with aversion of basing policy recommendations on partial data. However, comprehensive long-term monitoring programmes, particularly in developing nations, although presenting a number of advantages, are often impossible. Accurate total annual censuses can be achieved through a variety of sub-sampling regimens without sacrificing the ability to detect changes in the population trends over time. In this example, a solid block of at least 3 weeks sampling that encompasses the peak of the nesting season is advised. [copyright] 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the actual distribution of tigers across Sumatra has never been accurately mapped. Over the past 20 years, conservation efforts focused on the Sumatran tigers have increased, but the population continues to decline as a result of several key threats. To identify the status of the Sumatran tiger distribution across the island, an island-wide questionnaire survey comprised of 35 respondents from various backgrounds was conducted between May and June 2010. The survey found that Sumatran tigers are positively present in 27 habitat patches larger than 250 km2 and possibly present in another 2. In addition, a review on major published studies on the Sumatran tiger was conducted to identify the current conservation status of the Sumatran tiger. Collectively, these studies have identified several key factors that have contributed to the decline of Sumatran tiger populations, including: forest habitat fragmentation and loss, direct killing of tigers and their prey, and the retaliatory killing of tigers due to conflict with villagers. The present paper provides management authorities and the international community with a recent assessment and a base map of the actual distribution of Sumatran tigers as well as a general overview on the current status and possible future conservation challenges of Sumatran tiger management.",Integrative Zoology,,,,,,,

906,"Browne, Constance L. and Hecnar, Stephen J.",Species loss and shifting population structure of freshwater turtles despite habitat protection,"Changes to population and community structure can have important ecological consequences and raise conservation concerns when causes are anthropogenic; however, signs of stress may not always be apparent. Turtles are long-lived and presence of adults may suggest healthy populations when lack of recruitment is actually threatening persistence. We observed and captured turtles for two years in Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada, and compared our results with those collected 30 years earlier to determine if (1) species relative abundance, (2) sex ratios, and (3) age structure changed over three decades. Extirpation of the spotted turtle since 1972-1973 has altered the park's species assemblage. Evidence also suggests that Blanding's turtles have declined. Sex ratios were similar between time periods for all species except for the painted turtle which has become significantly more male-biased. Size structure for Blanding's and snapping turtles shifted towards larger and presumably older age classes. Our results suggest that limited juvenile recruitment caused the size shift. Heavy predation on turtle nests from a dense raccoon population appears to be the main factor limiting recruitment. Despite protecting a sizable fragment of turtle habitat for a century, Point Pelee has lost one species and only one other species has a large healthy population. Our study illustrates that habitat protection provides no guarantee for species persistence when multiple threats exist and highlights the necessity for monitoring populations of long-lived species. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Some stocks are increasing, such as in eastern Australia and Hawaii. However, there is evidence that many stocks have been reduced significantly, which is mainly a result of overharvesting of eggs, subsistence or commercial harvest of large turtles and nesting habitat destruction. Incidental capture in coastal and pelagic fisheries can also be an important source of mortality for some stocks.

Extensive monitoring demonstrated a globally significant population for the species despite a sustained high level of anthropogenic take of nesting females for local consumption. Through an extensive stratified monitoring program across the island in the seasons 2007--2007, we estimated a total of 13 955, 12 028 and 19 950 clutches in the 3 years, respectively. These values indicate that the mean number of nesting females averaged 3700. Considering that a female breed, on average, every 2.4 years, we estimate that the overall number of adult females in the population during these three seasons was 8900. These levels are much higher than those suggested in previous studies which were more constrained in spatial coverage. Our findings indicate that Cape Verde hosts the third largest nesting aggregation for this species in the world after the south-eastern US and Oman, with some sites having a particularly high density of nests, facilitating targeted monitoring and conservation. Consumption of sea turtle meat is a traditional practice in Cape Verde that continues despite national sea turtle protection laws. We estimated that 36, 18 and 5\% of nesting females were harvested in the 3 years of the study, respectively. Increasing beach protection and monitoring, ongoing educational programs and cooperative projects with local communities are urgently needed to further safeguard the only major loggerhead nesting aggregation in the eastern Atlantic.",Animal Conservation,,,,,,,

We present 7 years of camera trapping, tracking, and observational data on a local tiger population in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, to quantify changes in abundance of demographic groups and to identify underlying causes. Mean abundance in the 100-km(2) study area was 18 tigers, but there was high variance among years. Transients were generally recorded at low levels, but there were large oscillations in numbers of tiger offspring, driven by infanticide perpetrated by male tigers taking over territories. The number of breeding animals in the study area remained relatively stable, with about 6 breeding females and 1 or 2 breeding males. The high density of breeding adults in Chitwan National Park highlights the region as a potential stronghold for tigers. Concentrating on counting breeding animals increases the power of monitoring programs to detect change over time. An alternative approach is to carry out surveys on a scale large enough to encompass sufficient territories to compensate for the local impacts of periodic turnover of adult males on total abundance.",Journal of Mammalogy,,,,,,,

Zoological Studies 48(1): 83-94. We report on the nesting ecology and environmental parameters of one of the largest green turtle, Chelonia mydas, rookery nesting site in Taiwan: Lanyu (Orchid I.), Taitung County, southeastern Taiwan. The site was studied from 1997 to 2006. Results showed that although turtles nest year-round, the main nesting season occurs in the warm and dry summer. Green turtles were forced to nest on the smallest beach, where anthropogenic disturbances were relatively low. The warm surface-water temperature tends to result in shorter inter-nesting intervals. Fewer nesters in poor nesting years were found to lay fewer clutches. The relatively wet and cooler weather and firm sand on Lanyu tends to increase the substratum compactness, resulting in relatively shallow nests, Larger females tended to deposit larger clutch sizes. Precipitation may be responsible for increased hatching mortality. The morphological characters of the hatchlings were found to be influenced by the egg characters. Although the population size of the study area is small, studies of the nesting ecology and conservation measures are still important to the regional population status, especially in the Asian region where most populations are either severely depleted and/or poorly understood. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.1/83.pdf",Zoological Studies,,,,,,,

This survey covered the largest number of anatum populations to date and resulted in a larger number of occupied anatum territories and territorial anatum pairs than found in any of the previous surveys. The largest increases took place in Ontario and in central and southern Alberta, where mass reintroductions of captive-raised young had occurred yearly since 1992. North of 58°N, the Mackenzie Valley and Yukon River populations had average annual growth rates indicating stability. These are the largest and longest surveyed populations in Canada. Although the Southern Lakes population of the Yukon Territory disappeared during the 1970s, a pair reoccupied a historic (known) site in 1995 and successfully fledged three young. The northern Alberta population, which had an average annual growth rate of 21\%, has been managed since 1975, and surveys of additional nesting habitats resulted in five new territories. South of 58°N, the British Columbia anatum population has recovered. In central and southern Alberta, 12 pairs occupied sites, but only three pairs successfully fledged young. In Saskatchewan, two pairs reoccupied the two known city sites in Regina and Saskatoon and successfully fledged young. Similarly, in Manitoba, four pairs occupied city sites in Winnipeg and Brandon, but only two pairs successfully fledged young. The Ontario population reoccupied seven historic (known) sites in addition to eight new sites, and 10 pairs successfully fledged young. In southern Quebec, pairs occupied 13 sites and singles two sites. Ten pairs successfully fledged young. In the Maritimes, five sites in New Brunswick and one site in Nova Scotia were occupied. This latter site was the first site occupied by a territorial pair in Nova Scotia in over 40 years. In Labrador, peregrines reoccupied 20 of 31 known sites, and surveys of additional nesting habitats located 11 new sites. Within the tundrius populations, the Yukon North Slope population may be experiencing a recovery from its demise in 1970. Only a single adult was seen in 1990, but surveys between 1990 and 1995 located four occupied territories. During the 1995 survey, an additional occupied territory was found. In the Northwest Territories, which included Nunavut, populations appear stable.

In both 1980 and 1994, we obtained data primarily via a survey of farmers islandwide to obtain estimates of group size and number of groups on agricultural land. We assessed the farmers"" estimates independently for reliability by counting number of groups and group size on a subsample of farms. We surveyed approximately 20\% of the total land area in Barbados and extrapolated the results to the whole island. The estimate of population size of monkeys in 1994 is 4\% greater than for 1980, but the difference is not statistically significant. This suggests that, despite the removal of over 10,000 vervets via humane trapping and through hunting over the 14-year period, population size has remained the same. Over the same time period, the percentage of crops damaged by vervets was reported by farmers to have increased almost 30\%. The increase in crop damage relative to the increase in vervet abundance may best be explained by a decrease in the availability of crops to vervets, since substantial amounts of agricultural land were taken out of crop production between 1980 and 1994.",International Journal of Primatology,,,,,,,

Abundance indices of both large and medium size groups exhibit interannual-decadal variations, but their patterns were different. The large and medium size groups of saury are corresponding to the recruitments of winter- and spring-cohort, respectively. The abundance of large size group saury was significantly correlated with the winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Kuroshio region, whereas the medium size group saury showed high correlations with SST in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone and the Oyashio region, indicating that the two size groups are affected by subtropical and subarctic environment, respectively. Significant negative correlation between the abundance index and the southern oscillation index (SOI) suggested that El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) events have marked impacts on the large size group saury. Subtropical high pressure index and far east zonal index also show high correlations with the abundance of both large and medium size group saury, indicating a linkage between large-scale atmospheric circulation and the abundance of saury. These correlations demonstrate that the abundance of Pacific saury is directly affected by the SST fields through large-scale atmosphere-ocean interactions from the equatorial Pacific to mid- and high-latitude areas such as El Nino events.",Fisheries Research (Amsterdam),,,,,,,

This is perhaps the primary reason for the unchanged distribution of the saddlebilled stork in South Africa. A statistical power analysis is carried out to determine whether the current survey methods conducted in the KNP, which count storks incidentally, are sufficient to detect trends in population size. The surveys are unable to detect assumed trends and, in order to do so, marked improvements will have to take place. Two other methods have been used to count the KNP saddlebilled stork population, (i) a specific saddlebilled stork aerial survey and (ii) a modified capture-recapture technique based on individual photographic recognition. Both of these have greater power to detect trends in population size than those presently undertaken by the park authorities. Of these two methods, the latter has a greater ability to detect decreasing population trends. However, because of logistic and temporal constraints which will negatively affect technique precision, a specific saddlebilled stork aerial survey is proposed as the method most able to monitor population trends. However, a combination of aerial and photographic estimation techniques will also yield demographic data, which are as yet unavailable.",South African Journal of Wildlife Research,,,,,,,

The range area and population size of the Saiga in Kazakhstan have changed substantially since they were first described, declining rapidly through the nineteenth century to a low point in the 1920s, followed by recovery until the 1950s and subsequent stabilization. A detailed description is given of the Saiga's habitat and the differences between the winter and summer pastures. The species feeds mainly on grasses, although herbs and shrubs are seasonally important. The migratory patterns of the species divide into directional seasonal migrations and less structured local movements. Group sizes are largest in the calving season and during the autumn migration. Harems are formed in early December. Fertility rates are high, with females giving birth in their first year of life, and routinely twinning thereafter. However, mortality rates are also high in years of drought and harsh winters. The major factors limiting populations include climate, parasites and diseases, predators, and anthropogenic factors. The major human influences are commercial hunting and poaching. Agriculture and habitat alteration are less important currently, although they were probably responsible for the division of the Kazakhstan population into three separate populations. The species was well managed in the Soviet period, with strong institutional structures. However, a new political era requires a re-evaluation of the Saiga's needs, in the face of a growing threat from poaching.",,,,,,,,
952,"Gates, C Cormack and Stelfox, Brad and Muhly, Tyler and Chowns, Tom and Hudson, Robert J",The ecology of bison movemennts and distribution in and beyond Yellowstone National Park,"In 1968, Yellowstone National Park (YNP) moved from a 33 year (1934-1967) period of culling ungulate populations for achieving predetermined stocking levels to a regime of ecological management under which populations of bison and other ungulates are allowed to fluctuate in the park without human intervention. With growing numbers of bison, management has become dominated by two major linked controversies; namely, the risk to livestock of transmission of brucellosis from bison moving beyond the park boundary, and criticism of the effects of winter use by snowmobiles on bison movements and range expansion, including transboundary movements, bison condition and population dynamics. This project was initiated to: 1) provide a thorough, independent assessment of the state of knowledge of the ecology of bison movements and distribution within the context of current published concepts and theories; 2) provide recommendations for adaptive management of uncertainties and gaps in reliable knowledge within an adaptive environmental assessment and management framework, which involves organizing people to link science to management. The principal investigators, based at the University of Calgary, Faculty of Environmental Design, were chosen because of their lack of previous association with issues related to YNP bison ecology or winter use management, allowing them to assess the state of knowledge and adaptive management from an unbiased perspective. The project was commissioned by the National Park Service. The research contract was administered by the Rocky Mountains Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit (RM-CESU) at the University of Montana. The assessment entailed review of 1) literature on ungulate distribution, including Yellowstone National Park publications and planning documents, 2) key informant interviews for gaining rapid understanding of the system and unpublished knowledge, 3) development of a strategic level bison population and winter distribution model, and 4) key informant technical workshops to refine the model. In addition, 5) a workshop was held with environmental non-government organizations to review the concepts and knowledge upon which the assessment and model are based. The assessment is summarized below. We first present key findings derived from key informant knowledge and interpretation of empirical data on population and spatial ecology. Secondly, we provide a summary of key findings derived from a systems model. Then we summarize key uncertainties and data gaps that may be addressed through monitoring and basic research. To be effective, adaptive management requires learning from key management experiments defined with the agreement of stakeholders and carried out under scientifically rigorous experimental designs. We identify key challenges v for adaptive management, including how agencies are organized to collaborate on and coordinate policy development, management experiments, and procurement of scientific research and monitoring data in the long term. Finally, we offer recommendations for addressing these challenges.",,,,,,,,

In this paper, changes in the major New Zealand orange roughy fishery on the Chatham Rise during a 19-year period are examined. Data from research trawl surveys and commercial fishing returns from 1979 to 1997 were analysed, and changes in the population described. The distribution of orange roughy showed a marked contraction, and aggregations became largely centred around seamounts or very localised areas of the slope. The biomass of orange roughy, measured by trawl survey and commercial catch-per-unit-effort indices, declined substantially, and in 1997 was estimated to be about 20\% of virgin levels. Most bycatch species also declined in abundance, with no indication of species replacement. Size structure of the population did not change markedly over the period. Timing of spawning in July, and the pattern of gonad development, were also consistent over the years. There was no change in size or age at maturity. Prey composition remained similar. Biological changes may not have been apparent because orange roughy is a long-lived, slow-growing species, with low productivity. There could be a long response time of the population to fishing pressure. ",Fisheries Research,,,,,,,

In this paper, we examine the case of raptor predation on upland passerines and waders in Scotland. We analysed the abundance of five wader and passerine species on an upland sporting estate in southern Scotland during an eight-year period when hen harrier, peregrine and merlin numbers increased due to strict law enforcement. The abundance of meadow pipit and skylark declined significantly during this time. Golden plover also showed a declining trend, whereas curlew increased significantly and there was a near significant increase in lapwings. Contrasting the local population trends of these species with trends on nearby areas revealed higher rates of decline for meadow pipit and skylark at the site where raptors increased, but no differences in trends for any of the three wader species. There was a negative relationship between the number of breeding harriers and meadow pipit abundance the same year and between total annual raptor numbers and meadow pipit abundance. Predation rates of meadow pipit and skylark determined from observations at harrier nests suggested that predation in June was sufficient to remove up to 40\% of the June meadow pipit population and up to 34\% of the June skylark population. This 'quasi-natural' experiment suggests that harrier predation limited the abundance of their main prey, meadow pipit, and possibly the abundance of skylark. Thus, high densities of harriers may in theory reduce the abundance of the prey species which determine their breeding densities, potentially leading to lower harrier breeding densities in subsequent years. We found no evidence to suggest that raptor predation limited the populations of any of the three wader species. We infer that concerns over the impact of natural densities of hen harriers on vulnerable upland waders are unjustified.",Oikos,,,,,,,

A systematic method to record seabird passage along the coast became established in the early 1970s and was used ever since. These observations allowed a reconstruction of the return of the elusive harbour porpoi- se in Dutch coastal waters. A small, but gradually increasing number of sightings in the mid-1980s to early 1990s was followed by a proportional rate of increase of 41\% per annum over the last 15 years. At first, only full-grown animals were seen and the occurrence was virtually restricted to mid-winter. In later years, numbers sharply in- creased in winter, and more and more animals were seen also in summer and autumn, including mother-calf com- binations. Both the historic decline and the recent increase are concurrent with similar trends in strandings and at- sea survey data. Unambiguous explanations for the initial decline have never been given and it is equally difficult to fully understand the come-back. There is evidence, however, that distributional shifts rather than population fluctuations underlie the trends observed. The re-distribution of harbour porpoises in the North Sea may have been triggered by local reductions or shifts in principal prey availability.",Lutra,,,,,,,

By 2001 beavers created about 15.000 ha of wetlands and improved habitat for other animals and plants on roughly 21.000 ha. Increased beaver numbers have intensified beaver-human-conflicts. Management strategies that retain the benefits of beavers while minimizing related economic losses are outlined. Principles of successful beaver management are also detailed: (I) understanding population trends and limits, (II) enumerating the diverse ecological and hydrological values related to beavers, (III) protecting properties in a long-term, cost-effective manner that does not eliminate beavers, and (IV) educating the public. Survey results of beaver populations, beaver ecological effects, and human attitudes are presented. Management options that confront Poland and other European countries are discussed.","Denisia, Neue Serie",,,,,,,
985,"Apollonio, Marco and Ciuti, Simone and Pedrotti, Luca and Banti, Paolo",Ungulates and their management in Italy,"Italy is a complicated but fascinatingmixture of different popular traditions, historical origins, dialects. The country ranges from the Alps to the large Mediterranean islands, and the nation itself is a composite mixture ofmany politically independent different areas, that were initially joined together in 1860. At this time unity as a single nation was only partially achieved, being further fulfilled during World War I but then reduced again afterWorldWar II. Innumerable political events and influences have left their mark and affected popular traditions during the first two millennia AD. The result of this process is a complex country, subdivided into 20 regions and 103 provinces, with a total land area of 30 210 000 ha and with a human density of 189 ind./km2. This is not only very interesting from a cultural and historical point of view, but leads to some complications in hunting management. Moreover, 5 out of 20 regions have been granted substantial autonomy by the Italian National Government, leading to still greater complexity in administration. For all these reasons it is extremely difficult to collect data on a large scale in Italy and, as will be remarked upon later in this chapter, this situation is also affected by the absence of any significant state-control of management. The present chapter is based in part on updating of previous works (Pedrotti et al., 2001; Apollonio, 2004), but primarily tries to provide this missing overview by collating the results of new data collected between 2001 and 2004, on ungulate presence and management from all the “traditional” 103 Italian provinces. More data on ungulate status and culling statistics come from Carnevali et al. (2007).",European Ungulates and their Management in the 21st Century,,,,,,,
986,"Chilvers, B. L.","Using life-history traits of New Zealand sea lions, Auckland Islands to clarify potential causes of decline","Annual censuses of New Zealand (NZ) sea lions Phocarctos hookeri at the suban- tarctic Auckland Islands have indicated a decline in pup production of over 40\% during the first decade of the 2000s. With this significant decline and likely decline in the population as a whole, population ecology theory hypothesizes that life- history traits such as reproduction rate, survival or growth should improve, par- ticularly if density-dependency is playing a significant role in the population. This research examined whether changes in NZ sea lion pup production were associ- ated with changes in adult abundance or population life-history traits in an attempt to clarify potential causes of decline. Since 1998/1999, daily surveys of Sandy Bay, Enderby Island, were undertaken during the NZ sea lion breeding season (December–February). These surveys confirm that the number of adults at the breeding area has significantly declined during the period of pup production decline. There was no difference between years in mean pup birth date, but the ratio of pups to females ashore during peak pupping varied significantly. The sex ratio of pups at birth also varied from year to year, but with no significant variation overall. Pup mortality varied significantly only during years of epizootic events (1997/1998, 2001/2002 and 2002/2003). Pup birth mass showed little vari- ation between 2000/2001 and 2006/2007, increasing slightly in the last 3 years of study. Pup mass at 3 weeks, although highly variable, showed no trend during the period of decline. Despite the significant decrease in pup production and breeding animals, not all life-history traits relating to pup mass and survival or female fecundity improved. Research suggests that indirect fishing-related pressures may influence some of these traits and that the NZ sea lion population was unlikely to have been influenced by density-dependent factors or to have been at or near carrying capacity before the decline.",Journal of Zoology,,,,,,,

Catch rates in weight per haul per species were standardised to annual indices of abundance using a log-linear model. Standardised annual index trends for flathead, latchet and leatherjacket indicate a strong to severe decline during the period covered by the data. All species showed seasonal patterns, but the peak season varied depending on the species. The distribution of standardised catch rate by area also differed greatly by species, and no single area showed consistent differences across all species. Day trawls caught more flathead, redfish and latchet, while night trawls caught more morwong and leatherjacket. Moon phase had less influence on catch rates than other factors. The correlation of annual index trends to a number of annual mean environmental factors was examined and no strong correlations were found.",Marine and Freshwater Research,,,,,,,

In recent decades, the populations of several goose species have increased dramatically and are severely impacting on their habitat. We examined the relative contribution of reproduction and mortality to changes in the dynamics of the entire North American population of greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus from 1970 to 1998. 2. The total population increased 10-fold over this period, with two phases of rapid population growth in 1970--1970 and 1984--1984 separated by an intervening period of stagnation. The reproductive rate was estimated from age ratios in the autumn, survival from ring recoveries, and harvest rates from hunter surveys. 3. Variations in population growth could not be explained by changes in reproduction, which was similar across the three periods (overall mean 26 [plus or minus] 3\% young in the autumn flock) with no evidence of density-dependence. 4. Adult survival did not differ between the two periods of rapid population growth (0.84 [plus or minus] 0.04 during 1970--1970 vs. 0.80 [plus or minus] 0.04 during 1990--1990), thus providing no evidence of density-dependence effects either. The survival rates of young could only be estimated during 1990--1990, when they varied greatly (mean 0.36 [plus or minus] 0.12, annual range 0.11--11.48). 5. Adult harvest rates were much higher during the period of no population growth (0.11 [plus or minus] 0.01\%) than before (0.04 [plus or minus] 0.01\%) or after (0.06 [plus or minus] 0.01\%). The increased harvest starting in 1975 was due to the re-opening of the US hunting season. Thus, reduced survival due to increased hunting mortality apparently caused the stagnation of growth between 1975 and 1983. 6. We conclude that hunting mortality has had the most impact on recent population dynamics in the greater snow goose and, in the absence of density-dependent effects, hunting could be used to limit the growth of this population.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,

Data collected during ferry-based cetacean surveys in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay between 1998 and 2002 were analysed to investigate the distribution, encounter rate, and habitat characteristics of toothed cetaceans there. In all, 17 873 nautical miles were surveyed, and 1008 encounters of 13 identified species, including delphinids, ziphiids, harbour porpoise, and sperm whale, were recorded. The common dolphin was the commonest species, followed in decreasing occurrence by striped and bottlenose dolphins, pilot whale, harbour porpoise, Cuvier's beaked whale, and sperm whales. The distribution of harbour porpoises was restricted to the shallow waters of the western English Channel. Common and bottlenose dolphins were distributed mainly over the continental shelf, although there were some encounters along the shelf edge and in the open ocean. Striped dolphins and pilot whales were sighted in oceanic waters in the central and southern Bay of Biscay. Cuvier's beaked whales and sperm whales were recorded in the deep oceanic waters of the southern Bay of Biscay. Bathymetry clearly plays a significant role in the distribution and habitat partitioning of toothed cetaceans in the region.",ICES Journal of Marine Science: Journal du Conseil,,,,,,,

Canonical correspondence analysis using seven abiotic variables (mean width, residual pool depth, water surface slope, mean Froude number, variance in Froude number, maximum monthly discharge and minimum monthly discharge) separated fish communities among sites and years. The first axis represented a headwater-to-valley gradient; the second axis reflected habitat complexity, based on both geomorphic and hydraulic features. Temporal differences in fish densities were related to hydrological factors. Fish communities throughout the catchment showed similar responses to flood and drought.$\backslash$n",Ecology of Freshwater Fish,,,,,,,

Smaller, degraded forest fragments that surround the BFMS also contain C. vellerosus and may provide an important habitat for the monkeys. Our objectives were to 1) determine the current population size and density of C. vellerosus at BFMS and in five surrounding fragments, 2) examine the differences in demographics between the fragments and BFMS, and 3) determine whether a relationship exists between population density and fragment size and isolation distance from BFMS. The census was a complete count and was conducted for 1 month (July 2003) by S.W. and trained research assistants. Seven census routes were walked simultaneously on 13 days. The 2003 population estimate of C. vellerosus at BFMS was 217--217 individuals (15 groups), a slight increase from the 2000 census. Numbers in the fragments (58--58, six groups) have remained stable since 1997, when the only other census of these fragments was conducted. Mean group size did not differ between the fragments and BFMS. Larger fragments had larger numbers of colobus, but there was no relationship between fragment size and colobus density. Isolation distance had no effect on population density. Our data suggest that colobus probably travel between fragments. Conservation efforts should focus on treating the small forests and their connecting areas as a single conservation unit.",American Journal of Primatology,,,,,,,

After the adoption of protection measures, natural expansion and reintroductions led to the recovery of this species over much of its European range. 2 We review historical events that led to the recovery of beavers in France, and summarize the status of beavers in various river systems. Beaver establishment in France is a story of overall success: several major river systems are presently occupied, so that the species is no longer at risk in France. 3 However, beaver recolonization took place in parallel with increasing human impacts on the environment. In addition to natural limiting factors, anthropogenic factors impeded beaver settlement in many areas. Today, beavers often occupy suboptimal habitats and, as a consequence, come into conflict with human activities. Effective solutions for preventing beaver damage include the restoration of riparian habitats to discourage crop damage and the provision of physical barriers to protect crops. 4 Beaver populations reintroduced into France all originate from the relict Rhone population. However, in recent years, beavers from populations in neighbouring countries have been expanding into north-eastern France. Therefore, our review of beaver origin and distribution in these countries may contribute to the development of appropriate national management strategies and towards important decisions, e.g. the decision to try to keep Rhone beavers genetically isolated, or to allow populations to mix. 5 The recently discovered presence of North American beavers Castor canadensis in three countries surrounding France has raised an important issue. This species may out-compete C. fiber in places where the species come into contact. A programme based on field-trapping sessions and genetic analyses has recently been initiated in some western countries in order to eradicate this non-native species.",Mammal Review,,,,,,,

1070,Dfo,"Recovery potential assessment of Cumberland Sound, Ungava Bay, Eastern Hudson Bay and St. Lawrence beluga populations (Delphinapterus leucas)","Cumberland Sound Beluga • In Cumberland Sound, reconstruction of the historical population using the available catch information provides an estimated historical (pre-commercial whaling) population size of 8,465 (S.E. = 426). A Bayesian model estimated the 2002 population size to number 2,018 (95\% C.L.: 1,553-2,623), or 24\% of its estimated historical population size. The population is estimated to be on an increasing trend even with the quota regulated local subsistence hunt.  • A recovery target at 70\% of historical population size would correspond to 5,926 individuals. This target could be reached in 40, 55 and 90 years for harvest scenarios of 0, 20 and 41 (actual quota), respectively. The population would likely decline under a harvest scenario of 60. • Subsistence hunting might be considered as a threat to the Cumberland Sound beluga population. Nevertheless, the actual carefully managed subsistence hunt, that inflicts a low mortality rate, does not seem to be an impediment to recovery over the long term. Eastern Hudson Bay Beluga • Estimates of the historical (pre-commercial whaling) Eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) beluga population size using catch data and a population model suggest a minimum population of 12,500 belugas in 1854. Modelling of current population size indicates that the population has declined from 4,200 (SE=300) whales in 1985 to 3,100 (SE=800) in 2004, and would be at 25\% of its historical size. The population would likely stabilize at current harvest levels (60 belugas). • A recovery target at 70\% of the historical estimate would represent 8,750 belugas based on current information. This target could be reached by 2046 with a complete closure of harvesting, by 2081 with a reduction in reported harvests to 25 animals, and by more than 150 years from now with a reported harvest of 40 animals. • Subsistence hunting continues to be a cause for concern. There is uncertainty associated with total numbers of animals actually harvested by Inuit from Nunavut (Sanikiluaq), Nunavik and along the Labrador coast, as well as the stock identity of the animals taken by these hunters. Ungava Bay Beluga • In Ungava Bay, reconstruction of the historical population using the available catch information provides an estimated historical (pre-commercial whaling) population size of 1,900 animals in the late 1800s. There are no current estimates of abundance for this population, but modeling suggests that numbers are less than 200 animals. Small numbers of beluga continue to be seen in the Mucalic River, in southern Ungava Bay during the summer. This population may be extirpated and the few beluga observed in Ungava Bay may be from neighboring stocks.  • A recovered population of 70\% of the historical estimate would number 1,330 animals. There is no scope for human induced mortality with this population. Any harvesting on this population poses a threat to recovery. St. Lawrence Beluga • Historical (pre-commercial whaling) abundance of beluga in the St. Lawrence River Estuary was likely in the order of 10,100 animals during the 1800s. High harvests led to a decline in the population. Although protected from harvesting since 1979, little sign of recovery has been observed. Fitting a population model to aerial survey data collected between 1988 and 2003 suggests that the population has increased only slightly from 900 (SE=70) animals in 1988 to 1100 (SE=200) animals in 2003. • Since there is currently no harvesting of this population, it is unclear whether the failure of this population to increase more rapidly results from high mortality rates, a reduction in recruitment or a combination of the two. If the factors limiting growth of this population could be identified and rectified, then the population would be expected to reach the recovery population level of 7,070 by 2049. If current conditions continue, then recovery would not be expected before 2101.",Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Science Advisory Report,,,,,,,

1121,Fisheries and Oceans Canada,Recovery Potential Assessment for Northern Fur Seals (Callorhinus ursinus),"In 2006, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) recommended that the northern fur seal be listed under SARA as a threatened species. The recommendation was based on a 54\% decline in pup production on the Pribilof Islands, the largest breeding area. A final decision on whether this species will be legally listed under SARA is pending. DFO Science has developed a Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) process to provide information and scientific advice for meeting SARA requirements for listed species, and for deciding whether to add species to the list. The RPA process includes an assessment of current population status, scope of human induced mortality, and characteristics and availability of critical habitat. • Northern fur seals inhabit the North Pacific and comprise a single population; • Abundance of northern fur seals has declined from 1.7 million to 1.2 million over the last 30 years (3 generation). The decrease occurred at the largest breeding area on the Pribilof Islands; abundance at other breeding areas has not changed or has increased; • The cause of the fur seal decline on the Pribilof Islands is unknown, but does not appear to be due to direct human-induced mortality; • The breeding and wintering range of northern fur seals does not appear to have changed in recent years; • During the pelagic migration, about 375,000 northern fur seals (30\% of the population) winter along the west coast of North America (California to SE Alaska), with about one-third of those inhabiting Canadian waters during their peak abundance in May; • Critical habitat has not been defined. The main wintering area in Canada is La Perouse Bank off SW Vancouver Island, which is utilized predominantly by adult females that forage primarily on herring; • Recovery targets and sustainable levels of human-induced mortality have not been established; • The recent, unexplained decline of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands is a conservation concern, but the species is still the most widely distributed and abundant pinniped in the North Pacific Ocean, and seasonally one of the most abundant pinnipeds off the west coast of Canada.",Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Science Advisory Report,,,,,,,

1147,"Dodd Jr.}, C Kenneth",Drift Fence-Associated Sampling Bias of Amphibians at a Florida Sandhills Temporary Pond,"Five years of field observations suggest that amphibians inhabiting a sandhills community are able to circumvent a drift fence-pitfall trap enclosure as they move toward and away from an ephemeral pond. Trespass rates varied depending on species and showed no tendency to increase or decrease as the study progressed. Laboratory trials confirmed that frogs easily crossed the fence by walking up the side or hopping over it. Frogs crossed the fence readily regardless of sex or whether the frog was an adult or juvenile. Although striped newts did not climb over the fence in the laboratory, they may use tunnels to go under fences under field conditions. Other species may burrow directly under the fence. A priori assumptions about a species' ability to climb a fence, or that trespass rates do not vary temporally or among sites, are unwarranted and may lead to misinterpretations of the results from studies using drift fences and pitfall traps.

1148,"Dodd, C. Kenneth",Biological diversity of a temporary pond herpetofauna in north Florida sandhills,"From 1985 through 1990, the herpetofauna of a temporary pond in an uplands longleaf pine sandhills community in north-central Florida was monitored. A drift fence completely encircled the pond. Animals were captured in pitfall traps and marked as they entered and exited the pond basin. I captured 16 155 individuals of 42 species (16 amphibians, 26 reptiles). The species richness, diversity (using Margalef's Diversity Index) and dominance (using the Berger-Parker Index) varied among years. Between 62.5\% and 87.5\% of the amphibian species and 65\% to 81\% of the reptile species were captured in any one year. Daily amphibian capture was positively correlated with rainfall, whereas reptile capture was either not correlated or weakly negatively correlated with rainfall. Hydroperiod duration was not correlated with the numbers of either amphibians or reptiles captured. Neither the amphibian nor the reptile community showed any trends in diversity or dominance indices during the course of the study, although both communities were dominated by a few species. However, the species responsible for community dominance changed somewhat as the study progressed. Assessing the results of this study is hampered by the lack of comparable studies elsewhere, expected natural fluctuations of amphibian populations, and a prolonged drought, especially during the latter stages of the study. The herpetological community at Breezeway Pond does not appear to follow theoretical predictions of community response to stress. Temporary ponds are important centres of herpetofaunal biodiversity in uplands sandhills communities. Long-term studies are needed to monitor the composition, structure, and functional interactions of their resident species.",Biodiversity and Conservation,,,,,,,
1149,"Dodd, C. Kenneth and Dorazio, Robert M.",Using Counts To Simultaneously Estimate Abundance and Detection Probabilities in a Salamander Community,"A critical variable in both ecological and conservation field studies is determining how many individuals of a species are present within a defined sampling area. Labor intensive techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and removal sampling may provide estimates of abundance, but there are many logistical constraints to their widespread application. Many studies on terrestrial and aquatic salamanders use counts as an index of abundance, assuming that detection remains constant while sampling. If this constancy is violated, determination of detection probabilities is critical to the accurate estimation of abundance. Recently, a model was developed that provides a statistical approach that allows abundance and detection to be estimated simultaneously from spatially and temporally replicated counts. We adapted this model to estimate these parameters for salamanders sampled over a six year period in area-constrained plots in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimates of salamander abundance varied among years, but annual changes in abundance did not vary uniformly among species. Except for one species, abundance estimates were not correlated with site covariates (elevation, soil and water pH, conductivity, air and water temperature). The uncertainty in the estimates was so large as to make correlations ineffectual in predicting which covariates might influence abundance. Detection probabilities also varied among species and sometimes among years for the six species examined. We found such a high degree of variation in our counts and in estimates of detection among species, sites, and years as to cast doubt upon the appropriateness of using count data to monitor population trends using a small number of area-constrained survey plots. Still, the model provided reasonable estimates of abundance that could make it useful in estimating population size from count surveys.",Herpetologica,,,,,,,

J.",Evaluating a potentially strong trophic interaction: Pumas and wild camelids in protected areas of Argentina,"Predatory interactions involving large carnivores and their ungulate prey are increasingly recognized as important in structuring terrestrial communities, but such interactions have seldom been studied in the temperate Neotropics. Here, the large carnivore guild is limited to a single species, the puma Puma concolor, native prey populations have been drastically reduced and lagomorphs and ungulates have been introduced. We examined puma dietary patterns under varying abundances of native camelid prey 2013 guanacos and vicu\~{n}as 2013 in protected areas of northwestern Argentina. We collected puma feces from seven protected areas, and sampled each area for the relative abundance of camelids using on-foot strip and vehicle transects. In one area, where longitudinal studies have been conducted, we examined the remains of vicu\~{n}as and guanacos for evidence of puma predation in 200420132006. We compared our results with a study conducted in 197820131983, and contrasted the frequency of carcasses showing signs of puma predation with estimates of camelid abundance. Across sites, we observed a positive and significant relationship between camelid consumption by pumas and camelid abundance, with pumas about nine times more likely to consume camelids where the latter were most abundant. The temporal variation in predation rates on camelids differed by species. Guanacos, which did not change in abundance between periods, showed a slight decrease (1.5 times) in the relative frequencies of individuals killed by pumas. Conversely, vicu\~{n}as increased in abundance by a factor of 223C7 between periods, coinciding with an c. 3.4 times increase in individuals showing evidence of puma predation. Some protected areas of northwestern Argentina are conserving the trophic interaction between pumas and native camelid prey. This interaction may be the basis of the far-reaching community effects described for analogous systems on other continents. It also has implications for the possible recovery of or reintroduction of camelids to areas with high puma densities, where predation losses can be expected to be high, and possibly prohibitive.",Journal of Zoology,,,,,,,
1154,"Donlan, C. Josh and Campbell, Karl and Cabrera, Wilson and Lavoie, Christian and Carrion, Victor and Cruz, Felipe",Recovery of the Gal??pagos rail (Laterallus spilonotus) following the removal of invasive mammals,"Rails (family Rallidae) are vulnerable to the impacts of invasive mammals, and this is particularly true for species on oceanic islands. The endemic Gal??pagos rail (Laterallus spilonotus) is no exception; previous studies suggested that Gal??pagos rail populations were heavily impacted due to predation by pigs (Sus scrofa) and habitat degradation by goats (Capra hircus). Following recent conservation actions that have eradicated pigs and goats from Santiago Island, changes in rail abundance were observed. Estimated densities have increased by over an order of magnitude between 1986/1987 and 2004/2005. Limited data on rail densities from two additional islands over the same time period provide further support to the notion that the eradications spurred recovery. On Fernandina Island, where there is no history of invasive mammals, rail density increased slightly between 1986/1987 and 2004/2005. In contrast, on Isabela Island where invasive mammals were present both in 1986/1987 and 2004/2005, rail densities declined at one site between those two time periods. While the Gal??pagos rail is vulnerable to invasive mammals, the observed changes following goat and pig removal are encouraging for Rallidae conservation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Sighting data of olive ridleys were stratified by survey effort and sighting conditions, thereby reducing potential biases from heterogeneous observation conditions. Dive data from satellite telemetry studies were used to correct for the proportion of turtles that were submerged and unavailable for detection dur- ing the surveys. A weighted average of the 5 by-year estimates (1998 to 2006) was 1.39 million (coef- ficient of variation, CV = 19.7\%; approximate 95\% CI: 1.15 to 1.62 million).

The strategy for colony monitoring includes estimating timing of nesting events, rates of reproductive success and population trends of representative species of various foraging guilds (e.g., offshore diving fish-feeders, diving plankton-feeders) at geographically dispersed breeding sites. This information enables managers to better understand ecosystem processes and respond appropriately to resource issues. It also provides a basis for researchers to test hypotheses about ecosystem change. The value of the marine bird monitoring program is enhanced by having sufficiently long time-series to describe patterns for these long-lived species. In summer 2012 data were gathered on northern fulmars, storm-petrels, cormorants, kittiwakes, glaucous-winged gulls, murres, pigeon guillemots, ancient murrelets, auklets and/or puffins at eight annual monitoring sites on the Alaska Maritime NWR. In addition, data were gathered at other locations which are visited intermittently or were part of a research or monitoring program off refuges.",AMNWR report,,,,,,,

This study investigated the interannual variation in the growth rate of populations of Capra pyrenaica Schinz, 1838, and its extinction risk by comparing the dynamics of populations that were stable for more than two decades (Gredos and Tortosa-Beceite), populations that had increased recently (Tejeda-Almijara), and populations that were in decline (Cazorla-Segura) or extinct (the Pyrenees population; hereafter, bucardo). To estimate quasi-extinction threshold assessments (50\% of population extinct in this study), which have implications for the conservation of the species, we used empirical data and the predictions derived from several theoretical models. The results indicate that when variance of log population growth rate reaches a specific threshold, the probability of quasi-extinction increased drastically. For C. pyrenaica, we recommend keeping population variance < 0.05, which will reduce the likelihood that the irruptive oscillations caused by environmental and demographic stochasticity will put the population at risk. Models to predict the dynamics of C. pyrenaica populations should incorporate temporal stochasticity because, in this study, it strongly increased the likelihood that a population declined.",Acta Theriologica,,,,,,,

As one of East Africa's premier tourist attractions, it is also a major source of foreign exchange for Tanzania. This paper reports the decline of populations of wildebeest, Thomson's and Grant's gazelles since the mid-1980s and the rise to dominance of the buffalo, the results of research carried out from 1996 to 2000 on the Crater ungulates, and discusses natural and anthropogenic factors that may be linked to the population changes. Samples comparing young:adult female ratios in Ngorongoro and Serengeti populations indicated higher survival rates of Crater wildebeest and zebra young, and lower survival rates of Thomson's gazelle. The possibility that predation by lions and spotted hyenas was responsible for reductions in the ungulate populations is belied by corresponding declines in the number of predators. Further research in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is urgently needed to increase understanding of this complex ecosystem and promote effective stewardship, not only of Ngorongoro Crater but of the Serengeti ecosystem, of which the NCA is an integral part, comprising an International Biosphere Reserve. Our recommendations include establishment of a scientific advisory board and a research center that would attract and accommodate Tanzanian and foreign scientists. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

1204,"Fearnbach, H and Durban, J and Parsons, K and Claridge, Diane E",Photographic mark – recapture analysis of local dynamics within an open population of dolphins,"Identifying demographic changes is important for understanding population dynamics. However, this requires long-term studies of definable populations of distinct individuals, which can be particularly challenging when studying mobile cetaceans in the marine environment. We collected photo-identification data from 19 years (1992–2010) to assess the dynamics of a population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) restricted to the shallow (,7 m) waters of Little Bahama Bank, northern Bahamas. This population was known to range beyond our study area, so we adopted a Bayesian mixture modeling approach to mark–recapture to identify clusters of individuals that used the area to different extents, and we specifically estimated trends in survival, recruitment, and abundance of a ‘‘resident’’ population with high probabilities of identification. There was a high probability ( p 1⁄4 0.97 ) of a long-term decrease in the size of this resident population from a maximum of 47 dolphins (95\% highest posterior density intervals, HPDI 1⁄4 29–61) in 1996 to a minimum of just 24 dolphins (95\% HPDI 1⁄4 14–37) in 2009, a decline of 49\% (95\% HPDI 1⁄45\% to 75\%). This was driven by low per capita recruitment (average ;0.02) that could not compensate for relatively low apparent survival rates (average ;0.94). Notably, there was a significant increase in apparent mortality (;5 apparent mortalities vs. ;2 on average) in 1999 when two intense hurricanes passed over the study area, with a high probability ( p 1⁄4 0.83) of a drop below the average survival probability (;0.91 in 1999; ;0.94, on average). As such, our mark– recapture approach enabled us to make useful inference about local dynamics within an open population of bottlenose dolphins; this should be applicable to other studies challenged by sampling highly mobile individuals with heterogeneous space use.",Ecological Applications,,,,,,,

There were no significant differences in mean size and age between protected reefs and unprotected reefs. However, mean size and age varied significantly between the two protected and the two unprotected reefs. In the two reefs closed to fishing, the population structure was dominated by the presence of a strong year class which settled in early 1984, indicating the occurrence of strong interannual fluctuations in recruitment. A similar pattern was not observed on the reefs open to fishing, suggesting that fishing mortality may have caused the decrease in abundance of this strong year class on the open reefs. Sex change occurred over a wide range of sizes and ages on the four reefs. A comparison of the frequency of developmental stages between reefs indicated significant variation. The two unprotected reefs had a smaller proportion of males, but that seemed to be compensated for by a larger proportion of transitional-stage fish and young males. Although the distribution of developmental stages in the populations was different, the same final female: male balance was achieved. This suggests that for the leopard coralgrouper, sex change results from a combination of developmental and behavioral processes. Differences in age structure were more obvious than differences in the size structure between closed and open reefs, suggesting that age structure may be far more useful than size structure for comparisons of fishing effects on long-lived fishes such as Epinephelinae serranids. Comparisons of open and closed reefs based solely on mean sizes may fail to detect important differences.",Fishery Bulletin,,,,,,,

Photographic identification of individuals was used in a capture-recapture analysis to estimate the abundance and composition of the colony during 1993 to 1998. Results of the application of these techniques to Mediterranean monk seals were satisfactory, and allowed independent annual population estimates. No significant trends in abundance over the period 1993 to 1996 were detected, and the mean estimate for the period was 317 seals (CV = 0.16; 95\% CI: 237 to 447). Environmental changes affecting suitability of habitat, particularly food availability, are suggested as major factors for limited population recovery during this period. In spring 1997, a mass mortality event reduced the population size to 109 individuals (CV = 0.14; 95\% CI: 86 to 145). Mortality was age-specific and resulted in a severe change in the stage composition of the population. Adults were the most affected, and therefore the proportion of juveniles increased from an initial 12\% before the event to about 29\% after. As a result of both the decrease in seal numbers and the change in population composition, the number of individuals potentially contributing to reproduction fell to about 77 or fewer. This number may not be enough to maintain genetic variability and overcome the effect of demographic stochasticity. The demographic changes caused by the die-off are expected to have both positive and negative effects on the reproductive success of the colony. However, they are undoubtedly factors which potentially threaten the stability and survival of the colony in the near future.",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,
1217,"Forcada, Jaume and Trathan, Philip N.",Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean,"Penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments, but they can be highly sensitive to climate change, which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather, oceanography and critical habitats. For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and Ad�lie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models.",Global Change Biology,,,,,,,

Numbers of British wintering pochard doubled between 1948-1951 and 1960-1962; analysis of National Wildfowl Counts since 1960 shows that this dramatic increase continued into the early 1970s. The British population peaked, as it did in the rest of western Europe, during the mid-1970s, with a stabilisation or a slight decline in numbers since that time. The mid-winter population increased from 12-15 000 in the early 1960s to an estimated peak of 50 000. Within Britain, there have been considerable increases in numbers wintering on gravel pits, and sympathetic management of floodlands has also attracted greater numbers of pochard. The most important wintering flock at Duddingston Loch, Edinburgh, which exceeded 8000 in the 1970s, has disappeared due to closure of sewage outfalls in the nearby Firth of Forth. Such changes in habitat use have resulted in the geographical redistribution of pochard within Britain during the last two decades.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Demography,"A 4-year field study of one group of 60–80 spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve has revealed a form of social system undescribed among carnivores but common among primates. Male juveniles disperse from the natal group around puberty and join a population of nomadic males, wandering widely before settling in a new clan. Adult males frequently leave their adopted clan after a variable period of residence. Females remain in their natal group for life. Thus, the clan comprises several matrilines of related females, while resident adult males originate outside the group. Clans in the Mara tend to be separated by wide buffer zones where prey is scarce and boundary maintenance behaviours are relatively uncommon. Transients are subordinate to residents, but are tolerated by them, in contrast to the more territorial clan system that has been described in Ngorongoro Crater.",Animal Behaviour,,,,,,,

With a wide geographic range and more living individuals than any other listed land animal, biologists have needed to detect population trends against a ""noisy"" background of strong annual changes. We obtained annual population estimates of desert tortoises over 6 consecutive years at a 2.59-km2 plot in Joshua Tree National Park, California. Our estimates, based on weekly spring surveys, varied substantially, particularly between wet and dry years. Concurrently, we followed 10 radiotagged animals for 3 years to corroborate the surveys. Population density was determined separately for each year and for all years combined. Our best population estimate was an average of 67 adult tortoises, three times more than the density reported in a 1978 survey of the same site. Annual mortality was low ( <10\%), and the animals showed extreme site fidelity. Apparent changes in population size were most strongly related to the animals' varying susceptibility to capture. In dry years, home ranges decreased, captures decreased, and effort required to find each tortoise nearly doubled. Our data confirm that tortoises are likely to be undercounted during dry years and call into question earlier studies conducted during droughts.          Factores que Afectan la Evaluacion Poblacional de Tortugas del Desierto    Resumen:  Las tortugas del desierto han sido tema de controversia desde que fueron enlistadas como amenazadas en 1990. Con un amplio rango de distribucion geografica y mas individuos vivos que cualquier otro animal terrestre enlistado, los biologos han necesitado detectar tendencias poblacionales contra un trasfondo ""ruidoso"" de cambios anuales fuertes. Obtuvimos estimaciones de la poblacion anual de tortugas del desierto por seis anos consecutivos en un cuadrante de 2.59 Km2 en el Parque Nacional Joshua Tree de California. Nuestras estimaciones, basadas en sondeos semanales de primavera, variaron sustancialmente, particularmente al comparar anos lluviosos con anos secos. Al mismo tiempo, monitoreamos por tres anos a 10 animales marcados con radiotransmisores para corroborar los sondeos. La densidad poblacional estuvo determinada por separado para cada ano y para todos los anos combinados. Nuestras mejores estimaciones de densidad poblacional fueron en promedio de 67 adultos, tres veces mas que la densidad reportada en un sondeo de 1978 en el mismo sitio. La mortalidad anual fue baja ( <10\%) y los animales mostraron una fidelidad extrema por el sitio. Los cambios aparentes en el tamano poblacional estuvieron mas fuertemente relacionados con la variacion en la susceptibilidad de captura de los animales. En anos secos, el rango de hogar disminuyo, las capturas disminuyeron, y el esfuerzo requerido para encontrar cada tortuga fue de casi el doble. Nuestros datos confirman que las tortugas son probablemente mal contadas ( menos) durante los anos de seca y ponen en duda estudios previos realizados durante secas.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

The abundance, size structure and catch of commercially targeted groupers (Serranidae), emperors (Lethrinidae) and snappers (Lutjanidae) were investigated before the establishment of these reserves, then in 1997 and again in 2000. By 1997, these fish had shown a significant increase in mean abundance within two of the no-take reserves. By 2000 each family and three individual species (Lethrinus obsoletus, Cephalopholis argus and Variola louti) had increased in abundance in the reserves. There were significant increases in mean individual length of the serranids Epinephelus fasciatus and C. argus and of the lethrinids L. nebulosus and Monotaxis grandoculis. Meanwhile, mean recorded catch per unit effort (CPUE) within the adjacent fished areas increased by about two-thirds (P <0.05) during the 5 years. The establishment of the no-take reserves appears to have played a key role in maintaining the sustainability of the fishery. The involvement of local Bedouin and fishermen in the co-management of fisheries resources was critical to the success of this initiative.",Marine and Freshwater Research,,,,,,,

1238,"Garber, S. D. and Burger, J.",A 20-yr study documenting the relationship between turtle decline and human recreation,"This study documents the detrimental effects of human recreation on the North American wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta) in Connecticut. We chronicled the dynamics of two allopatric wood turtle populations in a protected southern New England wildlife reserve for 20 yr (1974-1993). Both wood turtle populations were reproductively isolated from one another, physically separated approximate to 100 yr ago when a 1.5 km long human-made pond was constructed. We conducted a mark-and-recapture study on a 1000-ha section of a protected watershed in south-central Connecticut (New Haven County). During this study we monitored 133 different wood turtles, observing them a total of 1176 times. Human and wood turtle demographics were recorded throughout this period. The data support the following conclusions: (1) following a period of apparent stability, two populations of wood turtles declined; (2) the declines were more or less synchronous in both populations; (3) the beginning of each decline corresponded to the opening of the habitat for recreation; (4) an increase in mean turtle age suggests a failure of recruitment; however, (5) a simultaneous reduction in numbers of adult females suggests that the failure of recruitment alone is not sufficient to explain the declines. Throughout our study the size of the forest remained the same, road building was restricted, and the quality of the air and water were constant. The wood turtle populations remained stable when people were denied access to the property. When this area was opened to human recreation (hiking, fishing) the two discrete wood turtle populations declined steadily; the total number of turtles in both populations declined by 100\% in 10 yr. As wilderness areas become mixed-use recreation areas, wood turtle populations may suffer. We conclude that without proper management, the increasing recreational use of parks, reservoirs, and wildlife reserves will adversely affect the long-term survival of the North American wood turtle.",Ecological Applications,,,,,,,

From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance. Meta-analysis of data arising from these case studies are used to establish the overall effect of MPAs, and its relationship to MPA features, such as size of no-take area or time since protection. Based on the review and the meta-analyses, specific recommendations are provided for MPA management, regarding the establishment of goals and objectives, site selection, MPA design and zoning, planning, and monitoring. Finally, a series of recommendations for MPA research are offered to drive future research in MPA issues in the Mediterranean and Macaronesia. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

O.",Effects of 1997-1998 El Ni??o on the dynamics of the shallow-water fish assemblage of the Patos Lagoon Estuary (Brazil),"High rainfall associated with El Ni??o events significantly increases runoff and stream discharge in southern Brazil. High freshwater discharge changes salinity, temperature, and water circulation patterns that can affect the fish estuarine assemblage. Using long-term data obtained from standardized surveys, we analyzed fish assemblage structure and dynamics in shallow waters of the Patos Lagoon estuary in southern Brazil before, during, and after the 1997-1998 El Ni??o event. Overall, the relative abundance of all the fish groups in the estuary was about five times lower during the El Ni??o than before and after. Freshwater vagrants were the only group with greater abundance during El Ni??o. Fish species richness was higher in the estuary during the El Ni??o event, when many freshwater species expanded their ranges into the Patos Lagoon estuary, than before or after the El Ni??o. El Ni??o-induced assemblage changes were not highly persistent, and the estuarine fish assemblage returned to its pre-El Ni??o state within 18 months after the El Ni??o period. Densities of many marine and estuarine fishes increased to pre-El Ni??o levels within 3-6 months of the end of the El Ni??o period. We suggested that the rapid recovery of fish estuarine populations after the 1997-1998 El Ni??o may have been caused by one or some combination of: (a) enhanced productivity stimulated by nutrients contained in newly deposited alluvial sediments, and (b) enhanced larvae transport in the large saltwater intrusion that followed the El Ni??o event. Clearly, fish population dynamics and assemblage structure of the Patos Lagoon estuary can neither be interpreted nor predicted on a long-term basis without explicit consideration of El Ni??o Southern Oscillation patterns. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Oil that spilled after the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in 1989 killed large numbers of sea otters in western Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. However, our boat-based counts of sea otters during 1990–96 at oiled sites were as high or higher than boat-based counts in the same area in the early 1980s. 2. Another study reported a significant decline in sea otter numbers after the spill, but our reanalysis of that data produced results very similar to ours. Counts of otters were higher than pre-spill counts in the oiled area; the only detectable decline was in the northern part of the sound, outside the area of oiling. 3. We suggest that otter numbers in the western sound may have been increasing during the late 1980s, masking the loss due to the spill. Direct evidence for such an increase is lacking because no counts were conducted during this period. However, for several years after the spill pup production was higher than normal, which, if characteristic of the period immediately pre-spill, could have spurred a population increase. 4. Heightened pup production may have been caused by increased food supplies: after the spill, otters obtained more and larger clams per dive and spent less time feeding per day than in the early 1980s. 5. We postulate that in the early 1980s clams were still recovering from the uplift caused by the 1964 earthquake, which resulted in massive clam mortality and habitat change in the western sound. Lingering effects of previous catastrophic events, like the earthquake and even 19th-century fur harvests, have hampered attempts to assess the impacts of the oil spill on sea otter population dynamics. The effects of uncontrolled and unreplicated environmental incidents, even major disasters, may be difficult to assess because of con- founding factors.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,

Seabird breeding habitat in this region includes steep, rocky coasts and low-lying coasts backed by lowland sedge-meadow tundra. The former areas sup-port colonial cliff- and scree-nesting seabirds, such as murres and fulmars; the latter inland or coastal seabirds, such as terns, gulls and jaegers. The region supports some 4 million breeding seabirds, of which the most numerous are thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia; 75\%), black guillemots (Cepphus grylle; 9\%), northern fulmars (Fulmarus gla-cialis; 8\%) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla; 6\%). The majority of Arctic seabirds breed in a small number of very large colonies (10,000 birds), but there are also substantial numbers of non-colonial or small-col-ony breeding populations that are scattered more widely (e.g. terns, guillemots). Population trends among Canadian Arctic seabirds over the past few decades have been vari-able, with no strongly negative trends except for the rare ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea): this contrasts with nearby Greenland, where several species have shown steep declines. Although current seabird trends raise only small cause forconcern, climateameliorationmay enable increased development activities in the north, potentially posing threats to some seabirds on their breeding grounds.",Polar Biology,,,,,,,

Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2002: 11: 2072013222. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2002 Abstract†2013†The required freshwater habitats of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are, in general, well known, but vary in quality, related to interacting effects of several variables, which may depend on different parts of a river system. Examples are given of ranges of densities and growth that can be found at various sites in eastern Canada, illustrating the biological and physico-chemical factors affecting production of juvenile salmon. Relative growth rates can indicate habitat quality and population densities. Salmon parr have negative effects on brook trout in riffle habitats. The effects of migrations within the river and of changes with stream succession on juvenile salmon production are illustrated with examples from a Newfoundland river. Migration of age-classes can be quantified from 'self-thinning' curves. Lakes have enhancing effects on downstream fluvial habitats, and, at least in Newfoundland, and probably in many boreal areas, the lacustrine proportion of the basin can be used as an index for deriving estimates of required spawning escapement. The factors described should be taken into account for more refined estimates of river production and management of the salmon resource.",Ecology of Freshwater Fish,,,,,,,

The past distribution was evaluated using field interviews, the present range was determined by sign searching (scats) in 5x5 km and 1x1 km UTM quadrats, and the annual population size was estimated by camera-trapping. Our results indicate that lynx distribution has been limited to granite areas, and since the middle of the 20th century lynx occupation was detected in only 17 5x5 km UTM quadrats. An important decline in lynx numbers has been registered since the early 1990s, resulting in only 11 UTM 5x5 km occupied quadrats between 2001 and 2002, with two subpopulations separated by a 5 km distance occupying 3 and 8 quadrats each. Considering 1x1 km UTM quadrats, the distribution range increased from 125 km2 in 2002 to 203 km2 in 2006. Also, between 2002 and 2006 the number of female territories increased from 19 to 31. The population size was assessed since 2004, increasing from 84 detected individuals (32 adults) to 135 individuals in 2006 (43 adults). The positive dynamics observed during the study was partially related to the development of a major conservation program. The lynx distribution was correlated with rabbit distribution and abundance, therefore conservation measures must be based on rabbit management in order to recover habitat carrying capacity since the most important Iberian lynx population is still too small.",Wildlife Biology in Practice,,,,,,,
1262,"Grant Gilchrist}, H. and Mallory, Mark L.",Declines in abundance and distribution of the ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea) in Arctic Canada,"The ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea) is a seabird that inhabits Arctic oceans throughout the year, often in association with polar pack ice. It is rare (<14,000 breeding pairs globally) and remains one of the most poorly known seabird species in the world. Canada supports breeding populations of international significance, and residents of communities in the Canadian High Arctic currently observe fewer ivory gulls than they did in the 1980s. However, no population trend data existed for this species in Canada prior to this study. We initiated aerial surveys in July 2002 and 2003 of most known ivory gull colonies in Canada to assess current population levels. Forty two colonies were visited, 14 of which were new discoveries. We recorded an 80\% decline in numbers of nesting ivory gulls. Several of the largest known colonies were completely extirpated and those that remained supported significantly fewer nesting birds than previously observed. Results were similar in both years despite some differences in local sea ice conditions, suggesting a numerical decline in the population and not simply annual fluctuations in colony occupation. Declines have occurred in all habitat types and across the known Canadian breeding range, suggesting that causes of the decline may be related to factors occurring during migration or on wintering grounds. We recommend that international efforts now be directed at assessing population status and trends of this species in other circumpolar countries. Crown Copyright ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1263,"Giling, Darren and Reina, Richard D. and Hogg, Zoe",Anthropogenic influence on an urban colony of the little penguin Eudyptula minor,"Native animals exploit resources in cities and inhabit anthropogenic structures worldwide. One example of this is the little penguin, Eudyptula minor, population nesting between boulders on the St Kilda breakwater in Melbourne. This population is attracted by safe hiding places, a lack of predators and the presence of prey. However, living close to urbanisation poses many threats to the colony, including boating, lighting, noise and human visitation. We investigated the effects of human disturbance by comparing the number of penguins and breeding sites in the publicly accessible region with those in the restricted region of the breakwater. Penguins and nest sites were not equally distributed along the breakwater, with the mean number of birds and nest sites present per 20-m section in the restricted region significantly greater ( typically double) than the number in the publicly accessible region. Although the penguins show a clear preference to nest in the restricted region of the breakwater, their continued presence in the publicly accessible region when nest sites are not limiting indicates that human disturbance is not incompatible with some nesting activity. In a global context these results illustrate some of the benefits and costs to animals that use anthropogenically altered habitats and urban environments",Marine and Freshwater Research,,,,,,,

In this paper the results of a 25-year study of a roe deer population, which was not subject to significant levels of culling, predation or ungulate competition are presented. Following planting with conifers (which was mostly in 1961-62), the canopy cover increased, most rapidly between 8 and 15 years after planting. Ground vegetation cover was negatively correlated with canopy cover. The deer population increased from 46 km-2 to 76 km-2 between 4 and 13 years after planting, after which it declined sharply to 34 km-2. A significant negative cross-correlation was found between conifer canopy cover and deer density with a lag of 6 years, indicating that the decline in deer numbers lagged behind the decline in browse supply. The rate of recruitment was correlated with the conifer canopy cover without any indication of a significant lag. The decline in cover of the main food plant species (bramble Rubus fruticosus), was much greater than the decline in deer density, implying that the deer were forced to change their diet and perhaps also their patterns of habitat selection in response to the change in habitat structure.",Forest Ecology and Management,,,,,,,

Abundance and biomass of grouper species pooled were 54\% and 72\% higher, respectively, at Ngerumekaol compared to Ebiil.

For the parameterized matrices obtained, we calculated population growth rates with confidence intervals, net reproductive rate, reproductive value, stable stage structure, and we performed a sensitivity analysis. We also generated and analyzed an analogous stage structured matrix model for the same population assuming no harvesting. The main results are (1) a negative growth rate for the observed population data; (2) a positive growth rate for the population without the capture effect which is significantly different from the growth rate of the harvested population; (3) the sensitivity analysis revealed that $\lambda$ is more sensitive to variations in adult survival in the age class 7-10 years; (4) the observed population exhibits a stable stage structure. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

G.","Foraging partitioning between giant petrels Macronectes spp. and its relationship with breeding population changes at Bird Island, South Georgia","We satellite-tracked the foraging trips of males and females of the 2 sibling species of giant petrels, Macronectes halli and M. giganteus, breeding sympatrically at Bird Island (South Georgia, Antarctica), during the incubation period (November-December). Size of the activity range in addition to speed and distance covered on foraging trips were similar between the species, but were lower for males than for females in both species. Sex-specific differences agree with previous observations on diets and on attendance at seal carcasses, suggesting that females mainly forage at sea, whereas males mainly scavenge on the coast. Overall, however, the foraging ecology of both species seems very similar. Interspecific and intersexual competition may be reduced by the limited overlap in the at-sea range, with southern giant petrels foraging further south than did northern giant petrels, and females further west than males, suggesting some spatial partitioning in foraging areas. Male northern giant petrels foraged almost exclusively on the South Georgia coast; their strong dependence during the brooding and chick-rearing period on Antarctic fur seals, whose population has increased exponentially in recent years, may be reflected in the recent population increase of northern giant petrels at South Georgia. Foraging areas of giant petrels overlapped extensively with longline fishery distribution, highlighting their susceptibility to being caught on longline hooks. Females were at higher risk during the study period since they made longer trips and foraged further west than males, into areas where local longline fisheries are more active.",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

Forest Range tiger occupancy in the Panna landscape (3,500 km(2)) estimated by 1,077 surveys of 5 km each was 29\% +/- SE 1. Within occupied Ranges of the Reserve a mean of 68\% +/- SE 7 of forest Beats had tiger signs. A total of 800 camera-trap nights yielded 24 captures of seven individual adult tigers within an effective trap area of 185.0 +/- SE 15.8 km(-2). The best model incorporating individual heterogeneity (M(h)) estimated the tiger population to be 9 +/- SE 2. Tiger density was 4.9 +/- SE 1.5 per 100 km(2) and was lower than that reported in 2002 (6.49 tigers per 100 km(2)). Both occupancy and density indicated a decline of the tiger population in the Reserve. Mean ungulate density was 42.4 +/- SE 8.4 km(-2) and comparable to other tiger reserves.

Bottom trawl catches in the Mwanza Gulf showed a decline in catch rates from 67.5 kg h-1 in 1973 to 5.5 kg h-1 in 1986. Trawling of commercial vessels in the Speke Gulf revealed a decline in lungfish catches from 1.3 kg h-1 in 1986 to 0.07 kg h-1 in 1990. The development of anoxia in the deeper waters of Lake Victoria, the algal blooms, and the decline of water transparency, all associated with eutrophication, are not likely to have contributed to the decreased catch rate. However, the lungfish decline may reflect the interaction of overexploitation by the fishery and a low level of Nile perch predation that restricts lungfish to wetland refugia. We suggest that this may have been reinforced over the past few decades by large-scale conversion of wetlands to agricultural land and harvesting of nest-guarding male lungfish leading to decreased recruitment of young. Resume Les donnees sur les prises et les efforts de capture pour la periode qui va de 1973 a 1990 montrent un declin spectaculaire des protopteres dans les eaux tanzaniennes du lac Victoria. Les prises faites au chalut dans le golfe de Mwanza montraient une reduction des taux de prises de 67,5 kg/h en 1973 a 5,5 kg/h en 1986. Les bateaux commerciaux qui pechent au chalut dans le golfe de Speke ont rapporte un declin de leurs prises de protopteres de 1,3 kg/h en 1986 a 0,07 kg/h en 1990. L'extension de l'anoxie dans les eaux profondes du lac Victoria, la profusion d'algues et la diminution de la transparence de l'eau, qui sont toutes associees a l'eutrophisation, sont peu susceptibles d'avoir contribue au declin du taux de prises. Le declin des protopteres peut cependant refleter l'interaction entre la surexploitation par la peche et un faible taux de predation de la perche du Nil qui repousse les protopteres vers les refuges marecageux. On suggere que ce phenomene a peut-etre ete renforce ces dernieres decennies par la transformation a grande echelle de terrains marecageux en terres agricoles et par le fait que les prelevements de protopteres males qui gardent les nids ont entraine une reduction du nombre de jeunes qui grandissent",African Journal of Ecology,,,,,,,

In 2000, the Government of Belize partnered with stakeholders to conserve the area and co-manage the fishery. The objective of this study was to present the history of the artisanal mutton snapper fishery in its environmental and socioeconomic context and qualitatively evaluate its present status. We identified long-term trends in the fishing activity through historical catch reconstructions and estimation of fishing fleet size since the late 1980s, statistically compared inter-annual trends in catch per unit effort (CPUE) and in mutton snapper sizes between 1999 and 2011, and delineated possible factors that might have caused the observed patterns. Our data show a sharp reduction in total landings and fishing effort that started in the late 1980s, parallel to a rapid growth in the tourism industry and to a shift in the livelihoods of many fishers. Annual CPUE, individual sizes, and sex ratios have been relatively stable between 1999 and 2011, indicating persistence of the fishery during this recent period. Key to successful long-term, adaptive co-management of the fishery is a continued involvement of fishers and other stakeholders in resource monitoring and evaluation, as well as in policy and decision making. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Fisheries Research,,,,,,,

Environmental constraints were relaxed on three reproductive traits: duration of breeding, where birds bred, and the number of young birds that bred. Clutch sizes and rate of clutch production were not affected. By the end of the breeding season population densities were exceptionally high, and age structures were dominated by young birds. The profound ecological effects of this climatic extreme in the terrestrial environment were remarkably short-lived, however. In the following two years the rains were weak (1984) or non-existent (1985), much of the vegetation died, and both seed supply and finch numbers declined drastically to the low levels recorded in 1978 and 1979.

For all years, we compared densities in different habitat types, as well as estimates for the entire region of total numbers of breeding Red Phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicaria), Pectoral Sandpipers, (Calidris melanotos), White-rumped Sandpipers (C. fuscicollis), Semipalmated Sandpipers (C. pusilla), Black-bellied Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), American Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica), Dunlin (C. alpina), Baird's Sandpipers (C. bairdii), and King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis). We found that breeding populations of Red Phalaropes, Black-bellied Plovers, American Golden-Plovers, and King Eiders in the 1990s had decreased substantially (76-87\%) from their numbers in the 1970s. Numbers of other shorebird species did not decrease significantly (17-48\%). Numbers of Black-bellied Plovers have apparently decreased at staging sites on the east coast of the United States and Canada. However, for American Golden-Plovers, there is no evidence of a decline on the east coast or in at least one other area in the eastern Nearctic. No other population information exists for Red Phalaropes breeding in the eastern Nearctic. Eider numbers appear to be decreasing throughout the Arctic. Possible reasons for declines are habitat changes in migratory staging sites and southern wintering areas. We need more consistent monitoring of arctic shorebirds in order to identify species with continual population declines. Further studies should emphasize Nearctic populations of species showing substantial declines in this study, examining consistency of decreases throughout the Nearctic, and reasons for such changes.",The Wilson Bulletin,,,,,,,

Counts at breeding localities suggest that the population has wide variation in production of fledged chicks, ranging from none in some years to over 100 in others. Only one major roost for non-breeding birds is known. Counts of birds at this roost decreased from the mid to late 1980s. Population estimates for the whole island also decreased from over 600 birds to about 250 in an eight-month period in 1987. It is postulated that this was the result of a single event that reduced the population but did not affect the subsequent reproductive effort, which was the highest recorded.

1303,"Grishchenko, V. N.",Number dynamics of the White Stork in Ukraine in 1994-2003,"White Stork is a convenient species for the analysis of patterns of population dynamics. Moreover, reasons of general and synchronous number increasing remain in many respects not clear. In Ukraine number dynamics of the species is influenced by two factors during many years: general changes in numbers and continuing expansion of the White Stork to the east. Therefore trends differed in east regions and in other parts of the country. In Ukraine in 1992 has started the program of monitoring of the White Stork population. Ornithologists and voluntary helpers take part in observations. Data are obtained on the net of constant study plots in different regions. They let control breeding success and number dynamics in the country. In total the information from 134 plots in 22 regions of Ukraine is obtained in 1992-2003. On 63 from them observations were carried out during 3 and more years, on 15 ones - during 10-12 years, on 1 - 17. Since 1994 the obtained data are sufficient for the analysis of number dynamics. Considered ten years cover the period between Vth (1994-1995) and VIth (2004-2005) International White Stork Censuses. For the analysis of population dynamics the average increment of numbers on study plots in \% were used. Since 1994 the increase of number permanently rose (Fig. 1). Maximum of increasing was registered in 1996 and 1998. In 1997 number of the White Stork has sharply decreased. This year was catastrophic for the species almost in whole Europe. It was caused by bad conditions during wintering and spring migration. Already the next year population was completely restored and number increasing continued. Since 1999 rate of growth began to decrease and last years population was stabilized. Comparison of dynamics of number increasing in three large regions of Ukraine (Fig. 2) shows that this process has firstly started in North-East Ukraine, the greatest increase of number was registered also here. In 1994-1998 numbers changed in all three regions synchronously. Later this synchronism was reduced and last years changes went discordantly. Ceasing of number increasing after 2000 was registered also in other countries, for example in Germany. Expansion of the White Stork has wave-like pattern. One of such waves in fact was traced during the period of observations. This wave has started in Ukraine with number increasing early in 1990s. Enlargement of the breeding range was observed in east regions of the country. At the same time the expansion livened up in Russia. General questions of expansion and number increasing of the White Stork are discussed. In Ukraine the number increased first of all and to a greatest extent in optimal habitats with low population density. Expansion of the White Stork in East Europe can be considered as filling of ""faunistic emptiness"" remaining in North Palearctic after the last glaciation. The expansion is vectorial. In East Europe it goes to the east, a lesser degree - to the north, but not to the south. This phenomenon can be connected with genetic determination of direction of young birds dispersal in population near the east border of the breeding range. Such ""directed"" population can be formed by the natural selection. Mechanism is similar to genetic control of partial migration well studied by P. Berthold and colleagues. If different directions of dispersal are equal for the population, existing various genetic programs of dispersal will remain in the same ratio. But if one of the directions give a preference in breeding success, the part of birds with this variant of the program will increase. ""Vector of expansion"" can be predetermined also by other factors. For example, dispersal goes on the way of ""minimum resistance"", on areas having favourable conditions for breeding but with low population density of storks or full absence of them. At last, combination of endogenous and exogenous control of dispersal is possible. Breeding success of the White Stork is higher in east part of the breeding range: in Ukraine (the Dnieper area and eastwards from this river) and in many regions of Russia. This fact explains a well known contradiction: storks continued advance to the east in spite of number decreasing of the species and depression of populations in many countries. The east part of breeding range are all-sufficient for the expansion: high breeding success and predominant direction of dispersal create the necessary prerequisites for further moving eastwards in spite of the situation in other parts of the breeding range. In Ukraine the negative correlation between population density and breeding success of the White Stork was not found. Probably ecological capacity of environment is far from the saturation and population density is not a limiting factor. It creates prerequisites for further number increasing. Only on one large area in Ukraine considerable number decreasing of storks was no ted: they almost stopped breeding in Chernobyl exclusion zone in 1990s. But it is connected not with population trends. This area became unsuitable for the White Stork because of evacuation of people and desolation of agricultural lands. Close correlation between changes of numbers and breeding success was found (Table 2). It means, that dynamics in both cases are caused by the same factors. First of all these are conditions in wintering area. Their influence on eastern population of the White Stork is discussed. It is supposed that reasons of its rise are also connected with African wintering grounds. May be global climate changes in Africa have caused the improvement of food supply for wintering storks. It promoted increasing the survival rate and breeding success and was an impuls for synchronous changes in numbers on the territory of whole breeding range of the European subspecies. Number of White Stork in Ukraine in 2003 is estimated at least in 25000-30000 breeding",Berkut,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate the severity of the population bottleneck that it experienced, we have developed a method for estimating the productivity of the nests that escaped detection. This method uses ringing records for MCMC estimation of parameters describing the recruitment of adults to the breeding population and the growth in productivity of undiscovered nests. 2. Comparison of the estimates for the two restored populations (eastern and western) showed a far lower proportion of undiscovered nests in the former, as predicted because of widespread use of nestboxes. This served to verify the method of estimation. The estimates show a steady increase in population size, in contrast with field estimates indicating a recent reduction in growth. 3. The results suggest that the alarmingly low estimates of population size in 1974 (two breeding pairs) were accurate, and that few undiscovered nests existed during the bottleneck. 4. The recovery of the population seems to have been initiated by the intensive conservation effort. The most rapid period of population growth coincides with the reintroduction programme. The results imply that the eastern population is much more reliant on intensive management for its future growth.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

As several species are strictly related to the flood pulse to fulfil their life cycle, the pulse may be seen as a dispersal mechanism of species onto a floodplain. In this study, we determine how dam construction influenced the persistence of Prochilodus lineatus population, a large migratory fish species from the upper Parana River floodplain. Data used were collected in two distinct periods, from April 1992 to March 1993 and from January 1999 to December 2001. Fish were collected using seining nets in six (monthly in the first period) and seven (quarterly in the second period) isolated lagoons. The fraction of occupied lagoons was high in the first period (higher than 0.65), when flood was intense. However, in the second period, when the flood pulse did not happen or was short, the fraction of occupied lagoons sharply decreased over time (from 0.85 to 0.22). For the first period, no model fitted to data, but for the second period, a negative linear model (named drought-dependent model) presented good fit (r(2) = 0.97). Therefore, it is possible to infer that long and intense flood pulses are important to maintain the persistence of P. lineatus populations in the floodplain. The artificial control of water levels prompted by dams disrupts this dynamic, reducing persistence to critical levels.",Ecology of Freshwater Fish,,,,,,,

During an intensive survey between 1993 and 1995, breeding success was similar to that reported from other sites, although the first egg (A-egg) loss rate was lower on Amsterdam Island than at other localities. The mean age of first return to the breeding site and of first reproduction were respectively (X) over bar = 4.2 SD of 2.1 years and (X) over bar = 4.7 SD of 1.7 years. The adult survival rate, calculated between 1988 and 1993, was significantly lower one year after banding (X) over bar = 72.2 SD of 1.6\% than in subsequent years (X) over bar = 84.0 SD of 1.1\% due to the effect of banding. Immature survival rate was estimated at 39\% during the first year after banding. Two birds banded as chicks have been found in Australia, suggesting that immatures winter off Souther Australia. The population on Amsterdam Island decreased at a rate of 2.7\% per year between 1971 and 1993. Using the demographic parameters measured, we calculated a modelled rate of increase of 0.943. Between 1982 to 1993, mean sea surface temperature near Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands decreased significantly, and this change was significantly related to the decline of Amsterdam Island population during the same period. Mean sea surface temperature decline could affect the Rockhopper Penguin population through changes of distribution and abundance of prey. Other factors such as the large increase of the Sub-Antarctic Fur Seal population at Amsterdam Island between 1971 and 1993 could have reduced the penguin population. Between 1971 and 1993, the Saint Paul population of penguins increased by 5.5\% per year, but this is not significantly related to the mea sea surface temperature decrease. This small Rockhopper Penguin population may still be recovering to its level before exploitation in the 1930s.",Colonial Waterbirds,,,,,,,

While impacts of invasive species garner much attention, interactions between endangered species must also be managed. The endangered Leon Springs pupfish, Cyprinodon bovinus, has suffered a population decline due to decreasing natural habitat. As breeding habitat is lost, C. bovinus is also adversely affected by the sympatric, endangered Pecos gambusia, Gambusia nobilis. Here, we document interactions between these species, finding significantly more G. nobilis accumulated at pupfish spawning events than randomly distributed on breeding grounds in the absence of spawning. As a known egg predator, our results suggest that G. nobilis presence at spawnings may further decrease pupfish numbers while also altering the evolutionary dynamics of C. bovinus breeding tactics. Habitat restoration may decrease Gambusia concentrations or influence C. bovinus breeding behaviour and increase the number of territorial males resulting in viable population sizes for both critically endangered fishes.",Biology letters,,,,,,,

Changes in the wintering habitat use of common crane (Grus grus) were related to changes in land use on this species' traditional migration route in the Western Palaearctics. The study was conducted in the Orellana area (Extremadura, SW Spain), the most important wintering area on this route, where the continued availability of natural food resources (acorns, bulbs, invertebrates) represents a more balanced diet than agricultural resources alone. The presence of crops such as corn (Zea mays L.) is, however, not a critical factor in the area, since the two types of resources, natural and agricultural, are available in the same period of time. The increase in area dedicated to irrigated crops, especially rice (Oriza sp.), affected the growth in the numbers of wintering cranes in the Orellana area. In the past the peak wintering period was in December and was positively correlated to acorn production, whereas the peak period is now in January-February, coinciding with the use of rice-field stubble as feeding places. Dehesas (Mediteranean scrub), cultivated or not, may replace rice-field stubble as feeding places. The existence of intensive farming activity in combination with traditional land-uses is suggested to be the cause of these changes.","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",,,,,,,

Robust statistical methods are needed to more fully assess the conservation value of such sites. We used the multi-strata model in Program MARK to estimate time-dependent transition probabilities between sequential staging sites to estimate lengths of stay for spring-staging Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) on the Fraser River delta and Parksville-Qualicum areas in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. Using resightings of marked individuals in combination with ground counts, we estimated the total number of brant, with associated uncertainties, staging at these sites during the spring migrations of 1999 and 2000. We estimated between 28,927 and 33,181 individual brant transited the Fraser River delta and Parksville-Qualicum sites in 1999 and between 21,621 and 25,405 individuals in 2000. These totals correspond to approximately 18–26\% of the entire Pacific Flyway brant population, suggesting the need for continued conservation and management efforts at these sites. Given the importance of staging sites to migratory populations, we believe this method could be applied to other species and locations.",Journal of Wildlife Management,,,,,,,

In this study, carried out in the Robinson Crusoe Island, we assessed density and habitat selection of terrestrial bird species, including juan fernandez firecrown and juan fernandez tit-tyrant, two endemics, as well as green-backed firecrown and austral thrush, which apparently originate from the mainland. Results show that perturbed habitats contained a low density of the endemic species whereas the mainland species were significantly more abundant in perturbed scrub habitats. Bird species show different habitat selection patterns, with endemics selecting for native forest and mainland species selecting for perturbed habitats, or using them at random. Bird species experienced temporal trends in their overall population sizes, with the endemic tit-tyrant suffering a significant decline in its population size of about 63\% between 1994 and 2009. Only mainland species exhibited temporal changes in habitat use, significantly reducing their densities in the preferred scrub habitats, possibly as a response to decreased habitat quality. Thrushes apparently were able to compensate the population decrease in one non native habitat type by using native forests, a habitat giving them the opportunity of preying on nests of endemic species. We conclude that endemic bird species behave as specialists whereas the mainland species must be treated as invasive generalists on Robinson Crusoe Island.",Biodiversity and Conservation,,,,,,,

However, for the third time in 10 years, an International Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) Breeding and Winter Census was conducted throughout the species range in 2001. Nearly 1,400 participants from 32 U.S. states and Puerto Rico; 9 Canadian provinces; St. Pierre and Miquelon, France; Cuba; and the Bahamas visited 2,244 sites covering 11,836 km of shore- line habitat. During the winter census, 2,389 piping plovers were observed at 33.5\% of potentially occupied sites (n = 352). Of these, 56.8\% had ≤10 birds present. The breeding census recorded 5,945 adults at 777 of 1,892 sites sur- veyed. More than 80\% of sites with piping plovers present had ≤10 birds. Results indicated an 8.4\% increase from 1991 but only a 0.2\% increase since 1996. Regional trends suggest that since 1991, number of breeding birds in- creased on the Atlantic Coast by 78\% (2,920 birds; 12.4\% increase since 1996) and by 80\% in the Great Lakes (72 birds; 50\% increase since 1996). However, plovers declined 15\% (2,953 birds; 10\% decline since 1996) in Prairie Canada/U.S. northern Great Plains. Subregional trends since 1991 reflect a 32.4\% decline in Prairie Canada (972 birds; 42.4\% decline since 1996), a 2.5\% decline in the U.S. northern Great Plains (1,981 birds; 24\% increase since 1996), 5.5\% decline in eastern Canada (481 birds; 14\% increase since 1996), although a 66.2\% increase on the U.S. Atlantic Coast (2,430 birds; 12\% since 1996).

1322,"Hailey, a",The effects of fire and mechanical habitat destruction on survival of the tortoise Testudo hermanni in northern Greece,"The impact of fire and mechanical habitat destruction on a population of the tortoise Testudo hermanni in northern Greece varied with vegetation type and season. A major fire in summer 1980 caused low ( 10 cm) in coastal heath, highest (about 50\%) mortality in grassland, and intermediate levers in dry heath. Mechanical habitat destruction caused about 50\% mortality in affected areas. Mortality of juveniles was greater than that of sexable animals. Overall, the 1980 catastrophe was more damaging than previously thought, causing a 64\% decrease in the total size of the Alyki main heath population. A localized summer fire in 1986 caused a similar level and pattern of mortality to that of 1980, but a spring fire in 1988 had little effect on the tortoise population. A fire and mechanical habitat destruction in winter 1989/90 caused only a 14\% decrease in population size; mortality was again concentrated in grassland areas, but affected juveniles and sexable animals equally. Variation of mortality with season suggests that any burning needed for habitat management at tortoise sites should occur in winter or early spring. Juveniles were undersampled by 3-4 times compared to sexable animals. their number increased greatly by 1990, reaching the same proportion as in the original population. There was, however, no recovery in the number of sexable tortoises in the decade after the 1980 catastrophe. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,

The survey was based on observations of hares made at night using a spotlight while driving 8 transects along roads. Data from the 2004 and 2005 surveys were analysed using improved methods of Distance Sampling, leading to improved estimates of hare densities and revisions to the 2004 survey findings.$\backslash$n2. The density of Irish hares was estimated to be 3.10 hares per km� in spring 2005 (and with 95\% confidence was between the limits 2.49-3.87). The estimated density in 2004 was revised to 5.11 hares per km� (95\% CL 4.23-6.16). Using these density estimates multiplied by land area, the Irish hare population in Northern Ireland was estimated to be 43,700 in 2005 (95\% CL 35,000-54,400) and was revised to 72,000 in 2004 (95\% CL 59,700-86,900).$\backslash$n3.

1327,"Halley, J. M. and Oldham, R. S. and Artzen, J. W.",Predicting the persistence of amphibian populations with the help of a spatial model,"We have used a stochastic population model with immigration to calculate extinction rates for two amphibian species: the common toad, Bufo bufo, and the crested newt, Triturus cristatus. Population models for amphibians are difficult to parameterize. It was not possible to measure all the relevant parameters for the model. The other parameters were obtained from other studies or estimated on the basis of similar species. Contour maps for persistence were generated using the model. The persistence of populations associated with a pond is affected both by the pond's internal dynamics and its proximity to a source pond. On a 20-generation time scale, toad ponds that were initially occupied were relatively unaffected by the proximity of a source. Persistence was almost certain ( > 95\%) when the average carrying capacity of a pond was greater than 30 adult females. Initially unoccupied toad-ponds were equally likely to persist if they lay within 4 km of a source and could support more than 50 adult females. Initially occupied newt ponds were likely to persist if they supported more than 40 females or lay within 0.5 km of a typical source pond. Initially unoccupied newt ponds were mainly dependent upon immigration rates. Very small ponds (Nk < 10) could persist if they lay within 0-75 km of a source pond, while large ponds (Nk >> 10) only needed to be within 1.5 km of a source pond. This model allows us to use the data available, to make predictions about the criteria which must be met by a landscape to ensure the survival of amphibian populations. It offers the possibility of better predictions when the data is refined. The model also suggests directions for further research such as the statistical study of environmental variation, the nature of minimum viable populations for toads and the statistics of long-range dispersal.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,
1328,"Halley, D.J. and Rosell, F","The beaver ’ s reconquest of Eurasia : status , population development and management of a conservation success","Overhunting reduced Eurasian Beaver (Castor fiber) populations to c. 1200 animals, in eight isolated populations, around the end of the 19th century. Protection, natural spread and rein- troductions led to a powerful recovery in both range and populations during the 20th century, which continues at a rapid pace. The minimum population estimate is 593 000. There are also c. 12 500 North American Beaver (C. canadensis) established in Finland and Russian Karelia; however, other populations of C. canadensis introduced in Austria, Poland and France ap- pear to be extinct. Castor fiber is now established throughout Europe with the exception of the British Isles, Iberia, Italy and the southern Balkans; reintroductions are continuing. Con- siderable further expansion in range and population, especially in western Europe and the lower Danube basin, can be expected. If current trends continue, C. fiber will, within a few decades, be a fairly common mammal in much of Europe. Following initial recolonization, populations typically show a pattern of rapid range extension within a watershed, followed only later by rapid population growth, and a barrier effect of watershed divides, which can be strongly isolating where physical or habitat barriers (such as mountains or intensive farm- land) intrude between watersheds. Management of beaver distribution should therefore operate at the watershed scale, except where large human-made dams form significant bar- riers to spread. The period of rapid population increase, if unchecked, leads to a phase of population decline as marginal habitats are occupied and exhausted. This coincides with a peak in conflicts with human land-use interests. A regulated hunting take of healthy beaver populations is recommended as the optimal management regime in managed landscapes. Early provision of interpretation and public viewing opportunities has been a feature of several recent reintroductions. This provides a benefit to the local economy through wildlife tourism, and helps foster positive attitudes to beavers.",Mammal Review,,,,,,,

The model explains four patterns in the dynamics of multispecies rodent assemblages in Fennoscandia: a predictable shift in the relative abundances of different prey species during one multiannual population cycle; long-term (supracyclic) variation in relative prey abundances; an association between the amplitude of population oscillations and the type of the numerically dominant prey species; and increasing rodent species number with increasing latitude, 3. The model results illustrate the complex and often unexpected behaviour of strongly connected multispecies assemblages, of which the Fennoscandian rodent-predator community is a prime example. 4. Since the mid 1980s, rodent oscillations in many, though not all, parts of northern Fennoscandia have become distinctly less regular (non-cyclic), a change which is reflected in the entire animal community linked to the keystone species. the arvicoline rodents, We demonstrate that such long-term changes in the amplitude and regularity of rodent oscillations are not unexpected in multispecies prey-predator assemblages.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

A con- servative estimate of the population size in 2003 was 19,400 animals, and available data suggest an annual rate of increase of 7.5\% since 1990. The growing population has led to increased in- teractions with the fishery, and demands are being raised for the re-introduction of the hunt. We provide a demographic analysis and a risk assessment of the population, and make recommen- dations on how to decrease the risk of overexploitation. Although hunting increases the risk of quasi-extinction, the risk can be significantly reduced by the choice of a cautious hunting regime. The least hazardous regimes allow no hunting below a ‘security level’ in population size. Obvi- ously, to implement such a hunting regime detailed knowledge of the population size and growth rate is required. It is not possible to estimate “true” risks for quasi-extinction, but we used an ap- proach where the relative difference for different scenarios can be compared. With a security level at 5,000 females, the population quasi-extinction risk increases 50 fold at an annual hunt of 500 females compared with a scenario with no hunting. The risk of quasi-extinction is very sensitive to declines in the mean growth rate and to increased variance in growth rate. The variance in the population estimates over the last 14 years imply that it would take 9 years to detect a decline from 1.075 to 1.027 in the rate of population increase. We also show how the age composition of killed animals influences the impact of the hunt. The overall recommendation is that hunting should be kept to a minimum, carefully documented and accompanied by close population monitoring.",NAMMCO Scientific Publications,,,,,,,

Along the North Sea coast populations started to decline substantially during the 11th century as a result of excessive hunting. The last breeding populations disappeared in the 16th century in the Wadden Sea, and before 1900 in the Kattegat-Skagerrak and the Southwestern Baltic as a result of an extermination campaign. No regular pupping occurred along mainland Europe until the end of the 1970s, when a breeding colony was established near Amrum in the German Wadden Sea. Somewhat later, additional breeding sites were discovered near Terschelling in the Dutch Wadden Sea (1980), at Helgoland, and off Brittany in France. Tracking of movements indicate these seal groups to be linked to the larger populations in the UK. Numbers of grey seals in the recolonised areas have increased over the years, but in the Kattegat-Skagerrak stable numbers of about 25 individuals have been observed since the 1970s, whereas more than 100 grey seals are found in the Southwestern Baltic. In the southeastern North Sea, 120 grey seals occur during moult at Helgoland, 120 in the German and over 1,130 in the Dutch parts of the Wadden Sea in 2004. Along the southern Dutch and Belgian coasts small groups are regularly observed, but no colonies have yet been established. In the colonies off Brittany in France about 105 grey seals have been counted. Successful pupping has only been recorded 3 times in the Kattegat-Skagerrak over the past 30 years, and 2-4 pups are born annually in France and the Southwestern Baltic. The relative strongholds for breeding along the European continent are the Dutch Wadden Sea, where in 2003/2004 at least 150 pups were recorded, Amrum in the German Wadden Sea (23 pups) and Helgoland (8 pups). Consequently, total numbers of counted grey seals from the Southwestern Baltic to France amounted to at least 1,600 in 2004, while about 190 pups were born in the area.",NAMMCO Scientific Publications,,,,,,,

The minimum numbers of wild boars belonging to the unmarked population (juveniles and/ or piglets) were added to the respective estimates to assess total population size. Over the 3 years, both estimators showed a stable population with a slight diminishing tendency. We used mean home range size determined by telemetry to assess the sampled areas and densities. Mean wild boar population densities calculated were 10.6 indi-viduals/km20.8 standard deviation (SD) and 10.0 ind/km2 0.6 SD with both estimators, respectively, and are among the highest reported from Western Europe. Because of the low proportion of marked animals and, to a lesser extent, of technical failures, our estimates showed poor precision, although they displayed similar population trends compared to the culling bag statistics. Reported densities were con- sistent with the ecological conditions of the study area.",European Journal of Wildlife Research,,,,,,,

At Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada, from 1992 to 1994, we conducted extensive surveys of habitats to document patterns of relative abundance and distribution of amphibians and to compare these patterns with those documented in studies conducted in 1972 and 1991. Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) have not been observed since spring 1990 and are now considered to be locally extinct in the park. Relative abundance of the green frog (R. clamitans) has increased 4 times since bullfrog extinction. Similarities in the natural history of bullfrogs and green frogs suggest that interactions should be greatest between this pair. The predaceous habits of bullfrogs are well-documented, and the experimental literature suggests that bullfrogs and green frogs are competitors. Changes in the pattern of ranid relative abundance that we observed suggest that the bullfrog is important in structuring amphibian communities.",American Midland Naturalist,,,,,,,

From the population estimates, growth rates, calf/cow ratios, known sources of mortality, continued threats from flooding and other threats such as domestic and feral livestock on the reserve that may transmit disease, the wild buffalo population in Kosi Tappu cannot be considered viable and the need for a translocation is imminent. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Habitat loss is considered to be the most likely cause of Henslows sparrow declines and the recent establishment of large acreages of undisturbed grasslands through the Conservation Reserve Program is considered to have the potential to benefit populations. I used data from Illinois' Spring Bird Count to estimate recent population trends and examine the association that changes in land-use, especially the establishment of Conservation Reserve Program lands, have had on local Henslow's sparrow population trends. My analysis shows that Henslow's sparrow populations have increased substantially within Illinois, USA over the last 10 years and that this population increase strongly coincides with the establishment of >400,000 ha of grasslands within the state by the Conservation Reserve Program. New rules allowing for managed haying and grazing on Conservation Reserve Program grasslands have the potential to reduce the suitability of program fields for this species and, thus, Henslow's sparrow use of program fields should be monitored as the new rules are implemented.",Journal of Wildlife Management,,,,,,,

The meeting was attended by slightly more than 300 participants representing 73 countries, a dramatic drop in participation from previous years brought about in no small part by the looming war in the middle east region and concerns over travel safety. For 22 years the Symposium had been an Americas-based event, even though it is the annual gathering of the international sea turtle society, and with the move to Malaysia, the Symposium hoped to raise the awareness among the general public of the plight of marine turtles in Southeast Asia, and share the enormous expertise of the world authorities on sea turtles with this so-far underrepresented region. Adopting the theme, Living With Turtles, the Symposium had a very personal flavour, and the smaller number of participants made it possible to make and renew acquaintances, and have time for discussion between sessions. While the travel safety concern excuse was often quoted, it was a pity, particularly to the large contingent of people who attended the event for the first time from underrepresented regions, that many of the household names linked to marine turtle biology and conservation were not present to share their knowledge and promote the global concerns on the plight of turtle populations.",Annual symposium on sea turtle biology and conservation,,,,,,,

However, shark control programs can provide suitable data from gear that consistently fishes nearshore waters all year round. We present an analysis of the distribution of 4757 . Galeocerdo cuvier caught in surface nets and on drumlines across 9 of the 10 locations of the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) between 1993 and 2010. Standardised catch rates showed a significant decline (p<. 0.0001) in southern Queensland locations for both gear types, which contrasts with studies at other locations where increases in tiger shark catch per unit effort (CPUE) have been reported. Significant temporal declines in the average size of tiger sharks occurred at four of the nine locations analysed (p<. 0.05), which may be indicative of fishing reducing abundance in these areas. Given the long term nature of shark control programs along the Australian east coast, effects on local abundance should have been evident many years ago, which suggests that factors other than the effects of shark control programs have also contributed to the decline. While reductions in catch rate are consistent with a decline in tiger shark abundance, this interpretation should be made with caution, as the inter-annual CPUE varies considerably at most locations. Nevertheless, the overall downward trend, particularly in southern Queensland, indicates that current fishing pressures on the species may be unsustainable. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Fisheries Research,,,,,,,

World-wide elasmobranch landings exceed 600 000 metric tons (mt) annually and have clearly made a significant impact on portions of that resource. In the eastern north Pacific catches of common thresher, shortfin mako and blue sharks may exceed 15 000 mt annually. Nearly 90\% of all sharks taken within this area are immature. Like most sharks, these pelagics have low rates of increase which make them quite vulnerable to modem day fishing pressure. Clearly the removal of large segments of juveniles from any population has the potential to decrease the adult population to unsustainable levels. The ability of populations to recover from over-exploitation depends not only on initial stock size, natural mortality, and migration rates, but also upon reducing total fishing mortality. Regulations enacted by special interest groups benefiting only one segment of the resource users, combined with the lack of biological information, have slowed progress towards achieving rational management.

Zoological Studies 46(6): 705-716. We compared geographical distributions of Pacific saury, Cololabis saira (Brevoort) (Scomberesocidae), fishing stocks in the Northwest Pacific (NWP) for 3 yearly groups of high, average, and low abundances, using the Taiwanese fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from 1994 to 2002. Two migratory groups, inshore and offshore, were found in averageand low-abundance years, while an additional oceanic migratory group, which spread eastward to around 178E in Oct., was found in the year of high abundance. Most of the saury groups were distributed in areas where the sea surface temperature (SST) ranged between 10 and 20C with a high aggregation around 15C, implying that 15C is the preferred temperature for saury to aggregate intensively for the commencement of the spawning migration, and to move southward to spawning grounds where SSTs of around 20C are favorable to their offspring. The timing, abundance, and geographical distributions of fish aggregations of migratory saury were associated with SSTs. In the early stages of the fishing season, apparent warming caused by the intrusion of Kuroshio Current waters in the southern NWP was closely related to delayed aggregation and low abundances of the saury stock; in contrast, cooling of the waters affected by Oyashio waters was related to eastward aggregation and high abundances of saury. High saury abundances occurred in low-temperature areas. Specifically, in years of low CPUE values, sea water temperatures (SWTs) of the fishing grounds were higher than 15C, while in years of average and high CPUE values, the SWTs of the fishing grounds were < 15C. Therefore, fishing ground SWTs higher than 15C (around 16C SST) is an indicator of low stock abundances of saury in the NWP.",Zoological Studies,,,,,,,
1392,"Hubbard, David M. and Dugan, Jenifer E.",Shorebird use of an exposed sandy beach in southern California,"Frequent morning surveys of birds were conducted on 1 km of beach in southern California to investigate shorebird use of an exposed sandy beach. The overall mean abundance (98.6individuals km-1), estimated biomass (9.6kgkm-1), and species richness (5.5 species km-1) of shorebirds observed were very high for a sandy beach in the temperate zone. Eight species, sanderling (Calidris alba), semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus), marbled godwit (Limosa fedoa), black-bellied plover (Pluvialis squatarola), western sandpiper (Calidris mauri), willet (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), surfbird (Aphriza virgata), and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), occurred in overall mean abundances >1 bird km-1 and accounted for 97\% of the abundance and biomass of shorebirds. Sanderlings were the most abundant shorebird every year (64\% of individuals and 35\% of the biomass). Different species of abundant shorebirds exhibited distinct patterns of use of beach habitat, including fall, spring, and winter peaks in abundance. Temporal variation in shorebird use on seasonal and interannual scales was associated with migration patterns, and also with habitat availability and condition. Seasonal variation in monthly mean abundance and estimated biomass of shorebirds varied over more than an order of magnitude and followed a similar pattern in each year, reaching maxima in the fall or winter (161-280 individuals km-1 and 15.4-23.9 kg km-1) and minima in May or June (3-11 individuals km-1 and 0.8-2.2 kg km-1). A minor peak in shorebird abundance and biomass coinciding with spring migration was observed in April of most years. The number of species of shorebirds observed in individual surveys ranged from 0 to 11 species km-1 and was positively and significantly correlated with abundance. Monthly mean species richness and the total species observed monthly followed similar seasonal patterns, ranging from annual maxima of 7.4-9.1 and 12-17 species km-1 between August and October to minima of 0.8-2.1 and 2-8 species km-1, respectively, during June, In contrast, species turnover was lowest (1.1-1.7) in October and November, and generally highest (2-4) during early summer (June). The amount of sandy intertidal habitat available to shorebirds on the transect was estimated using sand elevations and predicted tide heights. In the fall and winter, the abundance of shorebirds was significantly and positively correlated with tide height, possibly reflecting feeding opportunities and high tide refuge effects during the highest tides. In the spring when sand levels were low, the abundance of shorebirds was negatively correlated with tide height. Prey availability, beach condition and the local availability, and condition of alternative foraging habitats may influence those relationships. Interannual variations in shorebird use and beach condition were observed in the course of the study. During an El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event (1997-1998), the extent of sandy habitat was greatly reduced and intertidal habitat was mostly converted to rocky substrate. The overall abundance of shorebirds and the mean abundance of some common species (e.g. sanderling) were depressed, and an uncommon species (surfbird, A. virgata) was unusually abundant during the ENSO event. In summary, the results suggest that sandy beaches are important habitat for many species of shorebirds, particularly in areas where alternative coastal foraging habitats, such as coastal wetlands, have become scarce. Understanding the dynamics of and threats to exposed sandy beaches may be increasingly important for shorebird conservation in many coastal regions. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of nests fluctuated from a maximum of 186 in 1995 to a minimum of 58 in 2004. Successively smaller peaks at 3-year intervals were followed by successively smaller troughs. Two analyses-one representing a dampened oscillation, the other retaining the period and the amplitudes of the nesting cycles-predict that nest number will drop to about 40-50 by 2015, i.e. to about 22-27\% of its highest value. This drop at Fethiye does not correspond with a visible increase at neighboring beaches, leading to the interpretation that the number of nesting turtles here is declining. Moreover, the carapace size of emerging adult females is apparently decreasing, as are clutch sizes. Such a potential negative trend at a key Turkish nesting beach is cause for concern, an incentive for continued study, and a call for more coordinated and effective conservation programs in this region of the Mediterranean.",Biodiversity and Conservation,,,,,,,

Keenleyside Dam and the U.S.–Canada border has been identified as endangered, with nearly 30 consecutive years of consistent recruitment failure. The objectives of this study were to determine the status and population attributes of this subpopulation. We estimated survival rates and abundance using catch-curve analysis and mark–recapture models. An annual survival rate of 89\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 88–90\%) was estimated for the subpopulation using catch-curve analysis for the time period 1993–2004. The survival rates estimated from the mark–recapture data were obtained using model averaged parameter estimates from a multistrata Cormack–Jolly–Seber model. The annual survival rate from the mark–recapture model was estimated at 97\% (95\% CI, 92–99\%) from 1993 to 2004. The mark–recapture methods estimated abundance for 2004 to be 1,157 individuals (95\% CI, 414–1,900). The mark–recapture data suggest that the white sturgeon have low migration rates, ranging from 3\% to 5\% among sections of the river. Despite high estimated survival, high uncertainty as to the future viability of the white sturgeon subpopulation in this portion of the river remains, as natural recruitment is poor. The fish continue to age, and size and age-frequency data suggest that recruitment failure continues in this subpopulation with minimal presence of wild juvenile or subadult white sturgeon detected.",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,,,,,,,

The Action Plan also provides chapters on equid taxonomy, genetics, reproductive biology, and population dynamics. These chapters highlight unsolved issues of taxonomy and genetics. They also provide information and insight into the special demographic and genetic challenges of managing small populations. The chapter on disease provides a review of documented equine disease and epidemiology and focuses on priorities for equid conservation health. The final chapter deals with the importance of developing an assessment methodology that explicitly considers the role of equids in ecosystems and the ecological processes that are necessary for ecosystem viability. The approach of combining ecological field studies and ecosystem modeling should prove useful for the scientific management and conservation of wild equids worldwide. These chapters provide research and conservation practitioners with new information and paradigms.","Equids: Zebras, Asses, and Horses. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan",,,,,,,

1456,"James, Nicola C. and Whitfield, Alan K. and Cowley, Paul D.",Long-term stability of the fish assemblages in a warm-temperate South African estuary,"Little is known about long-term changes in estuarine fish populations and related environmental variations. Fishes in the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary were sampled bi-annually, in summer and winter, using seine and gill nets between December 1994 and July 2005. A total of 18 families, represented by 33 species, were recorded. The 10 most abundant species caught were consistently recorded in catches each year, but CPUE of individual species varied on an annual basis and this can often be related to mouth state. Multivariate analyses of the annual marine fish community identified two distinct groups, with more species recorded during years that succeeded spring (September to November) mouth-opening events than in years following no mouth-opening events in spring. Interannual community stability (IMD) and seriation (IMS) also increased from the years following no opening events in spring to the years that succeeded spring opening events. These results highlight the importance of the timing of mouth opening to the marine fish community in a temporarily open/closed estuary.

At Tugidak Island, the seal population declined substantially during molting from 1976 through the 1980s, stabilized in the early 1990s, and increased at a moderate rate (3.4\%/yr, CI: 1.0\%–5.8\%) from 1994 to 2000. Pups and all seals ashore during pupping increased at higher annual rates of 5.4\% (CI: 2.2\%–8.8\%) and 8.3\% (CI: 4.5\%–12.3\%) from 1994 to 2000 at Tugidak Island. At Nanvak Bay seals declined in abundance between 1975 and 1990 but increased during the 1990s at 9.2\%/yr (CI: 7.2\%–11.3\%) during pupping and 2.1\%/yr (CI: 0.6\%–3.6\%) during molting. Date and time-of-day were significant covariates in all analyses. Factors that led to declines at Tugidak Island and Nanvak Bay have seemingly abated sufficiently such that these populations are currently increasing, though still greatly reduced from the 1970s.

1461,"Jenouvrier, St\'{e}phanie and Caswell, Hal and Barbraud, Christophe and Weimerskirch, Henri","Mating behavior, population growth, and the operational sex ratio: a periodic two-sex model approach.","We present a new approach to modeling two-sex populations, using periodic, nonlinear two-sex matrix models. The models project the population growth rate, the population structure, and any ratio of interest (e.g., operational sex ratio). The periodic formulation permits inclusion of highly seasonal behavioral events. A periodic product of the seasonal matrices describes annual population dynamics. The model is nonlinear because mating probability depends on the structure of the population. To study how the vital rates influence population growth rate, population structure, and operational sex ratio, we used sensitivity analysis of frequency-dependent nonlinear models. In nonlinear two-sex models the vital rates affect growth rate directly and also indirectly through effects on the population structure. The indirect effects can sometimes overwhelm the direct effects and are revealed only by nonlinear analysis. We find that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to female survival is negative for the emperor penguin, a species with highly seasonal breeding behavior. This result could not occur in linear models because changes in population structure have no effect on per capita reproduction. Our approach is applicable to ecological and evolutionary studies of any species in which males and females interact in a seasonal environment.",The American naturalist,,,,,,,
1462,"Johnson, a. R.",Long-Term Studies and Conservation of Greater Flamingos in the Camargue and Mediterranean,"The Camargue delta of the Rh\^{o}ne River (southern France) is the only place in France where the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber roseus breeds, and it is the most important breeding site in the western Mediterranean. The numbers of breeding pairs and chicks raised have been monitored for 50 years (1947-1996). Following intensive management of this colony, the number of birds breeding in the Camargue increased from 4,000-5,000 pairs in the 1950s to an average of 13,500 in 1986-1996. Since the size of the colony is limited by the size of its island, this led to the expansion of the number of breeding sites in the western Mediterranean as a whole. Banding studies begun in the 1940s have shown that flamingos of Camargue origin exploit wetlands throughout much of the Mediterranean region and west Africa. Some individuals are sedentary, while others are migratory or opportunistic. Studies of the flamingo indicate that 1) single colonies such as the Camargue can be managed successfully enough to serve as a source population that can fuel expansion into an entire region, 2) movements and reproductive success of birds in the Camargue colony extend to the entire western Mediterranean region, 3) feeding areas of individual colonies may be up to 180 km from colonies, and 4) long term studies (50 yr) have revealed that mortality is extremely episodic and unpredictable; only long-term studies therefore seem capable of accurate estimation of demographics for this long-lived species.",Colonial Waterbirds,,,,,,,

We investigated the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007, including 10 yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10 yr, all vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997; thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995 (13.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.6 +/- 6.4 individuals/km2, respectively). Lemur populations may have remained stable or declined initially and then recovered in the last 10 yr. Life history and ecological adaptations may explain their resistance or resilience when faced with habitat change. Recent models suggest that lemurs have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental conditions. Such environmental variability may increase with projected climate change.",Biotropica,,,,,,,

Aims To assess the factors affecting Great Skua productivity, and the effects of Great Skuas on breeding Arctic Skuas. Methods From 2003 to 2006 population and breeding performance of Great Skuas and Arctic Skuas on Handa Island were intensively monitored, using all-island surveys and regular visits to focal territories from laying through to the post-fledging period. All study chicks were ringed for long-term study. Interspecific interactions were observed and 5116 regurgitated pellets of breeding and non-breeding Great Skuas were collected systematically for dietary analysis. Results Over the study period, numbers of breeding Great Skuas remained steady but there was an overall decline in productivity, with chick loss the most significant proximate factor. However the four-year average of 0.49 chicks fledged per pair was relatively high, with Handa being the most productive monitored colony in Britain in 2004. Great Skuas on Honda have a diverse diet of at least 30 species, including discarded fish and other seabirds. Among the Arctic Skuas, mean productivity was high but so was predation pressure on fledglings from Great Skuas, and population size has halved in four years. Conclusions Honda is a productive Great Skua colony in the context of recent breeding failures in the Northern Isles. A substantial part of their diet is other seabirds and their impact on globally important populations requires further monitoring and analysis.",Bird Study,,,,,,,

1471,"Jung, Sukgeun and Houde, Edward D.",Recruitment and spawning-stock biomass distribution of bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) in Chesapeake Bay,"Recruitment of bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) in Chesapeake is related to variability in hydrological conditions and to abundance and spatial distribution of spawning stock biomass (SSB). Midwater-trawl surveys conducted for six years, over the entire 320-km length of the bay, provided information on anchovy SSB, annual spatial patterns of recruitment, and their relationships to variability in the estuarine environment. SSB of anchovy varied sixfold in 1995-2000; it alone explained little variability in young-of-the-year (YOY) recruitment level in October, which varied ninefold. Recruitments were low in 1995 and 1996 (47 and 31 x 10(9)) but higher in 1997-2000 (100 to 265 x 10(9)). During the recruitment process the YOY population migrated upbay before a subsequent fall-winter downbay migration. The extent of the downbay migration by maturing recruits was greatest in years of high freshwater input to the bay. Mean dissolved oxygen (DO) was more important than freshwater inpu t in controlling distribution of SSB and shifts in SSB location between April-May (prespawning) and June-August (spawning) periods. Recruitments of bay anchovy were higher when mean DO was lowest in the downbay region during the spawning season. It is hypothesized that anchovy recruitment level is inversely related to mean DO concentration because low DO is associated with high plankton productivity in Chesapeake Bay. Additionally, low DO conditions may confine most bay anchovy spawners to the downbay region, where production of larvae and juveniles is enhanced. A modified Ricker stock-recruitment model indicated density-compensatory recruitment with respect to SSB and demonstrated the importance of spring-summer DO levels and spatial distribution of SSB as controllers of bay anchovy recruitment.",Fishery Bulletin,,,,,,,
1472,"Kacoliris, Federico P. and Berkunsky, Igor and Williams, Jorge D.",Methods for Assessing Population Size in Sand Dune Lizards (Liolaemus Multimaculatus),"Basic information, such as population size and density, is needed for conservation and management of many species, especially threatened species. Thus, well-designed population monitoring programs that use appropriate methods for estimating parameters of interest, including density and survival, are needed as well. Mark-recapture and distance-sampling are established methods for estimating density in wildlife surveys. The sand dune lizard (Liolaemus multimaculatus) is an endemic and vulnerable species that inhabits dune habitats in Argentina. At present, however, there are no accurate estimates of density of this species and no established monitoring programs. The objectives of this study were (1) to test the use of mark- recapture and distance-sampling methods and (2) to estimate density of this species in Mar Chiquita Reserve (37u 379 S–57u 169 W), an important area for the protection of this species. For distance-sampling surveys, we used a systematic line-transect design; for mark-recapture sampling, we performed exhaustive surveys and captured, marked, and recaptured lizards manually. Based on distance-sampling, populations were estimated at 3.6 and 5.4 individuals per ha in 2007 and 2008, respectively; corresponding estimates based on mark- recapture data were 5.2 and 4.1 individuals per ha in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Detection probabilities were 0.23 in both 2007 and 2008 distance-sampling analyses and capture probabilities were 0.02 and 0.05 in 2007 and 2008 mark-recapture analyses. Based on these estimates, the Mar Chiquita Reserve contains a population of at least 10,000 individuals. Both methods were adequate for estimating populations of sand dune lizards, given the facility with which individuals can be detected and captured. The distance-sampling method requires less effort, but the mark-recapture method allows estimates of survival as well as density. Results of this work provide the baseline for developing a monitoring program for this lizard, and we suggest that the distance-sampling method be used to monitor all populations of sand dune lizard",Herpetologica,,,,,,,

Surveys of B. canorus numbers in breeding aggregations were made yearly from 1971 to 1982, and less systematic observations were made from 1983 to 1991. Six other populations in the eastern Sierra Nevada were surveyed occasionally from 1973 to 1990. The total number of marked males entering the largest breeding pools at Tioga Pass declined nine-fold from 1974 to 1982. The mean number of toads found in daily searches during breeding also dropped over the 20 year study. Similar declines occurred at smaller breeding sites throughout Tioga Pass Meadow and at the six other populations. In 1990 we found evidence for continued reproduction by B. canorus at all but one location (Sylvester Meadow), although reproduction was minimal at Tioga Pass. No single source of mortality was responsible for all the declines. We interpret the decline in our study populations as caused primarily by drought, disease, and predation. Spring snow depths in 1976, 1977 and 1987-1991 were below the 62 year average, resulting in low tadpole survival. The death of adults from disease at Tioga Pass, and from predation at another site (Mildred Lake) also contributed to the declines. Although habitat destruction and localized human activities were not major factors, some natural variables responsible for the declines may have had anthropogenic components.

Zoological Studies 39(1): 67-76. We studied a population of Rana swinhoana using mark-recapture methods from August 1996 to July 1998 at the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site at Guandau Stream, Taiwan. We established a 330-m transect at the headwaters of a tributary of Guandau Stream and censused R. swinhoana for 2 consecutive nights monthly. We used mark- recapture techniques to sample frogs along transects, with each individual being uniquely marked. For every animal captured, we recorded clip, sex, snout-vent length, body mass of frogs, and location along the transect. We observed 1947 but captured 1608 frogs during the 24-mo study period, including 1414 adult males and 172 adult females. Frogs were more abundant in the summer than in the winter. Monthly recapture rates varied between 30\% and 81\%. R. swinhoana moved little during the study and showed no seasonal up- or down-stream movements. The clumped distribution of frogs along the stream is probably a result of the heterogeneity of microhabitats. R. swinhoana sometimes made extended excursions, but returned to their usual activity ranges.

We used data from annual volunteer-participatory waterfowl count surveys which were conducted in Japan by the Ministry of the Environment and local prefectural governments. Population indices and long-term trends of each species were calculated using TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data). TRIM is a freeware program developed for analysis of time series count data with missing observations. During the 14 years, seven species exhibited significant long-term declines, while four species showed long-term increases. Most of the species that showed long term declines were characterized as being water-surface foraging species, species breeding in both middle and high latitude regions, or species using rice fields. Most species that showed long-term increases were characterized as diving species, species breeding at high latitude or species rarely using rice fields. We calculated composite indices for these groups. The group of water-surface foraging species showed declines in river, natural lakes and artificial lakes, except reservoirs, when each habitat was analyzed separately. In contrast, the group of diving foraging species showed an increase in estuarine habitat. We suggest that changes in: water quality, breeding habitat in the middle latitude region, and in cultivation methods in rice fields, have affected population changes of some species and groups.",Ornithological Science,,,,,,,

Frequent sea ice break-ups in Lutzow-Holm Bay in the mid 1980s and since the late 1990s are thought to have induced the population increase through increased subadult survival and preferred prey availability.

The average breeding density increased in the study period from 0.84 to 1.36 calling males per km'. Using the data from the Snepele route (western Latvia), where counts have been done since the 1960s, and the decrease in proportion of meadows in Latvia, as well as the estimate of Corncrake numbers in Latvia in 1996, I calculated Corncrake numbers in Latvia in the past. The estimate from this model is consistent with previous estimates, e.g. for 1995, 20 118 v 22 735 and for 1989-1994, 3726-10 432 v 3 000-10 000. The results suggest that previous warnings that 3 000-10 000 was an underestimate, are incorrect. I now assume that the Corncrake population reached its minimum during the late 1980s and early 1990s and is currently increasing, but is still lower than it was at the beginning of the 20th century. Statistically significant negative correlation (r=-0.48; P=0.045) was found between total pesticide use in Latvia in year t and Corncrake numbers in the Snepele route in the following year (t+1). Lower pesticide use indicates reduced income from crop production and thus a lower-intensity (ie nature-friendly) agriculture. Abandonment and low-intensity use of agricultural lands in the1990s are the main reasons for the increase of Corncrake population, but favourable habitat will be lost in the near future by afforestation and intensification of agriculture. My final conclusion is that the Corncrake population is increasing not because of conservation actions (there are none) or legal protection, but because of the crisis in agriculture after the end of the soviet occupation of Latvia. Thus the increase in Corncrake numbers may not persist.",Ornis Hungarica,,,,,,,

Passive acoustic surveys were performed regularly from May 2007 to August 2010, near the conjunction of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. The distribution of the porpoises was seasonally site-specific. In May and August, the animals were detected more often at river junctions than in the lake, but vice versa from November to February. The rate of the porpoise detection was significantly higher in areas of fish presence than in areas of absence. The number of porpoises detected did not differ significantly between the sand dredging operation and the prohibition period (in 2008), although the number of vessels obviously declined in 2008.

In the late 1970s concerns for their future, and for the effect of contaminants, habitat modification, and marine traffic, became acute, and they were declared “Endangered” in 1983.The numerical progress of the population has been monitored since 1973 by continued sample surveys. Nine of 10 surveys were aerial, and of those 9, 7 used high-altitude aerial photography. Published indices of population size showed an average increase of about 17 belugas per year (SE = 4) and a 1995 smoothed value of about 650 (SE = 40) belugas. This apparent temporal trend might be open to question owing to slight variation in survey methods and in the area covered by different surveys, so factors were developed to correct for differences in survey coverage and in treatment of data and for the effect of hunting on population trajectory. Revised assessments of the population trajectory and of the present smoothed index value changed little as a result. A series of total-count surveys in 1987-1992 estimated a decline of about 6 belugas per year, and when they were combined with sample surveys flown in 1984-1995, an increase of 10 belugas per year was estimated and a 1995 standardized index of about 640 (SE = 43).

A major component of biodiversity are forest floor small mammal communities whose abundance and diversity serve as ecological indicators of significant change in forest structure and function from harvesting activities. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that abundance, reproduction, and survival of (i) the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi, formerly Clethrionomys gapperi), will decline; (ii) the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), will be similar; and (iii) the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and northwestern chipmunk (Tamias amoenus), will increase, with decreasing levels of tree retention. Small mammal populations were live-trapped from 1994 to 1997 in replicated sites of uncut forest, 20\% and 50\% volume removal by single tree selection, 20\%, 35\%, and 50\% patch cuts based on openings of 0.1-1.6 ha, and small 1.6 ha clearcuts in Douglas-fir forest near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. M. gapperi dominated the small mammal community, starting with an abundance of 74-98 animals/ha with mean values ranging from 33 to 51 animals/ha. In the two post-harvest years, abundance, reproduction, and survival of M. gapperi populations were consistently similar among uncut forest and the various levels of tree retention. Thereafter, M. gapperi was seldom found on the small clearcuts. M. pennsylvanicus, T. amoenus, and P. maniculatus occurred predominantly in clearcut sites. As with other types of forest disturbance, responses to our treatments were species-specific. The most striking result was the high abundance and productivity of M. gapperi populations in a dry forest ecosystem, a novel result for this bio-indicator species of closed-canopy forest conditions. At least with respect to small mammals, the retention systems studied seem to enable timber extraction and maintenance of mature forest habitat in these dry fir ecosystems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We examined relative abundance and distribution of sand seatrout [individuals > 100 mm standard length (SL)] in relation to environmental conditions and river discharge in the Tampa Bay (1997-2004) and Charlotte Harbor (1999-2004) estuaries on the west coast of Florida. Fish were collected during a long-term fisheries-independent monitoring program with a 183-m purse seine. Sand seatrout were more abundant over deep, muddy substrates devoid of seagrass. Smaller sand seatrout between 145 mm SL and 175 mm SL were found in low-alinity ares near river mouths and larger sand seatrout > 175 mm SL were found in high-salinity areas in the lower portion of the estuaries. We found a negative relationship between relative abundance and mean river discharge in both estuaries and a positive relationship between abundance and 2-yr lagged river discharge in Tampa Bay. Annual relative abundance of sand seatrout captured via purse seine in Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor was significantly correlated to annual changes in recreational and commercial harvest on the west coast of Florida. Differences and changes in environmental conditions, habitat, and river discharges clearly affected the relative abundance and distribution of sand seatrout, making habitat alterations and water-allocation decisions important to sand seatrout and the fishery they support.,Gulf of Mexico Science

We studied size distribution, condition index (CI), growth rates, and mortality of black turtles in Estero Banderitas, the largest mangrove channel in Bah\'{\i}a Magdalena, to supply information for the development of effective conservation strategies. A total of 213 black turtles (including 88 recaptures) were caught in entanglement nets between July 2000 and July 2003. Average yearly catch per unit of effort (CPUE, 1 unit: 100 m of net fishing for 12 h) dropped during the study from 2.19 to 0.76. About 97\% of all turtles were considered juveniles, average size was 54.6 ± 9.5 cm. Turtles were significantly smaller at the head of Estero Banderitas than in the central part of the Estero and in the open bay, indicating size-based habitat segregation. Average growth rate was 1.62 cm/year and declined with increasing size. Growth was seasonal and three times higher in summer (0.28 cm/month) than in winter (0.09 cm/month), body CI was also significantly higher during the summer months. A seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) was used to model growth for the size range studied (43-73 cm SCL), with the parameters: L ∞ = 101 cm SCL; K = 0.04 year-1; t 0 = 0; C = 0.4 and t s = 0.75. Growth data indicate that black turtles may spend up to 20 years in Bah\'{\i}a Magdalena before they reach maturity at about 77 cm SCL.

Catch rate varied with year, season and the diel period during which sampling was conducted as well as by the interaction between year and season. Indices of abundance of age-0 and age-1 yellow perch estimated from night samples typically produced better fitting models and lower estimates of age-2 abundance than those using morning or afternoon samples, whereas indices using afternoon samples typically produced less precise and higher estimates of abundance. The diel period during which sampling is conducted will not affect observed population trends but may affect estimates of abundance of age-0 and age-1 yellow perch, which in turn affect recommended allowable harvest. A field experiment throughout western Lake Erie is recommended to examine potential benefits of night sampling to management of yellow perch.",Fisheries Management and Ecology,,,,,,,

During the last centuries, the breeding range of the great snipe Gallinago media has declined dramatically in the western part of its distribution. To examine present population dynamics in the Scandinavian mountains, we collected and analysed a 19-year time series of counts of great snipe males at leks in central Norway, 1987-2005. 2. The population showed large annual fluctuations in the number of males displaying at lek sites (range 45-90 males at the peak of the mating season), but no overall trend. 3. We detected presence of direct density-dependent mechanisms regulating this population. Inclusion of the density-dependent term in a Ricker-type model significantly improved the fit with observed data (evaluated with Parametric Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio tests and Akaike's Information Criterion for small sample size). 4. An analysis of (a number of a priori likely) environmental covariates suggests that the population dynamics were affected by conditions influencing reproduction and survival of offspring during the summer, but not by conditions influencing survival at the wintering grounds in Africa. This is in contrast to many altricial birds breeding in the northern hemisphere, and supports the idea that population dynamics of migratory nidifugous birds are more influenced by conditions during reproduction. 5. Inclusion of these external factors into our model improved the detectability of density dependence. This illustrates that allowing for external effects may increase statistical power of density dependence tests and thus be of particular importance in relatively short time series. 6. In our best model of the population dynamics, two likely density-independent offspring survival covariates explained 47.3\% of the variance in great snipe numbers (predation pressure estimated by willow grouse reproductive success and food availability estimated by the amount of precipitation in June), whereas density dependence explained 35.5\%. Demographic stochasticity and unidentified environmental stochasticity may account for the remaining 17.2\%.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Following long-term management of Cousin, the population steadily recovered to around 300-360 birds. Given the vulnerability of one small island in the Indian Ocean, the possibility of establishing the species on additional islands had been proposed as a priority conservation measure, in order to give the species the security of additional breeding populations, lest some ecological disaster should befall the parent population. Successful translocation of warblers to the islands of Aride and Cousine took place in September 1988 and June 1990 respectively.

After a successful cat eradication program in 1981-1982, recruitment improved, although the abandonment of agriculture had caused a reduction in the amount of feeding habitat and hence in the carrying capacity of the island. The population declined because of the failure of recruitment to compensate for the annual adult mortality. Foraging activity of the Magpie Robin was greater in high- quality territories (measured by soil invertebrates available), leading to increased reproductive success. Through supplementary feeding, five times as many recruits were produced. Of the 11.5 potential annual breeding recruits. 5.3 are required to compensate for adult mortality, and the other 6.2 recruits can be regarded as 'surplus' contributing to an increase. Magpie Robins prefer to breed in rotten trees, which are a scarce resource. The greater the distance between the nest site and feeding areas, the less time was spent in incubation and nest guarding, resulting in greater egg loss. Because of lack of suitable areas for establishing territories, many young Magpie Robins became 'floaters'. Nest disturbance, both by these floaters and by the introduced Indian Mynah Acridotheres tristis, had adverse effects on the breeding success of robins. A recovery plan has been designed to save the Magpie Robin. Territories have been improved for feeding (by tree planting) and for breeding (by providing nestboxes and reducing nest disturbances). Given the vulnerability of one small island, the presence of surplus birds (supported mainly by supplementary food) and the suitability of neighbouring Aride Island (68 ha), successful translocations to this island took place in 1992 and 1994.

Density indices of mustelids were derived from snow-tracking, diet composition from scat samples, and vole abundances from snap-trapping. Pr?dation rate was estimated by the ratio of voles to mustelids and by the vole kill rate by predators (density of predator ? percentage of voles in the diet). We tested the following four predictions of the hypothesis that small mustelids cause the low phase of the microtine cycle. (1) The densities of predators should lag well be- hind the prey abundances, as time lags tend to have destabilizing effects. The densities of stoats fluctuated in accordance with the vole abundances, whereas the spring densities of least weasels tracked the vole abundances with a half-year lag and the autumn densities with a 1-year lag. (2) Predators should not shift to alternative prey with declining vole densities. The yearly proportion of Microtus voles (the staple prey) in the diet of stoats varied widely (range 16?82\%) and was positively cor- related with the winter abundance of these voles. In contrast, the same proportion in the food of least weasels was independent of the vole abundance. (3) The ratio of voles to small mustelids should be smallest in poor vole years and largest in good ones. This was also observed. (4) Vole densities from autumn to spring should decrease more in those winters when vole kill rates are high than when they are low. The data on least weasels agreed with this prediction. Our results from least weasels were con- sistent with the predictions of the hypothesis, but stoats behaved like ""semi-generalist"" predators. Accordingly, declines and lows in the microtine cycle may be due to least weasel pr?dation, but other extrinsic factors may also contribute to crashes.",Oecologia,,,,,,,

Diets of pairs that bred as neighbours (1 km) with interspecifics were compared with those of non-neighbours. In both species, neighbouring pairs fed less on Microtus voles and more on alternative prey than did non-neighbours. Competition theory predicts that diet overlap should be lower during prey shortage and that diet similarity should be especially reduced in neighbouring pairs. Observations were consistent with expectations: diet similarity was lower in the low vole years and neighbouring pairs showed less diet overlap that non-neighbours. Differences in habitat composition and prey availability at the sample sites should not confuse the results. In addition to the high diet similarity, hunting habitats and nest sites of the species overlapped almost completely; they only showed clear temporal segregation in hunting. Probably because of food competition, the neighbouring pairs of both species produced significantly fewer young than the non-neighbours. These results contrast with the view that the diet composition and dietary shift of rodent-feeding predatory birds can be interpreted in terms of simple opportunistic foraging. In the breeding season, interspecific competition for food seems to be an important factor that affects the niches of these species, especially in northern areas, where the seasonal low phase of voles in spring and the number of alternative prey are lower than in more southern areas.",Oecologia,,,,,,,

The yearly number of breeding pairs (range 1-26) and non-breeding males (0-10) in the study area (100 km2) was positively related to the number of available Microtus (M. agrestis and M. epiroticus) and Clethrionomys glareolus. The mean number of fledglings produced per pair was also positively correlated with the numbers of voles. The owls were able to track without time lags the population fluctuations of their microtine prey due to the high degree of mobility, vole-supply-dependent adult and juvenile survival, large reproductive potential and early maturity. The density of Microtus voles was the most important factor determining the diet composition of breeding owls. The functional curve to the changing numbers of Microtus spp. was very close to linear and did not level off at the high vole densities. This indicated a constant predation rate without satiety when voles peaked. The predation impact on microtines was positively dependent on vole densities and suggests that the owls dampen microtine cycles. The following factors seemed to promote the dampening impact. rapid numerical and functional responses to changes in vole densities, owl populations only slightly limited by territoriality, and spatial heterogeneity of the study area",Oikos,,,,,,,

We documented a 65\% decline in the local elk population following the arrival of wolves, with cougars concurrently switching from a winter diet primarily constituted of elk to one consisting mainly of deer and other alternative prey. Elk also became less important in wolf diet, but this latter diet switch lagged 1 y behind that of cougars. Wolves were responsible for cougar mortality and usurping prey carcasses from cougars, but cougars failed to exhibit reciprocal behaviour. Cougar and wolf home ranges overlapped, but cougars showed temporal avoidance of areas recently occupied by wolves. We conclude that wolves can alter the diet and space use patterns of sympatric large carnivores through interference and exploitative interactions. Understanding these relationships is important for the effective conservation and management of large mammals in protected areas where carnivore populations are recovering.",Ecoscience,,,,,,,

1515,"Kruger, O and Lindstrom, J",Habitat heterogeneity affects population growth in goskawk Accipiter gentilis,"1. The concept of site-dependent population regulation combines the ideas of Ideal Free Distribution-type of habitat settlement and density dependence in a vital rate mediated by habitat heterogeneity. The latter is also known as habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Site-dependent population regulation hypothesis predicts that increasing population density should lead to inhabitation of increasingly poor territories and decreasing per capita population growth rate. An alternative mechanism for population regulation in a territorial breeding system is interference competition. However, this would be expected to cause a more even decrease in individual success with increasing density than site-dependent regulation. 2. We tested these ideas using long-term (1975–99) population data from a goshawk Accipiter gentilis population in Eastern Westphalia, Germany. 3. Goshawk territory occupancy patterns and reproduction parameters support predictions of site-dependent population regulation: territories that were occupied more often and earlier had a higher mean brood size. Fecundity did not decrease with increasing density in best territories. 4. Using time-series modelling, we also showed that the most parsimonious model explaining per capita population growth rate included annual mean habitat quality, weather during the chick rearing and autumn period and density as variables. This model explained 63\% of the variation in per capita growth rate. The need for including habitat quality in the time-series model provides further support for the idea of site-dependent population regulation in goshawk.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Individual species were captured on 2-14 sites of a total of 17 and M. minutoides was the most widespread. The majority of samples consisted of two (ten sites in a pooled sample for 2 years) or three species (ten sites). Significant morphological structuring was found only in two-species samples. Species turnover was high both among sites and between the 2 years. We found no evidence of significant nested structure which would suggest hierarchical sets of ecological relationships among the species.

The point-count survey of widespread terrestrial bird species was undertaken to measure long-term population changes and to produce indicators of the condition of habitat types and the wider environment. The scheme has been mostly run by skilled volunteers of the Estonian Ornithological Society. The method applied is point counting on freechoice routes and without limiting recording distance. In the Estonian scheme, each count route consists of 20 points, with 5-minute stops at least 200 m apart. In total, 143 point count routes have been in use by 89 active birdwatchers and professional ornithologists in the course of 28 years. Yearly abundance indices for 87 bird species were calculated using TRIM software. The most evident changes in bird numbers were the declines detected in 19921996 among farmland species, and in 20072010 among farmland and woodland species. The long-term population trends (19752010) in four countries around the Baltic Sea depend on the migratory strategy of bird species. Among trans-Saharan migrants the proportion of declining species was much higher in comparison with short-distance migrants and sedentary species. A marked difference between these countries was found among sedentary bird species  with up to 2/3 of species with increasing trends in Finland and less than 1/3 in Denmark, Sweden, and Estonia. There is a growing interest in using the results of the scheme both at the national and the international scale (PECBMS).",Estonian Journal of Ecology,,,,,,,

The effects of human-caused fragmentation of boreal forest on the abundance of red fox Vulpes vulpes L. and pine marten Martes martes L. were studied by combining the Finnish wildlife-triangle snow-track data (1990-94) with land-use and forest resources data employing the GIS. Two study areas (each 45 000 km(2)) located in northern and southern Finland were selected for the investigation. 2. The extent of landscape that best explained predator abundance (tracks per 10 km 24 h(-1)) was the same (about 100 km(2)) in both species and study areas. 3. The decreasing proportion of older forest and the increasing proportions of young forest and agricultural land in the landscape positively affected track density of red fox. The relationship between agricultural land and fox abundance, however, was characterized by a convex curve peaking at 20-30\% of agricultural land. With the habitat classification used, landscape composition explained 26\% and 11\% of the spatial variation in fox abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. 4. The relationship between landscape composition and pine marten abundance was not as clear as in that of red fox. Landscape composition explained 10\% and 6\% of spatial variation in pine marten abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. In both areas a positive impact occurred with the increasing proportion of young forest in the landscape, but in the northern area the negative effect of increasing proportion of agricultural land was dominant. 5. The abundances of red fox and pine marten were not negatively correlated, indicating that competition or intraguild predation by red fox do not determine abundance of pine marten on a landscape scale. 6. A general increase in predation pressure by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes has been an intensively discussed conservation problem during recent years. We conclude that the red fox is a species potentially able to cause elevated predation pressure in boreal landscapes fragmented by human activities, but that the evidence against the pine marten is weaker.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Population fluctuations of both species were observed over 3 yr on the reef flat of Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan. Coral growth was negatively correlated with size, because partial death or destruction often occurred in large corals. The number and maximum size of gobies in a coral were positively correlated with coral size. Small corals (< 5 cm diameter) were seldom used, while large corals (> 15 cm) were almost always inhabited by 2 or more fish. The goby spawned from April to November, and juveniles (7 to 15 mm) increased in summer. The number of gobies and the corals occupied by gobies increased with the influx of juveniles. The goby population declined during winter and spring except in a year when corals > 5 cm became abundant. When the number of large corals decreased, large gobies (30 to 40 mm) decreased in number and the occupation rate of smaller corals increased. Mortality of marked fish (> 15 mm) was correlated with that of corals. Thus the population fluctuation of the goby was affected by both the availability of host coral and the goby's seasonal reproductive cycle",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

Of 113 species that have been described or are candidates for description, data indicate that in 42 species, population sizes have been reduced by at least half and only ten species have stable populations. The status of the remaining taxa is unknown. At least 30 species have been missing from all known localities for at least 8 yr and are feared extinct. Most of these species were last seen between 1984 and 1996. All species restricted to elevations of above 1000 m have declined and 75 percent have disappeared, while 58 percent of lowland species have declined and 38 percent have disappeared. Habitat loss was not related to declines once we controlled for the effects of elevation. In fact, 22 species that occur in protected areas have disappeared. The fungal disease Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been documented from nine species that have declined, and may explain declines in higher elevation species that occur in undisturbed habitats. Climate change may also play a role, but other potential factors such as environmental contamination, trade, and introduced species are unlikely to have affected more than a handful of species. Widespread declines and extinctions in Atelopus may reflect population changes in other Neotropical amphibians that are more difficult to survey, and the loss of this trophic group may have cascading effects on other species in tropical ecosystems.",Biotropica,,,,,,,

The arrival of DFTD triggered an immediate and steady decline in apparent survival rates of adults and subadults, the rate of which was predicted well by the increase in disease prevalence in the population over time. 4. Transitions from healthy to diseased state increased with disease prevalence suggesting that the force of infection in the population is increasing and that the epidemic is not subsiding. 5.

1529,"Lamberth, Stephen J. and Drapeau, Laurent and Branch, George M.",The effects of altered freshwater inflows on catch rates of non-estuarine-dependent fish in a multispecies nearshore linefishery,"In KwaZulu-Natal on the east coast of South Africa, the commercial and recreational boat-based linefishery is the largest fishery accounting for 1235 t (40\%) of the total landed mass there. In particular, the Thukela Banks are where most fishing takes place. Numerous developments ranging from dams to inter-basin transfer schemes either exist or have been proposed for the Thukela River, which is the largest of 17 catchments entering the sea in the region and provides over 40\% of the mean annual runoff. Exploratory analyses of the relationships between monthly flows and catch-per-unit-effort were performed using spectral analysis and general linear models on a data set comprising 17 years of monthly commercial catch-and-effort data for 140 species and monthly flow data from 17 catchments. Catchments having a significant influence on catches were those providing the bulk of the runoff volume (75\%) reaching the sea. Significant relationships existed between flow and the catches of 14 species, which provided over 90\% of the total linefish catch on the Thukela Banks. Time lags between flow events (wet and drought periods) and changes in catch-per-unit-effort corresponded in many cases to age at 50\% maturity and/or age-at-first-capture of the species concerned. Under a future maximum-development scenario, corresponding to a 44\% reduction in flow from the Thukela River, catches of slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus and squaretail kob Argyrosomus thorpei are forecast to decline by 36\% and 28\% respectively. These two species currently provide over 50\% of the landed mass on the Thukela Banks. Some species should respond positively to a reduction in flow, but any increases in their catches will be negligible, falling within natural variability, and will be insufficient to offset losses of other species because their abundance is naturally low or has been fished down to low levels. National legislation requires that sufficient freshwater flows be set aside to protect ecosystems, so these findings have important management implications, as marine needs for freshwater flows have not previously been addressed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Peak numbers of up to 4,000 Brent Geese occurred at two sites in eastern Hokkaido each October. By January none remained in this area and only 300-500 stayed in Japan at wintering sites in southern Hokkaido and northern Honshu. An examination of data collected during an annual January census by the Environment Agency of Japan suggested that these numbers have changed little over the last 25 years and there is no evidence of a decline. In January and February 1995 we surveyed 717 km of coastline in northern Japan to try and locate the remaining population, but found only another 162 individuals. We speculate that the majority of Brent Geese wintering in northeast Asia migrate in late autumn from eastern Hokkaido to sites in the Korean Peninsula and in China, although during a seven day survey of the southern coastline of Korea in January 1996 we found only 19 Brent Geese.",Wildfowl,,,,,,,

The extreme virulence of the putative frog pathogen suggests it is likely exotic to Australian rain forests. We propose that exotic pathogens may be re- sponsible for some recent declines of amphibian populations on other continents and that the intercontinen- tal spread of such pathogens is greatly facilitated by human activities such as the thriving international trade in aquarium fish.

1540,"Lavsund, Sten and Nygr\'{e}n, Tuire and Solberg, Erling J",Status of Moose Populations and Challenges to Moose Management in Fennoscandia,"In the Fennoscandian countries, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, moose (Alces alces) populations began to increase rapidly in the 1960s and have since then been among the most productive and heavily harvested moose populations in the world. At the start of the 20th century, the total annual harvest was < 10,000 moose, whereas in 2000, the annual kill reached about 200,000. The winter population was estimated to be about 500,000. In Sweden and Finland, the highest harvest numbers (and presumably population density) were recorded in the first half of the 1980s and in Finland again in the late 1990s and during the beginning of the 2000s. In Norway, the 1990s was the decade of the highest harvest numbers. The current regional moose density during winter varies from < 0.2 to about 2 moose/km2 this level in typical wintering areas (e.g., 5-6 moose/km2 within Fennoscandia. Locally, the density may far exceed ). In general, the current densities are lower in the north than in the south and higher in Norway and Sweden than in Finland. The strong increase in harvest and the present high densities are explained by several factors. First, modern forestry clear-cutting practices have provided Fennoscandian moose with prime habitats in the form of early succession stages. Accordingly, the current carrying capacity is likely to be relatively high compared to the situation 50-100 years ago. The current trend, however, is towards less activity in the forest and a decreasing proportion of forests found at an early successional stage. This may increase the food limitation already seen in several populations; i.e., in all three countries, body mass and recruitment rates have been found to decrease with increasing density. Second, the introduc- tion of sex and age-specific harvesting in the early 1970s has increased the general productivity of the populations. By focusing the harvest on calves, yearlings, and adult males, the proportion of productive females, the mean age of females, and the annual recruitment rate have increased. Simultaneously, the proportion and mean age of males have decreased, and in some populations, this has been associated with delayed parturition dates and lower fecundity; i.e., due to inadequate number of males for timely reproduction. Third, mortality other than hunting is low, and only near the eastern border of Finland with Russia has predation by wolves and bears had a notable effect on productivity figures. This situation is about to change with increasing populations of large carnivores in all of Fennoscandia during the 1990s. The management principles have been quite similar within Fennoscandia, although differences in legislation have resulted in national and regional differences in management performance. In general, moose managers take advantage of data collected by hunters during the hunting season (e.g., hunting statistics, number, sex, and age of moose observed) to monitor population development and determine hunting quotas. Moreover, in all three countries, the issues of traffic accidents and damage to forestry and agriculture play a central role in moose management and discussions concerning optimum population sizes.",Alces,,,,,,,

A full census of the coast was carried out by boat over 4 days, in order to make a full count of seals hauled out and close to the coast, and to document all haul-out sites. Regular land-based surveys were made of three haul-out sites in Cornwall, to investigate the effects of spatial, temporal and environmental factors on seal haul-out behaviour. Data from 2004 to 2007 were analysed to describe long-term temporal variation in seal abundance at two haul-out sites. A total of 592 sightings were made along the coast of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly over the four-day census period; 476 of these sightings (80.4\%) were recorded at six main haul-out sites. The highest proportion of seals was observed at three haul-out areas on the Isles of Scilly. In Cornwall, seals were observed in higher numbers on the north coast, where the three largest mainland haul-out sites were documented, than on the south coast. At one key haul-out site in Cornwall, a distinct seasonal pattern was evident in data collected between 2004 and 2007, with higher numbers of seals present during the moulting and breeding seasons than over the summer months. There was considerable inter-annual variability in peak seal abundance, during the moulting season, at this site. There was no significant variation in haul-out behaviour with tidal state at this site, although haul-out counts were generally highest at mid-ebb tides.

We estimated the stopover duration for 106 radiomarked pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos) in the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (MAV) during fall migrations in 2001 and 2002. We estimated time-at-site-after-capture by tracking radiomarked birds daily to determine their time of departure from stopover sites. We used length-biased sampling and program DISTANCE to estimate stopover duration from time-at-site-after-capture. Our estimate of stopover duration for pectoral sandpipers in the MAV over all sites and both years was 10.0 days (95\% Cl = 8.2-11.7). Aerial telemetry relocations from 2002 indicated that many pectoral sandpipers used multiple stopover sites during their migration through the MAV, which suggested that the total time spent by pectoral sandpipers in the MAV during fall migration, or turnover rate, was,longer than the stopover duration. Future research should focus on estimating the number of stopover sites used by pectoral sandpipers and determine whether other shore-bird species use multiple sites as well. If shorebirds migrating through the MAV stay in the region for a period longer than the 10 days suggested by the Lower Mississippi Valley joint Venture (LMVJV) Migratory Bird Science Team in their modeling of shorebird energetic requirements then more habitat may be required by shorebirds during fall migration than the 2,000 ha the group calculated for the MAV.",Journal of Wildlife Management,,,,,,,

Some ecologists focus on the role of environmental effects, whereas others argue that density-dependent feedback mechanisms are central. The relative importance of both processes is still hotly debated, but clear examples of both processes acting in the same population are rare. Key-factor analysis (regression of population changes on possible causal factors) and time-series analysis are often used to investigate the presence of density dependence, but such approaches may be biased and provide no information on actual demographic rates. Here we report on both density-dependent and density-independent effects in a murid rodent pest species, the multimammate rat Mastomys natalensis (Smith, 1834), using statistical capture-recapture models. Both effects occur simultaneously, but we also demonstrate that they do not affect all demographic rates in the same way. We have incorporated the obtained estimates of demographic rates in a population dynamics model and show that the observed dynamics are affected by stabilizing nonlinear density-dependent components coupled with strong deterministic and stochastic seasonal components.",Nature,,,,,,,

During the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella coming ashore on the island during the short summers. It is not known whether significant numbers of seals were present on the island prior to the initiation of commercial hunting in the early 1820s. The impact that the continuing increase of these seals had made on the island's terrestrial and freshwater environments has been sudden and locally devastating. The fragile cryptogam-dominated vegetation has suffered physical damage from which it may be impossible to recover. These seals are also frequenting several of the island's freshwater lakes which are becoming increasingly eutrophic. The long-term implications of this impact are causing serious concern for the future of the lowland terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems on Signy Island if the fur seal population continues to increase.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

The main recommendations include: -Review of national policy and legislation to ensure adequate legal protection for the White-headed Duck and its enforcement.  -Sustainable management of water resources to ensure adequate allocation of water.  -Site conservation measures, such as, establishment of an international network of sites of importance for migratory waterbirds.  -Development of a flyway-wide project to build and strengthen links between wetland managers and organisations.  -Development of a comprehensive population-monitoring programme covering the wintering, migratory and breeding seasons.  -Research to define the migration routes and population boundaries of the White-headed Duck.",,,,,,,,

We studied a fluctuating population of the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) in the Appalachian Plateau Province of Pennsylvania, USA, spanning 21 years of monitoring. We analysed the pattern of annual temporal variation fitting both time-series models and capture–mark–recapture (CMR) statistical models for survival and recruitment rates. 2. Wedeterminedthatnon-linearfirst-ordermodelsexplainalmost80\%ofthevariation in annual per capita population growth rates. In particular, a non-linear self-excited threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model describes the time-series data well. Average snowfall showed positive and non-linear effects on population dynamics. 3. The CMR statistical models showed that a non-linear threshold model with strong effects of population density was the best one to describe temporal variation in survival rates. On the other hand, population density or climatic variables did not explain temporal variation in recruitment rates. Survival rates were high during the study period. Weekly changes in population size attributable to new recruits entering in the population fluctuate between 21\% and 0\%, while the changes in population size related to survival fluctuate between 79\% and 100\%. 4. Two important results arise from this study. First, non-linear models with first-order feedback appear to capture the essential features of northern short-tailed shrew dynamics and demography. Secondly, climate effects represented by snowfall appear to be small and non-linear on this insectivore. The population dynamics of this shrew in the Appalachian Plateau are determined apparently by a strong non-linear first-order feedback process, which is related to survival rates. 5. This study links population dynamics and demography by detecting the underlying demographic mechanisms driving population dynamics. The feedback structure of this shrew suggests the existence of population dynamics dominated by intraspecific com- petitive interactions, such as aggression, solitary nesting, non-overlapping home ranges and territoriality.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Peaks in sandgrouse abundance are significantly negatively correlated with December rainfall and significantly positively correlated with March rainfall. Furthermore, annual sandgrouse abundance and March rainfall showed similar peaks at four-year cycles during 1909-1939. Therefore, a rainfall 'score' which takes cognizance of both December and March rainfall is useful for predicting annual sandgrouse abundance before the forthcoming hunting season. However, correct predictions of low sandgrouse abundance were more common than correct predictions of high sandgrouse abundance. These environmental correlates and predictive models are useful for forecasting the annual viability of commercial hunting of these populations.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Although the species has been relatively well-studied in the northern part of its range, little is known about southern populations. We conducted a four-year study on a population of Spotted Turtles in South Carolina. A total of 44 turtles were captured: 21 females, 17 males, 5 juveniles, and 1 hatchling. There was no size dimorphism with respect to carapace length. However, females had longer plastrons, greater shell heights, and heavier body masses than males, likely as a result of the concavity of the male plastron. The adult sex ratio did not differ from 1:1. Estimated adult population size varied annually from 31 to 36 turtles, and density was estimated at 0.36 turtles/ha. This information is important for the creation of management plans to conserve populations across the Spotted Turtle’s range.",Southeastern Naturalist,,,,,,,

We developed a habitat quality rating system, using existing wolverine (Gulo gulo) distribution, wolverine food, ecosystem mapping, and human development data. We used this and empirically derived estimates of wolverine density to predict wolverine distribution and abundance at a provincial scale. Density estimates for wolverines in high-quality habitat averaged 6.2 wolverines/1,000 km2 (95\% CI = 4.2-9.5). We predicted mean densities ranging from 0.3/1,000 km2 in rare-quality habitat to 4.1/1,000 km2 in moderate-quality habitat. Our predicted population estimate for wolverines in British Columbia was 3,530 (95\% CI = 2,700-4,760). We predicted highest densities of wolverines in interior mountainous regions, moderate densities in interior plateau and boreal forest regions, and low densities in mainland coastal regions and drier interior plateaus. We predicted that wolverines would be rare on Vancouver Island, along the outer mainland coast, and in the dry interior forests, and absent from the Queen Charlotte Islands, interior grassland environments, and areas of intensive urban development.",Journal of Wildlife Management,,,,,,,

I conducted a post hoc exploration of the major hypotheses for the decline of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister), incorporated the historical environmental changes that accompanied and preceded the decline, and considered how these events may have affected the species.What emerges is a complicated picture involving multiple, relatively minor stressors, all attributable to human activities. The temporal pattern of the decline is most coherent when considered from a historical perspective.Among the factors that are likely to have affected Allegheny woodrats are two exotic tree pathogens, a native parasite, the proliferation of human-adapted competitors, and habitat fragmentation. In addition, changes in competitive and predatory regimes appear to have influenced the timing of the collapse. Although the historic record cannot give definitive answers, taking a synthetic, historical– ecological approach can enhance understanding of species declines.",BioScience,,,,,,,

Mark",Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) Survival at Two Eastern Mojave Desert Sites: Death by Short-Term Drought?,"Survival of adult Desert Tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) appears related to site-specific variation in precipitation and productivity of annual plants. We studied adult tortoise survival rates at two closely situated, but physiographically different, sites in the eastern Mojave Desert over a nine-year period (spring 1992 to spring 2001). Survival rates were initially derived from population surveys conducted over a three-year period and by radio-telemetry monitoring over a seven-year period beginning in 1994. After a period of initial stability, survival rates on the two sites diverged over the study period, and seven-year survival rates estimated from radio-telemetry monitoring were 0.900 and 0.269, respectively. A die-off in 1996 on the latter site appears to have been triggered by a period of drought, which began in the summer of 1995, coupled with a failure of annual vegetation production in 1996. Depressed survival rates on this site were associated with drought conditions during three of four years. Although the decline had the appearance of an epizootic, there were no clinical signs of disease. Relatively short-term drought, combined with little or no annual biomass, appears to have caused severe reductions in tortoise survival. If periods of drought-induced low survival are common over relatively small areas, then source-sink population dynamics may be an important factor determining tortoise population densities.

Evolutionary theory predicts that individuals, in order to increase their relative fitness, can evolve behaviours that are detrimental for the group or population. This mismatch is particularly visible in social organisms. Despite its potential to affect the population dynamics of social animals, this principle has not yet been applied to real-life conservation. 2. Social group structure has been argued to stabilize population dynamics due to the buffering effects of nonreproducing subordinates. However, competition for breeding positions in such species can also interfere with the reproduction of breeding pairs. 3. Seychelles magpie robins, Copsychus sechellarum, live in social groups where subordinate individuals do not breed. Analysis of long-term individual-based data and short-term behavioural observations show that subordinates increase the territorial takeover frequency of established breeders. Such takeovers delay offspring production and decrease territory productivity. 4. Individual-based simulations of the Seychelles magpie robin population parameterized with the long-term data show that this process has significantly postponed the recovery of the species from the Critically Endangered status. 5. Social conflict thus can extend the period of high extinction risk, which we show to have population consequences that should be taken into account in management programmes. This is the first quantitative assessment of the effects of social conflict on conservation.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Port samples were obtained from the commercial fisheries based at Rio Grande do Sul for the period 1992-1998. In addition, data derived from the exploitation during the period 1977-1983 (Krug and Haimovici 1991) were included in this analysis. A statistical catch-at-age model is proposed to estimate population size and exploitation rates for both periods of study. This model incorporates both the seasonal characteristic and multi-fleet nature of the P. saltatrix fishery. During the most recent time period, fishery mortality has increased and spawning stock biomass has reduced in comparison to the earlier period 1977-1983. Currently, the exploitation of P. saltatrix relies on fish of all age classes. Adults have been intensively exploited and juveniles may not be abundant enough to maintain the stock at the current high level of exploitation. Management options for the stock are presented based on a redistribution of effort between fleets. Simulations indicate that a ban on fishing in shallow waters for either one or both gears would restore the level of spawning stock biomass.",Marine and Freshwater Research,,,,,,,

Isolated populations contribute little to these conservation efforts, so linking populations of dogs is a necessary goal to prevent extinction. I gathered demographic information from a small population of wild dogs in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Photographs and archive records from 1981 to 1996 were used to compile information on this population. Demographic parameters from the released population were compared with information on wild dogs elsewhere. Most demographic parameters of the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park population were similar to published information from other populations. The main difference was the effect of a single pack on population performance: pack formation was unlikely, unrelated animals were rare, and major losses (emigration and mortalities) occurred. Increasing the number of packs by introducing more dogs would be useful but would be only a short-term solution. Increasing the local population size and artificially linking populations in southern Africa appears to be the only longer-term solution to ensure the viability of wild dogs on the subcontinent.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

When these factors become part of the local fishermen's ecological knowledge, the resulting peak abundances are often intensively fished, as a result of their predictability, both in space and time. This study, conducted in the Caribbean Sea of north-eastern Colombia, tests hypotheses derived from local fishermen of seasonal patterns of the demersal species Lutjanus analis and the two pelagic species Caranx crysos and Scomberomorus cavalla, and of the possible wind- or swell-driven aggregations of L. analis. ARIMA modelling and Fourier analysis were used to identify seasonal patterns from time series of monthly mean catch per unit effort. Available biological information and, concerning L. analis, also data on wind speed and significant wave height anomalies were used to analyse the intra-annual patterns. Evidence of biologically induced seasonal migrations was found for the two pelagic species. Concerning L. analis, in the windy season the timing of these aggregations and therefore peak CPUE values appear correlated with the wind forcing occurring a few days before, but in the last months of the wet season these peak abundances seem to be mainly related to pre-spawning migrations and spawning aggregations. Thus, we state that both kinds of events should be taken into account for the implementation of precautionary measures aimed to reduce the vulnerability to overfishing of these aggregations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Fisheries Research,,,,,,,

A similar decline was evident from shore patrol data collected by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife staff in the southern areas of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park. As the distribution of fishing effort has decreased considerably since the promulgation of a beach vehicle ban in January 2002, this decline in the abundance of stumpnose has not been attributed to overfishing but rather to the closure of the mouth of the St Lucia estuary and lake system. The reason for this is because tropical stumpnose make extensive use of St Lucia as a nursery area and, since the mouth closure in June 2002, there has been no recruitment of juvenile fish into, or adult fish out of, the system. This emphasises the importance of estuarine nursery areas and highlights the need for ongoing catch and effort monitoring.",African Journal of Aquatic Science,,,,,,,

The nesting habitat is comprised of six beaches, totaling 5.5 km, which differ in physical features and human pressures. An average of 1293.7 nests were laid per season over the available nesting habitat, giving an overall nesting density of 235.2 nests/km, by far the highest in the Mediterranean. Mean nesting density was unevenly distributed per beach, ranging from 53.7 nests/km to 1062.8 nests/km. Despite the 19-year standardized work, no linear trend in the annual number of nests was detected. An overall 79.3\% of laid nests were hatched, with an average clutch size of 116.5 eggs and a hatchling emergence success of 66.6\%, yielding a mean annual output of 81,128 viable hatchlings. Spatial variability in incubation durations indicated production of hatchlings with different sex ratios on different beaches, with one producing almost entirely male hatchlings. Conservation measures for this important habitat, hosting 25.7\% of the documented total loggerhead nesting effort in the Mediterranean, are in conflict with local economic interests and poorly enforced.

Line-transect counts in four study areas were used to identify trends in the local abundances of wolves, people, livestock and domestic dogs (a putative rabies reservoir). Estimates of wolf abundance were validated against total counts in prime wolf habitats, where two local populations decimated by rabies in the early 1990s had recovered fully by 2000. Growth appeared to be regulated by negative density dependence, but the rate of growth was unexpectedly low at reduced densities. Limitations to rapid growth, including an initial gap for which data were sparse, are discussed. In a poorer habitat, wolf abundance estimates were less reliable but indicated slight fluctuations without an overall trend. A local extinction was recorded in an area of marginal habitat. With this exception, trends in wolf abundances were unrelated to trends in the abundance of people, livestock or dogs. Rabies emerged as the main cause of decline for high-density populations. The rapidly increasing livestock grazing pressure in Bale gives cause for concern, calling for further research on its impacts upon long-term wolf survival",Animal Conservation,,,,,,,

Fyke nets were used to determine the current distribution ranges of fish in the catchment to update a 1997 survey and to provide key information for the compilation of a conservation strategy for the Twee River redfin, Barbus erubescens. Population estimates from 1997 placed their total number at 8 400, but population size could not be estimated from the present surveys. A number of small populations of Twee River redfin and Twee River galaxias, which are restricted to two short stretches of tributary rivers, were identified.

Paul and {Von Korff}, Joy and Watt, Lorna",Abundance and distribution of waterbirds on the Knysna Estuary,"Twelve waterbird counts were undertaken on the Knysna Estuary during January (summer) and July (winter) from 1993 to 1998. A total of 67 species were recorded; a median of 5343 waterbirds were present during summer, 76\% of them Palearctic migrants, dropping to a median of 2336 waterbirds in winter. Waterbird numbers were about a third lower than normal during January 1997 following a flood in November 1996. There was a shift from a summer avifauna comprised predominantly of invertebrate-feeding migrant waders to a winter avifauna comprised mainly of piscivorous species. During the summer, 52\% of the birds were Curlew Sandpipers and Grey Plovers, Greenshanks, Kelp Gulls and Whimbrels each made up more than 6\% of the avifauna. During the winter Kelp Gulls, Cape and Reed Cormorants, Little Egrets and Sacred Ibises together comprised 62\% of the avifauna. The majority of invertebrate-feeding birds were found on the intertidal mudbanks around the Ashmead Channel and on the Brenton side of the estuary below the rail bridge, whereas the shallow water areas between the rail and N2 bridges were important to piscivorous birds, especially during the winter. The Knysna Estuary, being the largest estuarine system in the warm temperate region of South Africa, supports the largest number of birds of any estuarine system between Cape Agulhas and Durban Bay. However, bird densities are not as high as on other important bird estuaries and it is hypothesised that this may be due to recreational disturbance and to the relatively low density and availability of macrobenthic invertebrates.",Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa,,,,,,,

Despite mounting interest and research, several questions regarding the conservation implications of territory occupancy and site-dependent population regulation remain insufficiently explored for this species. Here, we report on a 12-year study of the territorial structure of a Bonelli’s Eagle population in southeastern Spain. No signals of population decline were found in the breeding population, as mean annual productivity was stable and the presence of mixed-age pairs in the population decreased with the years. However, the average proportion of subadults occupying territories was larger than that observed in other Spanish populations. Contrary to the predictions of a despotic distribution model, we found no significant relationship between occupancy rates and breeding parameters. Our results showed significant variations in productivity attributable to differences in the quality of individuals (i.e. mixed versus adult pairs), but no variability among territories per se (i.e. caused by habitat heterogeneity). Moreover, coexistence with intraguild species did not have any significant effect on productivity, although the proximity of Eagle Owls Bubo bubo affected the occupation rate of territories. Finally, our population does not appear to experience site- dependent population regulation, as a positive relation between mean annual productivity and density was found. The threat posed by changes in land use in the study area leads us to suggest that strict protection of current territories is necessary to ensure population persistence, and we suggest that a significant population increase is only likely if new or deserted territories become available.",Ibis,,,,,,,

Trichiurus lepturus was more abundant at bottom water temperatures of over 16°C and in the 40-120 m depth range. From late spring to fall, juveniles of 5-30 cm total length (TL) were found in coastal waters, subadults (TL 30-70 cm) mainly in inner shelf waters and adults (TL > 70 cm) in coastal, inner and outer shelf waters. Higher catches of subadults and adults were found associated with thermal fronts in the western boundary of the Subtropical Convergence or with a shelf break upwelling observed in summer. The standing stock in a 58000 km2 shelf area estimated by the swept area method, ranged from 3066 t (±46\% Cl) in September 1981 to 37814 t (±22\% Cl) in January 1982. Correlation between occurrences of different size groups of cutlassfishes and other fishes caught in 250 bottom trawl hauls was analyzed. A positive correlation between cutlassfish and juvenile weakfish, Cynoscion guatucupa, was associated with similar spatial distribution but also indicated trophic competition.",Fisheries Research,,,,,,,

Understanding why seals in Glacier Bay are declining may clarify their minimal habitat needs. We estimated population trends using models that controlled for environmental and observer-related factors. In 1992, 6,200 seals were counted on icebergs in a tidewater glacial fjord and at terrestrial sites; by 2002 only 2,550 seals were counted at these same haul-outs.Numbersof non-pups in the glacial fjord declined by 6.6\%/yr (−39\%/8 yr) in June and by 9.6\%/yr (−63\%/11 yr) in August and at all other haul-outs by 14.5\%/yr (−75\%/10 yr) during August. In the glacial fjord the number of pups remained steady from 1994 to 1999 and made up an increasing proportion of seals counted (5.4\%/yr), and the proportion of pups peaked at 34\%– 36\%. The rapid declines do not appear to be due to changes in seal behavior or redistribution. The declines reinforce genetic evidence that harbor seals in Glacier Bay are demographically isolated from other populations and indicate that current management stocks need to be redefined. Changes in Glacier Bay’s ecosystem and population demographic data from the glacial fjord suggest that interspecific competition and predation are likely factors in the declines.",Marine Mammal Science,,,,,,,

A method of valN1ating stochastic models of population viability is proposed, based on assessing the mean and variance of the predicted population size. 2. The method is illustrated with a model of the population dynamics of the mountain pygmy- possum (Burramys parvus Broom 1895), based on annual census data collected from a single population in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia between 1986 and 1997. The model incorporates density-dependence in survivorship and recruitment, and demographic and environmental stochasticity. 3. The model appeared to make reasonable predictions for the three populations that were used for valN1ation, provN1ed the equilibrium population size was estimated accurately. This may require that differences in habitat quality between populations be taken into account. 4. Following valN1ation, the model was given new parameters using the additional data from the three populations, and the risk of population decline within the next 100 years was assessed. Although populations as small as 15 females are predicted to be relatively safe from extinction caused by stochastic processes, B. parvus appears vulnerable to loss of habitat and reductions in the population growth rate. 5. The approach used in this paper is one of few attempts to valN1ate a model of population viability using field data, and demonstrates that some aspects of stochastic population models can be tested",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Mudpuppies are the obligate hosts for the mudpuppy mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua), a species that is endangered in Canada and in many Great Lakes states. We surveyed mudpuppies from the Sydenham River, the only known Canadian locality of the mudpuppy mussel, in order to generate information on relative density, deformity rates and population age/size structure and used this information to compare them to known mudpuppy populations from Great Lakes sites in the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair and Long Point in Lake Erie. Deformity rates were elevated at some sites in the Sydenham River. The relative density of mudpuppies in the Sydenham River was lower than that of other Great Lakes sites and their age was skewed towards younger individuals. Although at lower densities than at other Great Lakes sites, the mudpuppy population in the Sydenham River appears stable and is showing signs of recruitment which bodes well for the future of the mudpuppy mussel population of the river.

Despite their distribution throughout the tropics and sub-tropics, pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata) are rare throughout their range and are one of the most poorly-known species of odontocetes. During a 22-yr study of short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) off the island of Hawai‘i, we opportunistically photo-identified pygmy killer whales whenever encountered. As part of a directed multi-species study throughout the main Hawaiian Islands from 2000 through 2007, we also photo-identified individuals and obtained information on habitat use and behavior. This species was extremely uncommon (representing only 1.2\% of odontocete sightings in directed efforts). Given the low encounter rates, assessing trends of this population cannot be feasibly done with line-transect surveys. Despite their rarity, 80\% of the distinctive individuals within groups documented off the island of Hawai‘i were seen on multiple occasions, individuals were resighted over periods of up to 21 yr, and there was evidence of year-round use of the area. Association analyses indicate stable long-term associations in mixed-sex groups. High resighting rates indicate a small population of island-associated individuals that may be at risk from anthropogenic impacts.",Marine Mammal Science,,,,,,,

Great Skua numbers had fallen by 23\% overall since the previous census in 2000. However, the decline was not uniform across Orkney, the major colony on Hoy declining by 32\% but with many smaller colonies actually increasing. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed. Arctic Skua numbers fell by 47\% in the same time period and by 64\% from their peak in 1992. We found evidence of intra-specific negative density dependence in trends of both skua species, suggesting that declines may have been driven by low food availability. In addition, we found a negative relationship between Arctic Skua trends between 2000 and 2010 and the numbers of Great Skuas present in each colony in 2000. These findings suggest that whilst scarcity of food may have contributed to Arctic Skua declines, predation by Great Skuas is likely to have played an additional role. Predation on Arctic Skuas, both adults and young, is also likely to be ultimately attributable to a scarcity of alternative fish prey for Great Skuas.",Seabird,,,,,,,

Density and biomass also may behave differently in parts of the population composed of males and females because of differences in vagility and parental care between sexes. Herein, we explore seasonal and multiannual variation in density and biomass in a population of black-eared opossums (Didelphis aurita). Females and males were analyzed separately for associations with precipitation and litterfall, indicators of resource availability. Litterfall, density, and biomass were estimated from 1997 to 2003 on three 0.64-ha trapping grids in an area of Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Density of females exhibited a significant increase during the study. Density and biomass of males were more variable, without any significant positive trend or con-elation with precipitation or litterfall. Seasonal and biannual patterns of precipitation were detected, followed by the density and biomass of females with time lags varying from 0 to 1, and from 9 to 12 months. The relative stability of biomass of females, and its association with precipitation and litterfall, suggests that resource availability combined with density-dependent responses regulated the local population of females. The local population of males may be more influenced by the stochasticity resulting from the higher vagility of males.",Journal of Mammalogy,,,,,,,

However, such decline has not been consistently observed although profound modifications in the structure and/or composition of fish communities were generally recorded, and were linked to modifications of the downstream environment. In this work we analyze data from observations made before and almost 10 years after the completion of a hydroelectric dam in the neotropics. We monitored fish diversity below that dam and compared the taxonomic and functional structures of the samples between the pre- and post-dam periods. A significant decrease in species richness was evidenced. Taxonomic and trophic structures were significantly different between the two periods. Conversely, the functional structure of samples based on reproductive traits did not change significantly after the damming. Concerning feeding habits, a large increase in relative abundance of detritivores and a parallel decrease of fish species feeding on terrestrial food sources were observed in samples taken 69 years after closure of the dam as compared with samples taken before the dam.",Hydrobiologia,,,,,,,

Using 41 years of data, we examined annual variations in the reproductive performance of the red-billed gull at the Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand and related these to changes in climate, oceanography and the availability of the planktonic euphausiid Nyctiphanes australis, the bird's principal food. 2. In 1994 the population began to decline, and between 1983 and 2003 it was reduced by 51\%. Adult non-breeders comprised an average of 32\% of the population between 1983 and 1994, but following the decline they averaged only 18\%. The age at recruitment changed markedly following the population decline: 27\% of 2-year-old males bred for the first time prior to the decline, whereas the corresponding figure after the decline was 38\%. The proportion of females commencing to breed as a 3-year-old was not significantly different before or after the decline. 3. An increase in the availability of euphausiids increased the likelihood of breeding and the recruitment of young individuals, caused earlier laying and resulted in an increase in the condition of adults, egg volume of gulls laying two egg clutches, clutch size and fledging success. 4. The relationship between food availability and the number of pairs that bred, laying date, clutch size and fledging success was significantly different prior to and after the population decline. The underlying cause appears to be a compensatory density-dependent mechanism that reduced interspecific competition for food. 5. The relative abundance of N. australis was correlated positively with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the frequency of occurrence of NE winds. The proportion of non-breeders and mean laying date were correlated negatively with the SOI, and mean egg volume of two egg clutches correlated positively with the SOI. 6. These results emphasize that availability of adult euphausiids is critical for red-billed gulls. We hypothesize that high primary productivity of inshore water near Kaikoura in winter, linked to a stable water column of coastal water and upwelling of additional dissolved inorganic nutrients, increases the availability of adult euphausiids to the red-billed gull as long as the coastal water is not replaced by offshore subtropical water intrusions of warmer, low-nutrient water.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

The overall breeding population is probably over 1650 pairs, mostly concentrated at the Ebro Delta. The Llobregat Delta, the Aiguamolls de l'Emporda, and Torredembarra-Creixell also hold important populations. However, most of the localities are used irregularly, by a very few pairs. The intensive tourist use of beaches, as well as the destruction of dune vegetation, are the main problems facing the conservation of the species in Catalonia. Predation comes mostly from gulls and magpies, while feral dogs and cats can be important sources of disturbance in some areas. Outside the Ebro Delta, the conservation of the species depends on the successful management of beaches to make conservation compatible with human activities. The use of successful management techniques to other localities, and the accurate determination of population trends at the Ebro Delta are the most important measures that can be adopted for the conservation of the species in Catalonia.",Revista Catalana d'Ornitologia,,,,,,,

We established the study in 1994 using a randomized complete block design with three replicates and five treatments: (1) no harvest, no site preparation; (2) harvest, no site preparation; (3) harvest, mechanical site preparation; (4) harvest, chemical site preparation; (5) harvest, mechanical and chemical site preparation. We applied harvest and site preparation treatments from fall 1995 to fall 1997. We collected pre-treatment data in spring and summer of 1995 and post-treatment data from 1998 to 2002. We monitored salamander abundance using a grid of 20 cover boards surveyed 10 times per year within each of the 15 treatment plots. We also quantified changes in overstory and understory cover, supply of downed woody debris, and disturbance to the forest floor. Our data suggest that shelterwood cutting and site preparation can have immediate negative effects on the abundance of red-backed salamander populations in pine forest. However, effects are relatively short lived (<5 years). Changes in abundance appeared to be related to overstory and understory cover, and forest floor disturbance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In 1983, Aldabra became a UNESCO World Heritage Site managed by the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF). But prior to 1968, its green turtles suffered intense exploitation documented by trade statistics, historical literature, and a scientific study in 1927. Three population surveys conducted just before, during, and shortly after 1968 provide baseline data by which to assess the long-term population recovery monitored since 1980 using a standardized track count protocol. The 52 nesting beaches distributed along the 83-km outer rim of Aldabra were classified into 6 beach groups (WGT, SETT, DDM, DJL, CC, and North), with total beach length of 5.2 km. During Phase 1 (1980-1994) of the study, 17 index beaches (WGT \#1-17) were monitored 4 times per month and other beaches opportunistically. During Phase 2 (1994-2008), index beaches (WGT \#1-22 and SETT) were monitored at least 4 times per month and remote beaches monthly. Track counts were converted to estimated egg clutch production using nesting success data. Reproductive output for the atoll rose from a mean annual estimated 2000-3000 clutches in the late 1960s to 15,669 (SD = 2776) during 2004-2008, equivalent to a mean estimated 3100-5225 females nesting annually (assuming an average of 3-5 egg clutches per female). This represents a 500\%-800\% increase during 40 years of complete protection. During Phase 2, the rate of increase was highest at the Settlement Beach (SETT), which had historically suffered the most intense exploitation.

The possibility that yacare caiman had been over-exploited generated pressure for a monitoring programme for caiman populations. The marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) and pampas deer (Ozotocerus bezoarticus) are listed as endangered in Brazil and need the protection of effective management programmes. Ground surveys are difficult for the extensive and inaccessible Pantanal Wetland, south-western Brazil, but aerial surveys provided information that allowed re-evaluation of conservation priorities. Caiman and marsh deer have larger populations than was believed. Preliminary data indicates that the pampas deer density decreased at a rate of about 30\% per year from 1991 to 1993. This indicates the need for detailed ground-level studies for the pampas deer population in the Pantanal. We recommend a long term monitoring program using standardized counting procedures for wildlife populations in the Pantanal.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

The outbreak affected equids including the endangered Grevy’s zebras (Equus grevyi), plain zebras (Equis Burchelli) and donkeys (Equus asinus). Most of the deaths were localized in Nkaroni area just west of Wamba town. The diagnosis of anthrax was rapidly confirmed by bacteriological methods. The relevant government depart- ments, including the Kenya Wildlife Service and Veterinary Department, and other stakeholders were promptly informed. Fifty-three Grevy’s zebra and 26 plains zebras died from anthrax. An equal number (eighteen) of adult male and female Grevy’s zebras succumbed to the disease. The outbreak affected immature and mature individuals equally. The dead plain zebras included fifteen adult fe- males, two adult males and nine immature individuals. The Veterinary Department responded by vaccinating livestock while Kenya Wildlife Service vaccinated 620 Grevy’s zebras within southern Samburu. Examination of sites at which carcasses of animals which succumbed to the disease were burnt, revealed that unsupervised burning did not elimin- ate anthrax spores in 42\% of the cases (n ¼ 14).

1684,"Murphy, R F and Secor, D H",Fish and blue crab assemblage structure in a US mid Atlantic coastal lagoon complex,"Variability in assemblages of organisms in contiguous lagoons is dependent upon component bays and their connections to the ocean and terrestrial watersheds. Fish and blue crab assemblage structure of Maryland's coastal lagoon complex, which consists of Assawoman, Isle of Wight, Sinepuxent, and Chincoteague Bays, was analyzed for spatial and seasonal patterns for the period 1991-2002. Nonmetiric multidimensional scaling ordinated sites from a Maryland state trawl survey into discrete groups associated with each embayment. Dominant species included Callinectes sapidus, Anchoa mitchilli, Leiostomous xanthurus, Bairdiella chrysoura, and Brevoortia tyrannus. The relative abundance of these and other dominant species were significantly higher in the two bays north of the ocean inlet than in bays south of the inlet. Ninety-two species were identified in the survey, with total species richness highest in the southern-most bay (Chincoteague: S = 83) and lowest in the northern most bay (Assawoman: S = 59). On a catch per unit effort basis, the northern two bays were more diverse and productive. These bays were most affected by anthropogenic eutrophication, but also exhibited higher connectivity to the ocean inlet. There was clear seasonality in assemblage structure with peak abundance and diversity in the summer compared to spring and fall. Factors that influenced seasonal and spatial structure of Maryland's coastal lagoon complex included temperature, degree of eutrophication, and proximity to oceanic exchange. The arrangement of the bays in their exposure to oceanic and watershed influences specify that habitat management actions should occur at a bay-level scale rather than across the lagoon complex.",Estuaries and Coasts,,,,,,,

However, despite the abundant information on small rodent dynamics in South America, there are no studies reporting cyclic population dynamics. Here, we report evidence of cyclic population dynamics in a South American small rodent, the longhaired field mouse (Abrothrix longipilis) from southern temperate forests in Chile. The time-series analyses showed that longhaired field mice dynamics are better represented by a second-order autoregressive model characterized by 3- year cyclic dynamics. The 3-year cycles are clearly shown in the autocorrelation factor (ACF) pattern and in the domi- nant frequency of the spectral analysis. In addition, we determined nonlinear effects of the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AAOI). The results shown here pointed out that we need the integration of studies about cyclic small rodent populations from the different continents and beyond the Northern Hemisphere to resolve the enigma underlying the cyclic population dynamics exhibited by many small rodent species.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Under recovery programs, the wolf population increased in the United States, and depredation events increased proportionately. In both countries, thenumberof domestic animals killed each yearwas correlated with thenumberofwolves killed by government authorities for depredation management.We tested the ability of antiwolf barriers made of flags hanging from ropes to impede wolf access to food and livestock. In 18 experiments, barriers prevented captive wolves (n= 9) from accessing food for up to 28 hours and allowed daily separation of wolves to administer contraceptive pills to a female wolf. Barriers prevented access by wild wolves to 100-m2 baited sites during two 60-day tests. We also set barriers around three cattle pastures. In Alberta during two 60-day trials on 25-ha pastures, wolves approached barriers on 23 occasions but did not cross them, and no cattle were killed. Wolves killed cattle on neighboring ranches during the trials and before and after the trials on the tested ranches. In Idaho four radiocollaredwolves crossed barriers and killed cattle in a 400-ha ranch after 61 days of barrier exposure. Our results suggest that antiwolf barriers are effective in deterring captive and wild wolves for >1 and ≥60 days, respectively, and that wild wolves switch to alternative livestock when excluded from one herd of livestock. Our depredation data indicate that protecting livestock from wolves reduces the necessity for killing wolves. Barriers could play a role among the limited set of preventive measures available and offer a cost-effective mitigation tool for the problem of livestock depredation on a local scale.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

As abundances of all 11 great sharks that consume other elasmobranchs (rays, skates, and small sharks) fell over the past 35 years, 12 of 14 of these prey species increased in coastal northwest Atlantic ecosystems. Effects of this community restructuring have cascaded downward from the cownose ray, whose enhanced predation on its bay scallop prey was sufficient to terminate a century-long scallop fishery. Analogous top-down effects may be a predictable consequence of eliminating entire functional groups of predators.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",,,,,,,

The Białowieża Primeval Forest in Poland is among the few places where they still live in the wild. The management of this free-living herd has to reconcile to the conservation needs of a species and the economic and environmental objectives of their habitat: protected as well as commercial woodlands of Białowieża. Here we present a detailed account of the population development and analyse variation in vital rates based on monitoring that started in 1952 and continued until 2002. The population was allowed to grow freely until 1970, when removal started with the aim to stabilize population size. We found that recruitment rate, but not mortality, was density dependent, suggesting that the population density was not very high relative to resource levels. Winters with much snow and cold temperature had a strong negative effect on survival. May temperature of the previous year positively affected recruitment rates. Masting (oak seed) also positively affected recruitment rates, which provides a rare account of masting affecting the performance of a large ruminant. Sex ratio of offspring was even and was not strongly affected by density or climate. We use an age-structured matrix model to show how this knowledge of intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting vital rates may help managerial decisions by providing explicit links between given environmental conditions and the population growth rates.",Animal Conservation,,,,,,,

Four reef observation areas or marine protected areas (MPAs) were established in 1994 to examine their value in protecting vulnerable reef fish species, including the sub-tropical wrasse, Choerodon rubescens, and the coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus. In 1993 and 1994 (prior to protection), population densities and body sizes were monitored at two island groups (Easter and Wallabi). At each location, the MPAs and the equivalent 'control' areas to remain open to fishing were monitored by underwater visual censuses. These closed and open areas were subsequently monitored four more times between 1995 and 2002 to assess long-term trends in abundance and population structure. Populations of the wrasse, C. rubescens, did not appear to respond to protection, exhibiting irregular fluctuations in both closed and open areas throughout the study. In contrast, although there were no significant increases for P. leopardus for the first three years of closure, after eight years of protection there were significantly larger numbers of P. leopardus in the closed areas. There was a three-fold increase at the Easter Group and a seven-fold increase at the Wallabi Group, relative to open fishing areas, attributed primarily to reduced fishing mortality. Significant closed areas (17\% of the P. leopardus habitat) provided substantial stock-wide impacts. The data also indicate that the MPAs can be effective where some forms of fishing (such as lobster fishing) are permitted which are compatible with the objectives of the MPA. While MPAs are clearly an effective tool for increasing the local abundance of some reef fishes, the spatial and temporal scales required for their success may vary among species.",Environmental Conservation,,,,,,,

The natural resources of this high elevation (3500-5000 m) park make a significant contribution to the livelihood of local and nomad communities. The present legislation excludes people from a park, which increases conflicts between management and local people. However, a pragmatic approach was adopted to involve people in conservation in Deosai. Community participation, achieved by recognizing rights and introducing incentives, reduced resistance against the conservation efforts, reduced grazing pressure in bear habitat and helped reduce poaching. The size of the brown bear population was set as an indicator of park success, and was monitored annually from 1993 through 2006. We observed a 5\% annual growth of the brown bear population, suggesting that the conservation program has been successful due to a successful cooperation between an NGO, people, and the park management. The increase of the bear population is significant, because we observed an extremely low reproductive rate, due to late age of first reproduction (8.25 years), a long reproductive interval (5.7 years), and a small litter size (1.33). The reproductive rate of the Deosai population is the lowest yet documented for brown bear populations. Poor habitat quality, low quality food, high seasonality, and extreme weather conditions in the Himalaya probably explain the poor reproductive performance. Considering such low reproduction and known exchange of individuals with neighboring populations, we believe that the observed growth was a sum of reproduction and immigration. Brown bears are declining throughout South Asia and often have low-productive rates. Therefore, conservation efforts for brown bears in this region must target reducing human-caused mortalities, particularly of adult females. Involvement of people can increase efficiency in conservation, in addition to reducing cost and conflicts. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

D.",Population biology of bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli in the mid Chesapeake Bay,"The population biology of bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli was studied from July 1986 to December 1987 to estimate relative abundance, age structure, growth and mortality. Trawl surveys indicated that mean abundance, indexed by catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), was higher in the July-November period in 1986 than in 1987. Mean CPUE was highest in September of each year when catches were dominated by recruiting, young-of-the-year (YOY) anchovy. Annuli on otoliths indicated the presence of 4 age classes. Maximum age was 3+, when some individuals were 85 mm fork length (FL) and > 5 g wet wt. The population consisted primarily of YOY and age 1+ individuals. Observed lengths-at-age were highly variable. Although most growth in length was completed by age 1+, significant increases in length and, especially, weight occurred in older fish. The parameters of a von Bertalanffy growth model, fitted to the means of back-calculated lengths at otolith annuli and fall marks, are: L sub( infinity ) = 129.3 mm FL, K = 0.23, and t sub(o) = -1.23 yr. The best estimates of mean fork length-at-age were generated by a seasonally oscillating version of the von Bertalanffy model, with L sub( infinity ) = 107.0 mm FL, K = 0.36 and t sub(o) = -0.81 yr. Fork lengths-at-age, based upon this model, are: age 1, 50.4 mm; age 2, 67.6 mm; and age 3, 79.5 mm. The instantaneous natural mortality rates of recruited anchovy are high. Annual mortality rates, estimated from catch curve analyses, ranged from 2.2 to 2.9 (89 to 95\%/yr). The fast growth and high mortality rates indicated that maximum cohort biomass is achieved during the late postlarval or early juvenile period.  The bay anchovy ""Anchoa mitchilli"" is the most abundant fish in the Chesapeake Bay and possibly in the coastal, western North Atlantic. It lives over the continental shelf and in coastal bays and estuaries from the Gulf of Maine to Brazil. This small planktivore, which rarely exceeds 100 mm total length, is not exploited commercially but is preyed upon by commercially important species, including weakfish, striped bass, bluefish, and summer flounder. Bay anchovy population dynamics are poorly known but essential to understand its trophic role.

These figures gave mean periods of residence on territories of 1.4 and 1.5 years respectively, but occasional cocks stayed on the same territories for up to 5 years, and occasional hens for up to 6 (in a 10-year study). Turnover was more rapid on poor territories than on good ones. It was due partly to mortality and partly to movement. (2) Of birds identified in the next year, 77\% of cocks and 67\% of hens were on the same territory, and the rest were on a different territory. The median distance moved by cocks which changed territory was 0.8 km (maximum distance 19 km), and by hens 1.5 km (maximum distance 27 km). The minimum distance between nesting territories was 0.4 km. (3) No difference in frequency of movement was noted between lowland and upland habitats, but birds which failed in their breeding the previous year more often changed territories than did birds which succeeded the previous year (significant only in hens). This tendency to move after a failure was especially marked in young birds, and became less marked with age. (4) Birds which changed territories showed a slight tendency to occupy a higher grade territory after their move than before it, but on average they did not breed any better at their next attempt than they had at the previous one, nor did birds which kept to the same territory. (5) In thirteen cases where mates kept together from year to year, they also stayed on the same territory, and in another case the pair moved to an adjacent territory in the same wood. In other cases, birds of either sex retained the same territory with a different mate, or changed both territory and mate, sometimes with the original partner alive and breeding elsewhere. Four years was the longest period in which a pair was found to stay together on the same territory. (6) On average, partners which had been together on the same territory the year before produced more young than did partners that were new to one another or to the territory.

During January– May, 1998–2002, 167 aerial surveys were conducted (66,466 km of total survey effort), providing a complete representation of the spatiotemporal distribution of right whales in the bay during winter and spring. A total of 1553 right whales were sighted; some of these sightings were multiple sightings of the same individuals. Right whale distribution and relative abundance patterns were quantified as sightings per unit of effort (SPUE) and partitioned into 103 23-km2 cells and 12 2-week periods. Significant interannual variations in mean SPUE and timing of SPUE maxima were likely due to physically forced changes in available food resources. The area of greatest SPUE expanded and con- tracted during the season but its center remained in the eastern bay. Most cells with SPUE>0 were inside the federal critical habitat (CH) and this finding gave evidence of the need for management measures within CH boundaries to reduce anthropogenic mortality from vessel strikes and entanglement. There was significant within-season SPUE variability: low in December−January, increasing to a maximum in late February−early April, and declining to zero in May; and these results provide support for management measures from 1 Janu- ary−15 May.",Fishery Bulletin,,,,,,,

1741,"Nolet, B.a. and Baveco, J.M.",Development and viability of a translocated beaver Castor fiber population in The Netherlands,"We monitored survival, reproduction and emigration of a translocated beaver Castor fiber population in the Netherlands for five years and used a stochastic model to assess its viability. Between 1988 and 1991, 42 beavers were released in the Biesbosch National Park. The mortality was initially high but gradually fell to normal rates. However, the breeding success was low, and we hypothesized that this was either a temporary phenomenon (the translocation hypothesis) or a permanent feature (the poor habitat hypothesis). According to the computer simulations, the isolated population was viable under the first but not under the second hypothesis. In the latter case, the prospects generally improved by the foundation of another population in the Gelderse Poort (100 km from the Biesbosch). However, this second habitat should be optimal for beavers in order to reduce the extinction probability of the Biesbosch population to below 10\% in 100 years; the loss of genetic variability (1–2\% per generation) was just above the applied tolerable risk (1\%), but the effects of inbreeding are unknown in beavers. We conclude that the beaver population in the Biesbosch is not viable unless the reproductive success increases, either in the Biesbosch itself or in a nearby population. We recommend applying such viability analyses to evaluate the likely success of any translocation.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Our studies in the western-most part of the Polish Carpathian Mts, 1996–2003, revealed that the winter density of wolves varied in the region from 1.3–1.9 wolves/100 km2 (on average 1.6, SE=0.13). In late summer, the average number of wolves in a pack was 4.7 wolves (n=21, range 2–9, SE=0.4), while an average pack in winter consisted of 4.0 wolves (n=25, range 2–7, SE=0.3). The mean wolf territory covered an area of 158 km2 (SE=26.7, range 98–227 km2 ). In the Silesian Beskid Mountains, where no human hunting pressure occurred, the wolf population increased during the study period at a mean rate of 28\% per year. However, in the Żywiecki Beskid Mountains, where wolves were subject to hunting management in the Slovakian parts of their territories, the population did not increase. The mean rate of increase of the wolf population in the entire study area was 8\% per year. Wolf mating seasons began on February 13th until March 7th and lasted , with pups being born during the first ten days of May. Pup rearing places were located between 880 and 1290 m a.s.l. (average = 1009 m a.s.l., SE=34.5, n=11), in dense thickets or under roots of fallen trees and stumps. We did not find excavated dens. In late summer, we recorded an average of 1.9 pups per pack, but counted only 1.3 pups per pack the following winter. Reasons for death (n=18) included culls (83\%), collisions with motor vehicles (11\%), and sarcoptic mange (6\%). In the Żywiecki Beskid Mountains we estimated the minimum mortality rate of 1.5 individuals/pack/year.",Folia Zoologica,,,,,,,

Aim To produce an up-to-date assessment of the numbers of Red-throated Divers wintering around Great Britain. Methods A revised Great Britain (GB) wintering population estimate for Red-throated Divers was com- piled using data primarily from systematic line transect surveys by aircraft over marine nearshore areas conducted during 2001–06, supplemented with county bird records and Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) counts, both from 1995 to 2005. Population estimates for each survey area around GB were calculated as the mean of either annual means (aerial surveys) or annual maxima (WeBS, county bird records) of all data collected within January and February of each year. These were summed to give a revised GB wintering population estimate. Results A total of 17116 (13198–21034, 95\% confidence interval) Red-throated Divers were estimated to winter around GB. Distribution was uneven. By far the greatest numbers were found off southeast and east Britain (59.3\% of the total was between Flamborough Head, Yorkshire, and Dungeness, Kent), with large concentrations off the English south coast (10.9\%), north Wales and Liverpool Bay (9.8\%), and eastern Scotland (6.1\%). Conclusion This is a minimum plausible population estimate and the true population size may be larger. The new 1\% of population threshold for statutory conservation work is 170 birds.",Bird Study,,,,,,,

Chalinolobus tuberculatus appeared to be common throughout New Zealand in the 1800s but by 190030 it was becoming scarce in many dis- tricts. Formal surveys in the South Island since 1990 either failed to find C. tuberculatus,or recorded bats in low numbers. Of eight sites where transect counts were undertaken, bats were recorded frequently at two sites (4566\% of counts; Eglinton and Dart Valleys), rarely at four sites (2.410.7\% of counts), and were not recorded at the remaining two sites despite considerable survey effort. Of 10 sites where stationary counts using automatic detector units were used, no C. tuberculatus were recorded in three areas (153 nights combined), they were found rarely at six sites (2.121.0\% of nights; 461 nights combined) and were recorded com- monly only in the Eglinton Valley (85\% of 120 nights). Assertions that C. tuberculatus are common and that the conservation status is secure are questionable and this review sup- ports suggestions that the species should be classed as Vulnerable. Possible causes of decline have been suggested including clearance and logging of lowland forests, predation by intro- duced mammals and owls, competition for roost sites by introduced mammals, birds and wasps, and human interference and disturbance at roosting sites. However, authors claims have all been speculative and unsubstantiated. There has been no research undertaken to quantify these claims, and this is required urgently. The results of these preliminary surveys provide a new baseline against which future population trends might be compared. Increased effort using standardized monitoring techniques, applied at a national level, is required to confirm the possible trends and to help identify the best sites where conservation managers may attempt to restore the population level.",Mammal Review,,,,,,,

Therefore, SH polar bears may be among the first to show negative effects associated with climate warming and consequent loss of sea ice. Polar bears in the neighboring Western Hudson Bay (WH) population have declined significantly in body condition since the mid-1980s, and a recent study indicated that the size of the WH population declined by about 22\% between 1987 and 2004. Similarly, SH bears have shown a significant decline in body condition since the mid-1980s, and an assessment of the current status of the SH population was therefore needed. We applied open population capture-recapture models to data collected from 1984-86 and 1999-2005 to estimate population size and survival. The size of the SH population appears to be unchanged from the mid-1980s (1984-1986: 641, 95\% CI = 401, 881) vs. 2003-2005: 681 (95\% CI = 401, 961). Point estimates of survival for subadults and adult females were 94\% (95\% CI = 68\%, 100\%) in 1984-1985 to 89\% (95\% CI = 79\%, 99\%) in 2003-2005, but imprecision exhibited by overlap of the confidence intervals prevented us from unequivocally concluding that this 5\% decline in survival was not a chance occurrence. Similarly, a decline of 7\% in survival was estimated for subadult and adult males over the same time period (male survival estimates = 88\% (95\% CI = 77\%, 100\%) in 1984-1985; 81\% (95\% CI = 66\%, 96\%), but again we could not unequivocally conclude that this decline was not chance. There was weak evidence of lower survival of cubs, yearlings, and senescent adults in the recent time period. This, combined with the evidence of significant declines in body condition for all age and sex classes, which were greatest for pregnant females and subadults, suggests this population may be under increased stress at this time. However, we did not find any clear association between survival and cub-of-the-year body condition, average body condition for the age class, or extent of ice cover in our data. This lack of association could be real or attributable to the coarse scale of our average body condition measure, or to limited sample size and few years of intensive sampling. That the WH population appears to be in decline, but the SH population does not, might be explained by changes to sea ice patterns which to date have been greater in the western half of Hudson Bay (breakup 10 days earlier per decade) than in the eastern and southern portions of Hudson Bay (breakup 5-8 days earlier per decade). However, if the trend in sea ice patterns (i.e., earlier melt and later freeze-up) continues in eastern and southern Hudson Bay, the SH population will likely respond similarly to the WH population and begin to decline",USGS Science Strategy to Support U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Polar Bear Listing Decision.,,,,,,,

Summarized here are results for the sooty shearwater Puffinus griseus, the common murre Uria aalge, and Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, the 3 most abundant seabirds in the central part of the California Current (91\% of seabird abundance and biomass). During the study, sea-surface temperature, wind speed and thermocline depth all increased, salinity decreased and thermocline intensity (slope) showed no consistent trend. Periods of cool water and warm water, as well as offshore and inshore excursions of the shelfbreak front, alternated and were mediated by the Southern Oscillation and upwelling intensity. The responses to climate variation by the 3 seabird species were in accord with their respective morphologies and natural history patterns. All moved closer to shore and away from the shelf-break front (which also weakened). Abundance of the shallow-diving shearwater and auklet decreased dramatically, but those of the deeper-diving murre did not. The shearwater, which nests in the southern hemisphere and is the most mobile of the 3 seabirds, likely changed its migration routes and reduced its association with the California Current. The auklet, which breeds within the study area and lacks mobility, declined in number, most likely due to reduced breeding success and subsequent reduced population size. Remaining auklets moved away from the shelfbreak, but not as far inshore as the shearwater. The murre, which also breeds locally, is the most adaptable owing to its deeper-diving capabilities. It shifted distribution within the study area to feed on alternative prey found throughout the water column.",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

Sex ratio also has particularly important implications for growth rates of many large mammal populations through its influence on reproductive potential. Therefore, the interrelationships between density-dependent factors, comprising density, sex ratio and underlying growth rates (r) were examined for the Eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli) living in three rhino sanctuaries in Kenya using four population models. The exponential and logistic models gave similar results and the former were accepted because they better portrayed the actual situation on the ground. Sex ratios in all sanctuary populations were positively correlated with r but interpreted with realization of other factors also affecting r. We caution that the results of population models should be interpreted alongside ground-truthed observations. We recommend that future translocation strategies should take into account sex and age structures of the donor population, while future studies of density dependence should take into account both biotic and abiotic factors.Resume Des mecanismes de feedback de densite-dependance chez les grands herbivores donnent un apercu de la dynamique des populations et de l'interaction avec l'ecosysteme.

For both species, growth parameters and life-history strategies are characterised by small size, high growth rate, early maturity, high reproductive effort through daily spawning, short generation time, short life span and high mortality rate. Both species reproduce throughout the year, with peak periods of recruitment during the February to April and October to November periods. The population structures showed a preponderance of females over males, while males attained a larger total length than females. Three habitat types ( vegetated pool, vegetated riffle, and marsh) were preferred by both species, whilst unvegetated habitats were avoided. Epiplatys spilargyreius was fairly specific in its habitat preference, with a significant positive correlation (r = 0.65, p < 0.05) to marshy habitat, whereas E. bifasciatus showed some habitat-use plasticity.",African Journal of Aquatic Science,,,,,,,

However, improvements in satellite tracking technology in recent years, have enabled the study of medium-sized species by means of satellite telemetry. In 2006, ten adult Montagu's harriers were fitted with satellite transmitters in northeastern Spain and tracked during their autumn migration to their wintering grounds in sub-Saharan Africa. The migration took between 10 and 30 days, and the end point was determined using breakpoint regressions. Whereas some birds had stopovers of more than a week, others stayed at the same site for only 1 or 2 days at the most. The tagged birds ultimately established at wintering grounds located along the border of Mauritania with Mali and Senegal, a distance of nearly 3000 km from the breeding sites. These sites are situated within a small range of latitudes (14 degrees and 17 degrees N), although distributed over a wider range of longitudes (-15 degrees E and -4 degrees E), with some birds occupying sites more than 1000 km apart. The distance covered in 1 day during the migration ranged between 93 and 219 km, with peaks of traveling speed of up to 65 km/h. Harriers were recorded traveling only during daytime, covering the longest distances in the late afternoon, suggesting that they are daytime migrants. Most of the distance was covered between 1500 and 2000 hours, and no traveling was recorded between 2000 and 0500 hours. During migration, harriers flew close to the ground (40-100 m on average). Improved knowledge of the harriers' exact wintering sites may provide insights on the problems Montagu's harriers face during the winter, highlighting the need to take into account what happens in both the breeding and wintering grounds to implement successful conservation measures.",Ecology,,,,,,,

1784,"Owen-Smith, Norman and Mills, M. G L",Manifold interactive influences on the population dynamics of a multispecies ungulate assemblage,"The dynamics of animal populations can be influenced directly by prevailing resources, population density, and environmental conditions, and through the delayed effects of trophic interactions and abiotic effects on habitat conditions. For large mammals, lagged effects can extend several years back in time.We attempted to establish the causal processes governing the population changes shown by 11 ungulate species counted annually over a 20-year period in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. Kudu, waterbuck, warthog, sable, tsessebe, roan, and eland declined progressively in abundance after 1986, while zebra, wildebeest, impala, and giraffe maintained high abundance levels. To identify lagged in- fluences, we used statistical probes indexing (1) inferred changes in predator abundance as a consequence of past food availability, (2) effects on habitat conditions of prior rainfall, and (3) competitor impacts on shared food resources. Multiple linear regression models were fit to estimates of annual population growth derived from the count totals subdivided among four regions. The temporal pattern of the population declines by five species was most consistent with a lagged effect from past predator food, in addition to the direct effects of seasonal rainfall. However, models including the lagged effect of prior rainfall fit nearly as well. Species that maintained high abundance responded mainly to an immediate or lagged density feedback. Changing rainfall conditions apparently affect the relative sus- ceptibility of ungulate species to predation. Hence, the top-down interaction with predators cannot readily be disentangled from extrinsic influences on population dynamics, mediated through resources. Population declines by some species became extreme because a pro- longed period of low rainfall, especially in the dry-season component, followed a doubling in the food base supporting lions, and was coupled with widened prey distribution as a consequence of the augmentation of water points by managers. Changes in population abundance within this multi-prey, generalist predator system arose from a complex interplay between changing climatic conditions, variable food production, shifting habitat conditions, varying vulnerability to predation, and spillover effects on other species.

In 1962, the Crater lions suffered an epizootic that reduced the population to nine females and one male. An additional seven males apparently immigrated into the Crater in 1964-1965, but there has been no further immigration into the Crater in the past 25 yr. By 1975, the population had recovered to its current level of 75-125 animals. All members of the current Crater population are descended from only 15 founders, and over the years there has been considerable variance in the reproductive success of both sexes. This population shows a significant lack of genetic diversity compared to the much larger Serengeti population. Simulations suggest that the Crater population may have passed through previous bottlenecks before 1962 but that the level of heterozygosity in the breeding population has been declining since the mid-1970s, regardless of the populations's genetic composition in the 1960s. High levels of inbreeding are correlated with increased levels of sperm abnormality in lions. The reproductive performance of the Crater lions has apparently decreased as a result of decreasing heterozygosity.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

Despite numerous gradual changes in prey availability and vegetative cover, regional populations of Serengeti lions remained stable for 10- to 20-year periods and only shifted to new equilibria in sudden leaps. Although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories, regional lion populations did not expand until short-term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young. The results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern of ""saltatory equilibria"" results from the lions' grouping behavior.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",,,,,,,

As a first step toward establishing sustainable management strategies, we analyzed harvest trends for lions and leopards across Tanzania's 300,000 km2 of hunting blocks. We summarize lion population trends in protected areas where lion abundance has been directly measured and data on the frequency of lion attacks on humans in high-conflict agricultural areas. We place these findings in context of the rapidly growing human population in rural Tanzania and the concomitant effects of habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and cultural practices. Lion harvests declined by 50\% across Tanzania between 1996 and 2008, and hunting areas with the highest initial harvests suffered the steepest declines. Although each part of the country is subject to some form of anthropogenic impact from local people, the intensity of trophy hunting was the only significant factor in a statistical analysis of lion harvest trends. Although leopard harvests were more stable, regions outside the Selous Game Reserve with the highest initial leopard harvests again showed the steepest declines. Our quantitative analyses suggest that annual hunting quotas be limited to 0.5 lions and 1.0 leopard/1000 km2 of hunting area, except hunting blocks in the Selous Game Reserve, where harvests should be limited to 1.0 lion and 3.0 leopards/1000 km2.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

During the study period, 870 days were spent at sea, surveying a total of 73,046km, totalling 540 sightings of fin whales. Mean yearly whale encounter rates showed no significant differences in the first five years, but then steadily decreased between 1995-99. The highest encounter rates and largest mean aggregation size (mean=2.12; SD=1.32; SE=1.15) were in summer 1995 and the mean aggregation size throughout the study period was 1.75 (mode=1; SD=1.11; SE=0.05). Differences in mean aggregation size were significant between years, but not months. This is likely to be related to prey availability and to patchiness of plankton distribution. Generalised Linear Models were used to relate fin whale distribution to physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coast). Water depth was the most significant variable in describing fin whale distribution, with more than 90\% of sightings occurring in waters deeper than 2,000m. This study demonstrates the deep water preference of fin whales in this area, emphasises the crucial role that this part of the western Ligurian Sea plays in the ecology of Mediterranean fin whales and provides recommendations for conservation and management measures in the area.",Journal of Cetacean Research and Management,,,,,,,

Natural recruitment was inconsistent in the 1960s, and with the additional impact of Libby Dam since the 1970s, the wild population now consists of an aging cohort of large, old fish. Jolly-Seber population estimates have declined from approximately 7,000 white sturgeon in the late 1970s to 760 fish in 2000. At the current mortality rate of 9\% per year, fewer than 500 adults will remain by 2005 and fewer than 50 by 2030. At current growth and maturity rates, hatchery fish being released since 1992 should begin recruiting to the adult population around 2020. Population projections describe a significant bottleneck in spawner numbers as the wild population declines but hatchery fish have not yet matured. Only 113-203 wild females are projected to contribute to hatchery broodstock over the expected life span of the current population. With current levels of hatchery production, the population is projected to stabilize at about 3,000 adults-although numbers predicted by these population simulations are extremely sensitive to estimates of survival rate. The next generation is expected to be produced primarily from hatchery spawning of wild adults. Habitat restoration measures to improve survival and rearing conditions for the wild component are critical to recovery efforts in the long term; however, recovery measures should also include a balanced consideration of the short-term and long-term risks faced by the white sturgeon population. Use of increasing numbers of broodstock in the hatchery will reduce risks of genetic founder effects. Increasing numbers of juveniles produced per family in the hatchery will provide a hedge for uncertainty in broodstock availability as the population declines.",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,,,,,,,
1796,"Rodgers  Jr.}, James a and Schwikert, Stephen T and Jr, Rodgers J a",Buffer zone distances to protect foraging and loafing waterbirds from disturbance by airboats in Florida.,"We exposed 13 species of waterbirds (Pelecaniformes, Ciconiiformes, Falconiformes) to the direct approach of an airboat to determine their flush distances. Five lakes with different levels of airboat activity were visited in central Florida during April-August 1999 to 2001. We detected considerable variation in flush distances among individuals within the same species and significant differences among species in response to an airboat. Average flush distances among all species ranged from 49 m for the Snail Kite (Rastrhamus sociabilis) to 172 m for the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Average flush distances among herons ranged from 65 m for the Tricolored Heron (Egretta tricolor) to 113 m for the Great Egret (Ardea alba). Larger species generally exhibited greater average flush distances. A comparison of the flush distances elicited by a fast moving outboard-powered boat and an airboat indicated that all nine species exhibited significantly greater flush distances to the approach of an airboat. Recommended buffer zones that would minimize disturbance of waterbirds while foraging and loafing ranged from about 130 m (Snail Kite) to 365 m (Bald Eagle) for raptors and 165 m (Tricolored Heron) to 255 m (Great Egret) for wading birds.",Waterbirds,,,,,,,

Breeding pairs formed the nucleus of coyote social groups, and these often traveled with 1-3 other coyotes during winter. Increased use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was insufficient to explain group size and cohesiveness by eastern coyotes. Winter-traveling group size was similar for family groups using deer (X\`{I}„ = 2.6) or snowshoe hares (X\`{I}„ = 2.7) as a primary prey in winter. Estimated densities of coyotes in winter was 4.3-13.9 coyotes/100 km2. Coyotes used the same general areas during winter and summer and from year to year. However, territory sizes decreased with increasing densities of deer (partial r2=0.21, P = 0.043) and hares (partial r2=0.40, P = 0.007). During winter, coyotes used areas of high deer density in proportion to their availability, but in some instances, they used areas that contained few or no deer proportionately more than expected, probably because deep snow and few trails increased vulnerability of deer in these areas. Territoriality seemed to prevent coyotes from concentrating in deer wintering areas and kept the coyote: deer ratio relatively low (<1:25).",Journal of Mammalogy,,,,,,,

The jaguar population of this region is highly fragmented and reduced. To assess the status of the subpopulation of jaguars of the Green Corridor we conducted four camera-trap surveys in three sites with different levels of protection. At Urugua-\'{\i} (34 stations, 1,495 trap-days) we recorded one individual (minimum density = 0.12–0.33 per 100 km 2 ). At Yabot\'{\i} Biosphere Reserve (42 stations, 1,871 trap-days) we recorded two individuals (minimum density = 0.11–0.25 per 100 km 2 ). At Iguaz\'{u} National Park we conducted two surveys. In 2004 (39 stations, 1,839 trap-days) we recorded four adult individuals, estimating a density of between 0.49 ± 0.16 and 1.07 ± 0.33 per 100 km 2 . In 2006, we increased the area sampled (47 stations, 2,059 trap-days) and recorded 11 adult individuals, estimating a density of 0.93 ± 0.2 to 1.74 ± 0.34 per 100 km 2 . These density estimates are the lowest recorded for the species. Estimates for Iguaz\'{u} are between 2–7.5 times lower than those reported in the early 1990s. This population decline probably results from the interaction of several factors, including lack of prey as a result of poaching and persecution. We estimate that there is currently a population of 25–53 adult jaguars in the Green Corridor. In spite of having sufficient potential habitat available this population is threatened and urgent conservation action is required.",Oryx,,,,,,,

A demonstrated increase in the number of humpback whale sightings in the southwest Gulf of Maine since 1978 concurrent with an increase in the number of sand eel in the same area supports the hypothesis that within the Gulf of Maine the present distribution of humpback whales is due to the distribution of their apparent principal prey, the sand eel. A similar correlation between humpback whale sightings and sand eel abundance on Georges Bank was not significant (r = 0.24, df = 18) despite dense patches of sand eel in that region. Therefore, within the combined Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank regions, factors other than simply prey availability must influence the feeding distribution of the humpback whale. We argue that the bottom topography of the Gulf of Maine and the foraging behavior of the whales are critical factors influencing their present feeding distribution.",Fishery Bulletin,,,,,,,

1803,"Pelicice, Fernando Mayer and Agostinho, Angelo Antonio","Perspectives on ornamental fisheries in the upper Paran?? River floodplain, Brazil","South America has remarkable fish diversity, with many species regarded as ornamentals. Each year, ornamental fishes worth billions of dollars are traded worldwide. In Brazil, in spite of its large geographic area and many different drainage basins, the trade is restricted to the Amazon region. Considering that the ornamental potential is unknown in other basins, this work aimed to assess the potential in the last remaining floodplain of the upper Paran?? River basin. Fish collections associated with the PELD-CNPq project (Site 6) from 2000 and 2001 were analyzed. Fishes were collected with gill nets and beach seines in lagoons, channels and rivers of the floodplain. To evaluate the ornamental potential, this analysis categorized all taxa recorded as: (i) ornamental, (ii) potentially ornamental, (iii) lawful, and (iv) suggested lawful. A total of 101 taxa were captured, with 40.6\% cited as ornamental in the literature and an additional 42.6\% are considered as potentially ornamental. Of these taxa, Brazilian legislation restricts the trade to only 10 species, mainly small Characiformes, which are abundant in many lagoons and already well known in the market. CPUE and density catches differed among environments, with higher values for ornamental and lawful taxa observed in lagoons. Some isolated lagoons showed extremely high lawful fish densities (over 3000 ind./100 m2). Considering our results, the upper Paran?? River floodplain has great potential for ornamental fisheries. The ornamental fishery could be a new economic alternative to help alleviate the social poverty found in many cities along the Paran?? River. Due to the proximity of the floodplain to larger cities such as Maring?? and Paranava??, establishment of ornamental trade activities will demand less capital and at the same time reduce problems associated with transport, aviamento and fish mortality. Species richness and captures (density and CPUE) indicated an existing ornamental potential in this floodplain, but only future studies will assure if stocks can endure pressures of such a selective fishery. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Wildfowl numbers peaked during the early 1980s; lowest counts were recorded in 1997. Total wildfowl numbers (all species combined) and duck numbers (duck species combined) showed significant short-term (1981-2000) declines, while geese (goose species combined) showed a significant long-term (1961-2000) increase. Six wildfowl species suffered significant long-term declines, while four showed increases. During 1981-2000, 11 species declined, but none had significant increases. Redhead (Aythya americana), Mexican duck (Anas diazi), northern pintail (A. acuta) and black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) should be given high conservation priority because of the high proportions of their North American populations in Mexico. Declining numbers of the later two species should trigger further investigation into the possibility of assigning them legal protection status. Other species with apparent declines in numbers should also be more closely monitored. For setting hunting limits in the country, the population status of each species should be accounted for, as well as the condition of breeding populations the previous spring. Other species with poor data or combined counts should be targeted for basic population studies. We suggest that the mid-winter counts be expanded to cover non-surveyed areas and conducted every year to more precisely detect wildfowl population change. Integrated to a site-selection analysis, the information presented here can provide the basis for a wildfowl conservation strategy in Mexico. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The most important caves for bats (in terms of species representation and reproduc- tion) were visited yearly, and monthly in 2001. Noctilio leporinus still occurs on the island, but does not appear to be numerous (six observed in 2003). We captured Myotis nesopolus nesopolus, but its roosting sites remain unknown. Leptonycteris curasoae curasoae numbers varied greatly, even within a year, and it may travel to and from other islands and Venezuela. Overall, however, the population of this species on Curac¸ ao seems to be declining (1000 in 1993 and 625 in 2003); the disappearance of this pollinator could have severe consequences for the Curac¸ ao ecosystem. Mormoops megalophylla intermedia is declining as well; in 2003, we counted 403 individuals including 75 pups, from 500 to 600 adults in the 10 previous years, representing a 25–30\% decline in 1 year. We estimated the population of Natalus tumidirostris to be 890 in 2003. We also found a group of 60 Pteronotus davyi in Kueba di Rat ´on in 2003. Glossophaga longirostris elongata (1417 individuals counted) is the only species for which our data indicate relative stability over 10 years; L. curasoae and Mor. megalophylla are declining and other species must be monitored closely. Most caves are disturbed; four major caves require attention for the conservation of the most fragile species. Without immediate attention, Mor. megalophylla, in particular, risks imminent extinction. Despite problems associated with bat counts on Curac¸ ao, it is clear that regular surveys are crucial to understand bat populations and their fluctuations in caves, and to allow management responses to declines, particularly for areas undergoing rapid urbanization",Animal Conservation,,,,,,,

Habitat use and trend in numbers of Tundra Swans at Long Point were assessed using data from twelve Tundra Swans fitted with satellite transmitters and tracked locally, aerial surveys of swans on water (1971-1999), and roadside surveys of swans in fields (1998-2000). Mean peak autumn aquatic counts at Long Point increased from 442 Tundra Swans in the 1970s to 7,177 in the 1990s. The proportion of the Eastern Population of Tundra Swans using Long Point during peak one-day autumn counts increased from <1\% in the 1970s to nearly 8\% in the 1990s. In contrast, there was no change in peak spring aquatic counts. Tundra Swans were located in agricultural fields more often in spring (74\% of diurnal satellite locations) than in autumn (9\%). During spring, most (65\%) swans using terrestrial habitats were observed in corn (Zea mays) fields, whereas during autumn, most (67\%) were in winter wheat (Triticum duriem) fields. Seasonal differences in use of fields appeared to influence wetland habitat use; during spring, when agricultural fields were used extensively. Tundra Swans were located in those aquatic habitats that were closest to fields. However, during autumn, when aquatic plants were their primary forage, swans tended to use aquatic habitats closer to the tip of Long Point. Given the potential for Tundra Swans to influence the structure of waterfowl communities and aquatic habitats, and the overall lack of information about staging Tundra Swans, further research into the ecological importance and use of spring and autumn stopover sites is warranted.",Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology,,,,,,,

Sighting rates and line transect densities were used as indices of relative abundance to monitor trends over the period, and abundance estimates corrected for perception biases were calculated for some species from the 2001 survey. More than 11 species were sighted, of which the most common were the minke whale, humpback whale, dolphins of genus Lagenorhychus, and the harbour porpoise. Minke whales and dolphins showed little change in distribution or abundance over the period. There were an estimated 31,653 (CV 0.30) dolphins in the survey area in 2001. Humpback whales increased rapidly at a rate of 10.8\% (CV 0.24), with much of the increase occurring off eastern and northeastern Iceland. In 2001 there were an estimated 5,129 (CV 0.462) humpback whales in the survey area. The relative abundance of harbour porpoises decreased over the period at a rate of -4.9\% (CV 0.47), but estimates for this species were compromised by uncorrected perception biases. The ecological and historical significance of these findings with respect to previous whaling activities and present-day fisheries is discussed.",Reports of the International Whaling Commission,,,,,,,

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are expected to function simultaneously as biological conservation and fisheries management tools, but empirical evidence linking biodiversity conservation with fisheries benefits is scarce. Around the Medes Islands marine reserve (Spain, NW Mediterranean) patterns of fish catch diversity, catch (CPUE) and income (IPUE) were assessed and the economic value of diversity for local fisheries was explored by combining a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis with geostatistics. 2. Catch data were derived from the trammel net fleet operating around the MPA to gain information on species diversity, functional diversity, functional redundancy, CPUE and IPUE. 3. Results revealed significant impact of both the fishing prohibition in the MPA and the presence of seagrass beds on diversity metrics, catch and income. Clear differences in functional redundancy in fish assemblages were found within the study area, indicating greater resilience of the fish assemblage against fishing pressure or human impact close to the MPA (p2 km). In contrast, fish assemblages beyond 2km of the MPA border are more vulnerable to disturbance. High values of diversity, CPUE and IPUE overlapped close to the MPA border and close to seagrass beds. 4. The spatial approach developed suggests that, in addition to the more commonly studied effect of density- dependent spillover of adult fish, increased levels of ecological diversity and economic diversity can also result in fisheries benefits of an MPA. Hence, the fishing regulations in and around the Medes Islands marine reserve have shown that biological conservation and fisheries benefits can be complementary in the long-term, which should be considered in future policies for MPAs or MPA networks.

The assessment of species extinction risk has been well established for some time now. Assessing the potential for recovery in endangered species is however much more challenging, because complementary approaches are required to detect reliable signals of positive trends. 2. This study combines genetics, demography and behavioural data at three different time-scales to assess historical and recent population changes and evidence of reproductive synchrony in a small population of olive ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. Lepidochelys is considered as the most extraordinary example of reproductive synchrony in reptiles, yet to date, it has only been reported in large populations. 3. Using Bayesian coalescent-based models on microsatellite nuclear DNA variability, we demonstrate that effective population size in olive ridleys nesting in French Guiana has dramatically declined by 99\% over the last 20 centuries. This low current population size is further illustrated by the absence of genetic mitochondrial DNA diversity in the present nesting population. Yet, monitoring of nesting sites in French Guiana suggests a possible recovery of the population over the last decade. 4. Satellite telemetry shows that over the first 14 days of their 28-days inter-nesting interval, i.e. when eggs maturation is likely to occur, gravid females disperse over the continental shelf. They then gather together with a striking spatiotemporal consistency close to the nesting site, where they later emerge for their second nesting event. 5. Our results therefore suggest that reproductive synchrony also occurs in small populations. Olive ridleys may ensure this synchrony by adjusting the duration of the second half of their inter-nesting interval prior to landing, possibly through social mediation. 6. Such reproductive synchrony may be related to the maintenance of some species-specific strategy despite former collapse and may contribute to the present population recovery. The gregarious behaviour of reproductive individuals close to shore where human-induced perturbations occur is however a cause for conservation concern for this still poorly known species.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

Catch rates for apex predators such as blue shark (Prionace glauca), bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and albacore (Thunnus alalunga) tunas, shor tbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), and striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) declined by 3\% to 9\% per year and catch rates for four midtrophic species, mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus), sickle pomfret (Taractichthys steindachneri), escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum), and snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens), increased by 6\% to 18\% per year. The mean trophic level of the catch for these 13 species declined 5\%, from 3.85 to 3.66. A shift in the ecosystem to an increase in midtrophic-level, fast-growing and short-lived species is indicated by the decline in apex predators in the catch (from 70\% to 40\%) and the increase in species with production to biomass values of 1.0 or larger in the catch (from 20\% to 40\%). This altered ecosystem may exhibit more temporal variation in response to climate variability.",Fishery Bulletin,,,,,,,
1827,"Pondella, Daniel J. and Allen, Larry G.",The decline and recovery of four predatory fishes from the Southern California Bight,"What to do about fisheries collapse and the decline of large fishes in marine ecosystems is a critical debate on a global scale. To address one aspect of this debate, a major fisheries management action, the removal of gill nets in 1994 from the nearshore arena in the Southern California Bight ( 34 degrees 26' 30 '' N, 120 degrees 27' 09 '' W to 33 degrees 32'03 '' N, 117 07 degrees 28 '' W) was analyzed. First, the impetus for the gill net ban was the crash of the commercial fishery for white seabass ( Atractoscion nobilis; Sciaenidae) in the early 1980s. From 1982 to 1997 catch remained at a historically low level ( 47.8 +/- 3.0 mt) when compared to landings from 1936 - 1981, but increased significantly from 1995 - 2004 ( r = 0.89, P < 0.01) to within the 95\% confidence limit of the historic California landings. After the white seabass fishery crashed in the early 1980s, landings of soupfin ( Galeorhinus galeus; Triakidae) and leopard shark ( Triakis semifasciata; Triakidae) also significantly declined ( r = 0.95, P < 0.01 and r = 0.91, P < 0.01, respectively) until the gill net closure. After the closure both soupfin and leopard shark significantly increased in CPUE ( r = 0.72, P = 0.02 and r = 0.87, P < 0.01, respectively). Finally, giant sea bass ( Stereolepis gigas; Polyprionidae) the apex predatory fish in this ecosystem, which was protected from commercial and recreational fishing in 1981, were not observed in a quarterly scientific SCUBA monitoring program from 1974 to 2001 but reappeared in 2002 2004. In addition, CPUE of giant seabass increased significantly from 1995 to 2004 ( r = 0.82, P < 0.01) in the gill net monitoring program. The trends in abundance of these fishes return were not correlated with sea surface temperature ( SST), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO) or the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation ( ENSO). All four species increased significantly in either commercial catch, CPUE, or in the SCUBA monitoring program after the 1994 gill net closure, whereas they had declined significantly, crashed, or were absent prior to this action. This suggests that removing gill nets from coastal ecosystems has a positive impact on large marine fishes.",Marine Biology,,,,,,,

England (Coulson \& Thomas 1985) increased from 1954 to 1967, but the proportion of first breeders decreased during that time. Increased mortality of the breeding birds or the provision of more sites increased recruitment. This implied that there was a pool of potential recruits from which the new recruits needed could be drawn. In most years there appeared to be a non-breeding reservoir. (2) About 11\% of each cohort returned to breed in their natal colony. Immatures did not suffer the same variations in mortality as did adults; this finding is consistent with the premise of Coulson \& Thomas (1985) that increased adult mortality associated with the decline in numbers in the late 1960s occurred prior to the breeding season. (3) The age of first breeding fell from 5 to 4 years in response to high adult mortality in the early 1970s; body weights and wing-lengths of male and female recruits diminished, but the body weights of male and female prospectors fluctuated little. (4) A model of colony growth is presented, based on the relationship between colony size and rate of increase in expanding colonies of British kittiwakes. Small colonies grow faster than large ones, and are proportionately more attractive to recruits. Small colonies cannot produce enough young during the first 70 years and are sustained by immigration. (5) The North Shields colony is not a closed system and is not currently growing; it is supported by immigration. There is a positive relationship between colony size and nesting density; colony growth appeared to be limited by the number of attractive sites in the dense centre of the colony. There were sites available on the periphery which were not used. The importance to breeding of the buffering effect of the pool of potential recruits is discussed.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,
1833,"Potapov, Eugene R","What determines the population density and reproductive success of rough-legged buzzards, Buteo lagopus, in the Siberian tundra?","The annual variability of the breeding performance of rodentivorous birds of prey has traditionally been explained in terms of annual fluctuations in rodent abundance. This paper presents data from the Siberian tundra showing that this relationship may not be so simple as generally thought. The data consist of parameters of small mammal population fluctuations (small mammal density (SMD), average body weight, species diversity and rate of change of species diversity), inter-specific competition and meteorological factors (mean temperature and snow melt dale) during every stage of the breeding cycle of the rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus). The density of breeding pairs was found to be correlated with the SMD, whereas the total number of territorial pairs including non-breeding ones could be most accurately predicted by a model incorporating both the SMD and the population density of a larger competitor, the snowy owl (Nyctea scandiaca). Clutch size showed no correlation with the SMD. The best-fit multiple regression model to predict clutch size includes only small mammal diversity and its rate of change as predictive factors. Number of nestlings and egg losses did not show any correlation with any of the prey-related or weather parameters. Although the total number of rough-legged buzzard fledglings produced per unit area showed a significant positive correlation with the SMD in a single-factor regression, the most accurate multiple regression model to predict overall reproductive output included only the rate of change of the small mammal species diversity. The number of offspring produced by the buzzards in a given area fluctuated synchronously with the SMD, but the cycle was significantly more consistent in amplitude in the predator as compared to the prey.",Oikos,,,,,,,
1834,"Potts, Gr and Coulson, Jc and Deans, Ir","Population dynamics and breeding success of the shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis, on the Farne Islands, Northumberland","(1) A population study of the shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis (L.)) started on the Farne Islands in 1961 and continued until 1971. Many breeding individuals had originally been ringed as chicks and the majority of the population consisted of individually marked birds of known age. (2) Mean annual adult survival was normally 0.83 +- 0.007, but 0.24 and 0.38 respectively during the 'red-tides' of 1968 and 1975. Survival after the first year (0.51) and second year (0.75) was not affected to an important extent by age. (3) All the nest-sites were ranked according to their physical characteristics and suitability for breeding. Only 4\% of the sites which were used during the study were considered to be entirely satisfactory. (4) A multiple regression analysis was carried out on the variation in breeding success of 857 pairs (40\% of the total), for which twelve variables were measured. Breeding success was much better in the 3 years after the 'red-tide' of 1968 but the regression coefficients of the independent variables were similar. (5) It was possible to account for fifty-five percent of the individual variation in the seasonal start of laying. The most important factors here were age of the partners with the contribution by the male and female equal. The oldest birds on the best sites started to lay 5 weeks earlier than the youngest on the poor sites, but the mean date of laying of an age class varied by as much as 5 weeks from year to year depending on the annual differences in the dispersal of adults during the late winter. (6) Clutch size on the Farne Islands was 3.01 +- 0.04 with hatching success of eggs incubated for the full term at 0.87 +- 0.02. Variations in clutch size were responsible for only 4\% of variation in the number of young hatched. Most nesting losses were due to the weather, especially rough seas which particularly affected the poor quality sites. (7) Variation in the number of young fledged by a pair was accounted for by the quality of their chosen nest-site and to a lesser extent by previous breeding experience. No other factors were found to be important and those specifically excluded were direct effects of age after the first attempt to breed, nest density, pair status and site or mate fidelity. (8) There was a shortage of good nest-sites on the Farne Islands and mean nest-site quality declined significantly as the population increased. (9) Between 1963 and 1968, the shag population increased and the shortage of nest-sites progressively reduced the production of fledged young per pair. This effect was especially marked among the first time breeders which arrived late each season and were forced to occupy relatively poor sites. (10) After an exceptionally high mortality of adults in 1968, caused by a 'red-tide', nest-sites were not in short supply and productivity per pair greatly increased, especially among the first time breeders which moved to better sites. (11) The breeding efficiency of first time breeders was compared to established breeders. After excluding the effects of nest-site they bred 0.70 as well as established breeders. (12) The proportion of potential breeders which emigrated to the Farne Islands from the Forth was similar to that of emigration from the Farne Islands; 0.098 of potential female recruits. (13) Immigration, especially of young females, has been the dominant factor determining the size of the population on the Farne Islands during these studies and it allowed the population there to recover rapidly from the exceptional mortality caused by the 'red-tides'. Of 704 females which bred for the first time between 1962 and 1971, 420 (60\%) were immigrants. (14) A computer model showed that nest-site quality has been an important factor restraining the growth of the population. In future, nest-site availability is likely to limit breeding numbers to about 900 pairs. (15) The prolonged nesting season and the relation between nest-site quality and age of the occupying pair is considered to be the result of competition for sites which are tangible assets, not conventional trophies. (16) Social constraints on nesting meant that some poor sites in colonies were occupied before good ones in non-occupied areas but the progressive occupation of sites during the growth of the Farne Islands population has been efficient for the individual pairs and for the population as a whole. The established birds with the highest breeding potential occupied the best sites.",The Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,
1835,"Power, M and Attrill, M J",Factors affecting long-term trends in the estuarine abundance of pogge (Agonus cataphractus),"Long-term data assembled from a power station on the Thames estuary were used to model fluctuations in the abundance of pogge (Agonus cataphractus) as a function of estuarine environmental, seasonal and prey availability variables using multiple regression. Temperature was the most important determinant of abundance, with seasonal variables and changes in the relative abundance of age-0 dab, Limanda limanda, possibly as prey, also holding important consequences for pogge abundance. Pogge abundance was also moderately influenced by: salinity, flow, salinity-flow interactions, changes in the relative abundance of Dover sole, Solea solea, and a trend variable. Regular patterns of seasonal (spring/winter) occurrences were associated with the use of warmer estuarine waters to optimize growth and reproductive potential and/or correlated with inshore spawning migrations and the availability of prey species. Both mechanisms suggest opportunistic use of estuarine habitats by pogge. Available temperature-abundance relationships further suggest a well- defined estuarine thermal niche, with an optimum at 9-5 degreesC. There remains a requirement for improved information on the biology of pogge and factors governing the population dynamics of this important estuarine species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

During this period, live coral cover declined by >90\%, mostly due to severe coral bleaching. There were no short-term changes (within 4 months) in the abundance of butterflyfishes following initial declines in live coral cover. Surveys conducted in 2005, however, revealed significant declines in the abundance of Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon lunulatus, Chaetodon trifascialis, Chaetodon plebeius and Chaetodon rainfordi, all of which are obligate hard-coral feeders. In contrast, there was no significant change in the abundance of Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon aureofasciatus, Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon melannotus or Chaetodon vagabundus, which are much less reliant on scleractinian coral for food. Clearly, extensive coral depletion, such as that caused by severe coral bleaching, can have a major effect on the abundance of butterflyfishes. Specific responses of butterflyfishes varied according to their reliance on hard corals for food and their ability to utilize alternate prey types.",Journal of Fish Biology,,,,,,,

The paper applies a new approach to the indexing of waterbird populations (Underhill \& Pr -s-Jones 1994) to monthly counts for 11 species of coastal wintering waders obtained over 21 years of the Birds of Estuaries Enquiry (BoEE). 2. An examination of the month factors produced by the indexing methodology, in conjunction with the levels of coverage achieved in different months, suggested that the most appropriate grouping of months for winter index numbers was December-February. In addition, a series of index numbers for January alone was also produced for each species, in order to facilitate comparison of results with those from the previous approach to indexing BoEE data and because most other countries restrict their counts of wintering waders to this month. 3. Of the 11 species considered, the winter index numbers for two, grey plover Pluvialis squatarola L. and oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus L., revealed sustained increases over the period, by c. 600\% and 75\%, respectively. No species showed a sustained decrease, but short-term decreases, subsequently partially reversed, were particularly pronounced for dunlin Calidris alpina (L.) and knot Calidris canutus (L.). 4. The importance of good knowledge of the biology of the species under con- sideration for intelligent interpretation is stressed, in particular because varying proportions (c. 25-95 \% ) of their United Kingdom wintering populations contribute to the index numbers, and because for none can the United Kingdom wintering population be considered closed",Journal of applied ecology,,,,,,,

No significant population trends were detectable, mainly because of the short time-series and large spatial and inter-annual variation in the number of breeding pairs in the colonies monitored. However, the breeding success of all three penguin species has improved slightly over the last few years, indicating a potential for increasing populations in the near future. During the breeding season, all three penguin species preyed opportunistically on a mixture of fish, squid and crustaceans. Diet composition too showed a high degree of spatial and temporal variation. However, in all three penguin species studied, squid gradually disappeared from the diet over successive years, to be replaced by fish. Coincidentally, the commercial catches of the squid species Loligo gahi in Falkland Islands waters decreased and the by-catch of nototheniid fish increased. All three penguin species compete directly with the commercial fishing fleet for L. gahi; however, there may also be competition for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), hake (Merluccius sp.) and southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis), because juveniles of these species were found regularly in penguin diets.",Polar Biology,,,,,,,

In 125 locations, clear signs of breeding activity were found. An additional 10 presumably active territories were detected but it was not possible to locate the exact position of the nests and confirm the breeding. Based on this, it is concluded that the national breeding population is not less than 135 breeding pairs. The present distribution can be compared with previous reports with the exception of the area along the Ilova and Lonja rivers that have never been reported as an important breeding site. Analysis of the characteristics of 138 nest positions as well as preferences/avoidance of specific structural features were performed. The results showed that white-tailed eagles prefer to build their nests on pedunculate oaks, narrow-leafed ash and white poplars with the greatest preference for mature trees with a diameter above 92.5 cm. The minimal distance between two active pairs was 348 meters. More than 50\% of the national population breed less than two km from a large water area and 95\% of the population less than four km. More than 95\% of the population breed at altitudes lower than 140 m above sea level and are further than one km away from the nearest human settlement, regardless of the availability of forests. According to several parameters (distance to a large water area, elevation, forest presence, distance to the nearest settlement, distance to highways and railways) geographic information system (GIS) helped to determine potential white-tailed eagle breeding areas.",Biologia,,,,,,,

Fruit pulp is widely cited as a major food resource for these birds, which often eat seeds and nectar. In this study, I assessed flower and fruit production at a gallery forest in the Pantanal flood plain (Brazil) in order to evaluate the relationship between food resource production and abundance of a common parakeet, Brotogeris chiriri. Also, I evaluated the relationship between food resource production and foraging activity. Parakeet abundance varied markedly along the year, coinciding with massive episodes of flower and fleshy fruit availability. Inga vera nectar, intensely used during the latter part of dry season, was by far the most exploited food item by parakeets when they were very abundant. The nectar comprised 34\% of the parakeets' diet (N = 131 feeding records) at the gallery forest, while fleshy fruits made up the rest. Parakeets principally exploited fruits of Cecropia pachystachya and Ficus luschnathiana, besides palm fruits and Inga vera arils. The consistent relationship between foraging activity and parakeet abundance, as well as the coincidence between fluctuations of these parameters and availability of major food resources, suggests that food availability mostly influenced B. chiriri occurrence in the gallery forest. Furthermore, I found no evidence for gallery forest use for roosting and/or breeding, in spite of the fact that such factors usually influence local parakeet abundance.",Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia,,,,,,,

This encounter rate was significantly lower than that reported for surveys conducted in 2002. Two recently hatched nests, both on the same beach, were found during nest counts; no nests were found on other beaches known to have routinely yielded nests in the past. The number of nests found in this study is 4- to 10-fold lower than those reported from 1994 to 2004, suggesting a reduction in breeding females in the Turneffe Atoll crocodile population. Development of two important nesting beaches on Blackbird Cay since 2004 has likely rendered these habitats unsuitable for future nesting. The combination of low crocodile encounter rates, reduced nesting activity and human alteration of known nesting beaches observed in this study suggests a possible decline in the C. acutus population in Turneffe Atoll. Continued population assessments will be essential in monitoring the status of C. acutus in Turneffe Atoll, and immediate management and conservation efforts should be made to protect beaches on Blackbird, Calabash, and Northern Cays to provide critical nesting habitat for crocodiles.",Herpetological Bulletin,,,,,,,

Green",Long-term population trends of colonial wading birds breeding in do\~{n}ana (Sw Spain) in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors,"Breeding season counts of nine species of colonial wading birds (Nycticorax nycticorax, Ardeola ralloides, Bubulcus ibis, Egretta garzetta, Ardea cinerea, Ardea purpurea, Ciconia ciconia, Plegadis falcinellus and Platalea leucorodia) nesting at Do\~{n}ana during 1984–2010 were analysed. The aim of the study was to assess the size and trends of populations and to analyse their environmental and anthropogenic determinants. We used the TRIM programme to test for long-term trends, and Generalised Additive Models to assess the effect of local rainfall, the surface area of ricefields surrounding Do\~{n}ana and rainfall in the Sahel on breeding population size. All species showed positive population trends, mainly from 1996 onwards. The number of active colonies increased over time, and up to 17,297 nests from the nine studied species were recorded in one year (2010). Low precipitation (< 500 mm) in the previous autumn and winter was associated with reductions in the numbers of breeders, since rainfall determines the flooding extent in the natural marshes of Do\~{n}ana. The area of ricefields positively influenced the breeding numbers of five species. Only four of these species are considered to be increasing in Europe and increases in Do\~{n}ana coincide with management changes that have improved nesting and feeding habitat and reduced human disturbance. In addition to large-scale man-made habitat changes, breeding population sizes for the studied species were strongly influenced by high annual variation in rainfall, typical of Mediterranean habitats, therefore making them likely to be affected by climate change.",Ardeola,,,,,,,

An annual monitoring was performed since 1988. It took 12 years to the population size to reach the number of marmots released. Afterwards the population doubled every 7 years, despite several population crashes (in 1997 and 2001). The currently censused 492 marmots were distributed into 86 sites on an area of about 200 km2 in 2007. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis of demographic and environmental parameters of each site showed that marmots preferred, these last years, anthropogenic sites (meadows, dry stone walls, elevation under 1200 m) where reproduction rate was highest. Thus, marmots are now competing with farmers for space. In the same time, tourism increased strongly, especially tourism related to marmot spotting. The interactions between the presence of marmots in this agricultural environment and human activities are described, and their consequences are considered in the context of the sustainable development of the M\'{e}zenc Massif.",Ethology Ecology \& Evolution,,,,,,,

Accurate nest counts for this species are problematic owing to their extremely prolonged breeding seasons, high nest failure rates, turnover of individuals at nest-sites, replacement laying and biennial breeding. We conducted repeated complete censuses of Ascension Frigatebird eggs at the species\^{O}\c{C}\""{O} sole colony of Boatswainbird Island, and collected data on laying phenology and nest survival rates within sample quadrats, throughout the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons. We used these data to develop an individual-based model that predicted the number of Frigatebird nests present on each day an actual census occurred assuming an arbitrary 1000 breeding females bred there. We then divided the number of nests counted in these virtual censuses by 1000 to quantify bias, and used this figure to correct real census totals. The model revealed that the population numbered c. 6250 breeding females and c. 9350 mature females in 2001-2, and that numbers have not changed significantly since the late 1950s. Productivity, at 0.34 chicks/pair, was high compared to previous studies of Ascension Frigatebirds and most of those of congeners elsewhere",Ibis,,,,,,,

Differences in the overall abundances were studied at three sites in the??NW Mediterranean Sea for three years, to examine whether: 1) the adult population determined the number of successful nests; 2) the number of successful nests determined recruitment levels; 3)??recruitment levels were subsequently related to the number of young of the year (YOY) joining the population after the recruitment period; and 4) the YOY value determined the size of the year class 1 cohort in the following year's adult reproductive population. The results show that there was a significant relationship between the number of spawners and the number of successful nests. However, the number of successful nests does not always correlate well with recruitment level. Furthermore, recruitment levels are not good indicators of the Young of the Year (measured three months after settlement) in number joining the populations, though YOY in number was related to the strength of the year class joining the adult reproductive population the following year. Therefore, the magnitude of the recruitment and probably the size of the adult population did not determine the year-class strength in S.??roissali. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of the two studies were subsequently combined since they were found to be complementary. In addition, in England during 1984 and 1985, large numbers of ‘toadlets’ were marked so that they could be identified if recaptured as breeding adults.The degree of relocation between ponds was negatively correlated to the distance between ponds. The proportion of both males and females that moved between ponds within a particular year was significantly less than the proportion relocating between years. In any year, between 79\% and 96\% of adults that survived to breed the following year, returned to the original pond. Similarly, of the toadlets marked during1984–85, 81\% of the males that subsequently returned as breeding adults were captured in their pond of origin.Isolation, in relation to both population dynamics and population genetics, is defined and its implications for the management of common toad populatins discussed.","Breeding pond fidelity in the common toad, Bufo bufo",,,,,,,

In birds, and particularly amphibians, these declines are a global phenomenon whose causes are often unclear. Among reptiles, snakes are top predators and therefore a decline in their numbers may have serious consequences for the functioning of many ecosystems. Our results show that, of 17 snake populations (eight species) from the UK, France, Italy, Nigeria and Australia, 11 have declined sharply over the same relatively short period of time with five remaining stable and one showing signs of a marginal increase. Although the causes of these declines are currently unknown, we suspect that they are multi-faceted (such as habitat quality deterioration, prey availability), and with a common cause, e.g. global climate change, at their root.",Biology letters,,,,,,,
1869,"Real, Joan and Ma\~{n}osa, Santi",Demography and conservation of Western European Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus populations,"The basic demographic parameters of six Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus populations in Spain and France were calculated from field data obtained in the last 15 years. Average annual productivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.24 young/pair and average annual adult survival from 84\% to 96\%. Preadult survival (from fledging to recruitment) was estimated at 10\%. All the populations were declining at annual rates ranging from -7.3 to -1.1\%. Although no statistically significant disagreement was observed between the predictions of a Leslie matrix model fitted to the population parameters and the real trends, some populations declined faster and others more slowly than expected. These differences were interpreted as a result of differential emigration, recruitment rates or preadult survival not accounted for by the model. Since the intrinsic population growth rate was about four times less sensitive to changes in preadult survival than to changes in adult survival, and about ten times less sensitive to changes in fecundity and predispersal survival, conservation efforts must be primarily directed towards increasing adult and preadult survival. Power line casualties and direct persecution must be eliminated in order to reduce mortality. Priorities on research should address dispersal, mortality and habitat relationships involving these two parameters. Monitoring should be extended to other populations.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

In 1973 the Department of Agriculture of Peru (INRENA) prohibited commercial hunting in the Peruvian Amazon, and the giant otter was included in Appendix I of CITES. From 1973 to 2004 giant otter populations experienced a slow recovery in numerous rivers of the Peruvian Amazon. Here, we report the population growth of the giant otter on the Yavar\'{\i}- Mir\'{\i}n and Yavar Rivers in north-east Peru. The first evaluations of giant otter populations in these rivers, in which no individuals were sighted, were in 1992-1993. During surveys in 1996 and 1997 two individuals were sighted. In 2001, 19 individuals were sighted and in 2003 and 2004, 41 individuals were observed. This increase demonstrates a slow recovery and shows that the population has not yet reached its carrying capacity. The prohibition of international trade in otter skins by CITES, supported by INRENA, helped the population recover and was important in the conservation of this species. © 2009 Fauna \& Flora International.",Oryx,,,,,,,

1874,"Regehr, E.V. and Lunn, N J and Amstrup, S C and Stirling, I",Effects of earlier sea ice breakup on survival and population size of polar bears in Western Hudson Bay,"Some of the most pronounced ecological responses to climatic warming are expected to occur in polar marine regions, where temperature increases have been the greatest and sea ice provides a sensitive mechanism by which climatic conditions affect sympagic (i.e., with ice) species. Population-level effects of climatic change, however, remain difficult to quantify. We used a flexible extension of Cormack-Jolly- Seber capture-recapture models to estimate population size and survival for polar bears (Ursus maritimus), one of the most ice-dependent of Arctic marine mammals. We analyzed data for polar bears captured from 1984 to 2004 along the western coast of Hudson Bay and in the community of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. TheWestern Hudson Bay polar bear population declined from 1,194 (95\% CI�1,020-1,368) in 1987 to 935 (95\% CI�794-1,076) in 2004. Total apparent survival of prime-adult polar bears (5-19 yr) was stable for females (0.93; 95\% CI �0.91-0.94) and males (0.90; 95\% CI�0.88-0.91). Survival of juvenile, subadult, and senescent-adult polar bears was correlated with spring sea ice breakup date, which was variable among years and occurred approximately 3 weeks earlier in 2004 than in 1984. We propose that this correlation provides evidence for a causal association between earlier sea ice breakup (due to climatic warming) and decreased polar bear survival. It may also explain why Churchill, like other communities along the western coast of Hudson Bay, has experienced an increase in human-polar bear interactions in recent years. Earlier sea ice breakup may have resulted in a larger number of nutritionally stressed polar bears, which are encroaching on human habitations in search of supplemental food. Because western Hudson Bay is near the southern limit of the species' range, our findings may foreshadow the demographic responses and management challenges that more northerly polar bear populations will experience if climatic warming in the Arctic continues as projected.",Journal of Wildlife Management,,,,,,,

Reviews results from a comprehensive ground survey which assessed environmental factors (surface water, fire scars, type and greenness of vegetation), counted wildlife and livestock, and recorded human presence (including vehicles and garbage) and associated land uses in the Mara Ecosystem in southwestern Kenya 9-16 November 2002. Data derived from this survey, which covered about 40\% of the ecosystem, was compared with data from an aerial wildlife count flown the following week and data collected during an initial November 1999 ground survey that had covered about 80\% of the survey area. 1999 was a much drier year that 2002 and effects of rainfall differences were particularly evident in the higher quantity and quality of browse and grasses, the presence of surface water, the dispersal of both wild and domestic animals but fewer recent fire scars. 820 elephant were counted in 2002. The majority were the reserve areas, very few in the group ranches. Actual numbers were: in the ranches; Koyiaki 112, Ol Choor Oiowua 1, and other ranches 15; and, in the reserve area Musiara 64, Sakanumi 383 and Mara Triangle 245). Most of the elephant were in the southern part of Masai Mara NR well away from the northern boundary where cattle are grazed. A number of elephant were along water courses as would be expected at this time of year, numbers were particularly high along the Ol Keja Gem River. The authors suggest the land use pattern here is not sustainable from either the wildlife management perspective (the population trend for most species is downward), or the pastoralist's perspective as these people are unable to run enough stock to maintain economic needs. Information is needed and monitoring should continue, but as importantly is the need for communiction between all stakeholders.",\ldots Livestock Research \ldots,,,,,,,

Nest density and arctic fox den occupancy strongly influenced Canada Goose nest success. High nest density resulted in higher nest success and high den occupancy reduced nest success. Nest success was not influenced by lemming abundance in the current or previous year as predicted by the ""bird-lemming"" hypothesis. Reducing arctic fox abundance through targeted management increased nest survival of Canada Geese; a result that further emphasizes the importance of arctic fox as nest predators in this system. The spatial distribution of nest predators, at least for dispersed-nesting geese, may be most important for nest survival, regardless of the abundance of small mammals in the local ecosystem. Further understanding of the factors influencing the magnitude and variance in arctic fox abundance in this region, and the spatial scale at which these factors are realized, is necessary to fully explain predator-prey-alternative prey dynamics in this system. © 2011 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",The Wilson Journal of Ornithology,,,,,,,

1897,"Robards, Martin D. and Piatt, John F. and Kettle, Arthur B. and Abookire, Alisa a.","Temporal and geographic variation in fish communities of lower Cook Inlet, Alaska","–Nearshore and shelf fish communities were studied in three ar- eas of lower Cook Inlet, Alaska: the Barren Islands (oceanic and well-mixed waters), Kachemak Bay (mixed oceanic waters with significant freshwater run- off), and Chisik Island (estuarine wa- ters). Fish were sampled with beach seines (n=413 sets) and midwater trawls (n=39 sets). We found that lower Cook Inlet supported a diverse near- shore fish community of at least 52 spe- cies. Fifty of these species were caught in Kachemak Bay, 24 at Chisik Island, and 12 at the Barren Islands. Pacific sand lance dominated Barren Islands and Kachemak Bay nearshore habitats, comprising 99\% and 71\% of total indi- viduals, respectively. The nearshore Chisik Island fish community was not dominated by any one species; instead it exhibited higher diversity. These spa- tial differences appeared linked to lo- cal oceanographic regimes and sedi- ment influx. Analysis of historical data revealed that the nearshore Kachemak Bay fish community changed signifi- cantly between 1976 and 1996, show- ing increased diversity and abundance in several taxa, notably gadids, salmo- nids, pleuronectids, and sculpins. Decadal differences appeared to be re- lated to large-scale climate changes in the North Pacific. Catches of most taxa peaked in May–August, and were low during other months of the year. Sev- eral species were present for only part of the summer. Species composition of seine catches differed significantly be- tween consecutive high and low tides, but not between consecutive sets or years. Midwater trawls took 26 species, 14 of which were present in Kachemak Bay, 19 near Chisik Island, and 7 at the Barren Islands. Community structures in shelf and nearshore waters were similar: diversity was high and abun- dance low at Chisik Island, whereas a few abundant species dominated at both Kachemak Bay and the Barren Islands. In addition, the low fish abun- dance near Chisik Island appeared to be related to declining seabird numbers at this colony.",Fishery Bulletin,,,,,,,

1901,"Robertson, Gregory J. and Gilchrist, Grant and Mallory, Mark L.",Colony dynamics and persistence of ivory gull breeding in Canada,"Despite the importance of assessing the viability of small and endangered populations, often few demographic data are available. However, when counts are available from discrete sites, a colony- or site-based approach can be useful. We used recent counts of Ivory Gull, Pagophila eburnea, a rare species that breeds at remote sites in the high Arctic, to model colony dynamics and population persistence. Dramatic declines in numbers of pairs nesting in Canada led to the uplisting of this species to Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada in 2006. Colonies continued to decline from 2004 to 2006, with sites at the southern edge of the breeding range on Baffin Island almost completely extirpated; only one pair remained in 2005 and 2006. We used colony counts at 24 sites on southern Ellesmere Island and Devon Island from 2002 to 2006 to model extinction and colonization rates. Extinction rates were high at 0.735 ± 0.077 (mean ± SE) and increased for smaller colonies. Colonization rates were low at 0.189 ± 0.054 (mean ± SE), new colonies were small (mean: 7.7 pairs), and there was no evidence of local rescue effects from nearby colonies. Based on these rates, a population projection model was constructed using a starting population of 225 pairs at the 24 sites. The projected population reached an equilibrium of approximately 30 pairs in only 8 yr. The large and isolated colony on Seymour Island has declined at 2.7\%/yr (95\% confidence limits: –13.9, 8.5) since 1974, and had low but wide-ranging probabilities of going extinct within 20 yr. The suggestion that Ellesmere Island may be the only site where breeding Ivory Gull will persist in the future is supported by the recent discovery of new colonies there in 2006.",Avian Conservation and Ecology,,,,,,,

Harbour seal counts at haul-out sites ranged from 389 to 659 individuals in the Estuary compared with 890 individuals for the regions surveyed in the Gulf. Assuming that the haul-out behaviour of harbour seals in our study area is similar to harbour seals in the eastern Pacific, where it has been estimated that about 50-75\% of seals are hauled out during surveys, there may be approximately 4000-5000 harbour seals in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Trend analyses of the abundance of harbour seals in the Estuary since 1994 were inconclusive, owing to the small number of surveys available for the analyses.A total of 111 to 723 grey seals were counted at haul-out sites in the Estuary, far fewer than the 2474 grey seals that were observed during the two surveys of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. No attempt was made to correct for the animals in the water. Haul-out counts varied widely between years, suggesting between-year changes in the use of this area by grey seals.",Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,,,,,,,

At the Barra da Tijuca beach, in Rio de Janeiro city an estimate of the population abundance made in 1991, compared to a previous estimate made in 1984, showed a considerable decrease (about 65\%). Most of the decrease was attributed to anthropic disturbances that locally affected the beach vegetation, the species habitat. In this study we present estimates made in 2002 and in 2006 at the same area and compare them with the estimates of 1984 and 1991, using the same methodology in order to make comparable the data from different samplings years and to evaluate the present status of the local population. The estimated indexes of L. lutzae abundance in 2002 and in 2006 were higher than that of 1991. There was a significant increase in the mean number of recorded lizards in 2002 compared to 1991, but the mean number of lizards sighted in 2006 remained stable when compared with that of 2002. Our data based on the index of abundance recorded suggested that the number of L. lutzae at Barra da Tijuca beach recorded increased, which can be indicative of a potential recovery of the local population.",Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper was to survey and monitor waterfowl population at the largest natural lake of the Area of Environmen- tal Protection of Lagoa Santa, Southeast Brazil. The Lagoa do Sumidouro holds approximately 253 ha with a 12,072 m of perimeter. Species richness and abundance was estimated from June 1999 to December 2002. It was recorded 27 species of 12 families. Twelve species were considered residents, while eight migratory and another seven species did not present any seasonal pattern. Ardeidae was the most representative family holding 23\% of the species followed by Anatidae (15\%) and Socolopacidae (11\%). Platalea ajaja Linnaeus, 1758 is considered threat- ened to extinction, while Mycteria americana Linnaeus, 1758 and Ciconia maguari (Gmelin, 1789) are considered rare for the state of Minas Gerais. There was no difference of species richness among the three main seasons (wet, dry, and transitional). Species diversity was higher during the wet season.

1913,"Rogers, Danny and Hassell, Chris and Oldland, Jo and Clemens, Rob and Boyle, Adrian and Rogers, Ken","Monitoring Yellow Sea Migrants in Australia (MYSMA): North-western Australian shorebird surveys and workshops, December 2008.","In non-breeding season, North-western Australia is home to more migratory shorebirds than any other region in Australia and arguably in the East Asian – Australasian flyway. The most important two sites in north-western Australia are Roebuck Bay and Eighty-mile Beach, both of which are designated as Ramsar areas. This report presents findings from workshops and extensive shorebird and waterbird surveys carried out in north-western Australia in December 2008. The workshops were carried out to provide shorebird counters with further training in identification and monitoring, with particular emphasis on counting shorebirds at sites with very large numbers of shorebirds. The workshops consisted of two days of lectures and field sessions, after which participants gained extensive practical experience by joining one of the north-western Australian surveys carried out twice each summer by the Monitoring Yellow Sea Migrants in Australia (MYSMA) project. With the unusually large team available - six international participants from China and South Korea, ten participants from the Shorebirds 2020 project, and the usual MYSMA team of c. 10 Broome residents and contractors – we had the resources to carry out unusually extensive surveys. In addition to monitoring the regularly counted MYSMA sites at Roebuck Bay (northern beaches and Bush Point) and a 60 km stretch of Eighty-mile Beach, it was also possible count all 225 km of Eighty-mile Beach, to carry out the first ground counts of the 130 km stretch of coastline that separates Eighty-mile Beach and Roebuck Bay, and a number of sites around Broome and on the west coast of the Dampier Peninsula (including two areas that have been proposed as potential sites for an LNG hub). Our surveys confirmed that Eighty-mile Beach and Roebuck Bay are the most important shorebird sites in north-western Australia. Several “new” sites were found to have internationally significant numbers of shorebirds or terns: six species occurred in internationally significant numbers between Roebuck Bay and Eighty-mile Beach, including internationally significant numbers o f Little Tern at Dessault Bay, and Sanderling and Greater Sand Plover at Jack’s Creek. The latter two species were also found in internationally significant numbers on the Indian Ocean beaches immediately adjacent to, or just north, of the town of Broome. Our surveys demonstrated that shorebird numbers have declined on Eighty-mile Beach since the last complete summer surveys were carried out there in 1999 and 2001, and within the MYSMA study area since the MYSMA program began in 2004. The scale of the declines was deeply worrying: of the 15 most common coastal shorebird species in the region, 12 have undergone detectable declines, and for some of these species, the declines are considerable: at Eighty-mile Beach, for example, four species have declined by more than 50\% in the last 7-9 years. The declines observed in north-western Australia cannot be attributed easily to local habitat changes, as they occurred at sites which are remote and almost pristine. Rather, they reflect flyway-wide population declines. The most likely cause of these flyway-wide declines is habitat loss in the staging areas; in particular the tidal flats of the Yellow Sea, a crucial staging area for large numbers of staging shorebirds from Australia, are rapidly being lost to land claim projects. The most topical of these reclamations has been at Saemangeum, South Korea. Of the five species predicted to decline in Australia as a result of the Saemangeum reclamation, five showed an abrupt decline in at least some of our study areas in the two years following closure of the Saemangeum sea-wall. Recommendations for further analyses to assess whether these changes were coincidental are recommended in the report. In view of the importance of north-western Australian shorebird surveys, both in meeting monitoring obligations under the Ramsar treaty, and as a barometer of the health of flyway populations, we recommend that annual surveys of north-western Australia should be continued. We also emphasise the importance of increasing the repeatability of Eighty-mile Beach surveys by extending coverage so that all of the beach is surveyed.  These count data are noteworthy for several of the most abundant species of Eighty-mile Beach:   Bar-tailed Godwit numbers have declined markedly, and the population is now only 46.9\% of that in 1999-2001. No complete counts have been anywhere near as low as the estimates made from extrapolations of partial counts made in the 1980’s. This is a readily identified species for which we consider our counts to be particularly reliable.   Common Greenshank counts made in 2008 were slightly higher than any in the past. This may have been related to the very dry conditions, preventing this species from dispersing to inland freshwater wetlands. Curlew Sandpiper counts appear to have declined since 2001.  Curlew Sandpiper counts have been declining throughout Australia for some time (Gosbell and Clemens 2006). However it is difficult to assess the significance of the apparent decline at Eighty-mile Beach. Previous counts were made in October and November, and there is banding data indicating that there are Curlew Sandpipers in north-western Australia at this time which are staging en route to non-breeding grounds in southern Australia.   Eastern Curlew counts have declined to 59.7\% of their levels in 1999. Great Knot counts have declined since the very consistent counts of 1999 and 2001. The 23.9\% decline in numbers (to 76.1\% of former levels) corresponds closely with the 23.9\% decline in overall non-breeding populations predicted as a result of the loss of 90,000 birds from the former staging grounds in Saemangeum, South Korea. Greater Sand Plover has declined markedly, and the population is now only 35.4\% of that in 1999-2001. This is another species for which we consider our counts to be particularly reliable, as it typically roosts in small scattered flocks on upper beach stretches which are easily found and counted.   Grey Plover counts were 72.3\% of their levels in 2001.   Grey-tailed Tattler counts declined to 54.3\% of their levels in 2001. However it should be borne in mind that the 1999 and 2001 counts for Grey-tailed Tattler were rather different. In addition, 8km of beach was not counted in 2008, mostly behind headlands between 155-170 km S of the Anna Plains access track. Although this was not a bird-rich region of the beach, headland habitats are more suitable for Grey-tailed Tattlers than they are for most shorebird species. Counts of Little Curlew, Oriental Plover and Oriental Pratincole were quite different to those made on previous surveys. As noted above, the numbers of these species roosting on Eighty-mile Beach is greatly affected by weather conditions.  Pied Oystercatcher numbers apparently increased slightly between 2001 and 2008. It is not known if this was influenced by the slightly different times of year at which the surveys were made; this species nests in north-western Australia and adjacent off-shore islands, and counts may be influenced by roaming subadult birds.   Red Knot counts have declined to 77.9\% of their levels in 2001. No complete ground counts have ever come close to finding the 80,000 Red Knots reported on Eighty-mile Beach following extrapolation of partial counts in the early 1980’s. The estimate of 80,000 is still used in estimates of the flyway population of Red Knots (Bamford et al. 2008), and it is in urgent need of review.   Red-capped Plover counts were considerably higher than those in 1999 and 2001. This might have been related to the dry conditions forcing this resident species from inland freshwater wetlands.   Numbers of Red-necked Stints and Sanderling were higher than in the 1999 and 2001 surveys. For both species, estimates of abundance made in the early 1980’s are very different to totals observed during complete ground counts since 1999. Ruddy Turnstone counts were intermediate between those counted between 1999 and 2001 – the only common migrant species on Eighty-mile Beach for which was the case.   Terek Sandpiper counts have declined to 47.1\% of their levels in 2001. This species might have been undercounted in the incompletely surveyed coastal stretch from 155-170 km s of the Anna Plains access point; like Grey-tailed Tattler, this species may find headland roosts to be more suitable than do most shorebird species. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the decline (>5,000 birds) is such that we consider it unlikely that it can be explained solely by these short stretches of incompletely surveyed beach. Whimbrel numbers have increased, but this species remains uncommon on Eighty-mile Beach.  Overall, the picture from the December 2008 surveys was of a decline in numbers of migratory shorebirds. Excluding species which only forage inland and only roost on Eighty-mile Beach to avoid hot weather (Oriental Plover, Oriental Pratincole, Little Curlew), 12 migratory shorebird species regularly occur on Eighty-mile Beach in their thousands. Of these, three have increased slightly (Common Greenshank, Red-necked Stint, Sanderling); one has remained reasonably consistent numbers (Ruddy Turnstone), and seven have undergone very substantial decreases. The number of shorebirds which feed on the intertidal flats has decreased from 408,037 in 1999 and 430,923 in 2001 to 292,301 shorebirds in 2008.",,,,,,,,

1915,"Rolland, Virginie and Weimerskirch, Henri and Barbraud, Christophe",Relative influence of fisheries and climate on the demography of four albatross species,"Worldwide ecosystems are modified by human activities and climate change. To be able to predict future changes, it is necessary to understand their respective role on population dynamics. Among the most threatened species are top predators because of their position in the food web. Albatross populations are potentially affected by both human activities, especially longline fisheries, and climatic fluctuations. Based on long-term data (1985–2006), we conducted through a comparative approach a demographic analysis (adult survival and breeding success) on four albatross species breeding on the Indian Ocean sub-Antarctic Islands to assess the relative impact of climate and fisheries during and outside the breeding season. The study revealed that adult survival of almost all species was not affected by climate, and therefore probably canalized against climatic variations, but was negatively affected by tuna longlining effort in three species. Breeding success was affected by climate, with contrasted effects between species, with Southern Oscillation Index having an impact on all species but one. Differences in demographic responses depended on the foraging zone and season. In order to predict population trajectories of seabirds such as albatrosses, our results show the importance of assessing the relative influence of fishing and climate impacts on demography.

Although formerly abundant and widely distributed, the species has not been recorded in nature since 1988. To determine its population status, data from intensive surveys in 1999-2001 are compared with those from 1967 and 1981. Presence-absence data from several localities also are reported. Temperature and precipitation between 1891 and 1999 were analyzed to determine whether these correlate with population trends. Atelopus ignescens was abundant in 1967 at Paramo de Guaman\'{\i} (47 individuals recorded in 120 pers/min) and in 1981 at Paramo del Antisana (up to 0.75 individuals/m2). In the 1999-2001 surveys, A. ignescens was absent despite considerably higher survey efforts. The presence-absence data at several localities also indicate a dramatic decline. Before 1988, A. ignescens was present during 64\% of the visits to sites throughout its range. After 1988, A. ignescens was absent at all sites. The results strongly suggest that A. ignescens is extinct. Climatic data show that 1987, the year previous to the last record of A. ignescens, was particularly warm and dry. The reasons for the decline in pristine areas remain unclear, although the available information suggests that a combination of factors such as pathogens and unusual weather conditions may have played an important role. /// El sapo jambato, Atelopus ignescens es end\'{e}mico de bosques montanos, valles interandinos, y p\'{a}ramos del Ecuador.

1920,"Spray, Christopher and Rowell, H. E.",The Mute Swan Cygnus olor (Britain and Ireland populations) in Britain and Northern Ireland 1960/61 – 2000/01,"Reproduced by permission of the Wildfowl \& Wetlands Trust. This report aims to describe changes in the abundance and distribution of the Mute Swan Cygnus olor in Britain and Northern Ireland since 1960/61, to compile available historical information, to provide current estimates of population size, to review published data on the ecology and biology of this species, and to describe numbers, trends and site use at the key resorts in Britain and Northern Ireland. The Mute Swan has the most southerly breeding range of the Eurasian swans. The species has a fragmented distribution, with seven recognised populations. Many birds live in areas that are mild enough for them not to have to migrate to other areas during the non-breeding season. Birds in Britain and Ireland are largely sedentary and are considered to comprise two discrete populations. The British population remained fairly stable, at around 20,000 birds, from the late 1960s to the mid- 1980s. Since the late 1980s there has been a large increase in numbers. A national census during the breeding season in 2002 estimated the population at 31,700, whilst analysis of winter counts from the late 1990s suggested a figure of 37,500. The Irish population increased in size between the 1970s and mid-1980s, since when the population has become more stable. The all-Ireland total is estimated to number 10,000, although some have suggested it may be as high as 19,000-20,000. A possible reason for the increase in population is the incidence of lead poisoning. In the late 1970s lead poisoning was shown to be the largest single cause of Mute Swan deaths in England. However, since the ban on the use of lead fishing weights in 1987 and the changes imposed on shooting in England and Wales, the number of deaths from lead poisoning has reduced greatly. Mild winters are also likely to have contributed to the general increase in swan numbers. In Ireland, however, lead still remains a problem. In Britain and Ireland, the Mute Swan is widespread on lowland wetland habitats such as slow-flowingrivers, lakes, ponds and estuaries. It also occurs on man-made wetlands (e.g. gravel pits), and in urban areas. In Britain, the greatest numbers of breeding birds are found in central, eastern and southern counties. They are largely absent from many northerly and westerly areas where high ground predominates although they flourish in the southern Western Isles and Orkney. Here, the highest breeding densities occur in lowland river basins and in isolated areas. In Northern Ireland, the highest numbers of breeding birds are found in the east parts, particularly around Loughs Neagh \& Beg. The pondweeds Potamogeton, Myriophyllum and Chara are important food resources in freshwater habitats. In brackish and saltwater areas, eelgrass Zostera, tasselweeds Ruppia and various green algae are the main sources of food. Agricultural crops (oilseed rape, grasses, cereals and potatoes) are becoming increasingly important in certain areas. The species has a close association with humans, and supplementary feeding has become important in many areas. During 1996–2000, 19 sites in Britain were internationally important for the Mute Swan, regularly supporting at least 260 birds during the non-breeding season. Four sites in Northern Ireland were internationally important, holding 100 or more birds, during the same period. Information on numbers, trends and site use at these key resorts are provided within this review. Future monitoring should include the collection of demographic data to generate scientifically-robust assessments of abundance, productivity, survival and movements over a range of spatial scales. Such integrated population monitoring should be developed with the aim of understanding the population dynamics of this species. Survey during late summer is irregular, and consequently the importance of some sites for moulting birds may not be recognised. The instigation of a regular nationwide survey of Mute Swan moult flocks is recommended.",,,,,,,,

1924,"Ruetz, Carl R. and Trexler, Joel C. and Jordan, Frank and Loftus, William F. and Perry, Sue a.",Population dynamics of wetland fishes: Spatio-temporal patterns synchronized by hydrological disturbance?,"1. Drought is a natural disturbance that can cause widespread mortality of aquatic organisms in wetlands. We hypothesized that seasonal drying of marsh surfaces (i.e. hydrological disturbance) shapes spatio-temporal patterns of fish populations. 2. We tested whether population dynamics of fishes were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (Moran effect) or distance separating study sites (dispersal). Spatio-temporal patterns were examined in local populations of five abundant species at 17 sites (sampled five times per year from 1996 to 2001) in a large oligotrophic wetland. 3. Fish densities differed significantly across spatio-temporal scales for all species. For all species except eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a significant portion of spatio-temporal variation in density was attributed to drying events (used as a covariate). 4. We observed three patterns of response to hydrological disturbance. Densities of bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei), least killifish (Heterandria formosa), and golden topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus) were usually lowest after a dry down and recovered slowly. Eastern mosquitofish showed no distinct response to marsh drying (i.e. they recovered quickly). Flagfish (Jordanella floridae) density was often highest after a dry down and then declined. Population growth after a dry down was often asymptotic for bluefin killifish and golden topminnow, with greatest asymptotic density and longest time to recovery at sites that dried infrequently. 5. Fish population dynamics were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (independent of distance) and distance separating study sites (independent of hydrological disturbance). Our ability to separate the relative importance of the Moran effect from dispersal was strengthened by a weak association between hydrological synchrony and distance among study sites. Dispersal was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of flagfish, whereas hydrological disturbance was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of the other species examined. 6. Species varied in the relative role of the Moran effect and dispersal in homogenizing their population dynamics, probably as a function of life history and ability to exploit dry-season refugia.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

In 1983, the site had a significantly higher abundance of fishes, particularly those considered to be favoured targets of fishermen (e.g. serranids, lutjanids, lethrinids), than similar sites which were fished. Abundances were estimated by visual census within the reserve and at 3 control sites.

We conducted 11 surveys over three years to estimate abundance at each survey as well as survival and the probability of individuals becoming unavailable for detection between surveys. We utilized novel mark–resight estimators to account for the detection process in estimating these parameters. Annual survival was 0.977 (0.040 SE) and movement in (0.060) and out (0.018) of an observable state was low. We estimated abundance at 84.5 (95\% CI¼77.9–91.2) with little change over our surveys. We also estimated recruitment and population growth rate for the marked, and presumably older, individuals by estimating seniority using a reverse-time model. Seniority was estimated at 0.999 (0.028 SE), recruitment at 0.001 and population growth rate at 0.978. Although the population size appears to be stable, we believe this represents the slow disappearance of a long-lived animal with no recruitment. Along with the isolated nature of the population and reduced population size as compared to historical estimates, we believe this population is in serious threat of extirpation. We believe there may be as few as 7 or 8 animals in Lao PDR and that the species is at risk of extinction there in the short-term. Although recent management actions (e.g., outlawing of explosive fishing and some restriction on the use of gill-nets) have likely been beneficial we believe identifying population goals to work towards, identifying additional management actions to improve recruitment, and designing the survey methods to best estimate the success of these actions is needed.",Ecosphere,,,,,,,

Our aim was to examine quantitatively the relative effects of variation in parameters describing the expected dynamics and the environmental stochasticity as well as the uncertainties in them for the development of reliable population projections. The specific growth rate r1 was 0.14. Density regulation mainly happened close to the carrying capacity K, indicating that the commonly used assumption in population ecology of loglinear density regulation is not always valid. Annual variation in the point estimates of the environmental stochasticity was correlated with winter climate. Uncertainties in parameter estimates were high, especially in the estimates of density regulation and r1. In order to examine the dynamical consequences of the estimates as well as the uncertainties in them, we constructed Population Prediction Intervals (PPI). A PPI is the stochastic interval that includes the unknown population size with probability (1 - ?). Analyses of factors affecting the width of the PPI showed that the form of the density regulation as well as uncertainties in model parameters should be estimated when making projections of future fluctuations of introduced populations.",Ecology,,,,,,,
1931,"Saether, B E and Engen, S and Persson, J and Broseth, H and Landa, a and Willebrand, T",Management strategies for the wolverine in Scandinavia,"The use of Population Viability Analysis has recently been criticized mainly because uncertainties in population predictions are often ignored. We analyzed the viability of Scandinavian wolverine Gulo gulo populations that allow for the inclusion of uncertainties in parameter estimates and stochastic effects on population dynamics. We used the insight gained from analyses of stochastic population models to quantitatively analyze different management options for the wolverine. These management options were based on data from an individual-based demographic study in the Sarek National Park, Sweden, and data from monitoring schemes in Norway and Sweden. Stochastic components in population dynamics of the wolverine were large. Strong density regulation occurred around the carrying capacity. According to the World Conservation Union (2001), the carrying capacity of populations must exceed 46 sexually mature (>= 3-yr old) females to be considered not vulnerable. Continuation of the current levels of offtake in Norway will lead to extinction of the wolverine over large parts of the country. Hence, current rates of mortality of female wolverine make the northern population endangered, whereas the southern population is classified as vulnerable. Management plans allowing harvest of individuals should be based on a proportional threshold harvest strategy. Only 40-60\% of the surplus individuals exceeding a certain threshold for harvesting should be removed. Our analyses emphasized the importance of including estimates of precision in parameter estimates, including stochastic factors in recommendations based on Population Viability Analysis, and examining the robustness of the conclusions against variation in crucial parameters by sensitivity analyses.",Journal of Wildlife Management,,,,,,,

Development of population projections requires estimates of observation error, parameters characterizing expected dynamics such as the specific population growth rate and the form of density regulation, the influence of stochastic factors on population dynamics, and quantification of the uncertainty in the parameter estimates. 2. Here we construct a Population Prediction Interval (PPI) based on Bayesian state space modelling of future population growth of 28 reintroduced ibex populations in Switzerland that have been censused for up to 68 years. Our aim is to examine whether the interpopulation variation in the precision of the population projections is related to differences in the parameters characterizing the expected dynamics, in the effects of environmental stochasticity, in the magnitude of uncertainty in the population parameters, or in the observation error. 3. The error in the population censuses was small. The median coefficient of variation in the estimates across populations was 5.1\%. 4. Significant density regulation was present in 53.6\% of the populations, but was in general weak. 5. The width of the PPI calculated for a period of 5 years showed large variation among populations, and was explained by differences in the impact of environmental stochasticity on population dynamics. 6. In spite of the high accuracy in population estimates, the uncertainty in the parameter estimates was still large. This uncertainty affected the precision in the population predictions, but it decreased with increasing length of study period, mainly due to higher precision in the estimates of the environmental variance in the longer time-series. 7. These analyses reveal that predictions of future population fluctuations of weakly density-regulated populations such as the ibex often become uncertain. Credible population predictions require that this uncertainty is properly quantified.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,

It is an extraordinary fish. It regularly makes transoceanic migrations and uses its elevated body temperatures to hunt actively in frigid high latitudes (Block et al. 2001). It also fetches astro- nomical prices in the sushi mar- ket (Associated Press 2001). This last fact makes the bluefin a tragic case because short-term economics and politics have conspired against the bluefin’s survival. The Atlantic bluefin tuna’s western breeding pop- ulation is unprecedentedly low and declining. Commercial catches off the United States have fallen to 10\% of the quota, which suggests a popu- lation collapse. Recent research find- ings are not being incorporated into management decisions. Although the bluefin is a special fish, its problems are just one instructive example of how management can go off track if the scientific part of the process is corrupted by short-term economics and political lobbying.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

A case study of female roe deer,"Spatial distribution in mammals, and thereby home range size, is influenced by many different factors including body size, sex, age, reproductive status, season, availability of forage, availability of water, fragmentation of landscape, trophic level and intra- and inter-specific competition. Using linear mixed models, we looked for factors shaping the variation in size of spring-summer and winter home ranges for 51 radio-collared adult female roe deer at Trois Fontaines forest, Champagne Ardenne, France (1996 2005). Home range size of females was larger in winter than in spring summer, decreased with age, and decreased with increasing quality. Females in low quality areas adjusted the size of their home range to include more patches of habitat so that all female deer obtained similar amounts of food resources (total biomass of 6.7392.34 tons (mean9SE) for each home range). Such adjustments of home range size in response to patchiness of resources led to marked between-female variation in home range size. Our results demonstrate that roe deer females have different tactics of habitat use according to spatial variations in habitat quality so that females get similar food resources in highly productive environments such as the Trois Fontaines forest.",Oikos,,,,,,,

This forced the purple swamphen to concentrate in a few areas, increasing the risks from hunting or other disturbances. Recently, the effective protection of the species and the areas used by it, environmental changes such as the introduction of new farms and the creation of artificial wetlands (reservoirs) may have facilitated its expansion up the Guadalquivir river.

Age is important when biometrical data are used to assess the subspecific identity or probable breeding origin of the birds. Standard biometrics included bill length (feathers to tip), distance from nostril to tip, bill depth, head, wing (maximum flattened chord), and tarsus length, and body mass. The presence or absence of white or white-tipped feathers was checked in seven feather groups of the (grey) underwing. Bill depth and wing length were the most useful measurements to separate adult and juvenile Little Auks (when combined, classification accuracy 83\%). In combination with body mass (only emaciated birds were used), the age was assigned correctly in 88\% of the examined birds. White or white-tipped feathers in the lesser primary coverts (LPC) occurred more frequently in juveniles than in adults, while the reverse was true for the greater secondary coverts (GPC). Only 74\% of the Little Auks were properly aged on the basis of a combination of LPC and GPC pigmentation. With body mass being a ‘difficult’ measurement (an assessment of physical condition is required and incomplete corpses cannot be weighed), the combination of bill depth, wing length and white in LPC and GPC was evaluated (87\% correctly assigned). A review of biometrics collected in breeding areas indicated that birds wrecked in The etherlands were of the subspecies A. alle alle, with an overall size similar to for example birds of Bj\o rn\o ya (Bear Island) in the Barents Sea. It is recommended to use bill depth and wing length for ageing in combination with pigmentation patterns of LPC and GPC in future studies of wrecked birds.

1945,"Sargeant, G a and Ruff, R L","Demographic response of black bears at Cold Lake, Alberta, to the removal of adult males","Previous reports described an increase in population density following the removal of 23 adult and 3 subadult male black bears (Ursus americanus) from a 218-km2 study area near Cold Lake, Alberta (the CLSA). This finding plays a central role in continuing debates over population regulation in bears, but has been criticized because density estimates were based on assumptions that were not met. Moreover, subsequent discussion has been predicated on conjecture that human exploitation had minimal influence on population dynamics. We used improved methods of mark-recapture and survival analysis with a combination of new and previously published data to resolve these issues. Jolly-Seber estimates suggest numbers of females using the CLSA were relatively stable from 1969 to 1971, then more than doubled when males were captured and euthanized during 1971-72. Numbers remained high until 1975, when they declined abruptly. Similarly, numbers of subadult males captured annually increased disproportionately in 1972 and remained high until 1976, when they also declined. Changes in numbers of subadult males captured indicated changes in local density because they were not caused by changes in capture or settling rates. These findings support previous descriptions of trends in bear density at Cold Lake. However, survival records of 56 bears radiomarked during 1974-77 revealed heavier exploitation than previously suspected. Annual mortality rates of radiomarked bears ranged from 14 to 51\%, and humans caused at least 25 of 30 observed deaths. Consequently, an underlying assumption of previous interpretationsthat the Cold Lake bear population was naturally regulated near carrying capacity no longer seems reasonable. Our results suggest that adult males deterred bears in other sex-age groups from using the CLAS; however, we found no evidence that birth or death rates were affected. Thus, the observed increase in local density should no be construed as a density-dependent response. Abrupt changes in local density might not have occurred if males had been removed from a larger area encompassing the CLSA.",Ursus,,,,,,,

1948,"Saucy, Francis","Density dependence in time series of the fossorial form of the Water vole, Arvicola terrestris","Long term population fluctuations of the fossorial form of the water vole, Arvicola terrestris, can be reconstructed on the basis of the rewards given to vole trappers (""tail-return statistics""). Nine time series of at least 20 yr of continuous data recorded during the 20th century in Switzerland have been analysed using time series analysis and tested for direct and delayed density dependence. Seven of these data sets showed cyclic changes in abundance with statistically significant maxima of the periodogram for periods ranging between 5 and 7 yr. Their partial autocorrelation functions suggested the presence of both direct or delayed density dependence in the data. This was confirmed by regression analysis using the nonlinear approach advocated by Turchin. In contrast, no simple periodicity could be found in the two remaining time series, nor indication for direct or delayed density dependence in their partial autocorrelation functions. However, direct density dependence was also statistically demonstrated in these two data sets. In most cases, the analyses were complicated by the presence of trends in the data. The detection of density-dependent regulatory effects was obscured by linear and nonlinear trends in one and two cases, respectively. The data support the hypothesis that time-delayed and nonlinear mechanisms of population regulation operate in fossorial populations of A. terrestris. Furthermore, the data are consistent with regulatory mechanisms involving predator-prey interactions, while the causation of the unusually long cycle is still an open question. Finally, the presence of trends in these time series suggests that water vole populations track some long-term climatic changes in the environment.",Oikos,,,,,,,

To update the population size and pup production a new series of surveys was carried out during 1992 and 1997, either from land, airplane or boat, using direct counts in the field or pictures. The number of pups was corrected using data from land–based counts. Overall, we recorded 53 colonies, with a minimum number of 12,310 animals present on land, including 2925 pups. This estimate represents a decrease to only 14.5\% of the population size reported in the late 1940's. Applying a correction factor for animals in the water, the estimated total population was 22,157 individuals. The sealing activities performed mainly at northern Patagonia and at Tierra del Fuego are likely to be responsible for the depletion. We also detected changes in the location of the colonies. However, seasonal movements of animals were difficult to assess due to the scarce data available. Only four breeding colonies may be considered permanent. Seasonal movements would take place between the islets close to Ushuaia city and Islas Becasses. Southern Argentina does not hold large breeding colonies like those found, for example, in northern Patagonia. Juveniles predominate in the social structure of colonies. This suggests a likely increase in the coming years.","Mammalian Biology - Zeitschrift f\""{u}r S\""{a}ugetierkunde",,,,,,,

Often, however, only a single element of the life cycle is affected, and it is unclear whether such effects translate into effects on population growth. This is particularly true for research into the causes of global amphibian declines, where experimental research focuses primarily on the aquatic larval stages but theory suggests these stages have only minor importance for population growth.We used data from long-term mark-recapture studies of two natural populations of the salamander Salamandra salamandra to confirm the predictions of population models. One population remained stable (i.e., stationary) throughout the 20 years of the study whereas the other declined to local extinction. We used mark-recapture models to break down population growth rate into its two main components, recruitment and adult survival. Survival of postmetamorphic salamanderswas constant over time in the stable population, whereas the declining population was characterized by a decrease in survival and constant recruitment. Population growth was most sensitive to variation in adult survival. Current amphibian research focuses on preadult stages, and researchers assume recruitment is the most important determinant of population growth. This may not be the case. A better understanding of amphibian population dynamics is possible only through the integration of experiments, theory, and data from natural populations. Our results also suggest that amphibian conservation efforts should focus on all stages of the life cycle and their associated habitats",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

Increasing trypsin inhibitor activity was associated with a concomitant decrease in the concentration of soluble plant proteins (TI/SPP-ratio). At different phases of a three year lemming cycle, the TI/SPP-ratio was highest at peaking and declining densities and lowest when lemming density increased. Moreover, lemmings from a declining population showed pancreatic hypertrophy, which is a well documented pathology caused by a prolonged dietary intake of trypsin inhibitors. Thus, a grazing-induced action of trypsin inhibitors, leading to an excessive excretion of enzyme-inhibitory complexes and undigested dietary proteins from the alimentary tract, can explain the adverse effects typical for the decline phase of cyclic populations e.g. retarded growth, compressed breeding season, delayed sexual maturation, low recruitment, low survival rates, increased dispersal, and variation in spacing behaviour. The results suggest that a grazing-induced action of trypsin inhibitors in food plants is a possible cause for the cyclic dynamics of mammal populations",Oikos,,,,,,,

1976,"Sharpe, David J. and Goldingay, Ross L.",Population ecology of the nectar-feeding squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in remnant forest in subtropical Australia,"Context. Nectar is a temporally variable food resource. However, because few studies describe the population dynamics of nectar-feeding non-flying mammals, it is unclear how such populations are influenced by resource availability. Aims. We investigated the population ecology of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) in remnant forest in Brisbane, Australia, where nectar was a dominant food item. Methods. We used 36 tree-mounted traps to census a squirrel glider population inhabiting a 47-ha urban remnant over a 4-year period. Key results. A total of 201 gliders was captured 705 times in 3729 trap-nights (19\% trap success). Population density peaked in the first year at ∼1.6 individuals ha-1, and declined down to ∼0.5 individuals ha-1 by the final year. This change in population density appeared to be mediated by annual variation in flowering intensity. Births occurred from March to November, peaking between April and July. All females 1 year old bred in each year of the study, with a mean litter size of 1.7 (n=122). The overall natality rate was 1.9, indicating that females occasionally bred twice per year. The sex ratio was at parity in the pouch and in the trappable population. Gliders first entered the trappable population at 4 months of age, and persisted for a mean of 32 months. The maximum longevity was at least 6 years. Conclusions. The demographic characteristics of this squirrel glider population within remnant forest surrounded by urban development were similar to those reported elsewhere. Variation in nectar availability appears to have a substantial influence on the dynamics of squirrel glider populations. Implications. The substantial variation in population size driven by food availability raises concerns regarding the viability of small populations of nectarivorous non-flying mammals inhabiting remnant habitat. © 2010 CSIRO.",Wildlife Research,,,,,,,

All ended in failure. We place these attempts within the context of nineteen other reintroductions of macropods known to us. Success of reintroduction of macropods appears to depend critically on control or exclusion of exotic terrestrial predators. Islands without exotic predators support a success rate of reintroductions an order of magnitude higher than that of mainland sites and islands with exotic predators (82\% cf. 8\%). Reintroductions have generally been poorly monitored and poorly documented. Researchers have often failed to appreciate the enormity of the task of controlling introduced predators (foxes and feral cats and dogs) and herbivores (rabbits), and to make adequate use of existing technology (radiotelemetry), and have been unable to overcome the logistical problems of managing reintroductions far from their research bases. Successes in management and reintroduction of other threatened fauna in Australia suggest that effective control of introduced predators and rabbits using the poison 1080, for which many native species have a high tolerance, may provide an effective means of managing mainland reintroductions.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

1984,"Shuford, W David and Page, Gary W and Kjelmyr, Janet E",Patterns and dynamics of shorebird use of California’s Central Valley,"Surveys of Californias Central Valley between 1992-1995 document it as one of the most important regions in western North America to migratory and wintering shore- birds. Populations averaged 134,000 individuals in August, 211,000 in November, 303,000 in January, and 335,000 in April. Of 33 species, the 10 or 11 that averaged over 1,000 individuals each season accounted for 99\% of total numbers. Managed wetlands, agricultural fields (especially rice), and agricultural evaporation ponds held the most shorebirds. Species varied their seasonal, geographic, and habitat use of the Central Valley, primarily in response to changes in water availability from rainfall or management practices and latitudinal vari- ation in habitat availability mediated, in part, by climate. In the record rainfall year of 1994- 1995, shorebird numbers increased 74\% between November and January, primarily from coast-to-interior movements of the Dunlin (Cafidris alpina) and Long-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus) and local habitat shifts of Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus). Al- though the Valleys shorebirds face threats from poor or toxic water quality, changing ag- ricultural practices, and habitat loss to urbanization, they should benefit from current efforts to increase flooding of rice fields and to secure a stable high quality water supply for wetlands. Development of a sound conservation strategy is crucial for the preservation of shorebird populations in the Central Valley, as this agriculturally-dominated landscape is among the most altered in North America and remains vulnerable to strong economic and population growth pressures that may impact shorebird habitats in the future.",The Condor,,,,,,,

In most years, the Brooks and Hanna surveys encompassed 10 360 ha and,7060 ha, respectively. Both survey areas are located within the historical breeding distribution of Burrowing Owls in predominantly native mixed-grass prairie habitat. The Hanna surveys indicated that the density of nests ((x) over bar = 13.7 nests per 100 km(2), range = 2.8-32.6) declined significantly between 1991 and 2000. The decline in the Hanna area was most pronounced between 1991 (32.6 nests/100 km(2)) and 1997 (2.8 nests/100 km(2)) and recent surveys have found few nests. The Brooks surveys indicate that the density of nests ((x) over bar = 8.9 nests/100 km(2), range = 1.9-13.5), although lower than Hanna, did not decrease during the course of the surveys. The significant decline in Hanna is most likely indicative of the contraction of the northern edge of the breeding distribution of Burrowing Owls in Alberta and suggests that the population will soon become extirpated from that area.",Journal of Raptor Research,,,,,,,
1986,"Sidorovich, V E and Tikhomirova, L L and Jedrzejewska, B","Wolf Canis lupus numbers, diet and damage to livestock in relation to hunting and ungulate abundance in northeastern Belarus during 1990-2000","Wolf Canis lupus relationships with wild ungulates, domestic animals and humans were studied in an area of ca 800 km2 at the head of the Lovat River in northeastern Belarus during 1990-2000. The region was dominated by natural habitats (78\%) consisting mainly of forests and bogs, but also lakes and rivers. The abundance of wild ungulates, such as moose Alces alces, wild boar Sus scrofa, and roe deer Capreolus capreolus, as censused by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens, declined 5 to 6-fold between 1990 and 1996, most probably due to uncontrolled exploitation and poaching. During 1997-2000, the numbers of ungulates began to recover. Wolves responded to the shortage of wild ungulates by a strong shift in feeding habits. When wild ungulates were numerous, wolf diet as studied by scat analysis was composed of wild ungulates (80-88\% of consumed biomass), with small additions of medium- and small-sized wild animals (7-13\%), mainly beaver Castor fiber and hare Lepus sp., and domestic animals (4-6\%), mainly cattle. In the years when the recorded numbers of wild ungulates were at their lowest, wolves preyed on domestic animals (38\% of biomass consumed), wild ungulates (32\%), and medium- and small-sized wild prey (29\%). Wolf damage to domestic animals (28 head of cattle and 247 dogs killed) and wolf-human interaction (100 observations of wolves in and near villages, including one attack by a rabid wolf on 11 people) were recorded in 14 villages. The rate of wolf predation on domestic animals and their appearances in villages increased exponentially with the declining biomass of wild ungulates and ceased again when wild ungulates began to recover; a one-year time lag in wolf response to changes in ungulate abundance was observed. The numbers of wolves as estimated by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens played a weaker role in shaping wolf-livestock and wolf-human interaction. The wolf population was strongly affected by hunting during the study. Wolves responded numerically with a 1 to 2-year time lag to the varying intensity of harvest by humans. Our study showed the role of the human factor in shaping wolf numbers and wolf-livestock interaction in eastern Europe. The three major components of this relationship were: 1) the manifold decline in wild ungulate abundance, which was most probably caused by uncontrolled exploitation by humans in the years of political transformation and economic regress, made wolves shift to predation on domestic animals; inevitably, wolves were frequently seen in the rural areas; 2) people interpreted the growing rates of wolf damage and appearances near the settlements as an effect of greatly increasing numbers of wolves, and demanded that authorities and hunters fight the 'wolf plague'; 3) hunting impact on wolves increased and led to a marked reduction in wolf numbers and a decline in wolf-human conflicts. This scenario was most probably repeated in many areas of eastern Europe during 1990-2000, which was a decade of political and economical transformation. From a management perspective, we suggested that predation levels and wolf-human conflicts could be reduced not only by increased wolf harvest but also by enhancing the density and diversity of wild ungulates.",Wildlife Biology,,,,,,,
1987,"Sidorovich, V. E. and Sidorovich, Anna a. and Izotova, Inna V.",Variations in the diet and population density of the red fox Vulpes vulpes in the mixed woodlands of northern Belarus,"The dietary structure and distribution patterns of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in situations of different food supply in the coniferous-deciduous (mostly small-leaved) woodlands of northern Belarus were investigated. A total of 1526 scats of red foxes was analysed, and snowtracking of the species was performed each winter. Abundance of the main prey (small rodents, perching birds and hares) and wild ungulates supplying carrion for red foxes in the cold season were monitored. The results suggest that in northern Belarus red foxes had a diversified diet, consisting basically of different combinations of bank voles, Microtus voles, and wild ungulate carrion. The importance of carrion much increased in winter, while the proportions of birds and fruits grew during the warm season. In the ecologically rich woodland harbouring on clay soil, red foxes relied more on small rodents, while carrion and fruits appeared to be more important food item of the predator in the barren forested terrain dwelling on poor sandy deposits. During Microtus population outbreaks, red foxes more frequently fed on this prey. One-sixth lower density of red foxes was attributable to the forested terrain on sandy deposits compared to the woodland on clay soil, and a pronounced landscape-related difference in the habitat selection by the predator was found. ?? 2005 Deutsche Gesellschaft f??r S??ugetierkunde.

I argue that despite protection in$\backslash$nnational parks, active intervention is necessary to halt declines$\backslash$nin southern Africa's Greater (Phoenicopterus ruber) and Lesser (Phoeniconaias$\backslash$nminor) Flamingo populations. Flamingos are long-lived species that$\backslash$nbreed sporadically at only two localities in southern Africa: the$\backslash$nMakgadikgadi Pans in Botswana and Etosha National Park in Namibia.$\backslash$nDespite well-publicized breeding on Etosha Pan, flamingos have experienced$\backslash$nonly three major breeding events in 40 years. Breeding failure occurs$\backslash$nwhen high evaporation rates rapidly dry the pan, and up to 100,000$\backslash$nflightless chicks may starve. Consequently, pairs breeding in Etosha$\backslash$nexhibit extraordinarily low recruitment (0. 040 young pair$\backslash$$\backslash$year)$\backslash$nand extrapolations indicate that adults can replace themselves only$\backslash$nif they breed for 38 to 50 years and all offspring survive. Because$\backslash$nsurvival of offspring from fledging to adulthood (5 years) is about$\backslash$n46\%, this breeding lifespan rises to an unrealistic 83 years, making$\backslash$nEtosha a nonviable breeding site. Alternative, suitable flamingo$\backslash$nhabitats in Africa are being mined for soda-ash, are damaged by pollution,$\backslash$nor are unprotected. Accordingly, continent-wide estimates and those$\backslash$nfrom southern Africa alone suggest a population decline of about$\backslash$n40\% in both species over the last 15 years. Because Namibia regularly$\backslash$nsupports 84\% of the Greater and 93\% of the Lesser Flamingos in southern$\backslash$nAfrica, conservation strategies are best focused there. Simple but$\backslash$neffective management methods, based on those employed in western$\backslash$nEurope, could reverse these downward trends. In Etosha a small island$\backslash$nsurrounded by a water-filled depression would allow up to 4000 pairs$\backslash$nto breed annually.

1992,"Simons, Theodore R. and Farnsworth, George L. and Shriner, Susan a.",Evaluating Great Smoky Mountains National Park as a population source for the Wood Thrush,"The prevailing fragmentation paradigm predicts that large, intact forests are acting as population sources for Neotropical migrant landbirds. We used the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as a model for evaluating the role Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the largest national park in the eastern United States) may play in maintaining regional songbird populations. We estimated the annual productivity of Wood Thrushes in the park by combining observations on the birds' distribution, abundance, and productivity with estimates of habitat availability. We estimated a breeding population of approximately 10,000 nesting pairs using habitat models developed from over 2500 point-count censuses conducted across the park. Data from 426 nests monitored from 1992 to 1997 produced a daily nest survival rate of 0.96. We estimated an annual fecundity of 2.76 fledglings per breeding pair, based on a model that incorporated the re-nesting behavior of Wood Thrushes. Results indicate that the park is producing approximately 3000 surplus female young each year. Daily nest survival rates were below those reported in other studies of Wood Thrushes in large forest tracts. The relatively high productivity of 3.31 nestlings per successful nest suggests that, in the absence of predation, the park provides high- quality nesting habitat for Wood Thrushes, but that it may also support a more diverse and abundant predator community than more disturbed or less contiguous sites. The difficulties of estimating the size of continental breeding bird populations make assessing the significance of the park within a regional landscape context problematic, but our estimates suggest that, although the park is functioning as a substantial population source on a local scale, its potential to sustain regional or continental Wood Thrush populations is limited. Our findings suggest that species such as the Wood Thrush are capable of moderate levels of surplus productivity in high-quality habitat, but that extensive areas of suitable habitat outside protected areas and other public lands will be required to sustain continental breeding populations",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

However, the Asiatic lion of Gir forest, India presents a conservation success story whose history may help to guide the recovery and conservation of other imperiled predators. Protection of core and satellite habitats and the relocation of pastoral communities and their livestock triggered forest recovery and coincident increases in native prey populations. Wild ungulate populations increased by 10-fold between 1970 and 2010, supporting an increase in the lion population from 180 animals in 1974 to 411 animals in 2010. Coincident with this increase, lions shifted their predation preferences from a diet composed of 75\% livestock to one composed of just 25\% livestock. This example demonstrates the value of native prey populations to sustain imperiled carnivore species, and the use of protected areas and livestock exclusion to maintain healthy prey populations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Rouzic is the only French gannetry and is currently the most southerly breeding location for the species. Population size and distribution were assessed by using land-based field counts, photographs taken from the sea and aerial photographs. Since it foundation, the colony has shown three periods of increase with average annual rates of increase of 28.1\% (1947-65), 5.0\% (1967-79) and 8.4\% (1981-94). A Leslie simulation model indicates that, at least during the first and third periods, these increases eases were likely to have been sustained by net immigration of Northern Gannets to Rouzic. Compared to other gannetries of a similar age and size, Rouzic currently shows a high rate of population increase. In 1991, the colony held about 11,500 pairs and about 2,000 non breeders. At present, colony size is not limited by the availability of nesting habitat, but Northern Gannets will soon colonize the area occupied by the few Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula artica) and Manx Shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus) still breeding on Rouzic.

Initially this small (5 km(2)) forest was inhabited by substantial numbers of five species of diurnal primates and the forest was typical of Reserve Forests in northwest upper Assam. About two thirds of the forest had canopy cover of 20-50\% or more. Civil unrest, political problems and a lack of resources for Forest Department personnel, however, resulted in rapid degradation of the area. After three years less than one third of the forest had more than 20\% canopy cover; all primate populations had declined dramatically and the small percentage of juveniles in each species indicated that all were in imminent danger of local extinction. There was no evidence of hunting or trapping nor any large scale logging. Forest degradation was due primarily to small scale harvesting of forest products, selective cutting, and collection of firewood. Although only hand tools were employed, the forest inexorably declined in response to these steady pressures.

More than 95\% of all prey taken by these terns were round- fish, ranging in weight between 0.3 and 40 g. Usually birds fed alone, but sometimes they were observed feeding in mixed species flocks consisting of 15-200 individuals. Capture rate (n of fish per hour foraging) in these flocks was higher than that of solitary birds. However, smaller fish were caught while foraging in flocks, so food intake rate (g/h) did not differ between solitary and flock feeding birds. Especially the relationships between foraging behaviour of the three tern species and abiotic factors, such as time, tide and water clarity, have been investigated. Capture rate of Royal T erns increased with water clarity. For Little Terns and Sandwich Terns, food intake rate was lower in the most turbid waters compared to clearer waters. There was very little foraging activity during high tide. For Little Terns and Royal Terns, food intake rate was about twice as high during receding and low tide than during incoming tide. Food intake rate averaged 8 g/h in Little Terns, 60 g/h in Sandwich Terns and 45 g/h in Royal Terns. With a rough model, we provisionally estimate the maxi- mum rate of daily energy expenditure of terns wintering in the tropics at 3BMR.

In this study, we present data on the status of this population, based on our research between 1971 and 2006. We applied open population capture-recapture models to data collected from 1971-2006 to assess the relationship between polar bear survival and sex, age, time period, and a number of environmental covariates. Model-averaged estimates of survival (which include harvest mortality) for senescent adults ranged from 0.33 (1980s, males) to 0.92 (1990s, females). Estimates of cub-of-the-year (COY) and yearling survival ranged between 0.10 (1980s, male yearlings) and 0.97 (1990s, female COY). Survival of 2-4 year olds and adults were nearly identical and ranged from 0.61 (1980s, males) to 0.97 (1990s, females). Relatively wide confidence intervals for survival of young age classes were largely due to small sample sizes. In addition, we modeled recapture probability as a function of three covariates (effort, radio.vhf, radio.satellite) and used a Horvtiz-Thompson (HT) estimator to estimate long term trends in the size of the NB population. Models that allowed associations between annual variation in survival, habitat, or relative seal abundance variables were not, in general, supported by the data. The model-averaged estimate of population size from 2004 to 2006 = 980 155, 95\% CI) and was not significantly different from estimates for the periods of 1972 to 1975 and 1985 to 1987 of 745 246, 95\% CI) and 867 141, 95\% CI), respectively. These abundance estimates apply primarily to that segment of the NB population residing west and south of Banks Island to the mainland coast, plus a relatively small but unknown fraction of the population residing further north around Prince Patrick Island. In 1992 to 1994, a capture effort focused in the area around Prince Patrick Island confirmed significant mixing between northern and southern segments of the population, that some bears residing in the extreme northern portions of the population may not have been equally available for capture during other sampling periods, and that the number of polar bears around Prince Patrick Island was not large relative to the rest of the population. Thus, we consider our estimates of total abundance during the other three sampling periods to be slightly low. Currently the NB polar bear population appears to be stable, probably because ice conditions remain suitable for feeding through much of the summer and fall in most years and the Inuvialuit harvest has not exceeded sustainable levels.",Ecological Applications,,,,,,,

There were more humpbacks present in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries than there are today. It also appears that humpback whales utilised the Bermuda area from February to May during these centuries, while today they occur at Bermuda for only three to four weeks in April. Humpbacks probably used Bermuda as a breeding ground in winter during these previous centuries and it may be an area that will be repopulated during winter if and when the population recovers from over-hunting. Using the distinctive pattern of pigmentation on the under-sides of the tail flukes, 104 individual humpback whales were identified at Bermuda and 44 of these have also been seen at other locations, including all the major summering and wintering grounds in the western North Atlantic. Chi-square analysis of these resightings shows that the whales occur at Bermuda in the expected proportions, relative to the samples, from the summering and wintering grounds. Contemporary utilisation of Bermuda by humpbacks is as a mid-ocean habitat through which all members of the western North Atlantic population migrate during spring. There is also evidence suggesting that humpback whales feed at Bermuda on deep water scattering layers during their stop-over.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

The use of ibex products in many folk remedies guaranteed high financial returns for the hunter and resulted in the relentless pursuit of this species. By the early 1800s, < 100 animals survived in a single population in the Italian Gran Paradiso mountain massif. The recovery to more than 20 000 animals today is the result of a four-stage conservation effort which returned alpine ibex to almost their entire original range of distribution: (1) effective protection of the last remaining population, (2) captive breeding of animals caught in the recovered last population, (3) reintroduction of captive-bred animals into protected original habitat, (4) translocation of animals from successfully established ""reservoir"" populations to uninhabited sites. Alpine ibex management faces two challenges today: (1) habitat destruction in areas of high population densities, and (2) low genetic variability possibly a result of inbreeding during a succession of four potential population bottleneck situations.",Applied Animal Behaviour Science,,,,,,,

2037,"Sulkava, Risto",Risto Sulkava Ecology of the otter (Lutra,"The otter (Lutra lutra) is a semiaquatic Mustelid with wide distribution. However, its populations decreased in many areas in the 20th century. Otters are well adapted to life in the water. Their body is elongated, the tail flattened and the fur is thick and waterproof. The main food is fish all over the otters range. However, amphibians have also been important food for otters in Finland. Finding suitable feeding areas is problematic in the North, due to the thick ice layer in winter, and otters have to move over large home ranges searching for food and possible new feeding areas. In this long-term study, the ecology of otters was studied extensively in central Finland. The diet of otters was studied by analysing spraints (faeces). The activity of otters was investigated by following sprainting activity in summer and by snow-tracking in winter. Snow-tracking was also used to study the home ranges, breeding and density of otters. To estimate population densities two new snow-tracking methods were developed. The home range mapping method (HMM) is very intensive, but gives an exact estimate of the number of otters. The one-visit census (OVC) is a sampling method that provides a faster way to estimate the population densities. The one-visit census method was used in a large project for monitoring the Finnish otter population in 1995-1998. In this study the possibility of monitoring Finnish otter populations by snow-tracking was evaluated. The results were found to be promising and the method applicable for nation-wide studies. The number of otters in Finland was approximately 2000-2550 individuals in the above-mentioned years. In the study area (1650 km2) in central Finland, the otter population increased from about 20 individuals in 1985 to 50 individuals in 2002. It was possible to estimate the density of otter populations in different river systems by exact annual counting of all otter individuals by HMM. Finding an S-shaped growth curve made it possible to determine the local carrying capacity for the otter population in the study area. The density of otters depends on used method. It was 0.7 individuals per 10 km of riverbed in summertime (2002), but increased up to 5.2 individuals per 10 km if only available winter feeding areas was used. The length of the home range for female otters or litters was typically 20-40 km of watercourse. Otters used all the available feeding areas in winter, but in summer there was abundant free space and food available. The density-dependent offspring production for the population of otters was documented for the first time in this study. Density-dependent reproduction indicates the existence of intraspecific competition in otter populations in central Finland. Food was scarce and competition took place only in the winter, when most of the feeding sites were covered by ice. The ice cover limits the availability of food resources enormously, and creates a ""bottleneck"" for the otter populations in central Finland. In the study area most of the otter cubs produced in a few river systems, resulting in a source-sink structure between the network of habitats or local populations. The increase of local populations was equal in all river systems. Highly productive source populations rendered population growth possible in other river systems. In central Finland the mean number of cubs per female was 1.51 in autumn. All known litters were born between May and September.",Thesis,,,,,,,

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide-induced habitat alteration would reduce small mammal populations in early-successional stages of sub-boreal spruce forest. A secondary objective was to determine the long-term influence of herbicide treatment on reproduction, survival, and growth attributes of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) populations. Small mammal populations were intensively sampled in 4 pairs of control and treatment sites dominated by early-successional vegetation (5-10 yr after clearcut harvesting) near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Sampling was conducted during 1987 (pretreatment year), 1988-89 (first and second posttreatment years), and in 1991-92 (fourth and fifth posttreatment years). Higher mean numbers of red-backed voles (P = 0.03) and shrews (Sorex spp.; P = 0.001) were present on control than treatment sites during 1988-92. Mean abundance of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus; P = 0.69) and deer mice (P = 0.20) were similar on control and treatment sites throughout the study. Short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea) and long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata) were commonly captured on both control and treatment sites. There were no consistent differences between control and treatment populations in body mass, total biomass, or proportion of adult male and female red-backed voles and deer mice in breeding condition. However, there was a higher mean number of successful pregnancies in control than treatment populations of red-backed voles (P = 0.02) but not deer mice (P = 0.18) during posttreatment years. Mean Jolly-Seber estimates of survival of red-backed voles (P = 0.01) but not deer mice (P = 0.70) were higher in treatment than control populations. The magnitude of observed demographic effects from herbicide treatment were well within the mean values of natural fluctuations of these variables. Herbicide treatment of areas dominated by early-successional vegetation in northern coniferous forests should be staggered in time and space to allow recovery (2-3 yr) of vegetation and small mammal species such as red-backed voles and shrews.",The Journal of Wildlife Management,,,,,,,

2042,"Sullivan, Thomas P. and Sullivan, Druscilla S. and Lindgren, P. M F and Ransome, Douglas B.",Stand structure and the abundance and diversity of plants and small mammals in natural and intensively managed forests,"Little attention has been given to investigating biodiversity in managed forests. Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and fertilization have been used successfully to increase growth of coniferous trees, vegetative succession, and overall stand structure in second-growth stands. This study was designed to test the hypotheses (H) that PCT and repeated fertilization of young (20-25 years) even-aged lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands would enhance (H1) coniferous stand structure; (H2) abundance and diversity of understory vegetation; and (H3) abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals, to levels found in mature and old-growth forests. Replicate study areas were located near Summerland and Kelowna in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had six stands: young plantation, thinned stand (1000 stems/ha), thinned-fertilized stand (1000 stems/ha), unthinned stand, mature forest, and old-growth forest. Coniferous stand structure, understory vegetation, and forest-floor small mammals were sampled during a 5-year period from 1999 through 2003. The smaller tree sizes (diameter, height, basal area) in the young lodgepole pine stands did not support the tree size part of H1. Similar abundance of overstory and total conifers did support the abundance part of H1. The diversity component was supported by the similarity in species and structural diversity of total conifers among the intensively managed and older unmanaged stands. Response of understory vegetation was dominated by the abundance of herbs in the thinned-fertilized stands. There was no difference in shrub abundance among stands, but mosses and terrestrial lichens were most numerous in the mature and old-growth stands. Our results supported the abundance part of H2, at least for herbs and shrubs. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants were similar in managed and old-growth forests, and richness was lowest in the mature stands. H3 was supported for total abundance, species richness, and diversity of small mammals, and for the generalist species Peromyscus maniculatus and Tamias amoenus, but not for the old forest specialist Myodes gapperi. Two insectivores, Sorex monticolus and Sorex cinereus, were at comparable or higher abundance in the managed stands than in the older unmanaged forests. Three other microtines: Microtus pennsylvanicus, Microtus longicaudus, and Phenacomys intermedius were early successional vegetation specialists, and hence did not fit the prediction of H3. Thus, despite overall quantitative differences in stand structure and species-specific variability between our intensively managed and older natural stands, old-growth attributes seem to be developing in a time-span of decades rather than the centuries depicted by long rotations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

2047,"Summers, Ron W. and Foster, Simon and Swann, Bob and Etheridge, Brian","Local and global influences on population declines of coastal waders: Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima numbers in the Moray Firth, Scotland","Declines in numbers by several wader species in Britain have been linked to climate change, but the mechanism for the declines has rarely been explored. Britain lies at the northern end of the East Atlantic Flyway, and supports 1.3 million out of the Flyway's 8.5 million coastal waders (Charadrii) in winter and the Purple Sandpiper is one of the species whose numbers have declined. Here, we examine the dynamics of the decline as observed in the Moray Firth, northeast Scotland, investigating whether the decline was due to poorer apparent survival (return rate) or poorer recruitment of young birds. The maximum number in the Moray Firth declined from 860 in 1987/88 to 236 in 2006/07, with some increase during winters 2007/08 and 2008/09. At the three main high-tide roosts (Balintore, Lossiemouth and Buckie) the maximum combined number declined from 574 to 90. Changes in survival and recruitment (percentage of first-year birds) were examined at these roosts from captured samples, which were ringed and recaptured. There were no significant changes between winters in survival rates, nor were there differences between the survival rates of age groups (first-year and adult) or bill size groups, which represented birds of different sex and breeding origin. Annual survival estimates for the three roosts ranged from 72 to 77\%. The percentage of first-year birds varied among roosts and years; the lowest values were during the late 1980s/early 1990s and early 2000s. A free-running population model incorporating varying percentages of first-year birds and constant mortality for each roost provided a plausible explanation for the decline. Although modelled numbers followed the observed pattern, a discrepancy in one year was carried forward in subsequent years, so that the fit with the observed numbers was parallel rather than similar. However, it seems that the decline in numbers was largely due to poorer recruitment. We discuss whether breeding success had declined, whether the population had responded to changes in the local sewage treatment systems, which could affect invertebrate food for Purple Sandpipers, or whether fewer birds chose to winter in Scotland. The Moray Firth population is derived from Norway and possibly Canada, and there is evidence that the Norwegian population was disproportionately affected. The reason for poor recruitment requires further study, and other wader species require examination to test if poor recruitment is a common feature of decline in numbers. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science",,,,,,,

All four colonies across the atoll were surveyed in 2011 and 2012 by counting adults on nests and chicks, and calculating the number of fledged birds. The breeding population in 2011 consisted of approximately 4,400 pairs of Greater Frigatebird and 6,600 pairs of Lesser Frigatebird. This is a potential increase of at least 10\% since the last comparable surveys in 1976/77 and 2000. However, 2012 populations were considerably less than in 2011, highlighting significant annual variation and the need for more data. We also report a new breeding colony on the island of Picard, which was last reported to host breeding frigatebirds a century ago.

In contrast to a generally observed reduction in the recruitment of glass eels in Europe, including in Swedish waters, there was no indication of a decline in the total eel fishery yields along the Swedish west coast. Long-term records of daily catches as well as by test fishing results also shown that this stability in eel fishery yields has not been maintained by an increase in fishery effort, as the catch-per-unit-efforts in the past 20 years have been more or less unchanged. These findings implied that the number of recruits to the fishery has been rather stable, possibly indicating that density-dependent factors at the elver and yellow eel stages may moderate variations in glass eel recruitment. Total instantaneous rate of mortality was estimated from records on eel length distribution in the professional fyke-net fishery. The estimated total mortality rate in an isolated archipelago population on the west coast was chosen as an approximation of the instantaneous rate of natural mortality and net emigration in the west coast eel stock. The differences between these two estimates could, thus be regarded as the mortality that occurred due to fishing. It was found that the eel fishery was very intense and most fish were caught in small sizes, resulting in a low escapement rate of maturing fish.",Fisheries Research,,,,,,,

In contrast, numbers of lekking male sage grouse on a nearby unploughed control area showed no clear long-term trend. Ploughing even small areas of sagebrush steppe to produce cereal grains appears more detrimental to sage grouse than chemical control of sagebrush.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

As of 1989 about 5000 individuals are estimated to survive in the Paraguayan Chaco. Small dispersed populations still exist in Argentina and Bolivia, but more information is needed on the status of this species in those two countries. In Paraguay, Chacoan peccaries have almost disappeared from the two national parks within their range and the only significant population exists in an area where there are no reserves. The survival of this species depends on enforcing regulations against hunting both within and outside the national parks, translocating animals to the parks, establishing a system of reserves on private land in critical areas, training of Paraguayan wildlife professionals, and environmental education.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Its biology and conservation requirements are poorly documented. We report our observations, made in 1997 and 2000, on the behaviour and ecology of the two remaining populations, located in the Touran Protected Area and the Bahram-e-Goor Reserve. Recent population counts by the Department of Environment of Iran (471 in the Protected Area and 96 in the Reserve) are markedly lower than the estimate of 600–770 made in the 1970s in the Touran Protected Area. We observed social interactions between stallions and mares outside the breeding season that contrasts with the known social structure of this subspecies. Poaching, competition with domestic animals, removal of shrubs for domestic use, and land conversion have been identified as the main threats to the two remaining onager populations. In addition, geographical isolation could cause the loss of genetic variability in these two relatively small populations, and also makes them more susceptible to the potential effects of stochastic events such as drought or disease. Public awareness, appropriate protection, and scientific studies must be urgently supported by both national and international organizations in order to prevent the extinction of these two apparently dwindling populations of onager.",Oryx,,,,,,,

For all species the number of individuals sighted per hour declined by 77 to 94\% over the 3 yr period.

Here, we estimate the abundance and trends in one of these regional populations, the Bay of Islands, using a photo-identification database collected from 1997 to 1999 and from 2003 to 2006, containing a total of 3,841 records of 317 individual dolphins. Estimates of abundance obtained with the robust design fluctuated widely but showed a significant decline in the number of dolphins present in the bay over time (7.5\% annual rate of decline). Temporary emigration was random and fluctuated considerably ($\gamma$ = 0.18, SE = 0.07 to $\gamma$ = 0.84, SE = 0.06). Apparent survival was estimated at 0.928 (CI = 0.911–0.942). Seasonal estimates (26 seasons) obtained in POPAN also showed a significant decline in abundance (5.8\% annual rate of decline). Despite the decline observed in local abundance, dolphins continue to be found regularly in the Bay of Islands, suggesting that fewer dolphins use the bay on regular basis. Consequently, it seems that a change in habitat use, mortality and possibly low recruitment could underlie the apparent local decline.",Marine Mammal Science,,,,,,,

In that period, 527 nests were observed in the study area. The annual number of nests varied between 6 (in 1993–1994) and 92 (in 2002–2003). Between 1995–1996 and 2003–2004, the annual number of nests increased at about 20.4\% per year on average. Among the 527 clutches observed, 358 (67.9\%) were left in situ, 50 (9.5\%) were relocated to another spot on the beach, 88 (16.7\%) were relocated to open-air beach hatcheries, and 31 clutches (5.9\%) did not have their management decision recorded.

2073,"Thompson, Dba",Timing of Breeding and Breeding Performance in a Population of Greenshanks ( Tringa Nebularia ),"The paper examines data from a 19-year study of a greenshank population in north-west Scotland. (2) Greenshanks completed clutches earlier, and laid heavier eggs, in years when early spring was warm. Laying date was independent of weather conditions around the time when chicks hatched. Fresh egg weight was heaviest in years when the laying season was early. (3) Fewer chicks hatched, and they were likely to be lighter, when weather conditions during the incubation period were cold and wet. (4) Fewer birds (of both sexes) returned to breed and fewer new territories were established when the 2 preceeding years were characterized by (a) harsh weather around the period of chick growth and (b) a low estimate of population potential breeding success. (5) Three factors, in addition to weather conditions, were associated with laying date: (i) individual differences between females (every year some laid early and others laid late), (ii) female age (older females laid earlier in the spring), and (iii) territory type (territories which included a river produced earlier clutches than those including only lochs). (6) There was a negative correlation between annual average fresh clutch weight and the number of breeding females. However, total number of chicks hatched and an estimate of population potential breeding success were positively correlated with female number. (7) The paper concludes that a range of climatic and female-specific factors appear to shape breeding performance throughout spring and summer. Year-to-year fluctuations in population size are attributed to these factors and it is suggested that population regulation does not occur.",The Journal of Animal \ldots,,,,,,,

During both the SCANS 1994 and 2005 surveys, porpoises were commonly encountered in offshore waters, for example in the central German Bight. However, information on year-round abundance and distribution of harbour porpoises in that area on a monthly basis was lacking. Between 2002 and 2004, we undertook 26 aerial line-transect surveys in a 2,600 km2 area in the central German Bight, 100 km north of the Island of Borkum (Eastern Frisia). Data were analysed with DISTANCE software. A total of 406 porpoises were sighted. Sighting rates (=sightings/km transect) peaked in July 2002, February, May and September 2003, and in January and April 2004. Absolute densities (g(0) corrected) ranged between 0.14 and 1.54 animals/km2 (peak in April 2004). Proportion of calves varied between 3.4 and 27.3\%. Our results show a highly irregular appearance of harbour porpoises in the study area with no apparent seasonal trends in occurrence but peaks in single months. We propose that the area is used as a transit route with harbour porpoise moving in from regions of high density in summer (Northern Frisia) and early spring (Eastern Frisia).

2078,"Thompson, Paul M. and {Van Parijs}, Sofie and Kovacs, Kit M.",Local declines in the abundance of harbour seals: Implications for the designation and monitoring of protected areas,"1. Information on the abundance of European pinnipeds is required to assess interactions with fisheries and to meet new conservation obligations under the European Community (EC) Habitats Directive. A detailed time-series of data has documented increases in grey seal populations, but there remains considerable uncertainty over the current status of UK harbour seal populations. 2. We present data on changes in the abundance of harbour seals in a study area within Orkney, Scotland, UK, previously considered a stronghold for this species. In 1998, intensive shore-based counts of both adults and pups were only 16–36\% of similar counts made between 1984 and 1987. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the proportion of yearlings present in haul-out groups indicated a reduction in local recruitment. 3. Current monitoring of UK harbour seals, using wider-scale aerial survey techniques, has provided important estimates of site distribution and relative abundance at regional and national scales. However, these larger-scale surveys lack associated data on within-year variation in counts at particular sites. Consequently, they cannot currently be used to explore the spatial scale of the changes in seal numbers that we report here. Similarly, current data from wider-scale monitoring cannot be used to determine whether observed local changes in abundance result from redistribution or a change in survival or reproduction. 4. Management and monitoring plans are currently being developed for special areas of conservation (SAC) for harbour seals in response to the EC Habitats Directive. We suggest that more intensive research is required to assess whether or not similar changes in the abundance and age structure of seals have occurred in these areas. Without a better understanding of the current status of harbour seals both within and outside proposed SAC, future efforts to monitor the effectiveness of management initiatives will be constrained.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,

Over the last 40 years wild populations have declined from thousands to a scattered few. Despite its plight and occasional anecdotal reports of sightings by local people, no intensive field study has been conducted on this tiger subspecies and its habitat. The captive population of about 50 tigers, derived from six wild-caught founders, is genetically impoverished with low reproductive output. Given the size and fragmentation of potential tiger habitat, saving what remains of the captive population may be the only option left to prevent extinction of this tiger subspecies, and even this option is becoming increasingly less probable. This precarious dilemma demands that conservation priorities be re-evaluated and action taken immediately to decide if recovery of the wild population will be possible.",Oryx,,,,,,,

Forest removal is a particularly significant threat because an estimated 82\% of amphibians rely on forests for part of their lives.Biphasic amphibians rely on suitable terrestrial habitat to support their post-metamorphic growth and survival and also to maintain appropriate habitat and landscape connectivity.We created 4 replicate, 16-ha experimental arrays in the southeastern USA to examine the effects of forest removal on migratory movements of adult biphasic amphibians. Each array contained four forest-harvesting treatments that included an unharvested control, a partially harvested stand, a clearcut with coarse woody debris retained, and a clearcut with coarse woody debris removed.Some amphibian species emigrated from wetlands in significantly greater numbers through forest controls compared with harvested treatments. Also, salamanders were generally more sensitive to forest removal than were frogs, with a significantly greater proportion of salamanders migrating through forested habitat compared to frogs.For several species, individuals were significantly more likely to avoid clearcuts when emigrating compared to immigrating. Individuals that emigrated into clearcut treatments were more likely to reverse direction and return to wetlands in some species.Synthesis and applications. Our study identifies one mechanism by which forest removal shapes the abundance and distribution of amphibians in terrestrial habitat. To promote the persistence of amphibian populations, conservation efforts should focus on preserving forest habitat adjacent to reproduction sites. Such measures are especially important where forest habitat connects local populations or where it links reproduction sites to other habitat features necessary for amphibian growth, survival, or overwintering.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,

In 1996, the biomasses of the dominant fish species, roach and bream, were reduced to 14\% and 6\%, respectively, of that in 1992. The total biomass of percids was, however, unchanged or slightly increased. The proportion of benthic invertebrates in the total food of the fish decreased from 57\% to 36\% during the study period, whereas the proportion of zooplankton increased from 31\% to 56\%. At the same time the number of young planktivorous fish increased. Thus, the main object of fish predation turned from benthic invertebrates to zooplankton due to change in fish population structure. At the beginning of the study the amount of detritus eaten by cyprinids was about 620 kg . ha(-1) . year(-1), but this decreased by 82\% due to the intensive fishing. Thus, by recycling nutrients from the sediment, the detrivorous- benthivorous feeding of cyprinids is an important factor in the nutrient balance of the lake.",Ecology of Freshwater Fish,,,,,,,

Circumstantial evidence from New Zealand indicates that, when introduced to islands, Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) have negative effects on endemic plants, invertebrates, birds, and reptiles, including the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). We tested the effects of Pacific rats on tuatara by comparing the demographic structure and body condition of tuatara populations on three islands before and after removal of rats and on a fourth island where rats remained. In the presence of rats, juvenile tuatara constituted on average 0-5\% of the sample tuatara populations. When Pacific rats were removed after at least 200 years' occupancy, the proportion of juvenile tuatara increased 3.5- to 17-fold and body condition of adult males and females also improved (sometimes dramatically). We predict that, unless Pacific rats are removed from Taranga Island, the tuatara population will collapse because of low population density and the lack of juvenile recruitment. Our results demonstrate that when invasive species exert subtle effects on recruitment and body condition, the effects on populations of long-lived endemic species may only become apparent long after the invasion.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,

To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of this program, the Cofa´n developed and tested three methods to document changes in the populations of turtles. The ﬁrst method consisted of interviews with people from neighbouring communities about their perceptions of changes in turtle abundance. The second method was a direct count of turtles observed along the rivers from canoe. The third method was an indirect count, involving turtle nest censusing along community beaches. Two of the methods yielded numerical, statistically positive turtle population trends. The turtle program has inﬂuenced the community’s perception of turtle conservation issues so that, instead of hunting the adults and eggs, they now protect them. The training in record-keeping permits them to make a transparent history of the equitability of access to the turtle egg resource. The Cofa´n monitoring experience strengthened their successful petition to the Ecuadorian government for the rights to manage their territorial lands within the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve, and to receive protected area status and management rights to other ancestral lands. The experience gained by the Za´balo monitors is now serving as a model for the design and implementation of the park monitoring system of the newly-established Cofa´n Park Ranger Corps, which will be patrolling three Ecuadorian Ecological Reserves which overlap Cofa´n inhabited areas",Biodiversity and Conservation,,,,,,,
2090,"Tambling, Craig J. and {Du Toit}, Johan T.",Modelling wildebeest population dynamics: Implications of predation and harvesting in a closed system,"Summary * 1Predation upon ungulates is generally considered to have a stronger regulatory effect on sedentary than migratory populations, with migratory populations maintaining higher densities. The blue wildebeest Connochaetus taurinus is a migratory species that has suffered a general decline in numbers and distribution across its species range. Wildebeest suffer from a fragmented distribution together with isolation of populations in closed reserves, preventing migratory movements and potentially allowing predators to benefit from a ‘captive’ prey resource. * 2In Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, the declining blue wildebeest population (from 1074 in 1995 to 594 in 2001) is sedentary because the park (50 000 ha) is completely enclosed by fencing. This population was used to model the potential effects of predation and harvesting. The Pilanesberg population was then compared with other wildebeest populations in southern Africa. * 3The model outputs demonstrated that increased levels of predation by lions Panthera leo on a ‘captive’ population of prey such as wildebeest, in combination with regular harvesting by park managers, can drive the population towards extinction. At lower levels of predation some other factor needs to act in combination with predation to drive the population into a decline. * 4During our study the lion biomass density in Pilanesberg was almost three times greater than that predicted by regression models of the stable relationship between lion and prey biomass densities across African savannas. Furthermore, the ratio of lion numbers to prey numbers was substantially higher than in most other African reserves. * 5Synthesis and applications. In African savannas, artificial closed systems provide advantages to large predators. If wildlife-cropping schemes are implemented in such systems without careful monitoring and regulation of large predators, then ungulate populations can decline more rapidly than managers expect.",Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,,,

These surveys encompassed marsh and canal habitats throughout most of the Everglades region, including the mangrove fringe of Florida Bay. Two studies provided systematically collected density information over a 20-year period, and documented the first local appearance of four introduced fishes based on their repeated absence in prior surveys. Those species displayed a pattern of rapid population growth followed by decline, then persistence at lower densities.

2099,"Trites, a W and Donnelly, C P",The decline of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in Alaska :,"1. The decline of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands between the late 1970s and 1990s may have been related to reduced availability of suitable prey. Many studies have shown that pinnipeds and other mammals suffering from nutritional stress typically exhibit reduced body size, reduced productivity, high mortality of pups and juveniles, altered blood chemistry and specific behavioural modifications. 2. Morphometric measurements of Steller sea lions through the 1970s and 1980s in Alaska indicate reduced body size. Reduced numbers of pups born and an apparent increase in juvenile mortality rates also appear to be nutritionally based. Blood chemistry analyses have further shown that Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands area exhibited signs of an acute phase reaction, or immune reaction, in response to unidentified physical and/or environmental stress. Behavioural studies during the 1990s have not noted any changes that are indicative of an overall shortage in the quantity of prey available to lactating female sea lions. 3. The data collected in Alaska are consistent with the hypothesis that Steller sea lions in the declining regions were nutritionally compromised because of the relative quality of prey available to them (chronic nutritional stress), rather than because of the overall quantity of fish per se (acute nutritional stress). This is further supported by captive studies that indicate the overall quality of prey that has been available to Steller sea lions in the declining popu- lation could compromise the health of Steller sea lions and hinder their recovery.

Atlantic populations are, however, also important for the species' survival and therefore we undertook a study to quantify the size and nesting trend of the Caribbean Costa Rica and Panama leatherback turtle rookery. Tag returns show that post-nesting females from the rookery disperse throughout the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic. Aerial and track survey results were used to estimate 5,759-12,893 nests per year between San Juan river and Chiriqui beach, making this the fourth largest rookery worldwide. Monitoring results from three beaches (Tortuguero, Pacuare and Gandoca) were used to examine any temporal trend in nesting using nonparametric regression. Nesting appeared to decline slightly from 1995 to 2003 but the trend could be an artefact of interannual variation in nest numbers. Explanations for the difference in nesting trends over the past 15 years for Pacific (rapid decline) and Caribbean (slight decline or stable) rookeries include: (1) hatching success on Caribbean beaches has been higher due to dispersed nesting, (2) fisheries bycatch has been greater in the Pacific, and (3) less overlap between fishing areas and leatherback turtle habitats in the Atlantic. Quantification of human-caused mortality of all life stages and knowledge of the marine habitats used by Atlantic leatherback turtles are required to facilitate the development and implementation of effective strategies to reduce threats and avoid a repeat of the decline that has occurred in the Pacific population.",Oryx,,,,,,,
2101,"Tro\""{e}ng, Sebastian and Rankin, Eddy","Long-term conservation efforts contribute to positive green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting trend at Tortuguero, Costa Rica","Worldwide, green turtle Chelonia mydas populations have declined and the species is classified as globally endangered. Tortuguero, Costa Rica, hosts the largest remaining green turtle rookery in the Atlantic basin. Tortuguero green turtles have been hunted since pre-Columbian times. Monitoring and conservation of the green turtle population began in 1955. The long-term efforts provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate the success of sea turtle conservation action and policies. Nest counts conducted 1971-2003 were analyzed to: (1) determine the nesting trend, (2) estimate rookery size and (3) identify events and policy decisions influencing the trend. A nonparametric regression model indicates a 417\% increase in nesting over the study period. Rookery size was defined as the mean number of nests 1999-2003 and estimated at 104,411 nestsyear-1, corresponding to 17,402-37,290 nesting femalesyear-1. A comparison with 34 index populations verifies Tortuguero as one of the two largest green turtle rookeries worldwide. Events and policy decisions in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama that comprise the main nesting, feeding and mating grounds for the Tortuguero population are likely to have had the greatest influence on green turtle survivorship. Conservation efforts and policies catalyzing increased hatchling production and decreased adult and juvenile mortality since 1963 have contributed to the positive nesting trend. The trend demonstrates that long-term conservation efforts can reverse nesting declines and offers hope that adequate management can result in recuperation of endangered sea turtle species. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of nesting pairs and the average number of chicks fledged per pair fluctuated over time, and the studied populations differed in the variance of both breeding success and number of breeding pairs. The variance of breeding success (both for the mean number of chicks and the proportion of successful nests) and the variance of the number of breeding pairs was not correlated with the extent of stable habitats (pastures, meadows, wetlands), other habitats (farmland), or with local population trends over time. We found a non-linear symmetrical relationship between annual mean reproductive success and its variance but only when considered as the proportion of successful nests (i.e., when individual nests are coded as a binary value: 0, no success; 1, success). No such relationship existed when success was expressed as the number of fledged chicks. Although a positive significant correlation occurred between fledgling numbers (discrete data) and the proportion of successful nests (binary data), we believe that the use of only binary data will be inadequate in more detailed analyses, such as population viability analysis.",Population Ecology,,,,,,,

Survey data have been modelled by means of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), as functions of depth, sampling position (latitude-longitude interaction) and year. Both depth and geographical coordinates were the key determinants of the presence of all species, while annual abundance fluctuations were found to be either insignificant or without any specific trend. The depth distribution patterns differed between species. M. mustelus, and T. marmorata, were more frequent in continental shelf areas (up to 180-200 m). R. asterias preferred the transitional depth zone between shelf and slope (around 200 m), while depths over 350 m (continental slope) favoured the presence of G. melastomus. Model predictions were used to generate density distributions maps, which could facilitate conservation plans in the area through the identification of abundance hotspots. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science",,,,,,,

For 19 years data on badger and sett numbers were collected by direct observation of a local population in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands. Analysis of these data show two different patterns of population growth. The first shows a slow growth in numbers and setts and the second an exponential growth. Spatial dynamics were also analysed in combination with habitat use. The first increase showed colonisation of the entire study area by social groups. Subsequently, new groups settled at the border of the area and inbetween established group territories.

We studied the effect of factors that vary both spatially and temporally on the nest site distribution of the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus in northeast Portugal, and influence the population dynamics of these cliff-dwelling birds. Several demographic parameters were studied in the field, and the age structure of the population was determined. Additionally we investigated how food availability affected population fluctuations. The vulture population was most sensitive to juvenile mortality according to our model results. Our models showed that a decrease in the present food supply resulted in a decrease in vulture abundance and, moreover, negatively affected the spatial distribution of the species by decreasing the number of breeding pairs per colony. The total quantity of sheep and goat biomass, a greater distance to the nearest unpaved road, and the presence of Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus at the breeding colonies showed a significant positive relationship to the numbers of Griffon Vulture breeding pairs. It is recommended that the available food supply in the most important foraging areas should be monitored and protected. Furthermore, to manage the community of cliff breeding raptors adequately, future research should identify and protect the most suitable breeding areas for each species. Human disturbance should be kept to a minimum by protecting breeding areas, especially in an area like Riba-Coa where species such as the Egyptian Vulture, Bonelli's Eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus and Griffon Vulture breed so close to each other.",Bird Conservation International,,,,,,,

Before 2004, snake pipefish were mainly found in coastal areas and have been reported only occasionally in oceanic waters. The oceanic form lives free in the water column while the coastal form is found among sea weeds or in sea grass beds. Abundance indices (numbers per hour fishing) from inshore surveys have remained at the same level, while those from offshore surveys show a very strong increase since 2004. The length distributions differ significantly between surveys, with coastal snake pipefishes being larger. Although the outward appearance of the coastal pipefishes seems different from the pelagic specimens, no differences were found when comparing taxonomic features. Apart from appearance the habitat is different for the two types of snake pipefish. The oceanic specimens of snake pipefish are much leaner than the coastal specimens. Stomach contents of the oceanic snake pipefishes revealed remains of relatively small calanoids (mean length 2.4??mm). The calanoid population has recently changed and is nowadays dominated by the smaller Calanus helgolandicus. Here we put forward the hypothesis that the sudden appearance of the snake pipefish in the deeper waters is a result of the change in the average lengths of calanoids which in turn is caused by changes in the hydroclimatic environment. The mass occurrence of the snake pipefish is affecting the ecosystem. Seabirds are feeding their chicks with them and they are also found in stomachs of fish and sea mammals. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The number of individuals and duration of their visit to Melbourne increased dramatically in the early 1980s, with the first year-round presence occurring in 1986 within the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. Anecdotal information suggests that the Melbourne colony has been continuously present since 1986; however, counts of roosting animals were sporadic between 1987 and 1993. Regular monthly counts that began in December 1993 confirm the continuous presence of the species in Melbourne from that date onwards. The growth of the size of the colony from 1994 onwards was exponential, with a peak in March 2003 (when counting ceased) at between 20 000 (static count) and 30 000 (flyout count) individuals. The number of P. poliocephalus within the colony fluctuated across the year, with a peak in summer/autumn (December–May) and a trough in winter/spring (July–October).

2138,"Rijn, Stef Van and Zijlstra, Menno and Bijlsma, Rob G.",n the Netherlands: Aspects of Habitat Scale and Quality,"The coastal wetlands of The Netherlands have always served as winter haunts for juvenile and immature White-tailed Eagles from breeding populations further north and east. Even as these populations were at their lowest ebb by the 1960s and 1970s, each winter a few individuals showed up, invariably favouring large wetlands with a good supply of wintering, mainly herbivorous, waterfowl. An analysis of the presence of eagles in the wetland Oostvaardersplassen showed that wintering numbers as well as the duration of individual stays increased as a function of the number and biomass of waterbirds present. During the pioneering stage of this newly reclaimed area the dynamic vegetation produced huge seed supplies that attracted vast numbers of herbivorous waterbirds. The increase in eagle numbers in the Oostvaardersplassen reserve preceded the recovery of the northern and eastern breeding populations of Whitetailed Eagles, but did not increase any further after reaching a maximum of 3–4 wintering birds, despite the fact that wintering numbers elsewhere in The Netherlands continued to rise in the wake of the increasing breeding population elsewhere in Europe. It is argued that ‘core area’ Oostvaardersplassen became saturated each winter in the 2000s. Additional eagles reaching The Netherlands spent the winter at alternative sites with smaller food supplies. In 1997–99, new waterbodies were created in the dry border zone of Oostvaardersplassen. The subsequent boost in waterbirds and fish may have triggered — in combination with the presence of undisturbed breeding habitat — the summering, and eventual breeding, of White-tailed Eagles from 2004 onwards. Water management towards improving dynamics in larger wetlands (both estuarine and riverine) may further boost food supplies for waterfowl and, hence, create suitable habitat for White-tailed Eagles elsewhere in The Netherlands.",Ardea,,,,,,,

This exposes them to risks of collisions and probable acoustic and physical disturbance. This species is also the target of whale-watching operations. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual population size, survival rate, and population growth rate of pilot whales occurring in the Strait and their inter-annual variation using photo-identification. A robust design was used to estimate all three parameters. A total of 10,784 individual pilot whale fins were photographed and analyzed. The population size estimation in summer ranged from a low of 147 individuals in 1999 to a high of 265 individuals in 2003. The annual population growth rate was estimated from mark recapture models to be 5.5\%. The survival rate of adults was estimated at 0.982 (95\% CI: 0.955–0.993). The same individuals have been observed between years. This suggests that this population is resident in the Strait, at least during summer.

In this study, the economical costs of the upkeep of a white stork Ciconia ciconia colony at a cattle farm over a six-year period were evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of ash lopping in nest site selection and the efficacy of nest removal in controlling the population of this species was analysed. Location: The ash dehesa studied was located in the Northern area of the Madrid province, in both Soto del Real and Manzanares el Real localities (40º 44’N, 3º 49’E), from 1999 to 2004. Methods: Estimation was made of the economical cost of white stork colony maintenance by esti- mating the total weight of branches and bud shoots on the ashes. The tree type (lopped or unlopped) was noted to determine nest site selection where new nests were established in the subsequent year after lop- ping. Finally, it was recorded if removed nests (by the Regional Government as a method of population control) were less like to rebuilt in function of previous breeding success (failed or not). Results: Storks mainly selected lopped trees as nest sites. To avoid the increase of white stork pairs in the colony, lopping was not carried out in subsequent years, causing economical losses to landowners (a minimum of 13,902.33 €in six years). In addition, due to the high nest-site fidelity in this species, the to- tal number of nests in the colony was not reduced by nest removal. Nests that contained a pair that failed in their reproductive attempt were less likely to be rebuilt in the consecutive breeding season. The results showed that selective nest removal (removal of nests which failed the previous year) might be a more ef- fective method for population control than nest removal methods used to date. Conclusions: Due to the low total economic cost of colony maintenance, it is proposed that econom- ical compensation by the regional government to the farm owners will be a more effective management measure than nest removal.",Ardeola,,,,,,,

The mouth was open during March 2007 and 2008 with high-turbidity river water flowing into the sea, and was closed during August 2007 and 2008. Fish were sampled biannually with seine-nets during March and August in 2007 and 2008 at five sites throughout the system. A total of 5 886 fish from 59 species were recorded, with a higher number of species and CPUE in the Mfolozi Estuary than in the Msunduzi Estuary. Seine-net catches were dominated by Ambassis gymcocephalus, Ambassis natalensis, Leiognathus equula and Valamugil cunnesius. Juveniles of marine spawning species were present throughout the study period, even when the mouth was closed. The sampled fish assemblage structure was influenced by significant temporal differences between the four biannual sampling seasons, with relatively small spatial differences between the sampling areas. Temperature, salinity and sediment characteristics were most responsible for the structure of the fish assemblage as sampled by seine-nets. The results emphasise the importance of the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system as an alternate nursery area.",African Journal of Aquatic Science,,,,,,,
2153,"Gertseva, Vladlena V.","The population dynamics of the longnose skate, Raja rhina, in the northeast Pacific Ocean","The longnose skate, Raja rhina, is the most commonly landed skate species in the northeast Pacific Ocean. It also dominates survey catches in the area. Existing knowledge on skate biology and fisheries suggests that large skate species with late sexual maturation, like the longnose skate, are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, and if overfished they are slow to recover. Historically, in the US Pacific Coast skates have not supported directed fisheries, but have been taken as bycatch in other commercially important fisheries. For the past 13 years, landed catches of skates in waters off Washington, Oregon and California have significantly increased. Using the Stock Synthesis 2 modeling framework, a population model for the longnose skate was developed to assess the current state of the stock and reconstruct its past dynamics. Model results indicate that the longnose skate spawning biomass has slowly declined since 1915; the current stock biomass is estimated as 66\% of its unexploited level. Uncertainty in regards to fishery-dependent data and female maturity parameters was explored through sensitivity analyses. The model results indicate that it is important to conduct species-specific identification in the fishery and monitor discard of longnose skate to improve the accuracy of fishery catch data and make assessment conclusions more robust. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Detecting such effects, however, will often require sampling on an individual level and at the appropriate spatial and temporal scale. This study documents substantial variation in survival and growth of stream-dwelling brown trout Salmo trutta from a small Norwegian stream. The data is based on seasonal capture2013recaptures of individually marked trout on fixed stations during eight years. The fish were small-sized, rarely reaching sizes larger than 20 cm and ages older than seven years. Density varied between 0.220130.8 fish m22122. Variation in survival and recapture probabilities was analysed using program MARK. Apparent survival (the probability of being alive and present within the study area) generally decreased with increasing trout density and increasing drought level (measured as lowest observed water flow) during both winter and summer. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between density and water flow, indicating that density-dependent effects on survival predominated when environmental conditions were benign (no drought), while density-independent processes were most important under harsh environmental conditions (drought). Observed length-at-age during autumn indicated a more or less linear growth trajectory throughout life, and no effect of density, water flow or temperature was found. However, using the individual-based capture2013recapture data to estimated specific growth rate, significant positive effects of water flow and temperature and a negative effect of density were identified. Thus, the capture2013recapture data suggest a strong potential for population regulation at the rather low densities found in this stream, and regulation may occur both through effects on survival and growth.",Oikos,,,,,,,

These data, collected by mostly volunteer observers, were analysed for seven species of dabbling ducks using data from 35 years up to 2002. As site coverage is best during the midwinter census trend analyses focused on January data. Trends were calculated for three periods: 35, 25 and 10 years. Eurasian Wigeon increased strongly for all three periods except for the North Sea coast in the last ten years, which were influenced by two consecutive cold winters. The increase was greatest during a period of extremely mild winters between the end of the 1980s and the mid 1990s. Changes at the North Sea and the Baltic Sea coast occurred almost in parallel. Gadwall numbers went up as well during all periods considered, with a very pronounced increase in NW Germany since the end of the 1980s. Eurasian Teal numbers increased in the S, fluctuated (with an overall slight increase) in the NW, but decreased in the NE due to a pronounced and ongoing decline since the early 1990s. This may be related to improvement in water quality of rivers in E Germany, where most of wintering Eurasian Teals are found, but more detailed analyses are necessary. The most common dabbling duck, Mallard, declined in most regions and periods. This negative trend is confirmed for S Germany since the early 1980s, while in the NW and NE parts the decline was most pronounced during the last decade. Northern Pintail, which winters only in low numbers and few sites, increased, but especially in the N fluctuated according to winter severity. Garganey, for which only data from W Germany were available, decreased strongly until the mid 1980s, but stabilised or moderately increased afterwards (analysed month: April). Northern Shoveler, which is present during winter only in low numbers, showed an overall positive trend due to an increase during the first decade, but remained stable or fluctuated since. In all species present in winter, especially in the NW and NE parts, a moderate to strong relationship was found between yearly indices and winter severity.",Vogelwelt,,,,,,,

This has been achieved in part by maintaining ongoing monitoring as part of intensive protection and biological management. However, the efficacy of population monitoring methods has not been assessed. Rhino surveillance records and rainfall data were used to determine which ecological and operational factors affected monthly rhino sightings by vehicle patrols in Masai Mara, Kenya. Comparisons of sightings capture rates using different ground-based and aerial methods were also conducted. Stepwise multiple regression revealed a model (adjusted R-2 = 0.66) predicting monthly rhino sightings with four significant factors; number of patrols, rhino population size, rainfall over the previous 2 months and a dummy variable for the month of August. The latter two variables represent the negative effects of long grass growth and the annual wildebeest migration on rhino sightings, and result in seasonal deficiencies in monitoring. During vehicle patrols, 51\% of sightings were made whilst moving, and 49\% were made whilst stationary and scanning with binoculars, although sightings capture rate was an order of magnitude higher when stationary. Equally, sightings capture rate from hot air balloons was twice that during vehicle-based patrols, although with less accuracy of identification. The introduction of foot patrols would increase patrol cost-effectiveness and fill seasonal troughs, thereby providing better all-round surveillance.",African Journal of Ecology,,,,,,,

Abundance and biomass both peaked in late summer and fall before declining significantly in winter, a result of southward migration to lower Bay areas that were not sampled. Production also peaked between summer and fall, a consequence of rapid growth and recruitment of larval and juvenile anchovies. Annual production of young-of-the-year (YOY) anchovy was 856.69 g/100 m super(3), 87.9\% of which was produced in the first 3 mo of life. Production by YOY anchovy accounted for nearly all annual production (92.6\%) in this short-lived species. Total annual production was estimated to be 233 014 t wet wt in upper to mid-Bay regions. The production/biomass (P/B) ratio for YOY anchovy was 8.07 when larval and early juvenile stages were included but only 0.97 without those stages. The estimated translocation of nitrogen biomass from the upper and mid Bay to the lower Bay via anchovy migration was 1027 t N during fall 1990, which is approximately 0.8\% of the annual N input to Chesapeake Bay. Estimated population consumption (primarily zooplankton) by bay anchovy ranged from 5.29 to 12.81 g dry wt/100 m super(3)/d in August and from 5.35 to 6.78 g dry wt/100 m super(3)/d in October, suggesting that consumption by larvae and juveniles of this species could significantly impact populations of its plankton prey",Marine Ecology Progress Series,,,,,,,

Since scientific divers represent a small portion of the total number of divers worldwide, the use of non-scientific divers could drastically increase the number of observations needed to monitor broad-scale, long-term trends. Here, we use 83,940 surveys collected by trained volunteer divers to examine spatial and temporal trends of the most frequently sighted elasmobranch species in the greater-Caribbean, the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis). Despite being relatively common and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, little is known about the status of this species. In total, yellow stingrays were observed on 5,658 surveys (6.7\% sighting frequency) with the highest occurrence in the regions surrounding Cuba. Overall, sighting frequency declined from 20.5\% in 1994 to 4.7\% in 2007—a standardized decline rate of −0.11. However, these trends were not consistent in all regions. The strongest decline occurred in the Florida Keys, the most sampled region, where trends were similar among all areas, habitats and depths. In contrast, sighting frequency significantly increased in Jamaica where large fishes are severely depleted. We discuss possible explanations for these changes including habitat degradation, exploitation and changes in trophic interactions. Our results suggest large-scale changes in yellow stingray abundance that have been unnoticed by the scientific community. Thus, our study highlights the value of non-scientific divers for collecting data that can be used to understand population trends of otherwise poorly studied species.",Environmental Biology of Fishes,,,,,,,

This study examines predictions concerning the effects of establishing a protected area in Nepal on tigers (Panthera tigris), leopards (Panthera pardus), and their ungulate prey. Within a part of the park, after 22 years the total density of wild ungulates had increased fourfold, to ca. 200 animals/km2, almost exclusively due to a remarkable increase in chital deer (Axis axis). Tiger density also increased markedly to nearly 20 animals/100 km2, whereas leopard density did not and was ca. 5 animals/100 km2. The prediction that grazers should increase more than browsers was only partially supported. The prediction of positive density dependence in prey selection was not supported. Instead, the most abundant species (chital and hog deer, Axis porcinus) were killed less frequently than expected, whereas the lower-density wild boar (Sus scrofa) was preferred. Predictions that (i) initially rare species suffer highest predation was partially supported, that (ii) predation is highest among the most abundant prey was not supported, and that (iii) predation is highest among the most preferred prey independently of their densities was supported. Clearly, the conservation efforts adopted in Bardia were successful, as both tigers and their natural prey base increased. However, the positive numerical response of tigers limited and depressed the abundance of some prey species. Thus, conservation activities aimed at restoring large predators are likely to change in the composition of the overall mammal community, potentially eliminating rare but preferred prey species. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

2175,"Li, David and Wei, Zuo and Bloem, Andrea and Delany, Simon",Status of waterbirds in Asia Status of Waterbirds in Asia,"Background    The Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) was initiated in 1987 and runs in parallel with other waterbird censuses carried out in Africa, Europe, Central and West Asia and Latin America under the umbrella of the International Waterbird Census (IWC), which is organised by Wetlands International. The IWC is the largest and longest-running internationally coordinated faunal monitoring programme in the world.   The AWC started on the Indian subcontinent in January 1987 and has grown rapidly to cover the rest of Asia, Australasia and eastern Russia. During 1987-2007, a total of over 6,700 sites in 27 countries were counted at least once.   The AWC takes place annually, during the second and third weeks of January, and is carried out by volunteers interested in collecting information on waterbirds and wetlands as a basis for contributing to their conservation.   The data collected by the AWC have been used in various reports and contribute to a range of conservation activities at levels from local to global, including:   •  species and site conservation and research programmes and campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of wetlands in many countries;  •  the development of national wetland and waterbird conservation Action Plans and Strategies;  •  the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, by identifying Wetlands of International Importance through regular monitoring of waterbirds at  Ramsar List sites and other wetlands;  •  the Convention on Migratory Species, by monitoring the status of migratory waterbirds and their habitats;  •  the Convention on Biological Diversity’s goal of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity;  •  the implementation of the Asia-Pacific Migratory Waterbird Conservation Strategy (1996-2006), through monitoring of waterbirds and their sites, including sites listed under the three East Asian – Australasian Migratory Waterbird Site Networks (for shorebirds, cranes and Anatidae);  •  the West/Central Asian Site Network for the Siberian Crane and other waterbirds (WCASN);  •  BirdLife International’s Important Bird Area (IBA) programme;   •  IUCN/BirdLife’s globally threatened birds programme; and  •  Wetlands International’s Waterbird Population Estimates (WPE) programme.    In addition to the wide range of applications outlined above, the AWC has been extremely successful in achieving its primary objectives of:   •  providing the basis for estimates of waterbird populations;  •  monitoring changes in waterbird numbers and distribution by regular, standardised counts of representative wetlands;  •  improving knowledge of little-known waterbird species and wetland sites;  •  increasing awareness of the importance of waterbirds and their wetland habitats at local, national and international levels.    The AWC has also built and strengthened national networks of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers and facilitated their training as an integral part of achieving its objectives.    As a result of their increased awareness, local people and governments are now setting about the conservation of important sites in most of the countries covered by the census. However, coverage and conservation efforts vary considerably, and the increasing pressure on wetlands and their biodiversity highlights the need to strengthen the programme to tackle ever-growing challenges. These include global climate change and its far-reaching impacts on changes in distribution and types of wetlands, as well as seasonal variations linked to probable changes in the carrying capacities of the wetlands used by the waterbirds for feeding, nesting and roosting.    Highlights of the 1987–2007 censuses  Twenty-seven countries participated in the censuses, and 6,705 sites were covered at least once between 1987 and 2007. Of the sites covered, 116 were Ramsar sites, nine were World Heritage sites, eight were Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) heritage sites, nine were Man And Biosphere (MAB) reserves, 502 were IBAs, 55 were East Asian-Australasian Flyway Network sites and 417 were nationally protected areas.     A total of 1,387 sites met at least one of two criteria of internationally important sites according to the Ramsar Convention. Of these, 312 sites were reported to support more than 20,000 waterbirds, and 1,382 sites recorded more than 1\% of the biogeographic population of at least one species of waterbird. In the most recent five years (from 2003-2007), a total of 2,963 sites was counted, including 906 of the 1,387 internationally important sites identified by earlier counts. During this latter five-year period, only 673 of these sites met at least one of two criteria of internationally important sites. A total of 671 sites recorded more than 1\% of the biogeographic population of at least one species of waterbird, and 137 supported more than 20,000 waterbirds. The remaining 233 sites no longer met either of the international importance criteria.   Totals of 349 species of waterbirds and 74 species of wetland-dependent species (covering 18 species of sea birds, 44 birds of prey and 12 kingfishers) were recorded. The 28 most numerous species for which more than 100,000 individuals were reported were, in order of decreasing abundance,  Common Coot, Baikal Teal, Northern Pintail, Mallard, Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Shoveler, Greater White-fronted Goose, Greater Scaup, Lesser Whistling Duck, Gadwall, Tufted Duck, Asian Openbill, Dunlin, Eurasian Wigeon, Bar-tailed Godwit, Bean Goose, Great Knot, Garganey, Spot-billed Duck, Common Black-headed Gull, Black-tailed Godwit, Ruff,  Red-necked Stint, Demoiselle Crane, Cattle Egret, Little Stint and Greater Flamingo.  Fifty-two of the species recorded are recognised as globally threatened, according to BirdLife International (2008a). They include nine Critically Endangered, 16 Endangered and 27 Vulnerable species. In addition, 25 Near Threatened species were recorded. One hundred and seventy-four of the species covered by the census are listed in the Appendices of the Convention on Migratory Species. Of these, 28 are listed in Appendix I while 146 species are listed in Appendix II. Additionally, 66 species are listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); 15 and 51 species are listed in Appendices I and II respectively.  Fishing, agricultural development, hunting, excessive cattle grazing, pollution of wetlands through domestic sewage, pesticides and fertilisers, and overgrowth of vegetation were reported as the main on-site uses and threats. Wetland reclamation is believed to be the most destructive cumulative threat to the wetlands and their use by waterbirds.   The collection of data was coordinated and carried out by a dedicated volunteer network of National/Sub-national Coordinators and over 1,000 volunteers in 22 countries.   The AWC covers the following four main regions: South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and Australasia.   South Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka)   A total of 4,236 sites in South Asia were counted at least once. Totals of 193 species of  waterbirds and 41 species of wetland-dependent birds were counted, 24 of which are Globally Threatened and 16 of which are Near Threatened.     Southeast Asia (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor Leste and Vietnam)  A total of 1,248 sites in Southeast Asia were counted at least once. Totals of 211 waterbird and 34 wetland-dependent species were counted, 25 of which are Globally Threatened and 16 of which are Near Threatened.    East Asia (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, Republic of Korea, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Mongolia and eastern Russia)  A total of 864 sites in East Asia were counted at least once. Totals of 198 species of waterbirds and 37 species of wetland-dependent birds were counted, 28 of which are Globally Threatened and eight of which are Near Threatened.    Australasia (Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea)   A total of 357 sites were counted at least once. Totals of 160 waterbird and 19 species of wetland-dependent birds were counted, seven of which are Globally Threatened and eight of which are Near Threatened.    Status and distribution of species   Individual status reports are presented for a selection of 339 waterbird species (292 maps), including 44 Globally Threatened and 20 Near Threatened species for which relatively significant data are available. Internationally important sites for each species were identified according to the 1\% criterion provided in Waterbird Population Estimates – Fourth Edition (Wetlands International 2006).    Statistical Analysis  Statistical analysis of population trends using the data in the AWC database was undertaken using TRIM software. The software requires a high proportion of sites to have been counted in a majority of years, and in most countries, site coverage in space and time is only now attaining this level. The data quality is highest in the East Asia and Australasia regions, and trend analyses were successful for a small selection of species in these two regions. Although a very impressive number of sites have been included in the census in the other regions, coverage of the same sites from year to year was often too inconsistent to attempt population trend analyses using TRIM. Example trend graphs for eight duck species in the East Asia region suggests that four of them decreased between 1998 and 2007, while three are stable, and only one, Baikal Teal, increased in  this period.  The species which appears to be in strongest decline in this region is the Mallard, but caution is necessary when interpreting this finding because trends in adjoining regions are not yet sufficiently well known. The trend analyses also confirmed the pattern of increase for the Globally Threatened Black-faced Spoonbill.  ",Population (English Edition),,,,,,,

Diomedea exulans populations declined markedly, but since 1986 have shown slow recovery. The population of the endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis appears to have similarly recovered since 1985, but remains close to extinction. A demographic study of the Crozet population indicates that the earlier decline was mainly the result of increased adult mortality, and secondarily of low recruitment. Satellite tracking studies of breeding birds and band recoveries of non-breeding birds indicate that during and outside the breeding season these population are in contact with long-term fisheries, mainly the pelagic Japanese southern blue-fin tuna Thunnus maccoyii fishery and to a lesser extent the Patagonian tooth-fish Dissostichus eleginoides fishery operating on the Kerguelen shelf. Decreased fishing effort and a concentration outside the central Indian Ocean by the Japanese fishery during recent years has probably resulted in the slow recovery of these albatross populations as a result of improved adult survival and recruitment. Long-line fisheries still represent a major threat to great albatross populations, most of which are still declining in the Southern Ocean. Possible conservation measures to reduce mortality in the fishery and to reduce contacts between units and foraging albatrosses are examined.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Around the Medes Islands marine reserve (Spain, NW Mediterranean) patterns of fish catch diversity, catch (CPUE) and income (IPUE) were assessed and the economic value of diversity for local fisheries was explored by combining a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis with geostatistics. 2. Catch data were derived from the trammel net fleet operating around the MPA to gain information on species diversity, functional diversity, functional redundancy, CPUE and IPUE. 3. Results revealed significant impact of both the fishing prohibition in the MPA and the presence of seagrass beds on diversity metrics, catch and income. Clear differences in functional redundancy in fish assemblages were found within the study area, indicating greater resilience of the fish assemblage against fishing pressure or human impact close to the MPA (p2 km). In contrast, fish assemblages beyond 2km of the MPA border are more vulnerable to disturbance. High values of diversity, CPUE and IPUE overlapped close to the MPA border and close to seagrass beds. 4. The spatial approach developed suggests that, in addition to the more commonly studied effect of density- dependent spillover of adult fish, increased levels of ecological diversity and economic diversity can also result in fisheries benefits of an MPA. Hence, the fishing regulations in and around the Medes Islands marine reserve have shown that biological conservation and fisheries benefits can be complementary in the long-term, which should be considered in future policies for MPAs or MPA networks.

2189,"Whitehead, Hal and Christal, Jenny and Dufault, Susan",Past and distant whaling and the rapid decline of sperm whales off the Galapagos Islands,"It is generally expected that exploited whale populations should rebuild following the end of whaling. Using photographic identification of individuals during a series of field projects, we studied female and immature sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) that visit the waters off the Gal\'{a}pagos Islands, Ecuador. Analysis of mark-recapture data, using a likelihood model, indicates the population decreased at a rate of about 20\% per year (95\% c.i. 7–32\%) between 1985-1995. During the study period the animals were not hunted and were not obviously the subject of other immediate anthropogenic threats. Rates at which research vessels encountered whales also fell over this interval. The decline seems to be due principally to migration into waters off the Central and South American mainland. The population also has a very low recruitment rate, about 0.05 calves/female/year, as indicated by rates of observation of calves. Although other causes cannot be ruled out, both the high emigration rate and low recruitment rate are probably related to heavy whaling in Peruvian waters which ended in 1981. Whales from the Gal\'{a}pagos are moving east to fill productive but depopulated waters near the coast, and the virtual elimination of large breeding males (in their late twenties and older) from the region has lowered pregnancy rates. The case of the Gal\'{a}pagos sperm whales strongly suggests that exploitation can continue to have substantial negative impacts on the size and recruitment rate of an animal population well outside the range of the hunt and for at least a decade after it has ended.",Conservation Biology,,,,,,,
2190,"Whitehead, Hal","Trends in cetacean abundance in the Gully submarine canyon, 1988-2011, highlight a 21\% per year increase in Sowerby's beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens)","Long time series of abundance data have advanced ecological understanding. I examined trends in incidental sightings of cetaceans in the Gully and neighbouring submarine canyons on the edge of the Scotian Shelf during summers between 1988 and 2011. There were a total of 2938 h of sighting effort in good conditions. I fit Poisson models to the sighting count data, and examined the support for models that included parameters representing monthly variations in abundance, trends over years, and different sighting rates in the different canyons. Sowerby’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens (Sowerby, 1804)) were sighted 3.5 timesmoreoften in the Shortland and Haldimand canyons, compared with the Gully. For all other species, the best-supported models did not include differential sighting rates between canyons. The sighting rates of four species decreased over the 23 years of the study, while three species increased. Some of these trendsmaybe related to changes in overall population size or variation in food resources, but a remarkable 21\%/year increase in Sowerby’s beaked whale is perhaps most plausibly explained by a reduction in anthropogenic disturbance.",Canadian Journal of Zoology,,,,,,,

2192,"Peninsula, Kola","Evaluation of the effects of catch-and-release angling on the Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) of the Ponoi River , Kola Peninsula , Russian Federation","We studied the effects of catch-and-release fishing upon the Ponoi River's Atlantic salmon populations. The Ponoi River is located on the Kola Peninsula of the Russian Federation, and has recently been developed for sports fishing. Angler exploitation rates are estimated to range from 10.4\% to 19\% of the river's salmon, thus the possibility of significant levels of post-release mortality is of concern. We radio-tracked fish caught and released by anglers in 1995 and 1996. Despite our simple equipment and the large size of the river, we were able to relocate most fish. These fish had high rates of survival, and anglers recaptured about 11\% of them per year a second time. This is very similar to the recapture rates observed for Floy-tagged fish released in an angler-based mark-recapture assessment. We also held 62 angled fish for 24 hours in a live cage to evaluate rates of delayed mortality. Only one of the 62 fish died, and it was heavily scarred with gillnet marks. Most fish that are fatally stressed by angling die within 24 h (e.g., Booth et al. 1995). In 1996, up to 10\% of our Floy-tagged fish were angled and released twice, and about 0.5\% were angled and released three times. No significant biases were detected in the post-angling movement patterns of these fish. The multiple captures and lack of movement bias suggest that fish behavior was little altered by the angling experience. Nine fish Floy tagged prior to spawning have been recovered as typical emaciated kelts. Three were killed, and a post mortem exam showed all had spawned. Parr numbers at all monitored sites have been steadily increasing since the advent of catch-and-releasing fishing. By contrast, parr growth rates are generally unchanged or significantly better.",Ecology of Freshwater Fish,,,,,,,

We calculated life tables based on the age structure of hunted grey seals in the Finnish sea area. The catch was treated as a sample of the dying part of the population. The catch was male biased and the proportions of female pups and mature males in the catch increased from the early to late 2000s. Annual mortality rate of the youngest age classes was high and higher among males than females, which resulted in low sex ratio (males to females) of the population. Sex ratio was, however, higher in the latter years due to the increased mortality rate of females, especially those < 10 years of age. Accordingly, the proportion of mature females in the population decreased and relatively fewer pups were produced during the late 2000s than in the early 2000s.",Annales Zoologici Fennici,,,,,,,

The yellow-shouldered blackbird populations have since declined, about 770-1200 remaining (470-900 on Mona Island) by 1982-1986 compared to a population of about 2400 in 1975. Nearly all nests of blackbirds in most of its habitats are parasitized by cowbirds. This significantly reduces nesting success, but blackbirds have evolved no defenses against brood parasitism. Removal of cowbirds from the yellow-shouldered blackbird nesting grounds, modeled after similar programmes for the brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater on Kirtland's warbler Dendroica kirtlandii nesting areas, significantly increased blackbird production. Blackbirds readily accept nest boxes, and breeding populations can be established in otherwise unusable sites and can be concentrated in mangrove habitats, were they are more easily protected by cowbird removal. Furthermore, yellow-shouldered blackbird pairs using cavities, including nest boxes, fledged more young per nest than pairs using open nests.",Biological Conservation,,,,,,,

Both woodlots lost species gradually over the years. Some birds avoided hard cane-field edges, preferring soft bushy edges. Of open-area species, 22 seemed to have disappeared by 1997 due to earlier high El Ni\~{n}o rains or rare permanently open habitats in the sugar cane; 17 new species were mostly nocturnal ones not noted earlier, or occasional visitors. Forest and borders lost 31 species, gaining five of dry regions and one winter visitor. Several migrants from the south appeared only in wet years before recent greenhouse effects, some resident birds were hunted, and canopy hummingbirds were perhaps still present.

An outbreak of canine parvovirus (CPV) in the wolf population on Isle Royale allowed us to test the transient effects of an introduced pathogen and global climatic variation on the dynamics of a three-level food chain. Following the introduction of CPV, wolf numbers plummeted, precipitating a switch from top-down to bottom-up regulation of the moose population; consequently, the influence of climate on moose population growth rate doubled. This demonstrates that synergistic interactions between pathogens and climate can lead to shifts in trophic control, and suggests that predators in this system may play an important role in dampening the effects of climate change on the dynamics of their prey.",Ecology Letters,,,,,,,

Significant differences in the relative abundance of common snook among the estuarine areas suggested marked variation in common snook population abundance and densities on a regional scale. The highest adjusted mean relative abundance of common snook occurred in the southern Indian River Lagoon (4.68 fish/haul; SE = 0.08), followed by Tampa Bay (3.36 fish/haul; SE = 0.11), Charlotte Harbor (2.13 fish/haul; SE = 0.10), and the northern Indian River Lagoon (0.76 fish/haul; SE = 0.21). Several common factors (e.g., mangrove and seagrass habitat, salinity, and water temperature) among the estuarine areas were linked with common snook relative abundance and distributions, allowing us to better understand how these fish interact with their environment in different regions of Florida.",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,,,,,,,

Where historical or current estimates of population size are not adjusted for detection probabilities they may be too inaccurate to provide meaningful estimates of trends and thus monitoring methods need to be adapted. Here, we use data from the Endangered huemul deer Hippocamelus bisulcus to outline a framework to develop accurate robust estimates of detection probabilities that can be incorporated into new surveys in a cost-effective way and applied to existing survey data sets. In particular, by retroactively estimating detection probabilities for surveys of huemul, we show that current survey methods for huemul are inadequate to determine population trends reliably. Based on these results we propose a new monitoring method for the huemul and discuss the importance of estimating accuracies of historical survey data to ensure that changes in the abundance of the species reflect real population trends and are not an artefact of variation over time in the accuracy of survey data.",Oryx,,,,,,,

Four sub-populations, with a total of ca. 750 individuals, were located in mixed deciduous and evergreen broad leaf forest at 800-2200 m asl. Identified threats to the species include (1) accidentally injured or killed by poaching, (2) loss or alteration of habitat through wood extraction, and (3) loss or alteration of habitat through economic activities, such as building projects and illegal mining. We recommend that several actions can be taken to alleviate the anthropogenic pressure on the ecosystem including: (1) designating specific forest reserve for sustainable wood extraction, (2) utilizing biogas to reduce firewood demands, (3) introducing local people to bamboo utilization for generate greater cash income, (4) educating for young people and encouraging them to work in developed areas, and (5) encouraging the villagers to move out the mountain. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We used an experimental paradigm employed previously with capuchin monkeys and children, in which a subject (observer) was presented with a novel food under three conditions: (i) Presence: group members did not have food; (ii) Different color: group members received familiar food whose color differed from that of the observer’s novel food; (iii) Same color: group members received familiar food of the same color as the observer’s novel food.Althoughmostcommonmarmosetstastedand/oratethenovelfood, none of the Goeldi’s monkeys ate it and only two sampled it. Differences in home range size and early social experience might explain the divergent behavior of the two species. Observers of both species similarly attended to group members and their visual attention increased with the number of group members eating, especially when the observer’s and group members’ foods were perceptually similar. However, we observed social inﬂuences on explorative behavior in Goeldi’s monkeys but not on explorative or eating behavior in common marmosets. This result might be explained by the different pattern of response to novel food observed in the two species. Moreover, social inﬂuences on Goeldi’s monkeys’ behavior were nonspeciﬁc, i.e. they were not based on an appreciation that the food is safe because eaten by group members.",American Journal of Primatology,,,,,,,

The world population declined to c. 220,000 individuals in the late 1990s from an estimated 400,000-500,000 in the 1960s. The species has a limited global wintering distribution, occurring in marine habitats in north-east Europe, islands close to Kamchatka in Russia, and the eastern Aleutian Islands and south-west Alaska. European wintering numbers were estimated at 30,000-50,000 in the early 1990s, when the population was considered of favourable conservation status. Recent census data from the most important European wintering sites show annual declines of 8\% in Norway since 1984, 9\% in Estonia since 1994 and 22\% in Lithuania since 1995, suggesting an overall 65\% reduction in Europe. Counts in 1994 suggested that 30-50\% of the European population wintered in Russia at that time. Current census data from Russia show similar declines along monitored sections of the Kola Peninsula wintering grounds since 1994. Accounting for trends in Russia, the current European wintering population could possibly stand at 10,000-15,000 individuals (a more than a 50\% decline in 10 years), qualifying this population as Endangered under \{IUCN\} criteria. The changes in \{Baltic/Norwegian\} wintering numbers did not correlate with changes in the extent of ice-free marine waters in the Kola \{Peninsula/White\} Sea areas, but changes in annual numbers in Norway were correlated with winter North Atlantic Oscillation indices. Variation in annual numbers in the Baltic Sea correlated with projected number of juveniles among wintering birds. However, none of the possible causes discussed in this paper could fully explain the decline in Steller's Eider, confirming the need for comprehensive monitoring of the population throughout its winter range and for cohesive demographic monitoring to target effective conservation action.",Bird Conservation International,,,,,,,

D C and Engen, Steinar and Andersen, Reidar and Bretten, Tord",Predicting the growth of a small introduced muskox population using population prediction intervals,"1. A key issue in ecology is the prediction of future population fluctuations. Such population predictions are fundamental for population-viability analysis and are essential for assessing the implications of various management actions. Development of reliable population predictions is however, difficult because it requires estimation and modelling of the separate effects of the deterministic components of the population dynamics as well as the stochastic influences on the population fluctuations. Here we model the stochastic dynamics of an introduced population of muskox Ovibos moschatus in the Dovrefjell mountains of central Norway, using a simple model without density regulation. Our aim is to examine quantitatively factors affecting the accuracy of the population projections by applying the concept of Population Prediction Interval (PPI). 2. The long-term growth rate was \% = 0·0511, assuming no density dependence. The environmental variance was relatively large ($\sigma$e\^{}2 = 0·0159). This gives a deterministic growth rate of r = 0·0591. However, accounting for losses due to various kinds of human activities resulted in a nearly doubling of s ( \% = 0·0980). 3. Autumn temperature and late winter snow depth were each able to explain a signif- icant proportion of the annual variation in population growth rates. 4. The impact of environmental stochasticity made the PPI wide after only a few years. Uncertainties in the estimates of the population parameters were quite small and had a minor impact on the PPI. 5. A sensitivity analysis showed that ignoring demographic stochasticity led to an overestimate of the environmental variance $\sigma$e\^{}2, but that the impact on the width of the PPI was small. 6. This study shows that reliable projections of future population growth, even based on simple population models without density regulation, are dependent on assessment of the accuracy in the population predictions that must be based on estimating and modelling the stochastic influences on the population dynamics.",Journal of Animal Ecology,,,,,,,
