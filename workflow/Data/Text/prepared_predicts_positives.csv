0,bees are believed to be dominant pollen vectors in tropical forests yet studies specific to bees in south east asia are rare regeneration and restoration of the rapidly disappearing lowland forests of this region are reliant on bees thus there is an urgent need for forest bee data at the community level bee communities of eight forested sites in johor malaysia and singapore were surveyed three times each from february to august at the below canopy level these sites ranged from relatively undisturbed primary lowland dipterocarp forests to late secondary forests and exotic forests including an oil palm plantation we attempted to elucidate the environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees bee abundance in particular that of apidae was significantly higher in larger primary forests than other types of forests however bee species richness was higher in disturbed forests the distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables closely related to forest disturbance and resource abundance such as the density of big trees diameter at breast height – cm temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs more stingless bees trigona spp were found where trees were larger and ambient conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower the differences between the bee communities in forests of urban singapore and primary forests in johor may indicate that ecological processes in the forests of singapore in particular pollination may be changing however pollination may not be totally intact in the primary forests surveyed as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate the role of important pollinators especially bees for the long term survival of tropical lowland forests is poorly understood our study indicates that we urgently need more thorough understanding of pollination and pollinators as some bee species appear to be disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests,Journal of Applied Ecology,bee diversity along a disturbance gradient in tropical lowland forests of south east asia
1,the maintenance of grasslands as distinct habitats depends on regular management usually through grazing or mowing but their species diversity is known to decline with increasing management intensity the reduction of management intensity can be a useful tool for the long term conservation of the biological diversity of grasslands we analyzed floral and faunal diversity on intensively and extensively unintensively grazed pastures and on to year old ungrazed grasslands in northern germany each of the three grassland habitats differing in grazing intensity was replicated six times we related diverse taxa such as grasshoppers butterfly adults and lepidopteran larvae and trap nesting solitary bees and wasps to vegetation structure there was an increase of species richness and abundance from pastures to ungrazed grasslands the percentage of parasitism of the most abundant trap nesting species the digger wasp trypoxylon figulus was also higher on ungrazed grasslands decreased grazing on pastures enhanced species richness for adult butterflies only whereas the abundance of adult butterflies solitary bees and wasps and their natural enemies increased although the differences in insect diversity between pastures and ungrazed grassland could be attributed to a greater vegetation height and heterogeneity bottom up effects on ungrazed areas the differences between intensively and extensively grazed pastures could not be explained by changes in vegetation characteristics hence intensive grazing appeared to affect the insect communities through the disruption of plant insect interactions a mosaic of extensively grazed grassland and grassland left ungrazed for a few years may be a good means by which to maintain biodiversity and the strength of trophic interactions,Conservation Biology,grazing intensity and the diversity of grasshoppers butterflies and trap nesting bees and wasps
2,male euglossine bees were sampled with chemical baits every two months from september to july at nine sites in the desengano mountain range rio de janeiro state brazil four sites were located in atlantic forest mature second growth two sites in disturbed forest and three sites in forest fragments of and ha respectively we collected male euglossine bees from at least species analyses of variance indicated no differences among the three habitat types for total number of bees and of the dominant species bootstrapping indicated significant variation in species richness and diversity for some sites but there was no clear indication of differences among habitats similarity as measured with the morisita horn index was inversely related to distance between sites but relatively high for most site combinations these results suggest that the euglossine bee community in the three habitats was essentially the same although some species were associated with each habitat type most appeared to respond to temporal local conditions our results do not support the hypothesis that forest fragmentation or habitat alteration reduces abundance and diversity of euglossine bees,Biotropica,abundance and diversity of euglossine bees in the fragmented landscape of the brazilian atlantic forest
3,niche breadth of species has been hypothesized to be associated with species responses to disturbance disturbance is usually believed to affect specialists negatively while generalists are believed to benefit from disturbance we call this the specializationdisturbance hypothesis we also propose an associated hypothesis the specialization asymmetry disturbance hypothesis under which both specialization and asymmetry of interactions would explain species responses to disturbance we test these hypotheses using data from a plant pollinator system that has been grazed by cattle i e a biological disturbance in southern argentina we quantified specialization in species interactions specialization of interaction partners and species responses to disturbance we found no relationship between degree of specialization and a species response to disturbance we also found that plant pollinator interactions tend to be asymmetric in this system there was no relationship between the degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of specialization of its interaction partners however asymmetry of interactions did not explain the variability in species responses to disturbance thus both hypotheses are rejected by our data possible reasons include failure to assess crucial resources substantial direct effects of disturbance inaccurate measures of specialization difficulty detecting highly nonlinear relationships and limitations of a nonexperimental approach or in fact there may be no relationship between specialization and response to disturbance,The American Naturalist,ecological specialization and susceptibility to disturbance conjectures and refutations
4,bumblebees hymenoptera apidae are important pollinators of crops and wildflowers but many species have suffered dramatic declines in recent decades strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their foraging range and nesting density both of which are poorly understood previous studies have mainly focussed on the cosmopolitan bumblebee species bombus terrestris and implicitly assume this to be representative of other species here we use a landscape scale microsatellite study to estimate the foraging range and nesting density of two ecologically dissimilar species b terrestris and b pascuorum workers were sampled along a km linear transect and polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters we provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius m in an agricultural landscape for b terrestris and for b pascuorum estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species km for b terrestris and km for b pascuorum foraging ranges also differed substantially with b pascuorum foraging over distances less than m and b terrestris less than m clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental aspects of their ecology this has significant implications for the development of conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations for the management of bumblebees as pollinators and for predicting patterns of gene flow from genetically modified plants,Oikos,use of genetic markers to quantify bumblebee foraging range and nest density
5,the diversity of the italian bee fauna was investigated over a four year period at sites in italian regions of italy piedmont friuli venezia giulia emilia romagna tuscany umbria molise sicily and sardinia a previously agreed sampling methodology was used and the bee collection protocol was based upon the transept method the sampling sites were chosen within an agricultural landscape an account on data processing concerning captured specimens is presented over one third of the known italian fauna i e species were recorded three species hylaeus kahri förster förster lasioglossum subaenescens pérez and osmia niveibarbis pérez are new records and species showed an enlarged distribution area seventyone percent of the bee species collected in the italian agroecosystems and semi natural landscapes are distributed in the palearctic ecozone the remaining of the bee species are present in europe some species mostly occur in central europe whereas others occur also in the mediterranean countries the total no of the censused species was present in agroecosystems and total no in semi natural landscapes the bee fauna composition varies along the north south direction of the peninsula with halictidae being more abundant in northern italy and anthophoridae more abundant in the south,Bulletin of Insectology,wild bees in agroecosystems and semi natural landscapes collection period in italy
6,small beetles usually species of nitidulidae are the natural pollinators of atemoya annona squamosa l x a cherimola mill hybrids custard apple ßowers but commercial atemoya growers often need to carry out labor intensive hand pollination to produce enough high quality fruit because australian rain forest has plant species in the same family as atemoya annonaceae and because many rain forest plants are beetle pollinated we set out to discover whether tropical rain forest in far north queensland harbors beetles that could provide this ecosystem service for atemoya crops orchards were chosen along a gradient of increasing distance from tropical rain forest Ð km we sampled ßowers from each of nine atemoya orchards and determined the identity and abundance of insects within each ßower to assess the amount of pollination due to insects we bagged six ßowers per tree and left another six ßowers per tree accessible to insects on trees at an orchard near rain forest results indicated that atemoya orchards km from rain forest were predominantly visited by Þve previously unrecognized native beetle pollinators that are likely to originate in tropical rain forest these native beetles occurred reliably enough in crops near rain forest to have a positive effect on the quantity of fruit produced but their contribution was not great enough to satisfy commercial production needs management changes aimed at increasing native beetle abundance in crops are required before these beetles could eliminate the need for growers to hand pollinate atemoya ßowers appreciation of the value of this resource is necessary if we are to develop landscapes that both conserve native biodiversity and support agricultural production,Horticultural Entomology,rain forest provides pollinating beetles for atemoya crops
7,meaningful ecological studies on insect communities require sampling protocols that take into consideration temporal fluctuations in abundance and species composition bees with their specific requirements for nutrition and nesting are good indicators of landscape structure and overall biodiversity provided the ecological and seasonal patterns they show are taken into consideration the present two year study traced the ecological and seasonal patterns on km of a southern slope in the swiss alps ranging from to m above sea level the study area consisted mainly of grassland under different regimes mostly hay meadows and pastures by direct netting at five monthly intervals in each year a total of bee species were recorded this comprehensive sampling scheme identified one of the most diverse bee faunas in central and northern europe consisting of a statistically estimated species most species were rare with represented by a single individual ecological analysis of the bee community showed that the primitively eusocial species were over represented among the abundant species and the parasitic species among the rarest both abundance and species richness were subject to marked seasonal variations a substantial turnover in species composition as well as changes in ecological patterns were observed more than of all species were recorded in only one of the two years in particular many of the parasitic species singletons accounted for a higher proportion when individual years rather than the pooled data were analysed all these findings underline the importance of season long sampling and sampling over more than one year if bees are to be used as indicators in ecological and studies on bee communities,European Journal of Entomology,ecological and seasonal patterns in the diversity of a species rich bee assemblage hymenoptera apoidea apiformes
8,recent declines in managed honey bee apis mellifera l colonies have increased interest in the current and potential contribution of wild bee populations to the pollination of agricultural crops because wild bees often live in agricultural Þelds their population density and contribution to crop pollination may be inßuenced by farming practices especially those used to reduce the populations of other insects we took a census of pollinators of squash and pumpkin at farms in virginia west virginia and maryland to see whether pollinator abundance was related to farming practices the main pollinators were peponapis pruinosa say honey bees and bumble bees bombus spp the squash bee was the most abundant pollinator on squash and pumpkin occurring at of farms in population densities that were commonly several times higher than that of other pollinators squash bee density was related to tillage practices no tillage farms hosted three times as great a density of squash bees as tilled farms pollinator density was not related to pesticide use honey bee density on squash and pumpkin was not related to the presence of managed honey bee colonies on farms farms with colonies did not have more honey bees per ßower than farms that did not keep honey bees probably reßecting the lack of afÞnity of honey bees for these crops future research should examine the economic impacts of managing farms in ways that promote pollinators particularly pollinators of crops that are not well served by managed honey bee colonies,Field and Forage Crops,farming practices influence wild pollinator populations on squash and pumpkin
9,tropical rainforests are potential reservoirs of insects that could enhance crop pollination but only a few instances of the provision of such services by tropical rainforest insects have been reported our field study aimed to determine the relative importance of such insects to the pollination of macadamia macadamia integrifolia and longan dimocarpus longan crops on the atherton tableland north queensland australia we quantified initial fruit set a measure of pollination success in treatments designed to assess the relative importance of the possible modes of pollination the treatments were applied in orchards that varied in distance from rainforest in order to compare the effects of the contrasting pools of available pollen vectors we also recorded the insect species present and estimated the number of visits each made to flowers in crops near and far from rainforest for both crops there was an interaction between pollination treatment and distance from rainforest maximum fruit set was only achieved when pollen vectors had access to flow ers and orchards were close to rainforest exclusion of pollinators near rainforest reduced initial fruit set to a greater extent than exclusion of pollinators far from rainforest we confirmed that pollen transfer in macadamia is by autogamous self pollination and by pollen vectors but our design did not distinguish among pollen vectors the only abundant insects in macadamia orchards were honeybees apis mellifera there were more honeybee visits to macadamia flowers in orchards near rainforest than far from rainforest but we detected no relationship between honeybee visits and initial maca damia fruit set in our sample of observations on a per raceme basis more detailed studies are needed to identify the pollen vector responsible for enhanced pollination of macadamia near rainforest we established for the first time that pollen transfer in longan is by a combination of autogamous self pollination wind and bees longan flowers were visited by stingless bees and honeybees but only stingless bees had a positive relationship with initial longan fruit set and higher visitation rates near rainforest than far from rainforest this suggests that enhanced pollination in longan near rainforest resulted primarily from a more abundant supply of stingless bees from the rainforest synthesis and applications by demonstrating that tropical rainforest can act as a re servoir of pollen vectors that benefit crops our study highlights the existence of a largely unrecognized resource available to agriculture at the same time our results make a significant contribution to the growing database of studies that underscore the importance of tropical rainforest conservation policy and management aimed at sustainable use of this resource would satisfy the goals both of agriculturalists to improve crop yields and conservationists to conserve tropical rainforest,Journal of Applied Ecology,proximity to rainforest enhances pollination and fruit set in orchards
10,the regional distribution pattern of bombus muscorum was studied in an agricultural landscape of central germany one of two remaining areas with the occurrence of this nationally endangered species in the land hesse to determine the landscape characteristics that facilitate the occurrence of b muscorum grid based observation records were analysed in a gis environment at a regional scale a significantly negative effect of the number of trees on the occurrence of b muscorum and a significantly positive one of the proportion of arable land strongly support the species preference for open landscapes yet apart from open landscapes additional landscape features were shown to be important a significantly positive effect of ditches in the final model revealed the importance of this landscape element for the occurrence of b muscorum this finding was additionally supported by recordings of nest searching queens nests and flower visits along dithes the positive effects of clover and fallow land indicate the species need for suitable food resources throughout the season because b muscorum exhibits small foraging ranges it is essential that landscape elements that provide nesting sites foraging habitats and undisturbed hibernation structures are next to each other the low numbers of individuals of b muscorum recorded indicate that the supply of these habitat elements may have reached a critical threshold in the study region,Biodiversity and Conservation,effects of landscape elements on the distribution of the rare bumblebee species bombus muscorum in an agricultural landscape
11,the hypothesis that sown m grass margins strips at the edges of arable fields have a positive impact on farmland biodiversity was tested using a paired field approach in southern england a total of fields were investigated half with at least year old margin strips created under the uk agri environment scheme countryside stewardship and half nearby control sites the sites were grouped on the basis of average field size into small intermediate or open landscape locations to examine landscape structure effects assessments of the flora bird and territory numbers bees spiders orthoptera and carabidae were made in early to mid summer there were positive impacts on diversity or abundance for the flora bees and orthoptera the herbaceous flora of the pre existing boundary adjacent to sown m strips was significantly more species rich than controls probably reflecting a buffer effect of the strip bees and orthoptera the latter of which were only found in field boundaries were more abundant where strips were sited reflecting added habitat resources bee numbers were significantly lower in field centres where there were no m margin strips there were no significant effects of sown strips on numbers of birds observed or bird territories spiders or carabidae but also no negative impacts lycosid spiders were consistently more abundant in boundaries of small fields with m margin strips linyphiidae were more abundant within the crop area of smaller fields amongst birds wrens troglodytes troglodytes were also more abundant in small fields while yellowhammers emberiza citrinella were more abundant in open landscapes the results confirm there are benefits to farmland biodiversity from introducing new margin strips at the edges of arable fields more significantly the success of agri environment schemes which will vary between taxa and species can be dependent on landscape structure scheme administrators may need to address landscape structure and mean field size to achieve significant enhancement of populations of declining farmland species,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",impacts of an agri environment field margin prescription on the flora and fauna of arable farmland in different landscapes
12,declines in bee populations have been documented in several parts of the world bees are dependent upon flowering plants for resources and flowering plants often depend upon bees for pollination services bees can therefore serve as indicator species of habitat degradation due to these relationships with flowering plants this study investigates how the bumble bee community in san francisco has responded to urbanization and which urban park characteristics are important for the current communitys structure to answer these questions we sampled bumble bees in urban parks and two nearby wild parks we estimated park characteristics and used multiple regression analysis to determine which characteristics predicted bumble bee abundance and species richness bumble bee abundance was positively associated with resource availability or proxies of resource availability natural area areas that contain remnant fragments that have been largely unchanged by human activity in and nest site abundance and openness of the surrounding matrix in both and bumble bee species richness was negatively associated with abundance of a dominant species bombus vosnesenskii in the importance of the surrounding matrix suggests that these parks do not act as islands accordingly area of park did not explain species richness while abundance of the dominant competitor did the species that was most influenced by competition bombus sitkensis uses rodent holes as nest sites and is possibly excluded from nest sites by the early emerging b vosnesenskii another subterranean nester the species least influenced by competition bombus melanopygus is able to use both rodent holes and abandoned bird nests as nest sites,Biological Conservation,are urban parks refuges for bumble bees bombus spp hymenoptera apidae

14,although habitat fragmentation and agricultural intensification are known as threads to pollinator diversity little is known about consequences for population size and genetic diversity here we combined detailed field observations molecular approaches and gis based quantification of landscape structure measured by proportions of seminatural habitats and proportions of mass flowering crops to get new insights into driving forces of population dynamics of the bumblebee species bombus pascuorum comparing agriculturally dominated landscape sectors we found the proportion of mass flowering crops to positively influence bumblebee abundance whereas the proportion of seminatural habitats was of minor importance we used microsatellites to quantify landscape related colony densities inbreeding and population substructure detected colony densities did not correlate with landscape parameters or with local worker abundance measured by field observations these results indicate that increased worker abundances within landscapes are rather due to greater colony sizes than due to an increased number of nests we found significant population substructure measured by fst and seven landscapesectors to bear significantly increased inbreeding values fis fis was strongly varyingbetween sectors but did not correlate with landscape structure moreover fis had asignificantly negative effect on colony size demonstrating the importance of genetic diversity on population fitness at a landscape scale we suggest that inbreeding levels might be related to the temporal variation of food resources and population sizes in agricultural landscapes,Molecular Ecology,genetic diversity and mass resources promote colony size and forager densities of a social bee bombus pascuorum in agricultural landscapes
15,agricultural land use intensifi cation has caused a considerable decline of once common semi natural habitats leaving only small and isolated habitat remnants within a homogeneous landscape matrix populations of fl owering plant species in these remaining habitat fragments are also declining and can not offer suffi cient resources for potential pollinators the loss of pollinators and consequential pollination limitation is especially severe for obligately out crossing plant species in this study pollination and reproductive success of hippocrepis comosa was examined hippocrepis comosa l is a self incompatible declining plant species occurring on fragmented remnants in semi natural calcareous grassland habitats in an agricultural landscape in southern lower saxony germany plant pollinator interactions were analysed in small medium and large plant patches in differently sized calcareous grassland fragments surrounded by landscape matrices of differing complexity flower visitors were observed during three minute observations pollen supplementation experiments were performed to test for pollination limitation and fruits from the plant patches were collected to calculate seed set hippocrepis comosa showed evidence of pollination limitation because hand pollinated fl owers set more seeds per infl orescence than open pollinated fl owers and seed set was strongly reduced by decreased visitation rates pollinators were most abundant in large patches and in diverse landscapes visitation rate was not affected by patch size hence in order to maintain plant pollinator interactions in an agricultural landscape conservation efforts should include the preservation of calcareous grasslands that can support suffi ciently large patches of a plant species and offer ample rewards for pollinators and the establishment of a diverse agricultural landscape around the semi natural habitats that will further enhance pollinator abundance,Entomologia Generalis,patch size and landscape effects on pollinators and seed set of the horseshoe vetch hippocrepis comosa in an agricultural landscape of central europe
16,in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes many species are confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins however it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed there instead species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may at least partly be dependent on dispersal from larger semi natural grassland fragments we tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern sweden in each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in one semi natural grassland one linear habitat uncultivated field margin adjacent to this called proximate and one similar linear habitat called distant situated at least m from the semi natural grassland patch both species richness and density individuals per unit area of butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones moreover butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the linear habitat types butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats the effect of isolation on density was stronger for less mobile butterfly species for bumble bees there was no difference in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats for at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of semi natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas for bumble bees it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators in order to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi natural grasslands or re creation of flower rich grasslands is essential,Journal of Applied Ecology,semi natural grasslands as population sources for pollinating insects in agricultural landscapes
17,it is important for conservation biologists to understand how well species persist in humandominated ecosystems because protected areas constitute a small fraction of the earths surface and because anthropogenic habitats may offer more opportunities for conservation than has been previously thought we investigated how an important functional group pollinators bees hymenoptera apiformes are affected by human land use at the landscape and local scales in southern new jersey u s a we established sites that differed in surrounding landscape cover or local habitat type and collected bees of species the natural habitat in this ecosystem is a forested ericaceous heath bee abundance and species richness within forest habitat decreased not increased with increasing forest cover in the surrounding landscape similarly bee abundance was greater in agricultural fields and suburban and urban developments than in extensive forests and the same trend was found for species richness particular species groups that might be expected to show greater sensitivity to habitat loss such as floral specialists and bees of small or large body size did not show strong positive associations with forest habitat nevertheless of the bee species studied were positively associated with extensive forest one of these species is a narrow endemic that was last seen in our results suggest that at least in this system moderate anthropogenic land use may be compatible with the conservation of many but not all bee species,Conservation Biology,effect of human disturbance on bee communities in a forested ecosystem
18,in many european agricultural landscapes species richness is declining considerably studies performed at a very large spatial scale are helpful in understanding the reasons for this decline and as a basis for guiding policy in a unique large scale study of agricultural landscapes in seven european countries we investigated relationships between species richness in several taxa and the links between biodiversity and landscape structure and management we estimated the total species richness of vascular plants birds and five arthropod groups in each km landscape and recorded various measures of both landscape structure and intensity of agricultural land use we studied correlations between taxonomic groups and the effects of landscape and land use parameters on the number of species in different taxonomic groups our statistical approach also accounted for regional variation in species richness unrelated to landscape or land use factors the results reveal strong geographical trends in species richness in all taxonomic groups no single species group emerged as a good predictor of all other species groups species richness of all groups increased with the area of semi natural habitats in the landscape species richness of birds and vascular plants was negatively associated with fertilizer use synthesis and applications we conclude that indicator taxa are unlikely to provide an effective means of predicting biodiversity at a large spatial scale especially where there is large biogeographical variation in species richness however a small list of landscape and land use parameters can be used in agricultural landscapes to infer large scale patterns of species richness our results suggest that to halt the loss of biodiversity in these landscapes it is important to preserve and if possible increase the area of semi natural habitat,Journal of Applied Ecology,indicators for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes a pan european study
19,during recent decades concern about the loss of biodiversity on agricultural land has increased and semi natural grasslands have been highlighted as critical habitats temperate european agricultural landscapes require distinct and appropriate management to prevent further impoverishment of the flora and fauna this is especially urgent for pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services our aim was to examine how species richness of three important groups of pollinating insects solitary bees butterflies and burnet moths are related to different farm characteristics and if there are any differences between these three groups a further aim was to test if red listed species are related to any farm characteristics species richness of solitary bees butterflies and burnets was measured on all seminatural grasslands at farms in a forest dominated area of km in southern sweden using systematic transect walks in april to september only butterflies and burnets and species richness of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated both before and after controlling for the area of semi natural grassland species richness of solitary bees increased with the area of semi natural grassland after controlling for the effect of the area of semi natural grassland species richness was strongly positively related with the density of the plant knautia arvensis and negatively related with the proportion of grazed grassland the results were similar for solitary bees and butterflies the number of red listed solitary bees was positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest after mid july and decreased with increased farm isolation the number of burnet species all red listed was positively related to vegetation height flower density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest on a farm areas with a high density of k arvensis and with traditional hay meadow with late harvest present harbour most species promoting traditional hay meadows late extensive grazing and the herb k arvensis people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high species richness of pollinating insects and support red listed species further we suggest that the density of k arvensis at a farm can be used as a biodiversity indicator at least for pollinating insects,Ecography,how can we preserve and restore species richness of pollinating insects on agricultural land
20,factors that determine the relative abundance of bumblebee species remain poorly understood rendering management of rare and declining species difficult studies of bumblebee communities in the americas suggest that there are strong competitive interactions between species with similar length tongues and that this competition determines the relative abundance of species in contrast in europe it is common to observe several short tongued species coexisting with little or no evidence for competition shaping community structure in this study we examine patterns of abundance and distribution in one of the most diverse bumblebee communities in europe found in the mountains of southern poland we quantify forage use when collecting nectar and pollen for bumblebee species and examine patterns of co occurrence and niche overlap to determine whether there is evidence for inter specific competition we also test whether rarity can be explained by diet breadth up to species were found coexisting within single sites with species richness peaking in mountain pasture at m altitude results concur with previous studies indicating that the majority of pollen collected by bumblebees is from fabaceae but that some bee species e g b ruderatus are much more heavily dependent on fabaceae than others e g b lucorum those species that forage primarily on fabaceae tended to have long tongues in common with studies in the uk diet breadth was correlated with abundance rarer species tended to visit fewer flower species after correcting for differences in sample size no evidence was found for similarity in tongue length or dietary overlap influencing the likelihood of co occurrence of species however the most abundant species which co occurred at most sites occupied distinct dietary niche space while species with tongues of similar length tended overall to have higher dietary niche overlap among the group of abundant short tongued species that commonly co occurred there was marked dietary differentiation which may explain their coexistence,Biodiversity and Conservation,diet breadth coexistence and rarity in bumblebees
21,over the last decades biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically initiatives to enhance biodiversity such as agri environment schemes often have little effect especially in intensively farmed landscapes the effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high quality habitats that can act as a source of species we evaluated up to what distance high quality habitats nature reserves and artificially created flower rich patches fect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the netherlands we surveyed forbs inflorescences bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in ansects along ditch banks extending m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture in a separate experiment we surveyed inflorescences bees and hover flies in m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower rich patches and in five control transects species density of forbs declined over the first m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first m beyond the nature reserves beyond these distances no further declines were observed the effects of flower rich patches were spatially limited the species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower rich patch but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to m beyond the patch in intensively farmed areas remnant high quality habitats sustain more undant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside they do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted m and relatively small these habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or gricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity habitat restoration in intensivelyused farmlandshould thereforebe implemented preferentiallyin the immediate vicinity of high quality habitats in the short term newly created flower rich habitats are no alternative to pre existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland,Journal of Applied Ecology,at what spatial scale do high quality habitats enhance the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes
22,this study examined bee communities by sweep net and pan trap sampling and quantified the number of ramets of floral resources in native tallgrass prairie fragments and nearby ruderal areas within km in iowa usa in the summer of bee communities in ruderal areas were significantly less diverse than those in native tallgrass prairie remnants with about half as many species and approximately a third as many bees diversity abundance and richness of floral resources were also significantly less in ruderal grasslands than in native prairies indicating that poor floral resource levels may substantially depauperate their bee communities common bees dominated the composition of the ruderal grasslands only one rare species in this study was found at a ruderal site indicating that high quality prairie remnants are important reservoirs of bee diversity abundance of flowering ramets of a plant species was a significant predictor of the abundance of bees found on that plant there was also a preference for human yellow flowers after adjusting for ramet abundance and there were significantly more bees caught in yellow pan traps than blue or white ones the abundance but not the richness of small bee species length  mm was less than expected at ruderal sites when compared to prairies implying the presence of local nesting opportunities in ruderal grasslands for small bees but insufficient resources to support large populations,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",diversity and abundance of bees hymenoptera apiformes in native and ruderal grasslands of agriculturally dominated landscapes
23,habitat loss and fragmentation lead to changes in species richness and composition which may affect ecosystem services yet few studies distinguish between the effects of habitat loss and isolation or how multiple ecosystem services may be affected simultaneously we investigated the effects of variation in cover of woody and open semi natural habitats and isolation from forest on the relative functioning of pollination seed predation and insect scavenging in agricultural landscapes we established sites in grassland locations in the swiss plateau around berne the sites varied independently in their isolation from forest edges in the percentage of woody habitats and in the percentage of open seminatural habitats in the surrounding landscape m radius we experimentally exposed primroses sunflower seeds and cricket corpses during spring none of the three studied services was affected by variation in woody or open semi natural habitat cover however the proportion of flowers setting seed was significantly reduced by isolation from forest further seed predation and insect scavenging were significantly lower at isolated sites than at sites connected to woody habitat this pattern was particularly pronounced for seeds and insect corpses that were enclosed by wire netting and thus inaccessible to vertebrates thus all three studied services responded quite similarly to the landscape context the observed small scale determination of seed set seed predation and insect scavenging contrasts with larger scale determination of pollination and insect pest control found in other studies,Landscape Ecology,isolation from forest reduces pollination seed predation and insect scavenging in swiss farmland
24,recent declines in managed and feral honey bee populations have greatly increased interest in the current and potential role of wild pollinators in agricultural pollination pumpkin cucurbita pepo l has great potential to be served by wild pollinators because of a reliable and widespread group of bee species that are commonly associated with their ßowers including bumble bees bombus spp and in the americas two genera of specialist ground nesting bees peponapis and xenoglossa we examined the effects of several key farm management practices and landscape variables on bee abundance in pumpkin on farms in virginia and maryland during summer weevaluated bee abundance with respect to tillage irrigation practices soil properties natural habitat forest and grassland ßowering crop and disturbed areas additionally we examined nest site preference within or outside of crop areas of peponapis pruinosa say at one farm and in a large screenhouse we found p pruinosa nesting preferentially within crop areas and near the vines and leaves of their host plant although these bees typically place some of their brood cells within tillage depth we did not Þnd a tillage effect on their abundance at ßowers we found a negative effect of soil clay content r  p  and a positive effect of irrigation f  p  on p pruinosa abundance using published data on pollinator visitation requirements we found wild bee densities were sufÞcient to fully pollinate all pumpkin ßowers on Ð of the farms studied,Journal of Economic Entomology,wild bee abundance and pollination service in cultivated pumpkins farm management nesting behavior and landscape effects
25,combining the needs of agricultural production with enhancing biodiversity requires a landscape scale approach since the geographic scale at which most non farmed species operate is unconstrained by farm boundaries bumblebees are a key component of farmland biodiversity as pollinators of both crops and wild flora however the factors determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood using a combination of remote sensed landscape data and molecular markers we quantify the effects of land use oilseed rape field beans and non cropped areas all of which provide suitable bumblebee forage at various spatial scales to find the best predictor of colony density for the bumblebee bombus pascuorum scopoli in an arable landscape estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all habitat categories within m of the sample site no significant relationships were found for greater or lesser distances this concurs with earlier estimates of the foraging range of this species we found no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability although our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility it has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance in agricultural landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this here we report a direct relationship between floral abundance and bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area importantly we suggest that the forage availability within the previously published estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good predictor of the scale of impact of forage provision on nesting density key words bombus pascuorum forage availability foraging range kinship mass flowering crops microsatellites nest density,Insect Conservation and Diversity,bumblebee nest density and the scale of available forage in arable landscapes
26,pollination is an ecological process that provides important services to humans pollination service in agroecosystems depends on several factors including the land management systems used by farmers here we focused on the effects of insect pollinator diversity on coffee fruit production along a gradient of management systems in central veracruz mexico the gradient ranged from low environmental impact management systems the native forest is not completely removed to high environmental impact management systems the native forest is completely removed we hypothesized that pollinator diversity should be higher in low impact systems then if fruit production is positively related to pollinator diversity plantations with low impact management systems should display higher fruit production than plantations with high impact management systems we used observational and experimental data to test this hypothesis our results indicated that low impact management systems have higher species richness and relative diversity measured with the shannon wiener diversity index of pollinators than high impactmanagement systems in all cases fruit production was positively related with species richness and diversity of pollinators moreover fruit production was higher in low impact than in high impact management systems these results suggest that the diversity of insect pollinators can be influenced by the management system applied by farmers and that such effects may have strong consequences on coffee fruit production,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",pollinator diversity increases fruit production in mexican coffee plantations the importance of rustic management systems
27,an important goal of ecological compensation areas ecas is to increase biodiversity in adjacent intensively managed farmland and the agricultural landscape at large we tested whether this goal can be achieved in the case of the agri environmental restoration scheme implemented for swiss grassland using five large arthropod taxa bees true bugs orthopterans ground beetles and spiders representing different ecological and functional groups the species richness and abundance of all groups and species respectively was measured along m transects from eca meadows into the adjacent intensively managed grassland at sites species richness of all arthropod taxa except ground beetles and the abundance of of the arthropod species sampled with at least five individuals were higher in ecameadows than in their surroundings while the total abundance of spiders and ground beetles was higher in intensively managed meadows the abundance of of these species were only increased in the ecameadows themselves stenotopic species but had increased abundance both in the eca meadows and the adjacent grassland declining exponentially with increasing distance from eca meadows edge species the decay distances for these edge species differed among taxonomic groups ± m for true bugs ± m for spiders ± m for bees ± m for orthopterans ± m for ground beetles mean ± standard error and independent of taxonomic group were larger for large sized or predacious species than for small sized or phytophagous species because the average distance between neighbouring eca meadows in swiss grassland is only ± m the current agri environment scheme very likely enhances arthropod diversity and possibly associated ecosystem services in the swiss agricultural landscape at large,Biological Conservation,effects of ecological compensation meadows on arthropod diversity in adjacent intensively managed grassland
28,globally there is concern over the decline of bees an ecologically important group of pollinating insects genetic studies provide insights into population structure that are crucial for conservation management but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological methods yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily focussed on social species rather than the more species rich solitary bees here we investigate the population structure of colletes floralis a rare and threatened solitary mining bee in ireland and scotland using nine microsatellite loci genetic diversity was surprisingly as high in scottish hebridean island populations at the extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland irish populations further south extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected multilocus fst was up to and g st and dest were even higher maximum and respectively a pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land water appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance c floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration drift equilibrium gis based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow our results highlight the need for urgent site specific management action to halt the decline of this and potentially other rare solitary bees,Molecular Ecology,landscape effects on extremely fragmented populations of a rare solitary bee colletes floralis
29,we have little idea how landscape scale factors inﬂuence the success of wild bumblebee nests over time here for the ﬁrst time we use molecular markers to estimate within season changes in the numbers of nests workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late may–june and late july–august and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated we compare the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best ﬁt to our data changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival the two bee species appeared to diﬀer markedly in survival over time with estimates of of nests surviving for bombus lapidarius and for b pascuorum however our data suggest that the foraging range of b pascuorum may be greater in late season which would lead us to overestimate nest survival in this species diﬀerential survival may also reﬂect diﬀerences in phenology between the two species the land use class which had the most consistent eﬀects on nest number and survival was gardens for b lapidarius the area of gardens within a and mradius positively inﬂuenced nest survival while for b pascuorum the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more gardens within a and m radius for b pascuorum the area of grassland within a and mradius also positively inﬂuenced nest number in late samples probably because this is the preferred nesting habitat for this species the importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment furthermore our data suggest that the positive inﬂuence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill over at least km into surrounding farmland synthesis and applications the substantial eﬀects that even small areas of local resources such as rough grassland or clover leys can have on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear relevance for the design of pollinator management strategies,Journal of Applied Ecology,effects of land use at a landscape scale on bumblebee nest density and survival
30,anthropogenic habitat disturbance can have profound effects on multiple components of forest biotas including pollinator assemblages we assessed the effect of small scale disturbance on local richness abundance diversity and evenness of insect pollinator fauna and how habitat disturbance affected species turnover across the landscape and overall diversity along a precipitation gradient in nw patagonia argentina we evaluated the effect of disturbance on overall pollinator fauna and then separately for bees i e apoidea and non bee pollinators locally disturbed habitats had significantly higher pollinator species richness and abundances than undisturbed habitats for the whole pollinator assemblage but not for bees or non bees separately however significant differences in species richness between habitats vanished after accounting for differences in abundance between habitat types at a local scale shannonweaver diversity and evenness did not vary with disturbance a b diversity index indicated that across forest types species turnover was lower between disturbed habitats than between undisturbed habitats in addition rarefaction curves showed that disturbed habitats as a whole accumulated fewer species than undisturbed habitats at equivalent sample sizes we concluded that small patches of disturbed habitat have a negligible effect on local pollinator diversity however habitat disturbance reduced b diversity through a homogenization of the pollinator fauna in particular of bees across the landscape,Biodiversity and Conservation,effects of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on local pollinator diversity and species turnover across a precipitation gradient
31,the northwest of scotland is a stronghold for two of the uks rarest bumblebee species bombus distinguendus and bombus muscorum the predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is crofting a system specific to scotland in which small agricultural units crofts operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes crofting is considered to be beneficial to a wide range of flora and fauna however currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee populations in this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest scotland the results of our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer but this has been largely abandoned summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance and forage plant availability throughout the survey period the use of specific bird and bee conservation seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape although the number of bees observed remained low of the forage plants available the three most frequently visited species were from the fabaceae we therefore conclude that the creation of agri environment schemes which promote the use of fabaceae rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted areas,Biological Conservation,crofting and bumblebee conservation the impact of land management practices on bumblebee populations in northwest scotland
32,background the potential for reduced pollination ecosystem service due to global declines of bees and other pollinators is cause for considerable concern habitat degradation destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline however despite increasing and accelerating levels of global urbanization very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages we assessed changes in the diversity abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban suburban and rural sites across a uk city methodology principal findings bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at sites of similar habitat character churchyards and cemeteries that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization local habitat quality altitude shelter from wind diversity and abundance of flowers and the broader scale degree of urbanization e g percentage of built landscape and gardens within m m m km and km of the site were assessed for each study site the diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and suburban land use but more species negatively so pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat quality in particular the availability of flowering plants conclusions significance our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages but that this capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality nonetheless in both urban and suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats the unique development histories of different urban areas and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range mean that complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable,PLOS ONE,changing bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages along an urban rural gradient
34,bumble bees bombus are vitally important pollinators of wild plants and agricultural crops worldwide fragmentary observations however have suggested population declines in several north american species despite rising concern over these observations in the united states highlighted in a recent national academy of sciences report a national assessment of the geographic scope and possible causal factors of bumble bee decline is lacking here we report results of a y interdisciplinary study of changing distributions population genetic structure and levels of pathogen infection in bumble bee populations across the united states we compare current and historical distributions of eight species compiling a database of museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of specimens we show that the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by  some within the last y we also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian pathogen nosemabombi and lower genetic diversity compared with co occurring populations of the stable nondeclining species higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are thus realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in north america although cause and effect remain uncertain,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,patterns of widespread decline in north american bumble bees
35,substantial reductions in the distributional ranges of several species of bumblebee have been recorded in the uk loss and fragmentation of suitable foraging and nesting habitat to agricultural intensification is thought to be the main driving force behind declines limited knowledge of species ecology means that effective conservation management prescriptions cannot be put into place here we investigated the spatial dynamics of two uk biodiversity action plan bumblebee species bombus sylvarum and bombus humilis for the first time microsatellite dna analysis was used to estimate foraging distances in rare bumblebees sisterhoods were identified between bees sampled at discrete forage patches within a fragmented landscape using these sisterhoods minimum estimates of maximum and mean foraging distances were calculated from distances separating sister bees minimum mean foraging distances were calculated as  m for b humilis and  m for b sylvarum mean distances were significantly greater for b humilis than b sylvarum p the differences between the spatial scales that the species were recorded over highlighted a need for further research into the spatial dynamics of rare and more ubiquitous foraging bumblebees,Insect Conservation and Diversity,microsatellite analysis reveals the spatial dynamics of bombus humilis and bombus sylvarum
36,although the practice of cultivating mass fl owering crops mfcs is seen as a means of counteracting the widespread decline of insect pollinators no study to date has evaluated whether the increased pollinator abundance associated with mfcs infl uences pollinator visits to assemblages of adjacent native non crop plant species pollinator  spill over  in this study we quantifi ed bumblebee abundance along hedgerow transects in mfc fi eld bean vs non mfc wheat margins surveys were conducted on east and west facing margins twice daily morning and afternoon for three or four days during the main mfc fl owering period june over four years involving paired bean and wheat fi elds in devon and cornwall southwest england although no single bumblebee species showed any consistent change in relative frequency when taken across all years and bumblebee species combined we observed twice as many bumblebees visiting fl owers adjacent to the mfc however when we compared bumblebee activity along hedgerow transects two weeks after bean fl owering there was no diff erence between crops we thus conclude that although there is evidence for pollinator spillover from the bean mfc to nearby semi natural habitat the eff ect is comparatively short lived and not specifi c to any single bumblebee species we also suggest that while pollinator services to native plant species might be briefl y enhanced by mfc cultivation the possible repercussions of bumblebee spill over from mfcs to semi natural habitats and the other pollinator groups they support should be evaluated before mfc cultivation is considered as a means of conserving declining bumblebee populations,Oikos,increased bumblebee abundance along the margins of a mass flowering crop evidence for pollinator spill over
37,agricultural land use results in direct biodiversity decline through loss of natural habitat but may also cause indirect cross habitat effects on conservation areas we conducted three landscape scale field studies on sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape brassica napus results in a transient dilution of bees in crop fields and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland plants for pollinators abundances of bumble bees which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant primula veris but also pollinate oilseed rape osr decreased with increasing amount of osr this landscape scale dilution affected bumble bee abundances strongly in osr fields and marginally in grasslands where bumble bee abundances were generally low at the time of primula flowering seed set of primula veris which flowers during osr bloom was reduced by per cent when the amount of osr within km radius increased from to per cent hence the current expansion of bee attractive biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators which means an increased competition for pollinators between crops and wild plants in conclusion mass flowering crops potentially threaten fitness of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas despite the fact that in the long run mass flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service,Proceedings of the Royal Society: B,expansion of mass flowering crops leads to transient pollinator dilution and reduced wild plant pollination
38,the decline of bees has raised concerns regarding their conservation and the maintenance of ecosystem services they provide to bee pollinated wild ﬂowers and crops although the mediterranean region is a hotspot for bee species richness their status remains poorly studied there is an urgent need for cost eﬀective reliable and unbiased sampling methods that give good bee species richness estimates this study aims a to assess bee species richness in two common mediterranean habitat types semi natural scrub phrygana and managed olive groves b to compare species richness in those systems to that of other biogeographic regions and c to assess whether six diﬀerent sampling methods pan traps variable and standardized transect walks observation plots and trap nests previously tested in other european biogeographic regions are suitable in mediterranean communities eight study sites four per habitat type were selected on the island of lesvos greece the species richness observed was high compared to other habitat types worldwide for which comparable data exist pan traps collected the highest proportion of the total bee species richness across all methods at the scale of a study site variable and standardized transect walks detected the highest total richness over all eight study sites trap nests and observation plots detected only a limited fraction of the bee species richness to assess the total bee species richness in bee diversity hotspots such as the studied habitats we suggest a combination of transect walks conducted by trained bee collectors and pan trap sampling,Ecological Research,assessing bee species richness in two mediterranean communities importance of habitat type and sampling techniques
39,aim understanding the response of species to ecotones and habitat edges is essential to designing conservation management especially in mosaic agricultural landscapes this study examines how species diversity and composition change with distance from semi natural habitats over ecotones into agricultural fields and how within site patterns of community transition change across a climatic gradient and differ between crop types location a total of sites in israel where semi natural habitats border agricultural fields wheat fields or olive groves distributed along a sharp climatic gradient ranging between and mm mean annual rainfall methods we performed butterfly surveys in we analysed species richness a diversity diversity community nestedness and species turnover b diversity within sites and between sites c diversity we also assessed where species of conservation concern occurred results in wheat sites richness and diversity declined abruptly from ecotones to fields and remained homogenously poor throughout the fields regardless of climate in olive sites despite the sharp structural boundary richness and diversity remained high from the semi natural habitat to the grove margins and then declined gradually into groves species of conservation concern occurred across all habitats at olive sites but none were found inside wheat fields or at their ecotones the contrast in community structure between semi natural habitats and fields was affected by both climate and field type irrigation in arid regions did not augment species diversity main conclusions our results indicate that consideration of crop type within a climatic context should receive high priority in biodiversity conservation in agricultural areas in ‘hostile’ crops such as wheat we suggest favouring a combination of high intensity management and wide margins over less intensive management without margins which may merely aid generalist butterfly species the scarcity of butterflies in arid irrigated fields suggests a need to carefully assess the effects of irrigation and agrochemicals on species’ communities,Diversity and Distributions,butterfly diversity at the ecotone between agricultural and semi natural habitats across a climatic gradient
40,pollination interactions comprise a network of connections between flowers and insect visitors they are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural practices although less intensive approaches including organic farming could improve farmland biodiversity it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination and the stability of insectflower interaction networks we investigated the effects of organic vs conventional farming on insectflower interaction network size and structure bee and hoverfly diversity and pollination in pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms in the republic of ireland we found that insectflower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asymmetrically structured than networks on conventional farms overall however networks contained fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant  animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously documented insectflower interaction networks organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees partly because of higher floral abundances mainly trifolium sp hoverfly evenness was greater in organic farms but neither abundance richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance suggesting organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies pollination of crataegus monogyna hawthorn was higher on organic farms although pollen deposition was limited synthesis and applications organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of insectflower interaction networks however network stability was not improved and all networks organic and conventional were vulnerable because of their small size low niche overlap and low plant  animal ratios nonetheless organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more flower visitors and improved pollination of c monogyna we suggest that strategic management of important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri environmental schemes sowing trifolium spp and allowing these plants to flower could benefit bees but more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can be made for this group we conclude that organic farming although not the solution in its present form can benefit insect biodiversity insectflower interaction networks and insect mediated pollination,Journal of Applied Ecology,organic dairy farming impacts on insect flower interaction networks and pollination
41,the bee fauna hymenoptera apoidea of the niagara peninsula at the eastern end of the carolinian zone in ontario canada is poorly known from april to october we studied bee abundance and diversity in set aside grasslands at brock university and the glenridge quarry naturalization site in southern st catharines ontario using three sampling methods pan traps sweep nets and aerial nets we collected and identified specimens of species and morphospecies representing all bee families except melittidae found in north america abundance based diversity estimators suggested bee species richness to be as high as species there were three seasonal peaks in bee abundance early spring late spring and midsummer with a lull in activity shortly after the summer solstice several indicators suggested substantial impacts of disturbance on the niagara bee community including evidence of high dominance by the most abundant species comparison of the sampling methods indicated considerable catch variation among taxa halictidae and apidae were dominant in pan trap samples and in sweepaerial net samples respectively however bee abundances in pan traps and sweep nets were highly correlated suggesting that both methods fairly sample local bee abundances,The Canadian Entomologist,bee diversity in naturalizing patches of carolinian grasslands in southern ontario canada
42,the recent loss of pollinating insects and out crossing plants in agricultural landscapes has raised concern for the maintenance of ecosystem services wild bees have been shown to benefit from garden habitats in urban and suburban areas we investigated the effects of distance from garden habitats on wild bees and seed set of a native out crossing plant campanula persicifolia in intensively managed agricultural landscapes in southern sweden bee abundance and species richness as well as plant seed set were higher closer to gardens m than further away m this highlights private gardens as a landscape wide resource for pollinators but also the lack of sufficient pollination of wild plants in contemporary agricultural landscapes,Biological Conservation,gardens benefit bees and enhance pollination in intensively managed farmland
43,habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning effects of these usually intercorrelated processes on biodiversity have rarely been separated at a landscape scale we studied the independent effects of amount of woody habitat in the landscape and three levels of isolation from the next woody habitat patch isolation on trap nesting bees wasps and their enemies at farmland sites in the swiss plateau species richness of wasps was negatively affected by patch isolation and positively affected by the amount of woody habitat in the landscape in contrast species richness of bees was neither influenced by patch isolation nor by landscape composition isolation from woody habitats reduced species richness and abundance of natural enemies more strongly than of their hosts so that parasitism rate was lowered by half in isolated sites compared to forest edges thus population regulation of the hosts may be weakened by habitat fragmentation we conclude that habitat amount at the landscape scale and local patch connectivity are simultaneously important for biodiversity conservation,Oecologia,differential effects of habitat isolation and landscape composition on wasps bees and their enemies
44,due to loss of natural habitats human dominated green spaces are likely to increase in importance for biodiversity support we assessed the potential value of urban green roofs for native pollinator conservation in the chicago region comparing them with reference habitats of tallgrass prairie natural areas and traditional city park green spaces we found that native bees are present on green roofs though at lower abundance and diversity than in reference habitats green roof and prairie bee communities were distinct from each other while those in parks were intermediate and similar to the other two habitat types bee community patterns were related to habitat characteristics at both the site and landscape scales overall bee abundance and species richness increased with greater proportions of green space in the surrounding landscape however this relationship disappeared in cases where green space was dominated by turf grass at the site scale bees benefited from greater plant diversity and bee and plantcommunity composition were significantly correlated green roofs are potentially valuable sites for bee conservation in urban areas particularly if planted with diverse native forbs to provide foraging resources and designed to accommodate bees with different nesting habits,Landscape and Urban Planning,a comparison of bee communities of chicago green roofs parks and prairies
45,the relationship between resource availability and biodiversity of consumers has gained particular attention with the increasing loss of biodiversity we evaluated resource availability on meadows of low intensity low unfertilised mown once or twice per year and meadows of high intensity land use high fertilisation mown twice or thrice before and after the first mowing in relation to network specialisation species richness and composition of flower visitors we studied meadows simultaneously sampling one meadow of low intensity and one meadow of high intensity land use each survey yielded a separate interaction network comprising all flower visitors found during h in an area of m in total we recorded plant species and flower visitor species species composition of plants and flower visitors differed considerably between the two management regimes with species overlaps of in plants and in flower visitors complementary specialisation of flower visitors differed between taxa dipterans were significantly less specialised than beetles and butterflies and bees had the highest degree of specialisation earlier in the season before mowing meadows of lowintensity land use were significantly richer in flowering plant bee and butterfly species they also showed more plantflower visitor interactions greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of butterflies than meadows of high intensity land use however later in the season after mowing management types differed only in plant species richness being higher on meadows of low intensity land use we conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from differences in grassland management may alter plantflower visitor interactions moreover an impoverishment of flower diversity has stronger effects on the diversity and species composition of specialised flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors,Basic and Applied Ecology,land use intensity in grasslands changes in biodiversity species composition and specialisation in flower visitor networks

47,pollination has received attention recently due to reported sharp declines of apis mellifera in several locations and it has been proposed that diverse native bee communities may be key for continued pollination of economically important crops however there is some inconsistency in the literature as to how these communities should best be managed to address this issue we collected bees from an intensively managed agricultural region in eastern australia using blue vane traps both linear remnants of vegetation which form part of a larger corridor network and adjacent fields of native and exotic pastures wheat canola and lucerne were sampled a total of individual bees representing four families and species were collected highly modified environments of nectar bearing crop supported the most speciesrich bee assemblages and the highest abundance of individual bee species distance from the remnants did not limit the body size of species occupying fields up to m however richness of bee assemblages also responded positively to the presence of conservation land in nearby areas or the number of remnant native trees surrounding traps linear remnants of native vegetation contributed to assemblage heterogeneity by adding unique species to the regional pool our findings indicate that agricultural industries that currently rely on pollination by a mellifera should ensure that intensive land use is complemented by untilled areas in the form of conservation land or farm dams and scattered trees in fields to support wild pollinators that may act as insurance against further future losses of managed hives,Biological Conservation,supporting wild pollinators in a temperate agricultural landscape maintaining mosaics of natural features and production
48,the aim of this study was to assess species diversity and population abundance of the two main orders of pollinating insects hymenoptera and diptera the survey was conducted in grassland fragments within agro ecosystems in vojvodina as well as in surrounding fields with mass flowering crops pollinators were identified and the shannon wiener diversity index was used to measure their diversity five families subfamilies genera and species of insects were recorded all four big pollinator groups investigated were recorded hoverflies were the most abundant with of the total number of individuals followed by wild bees  honeybees  and bumblebees with,Archives of Biological Sciences,pollinator diversity hymenoptera and diptera in semi natural habitats in serbia during summer
49,recent studies have focused on ways to enhance floral availability on arable farmland but little attention has been paid to the importance of off farm habitats in providing forage for pollinators within farmed landscapes we conducted a comparative study to assess bumblebees and flower abundance on farmed and offfarm habitats in two low intensity systems in the uk the somerset levels and the outer hebrides in both farming systems both on and off farm habitats contributed to the mosaic of bumblebee forage in the somerset levels track edges and road verges were particularly important sources of forage for long tongued bumblebees cattle grazed pasture in somerset and winter grazed pasture in the outer hebrides were also notable sources of bumblebee forage non agricultural habitats need to be integrated into local land management plans to ensure the provision of forage for bumblebees throughout the breeding season,Apidologie,the use of off farm habitats by foraging bumblebees in agricultural landscapes implications for conservation management
50,urbanization of natural habitats is considered to have large impacts on local plant populations and their associated pollinator faunas which are expected to cause changes in both plant pollinator interactions and increased pollen limitation this study investigated the effects of increasing intensity of urban land use on pollinator diversity flower visitation rates and reproductive success in digitalis purpurea to this end we set up experimental populations of d purpurea in three urbanrural gradients and contrasted these against two large natural populations in the experimental populations we quantified the number of flower visits per min and applied supplemental hand pollinations to determine the impact of pollen limitation on fruit level seed set we found no impact of urbanization intensity on pollinator diversity at all locations studied and also the number of flower visits did not differ significantly between urban and rural populations reproductive success appeared however pollen limited in all sites even in the large and optimal reference populations this led us to conclude that the pollen limitation was caused by a bet hedging strategy of the species rather than by insufficient pollination,Landscape and Urban Planning,sex in the city reproductive success of digitalis purpurea in a gradient from urban to rural sites
51,since the s japan has become highly dependent on foreign countries for natural resources and the amount of managed lands e g coppice grassland and agricultural field has declined due to infrequent natural and human disturbance early successional species are now declining in japan here we surveyed bees birds and plants in four human disturbed open habitats pasture meadow young planted forest and abandoned clear cut and two forest habitats mature planted forest and natural old growth we extended a recently developed multispecies abundance model to accommodate count data and used the resulting models to estimate species functional group and community level state variables abundance and species richness at each site and compared them among the six habitats estimated individual level detection probability was quite low for bee species mean across species for birds thirty two credible interval  and one  bee and bird species respectively were suggested to be undetected by the field survey although habitats in which community level abundance and species richness was highest differed among taxa species richness and abundance of early successional species were similar in the four disturbed open habitats across taxa except for plants in the pasture habitat which was a good habitat only for several exotic species our results suggest that human disturbance especially the revival of plantation forestry may contribute to the restoration of early successional species in japan,Biodiversity and Conservation,biodiversity of man made open habitats in an underused country a class of multispecies abundance models for count data
52,bumblebees are important pollinators of crops and wildflowers in northern temperate regions the number of bumblebee species has declined in recent decades particularly in developing regions here we investigated the distribution and floral preferences of founder bumblebee queens that were collected between and in korea with the intention of gathering information useful in the conservation of native bumblebee populations a total of overwintered bumblebee queens were collected at locations from provinces the collected bumblebees consisted of five species of native bumblebees bombus ardens b ignitus b hypocrita spporoensis b ussurensis and b consobrinus wittenburgi and one species of exotic bumblebee b terrestris the dominant species were bombus ardens smith and bombus ignitus smith which accounted for and of the collected bumblebees respectively as a proportional distribution of the founder bumblebee queens that were collected b ignitus was the most common followed by b ardens b hypocrita spporoensis b ussurensis b consobrinus wittenburgi and b terrestris the bumblebee queens foraged from families of plants and plant species b ignitus bumblebees were primarily collected from prunus serrulata matsumura and corydalis speciosa max and b ardens bumblebees were primarily collected from rhodldendron mucronulatum turcz and prunus yedoensis,Unpublished,local distribution and floral preferences of founder bumblebee queens in korea
53,the beneficial roles of insects in facilitating pollination of many cultivated and uncultivated plants and as natural enemies of pest species cannot be overemphasized this study was carried out to ascertain the impact of habitat fragmentation and loss on the composition and diversity of the insect populations within the premises of the university of port harcourt nigeria four fragmented sites the biodiversity conservation area bca monoculture plantation of hevea brasilensis mp gambiama residential area gra and arable farmland af reflecting different land uses covers and varying degrees of disturbance were purposively chosen for the study pan trap and pit fall methods were used to trap insects at the above ground and ground levels respectively alpha diversity was measured in each site using simpson shannon menhinick and margalef indices while insect species compositional similarity between each pair of the sites was assessed using sorensens similarity index insect species richness was highest in bca followed by af and gra respectively while it was lowest in mp dorylus sp was the most abundant insect species in all the fragments with the highest number of individuals occurring in af af also had the highest total number of individuals for all the species followed by mp and gra respectively while the bca had the lowest total number of individuals alpha diversity was highest in bca followed by gra and af respectively while mp had the lowest diversity the level of similarity between each pair of the fragments in terms of their insect species composition was generally low below the highest variation was observed between bca and mp followed by mp and af while the least variation was observed between bca and gra the highest species richness and diversity observed in the bca underscores the importance of the site for insect species conservation and calls for better protection and management,Journal of Agricultural and Biological Sciences,insect species diversity in fragmented habitats of the university of port harcourt nigeria
54,bees are mobile organisms that seek food and nesting opportunities from a range of habitats it is important to understand the way they move in agricultural landscapes if we are to conserve them and benefit from their activity as pollinators we surveyed bees using directional flight interception malaise traps over a year period in two agricultural landscapes in south east queensland australia we placed traps at the ecotone between crops and remnant vegetation to establish the pattern of movement between these habitats species richness in these landscapes was high relative to that in comparable studies some bees were active year round but most were caught in the period september to march across the whole assemblage there was a significant pattern where more species were detected leaving rather than entering remnant vegetation the same bias was true for the number of individuals of the two most abundant species homalictus urbanus and apis mellifera species exclusively found in crops were smaller on average and therefore have smaller foraging range than their non crop counterparts together these patterns indicate that while bees are abundant in crop habitat the remnant vegetation is important as the point of origin for bee movements and the riparian remnant in particular is richer than the dry native remnant compositional similarity among samples was significantly explained by landscape but also movement direction i e to or from the riparian remnant because different species showed different patterns of response the landscape with greater native vegetation cover supported more species in and around crops than the landscape with less native vegetation,Austral Ecology,movement and phenology of bees in a subtropical australian agricultural landscape
55,the continuing spread of exotic plants and increasing human land use are two major drivers of global change threatening ecosystems species and their interactions separate effects of these two drivers on plantpollinator interactions have been thoroughly studied but we still lack an understanding of combined and potential interactive effects in a subtropical south african landscape we studied plantpollinator networks along two gradients of relative abundance of exotics and land use intensity in general pollinator visitation rates were lower on exotic plants than on native ones surprisingly while visitation rates on native plants increased with relative abundance of exotics and land use intensity pollinator visitation on exotic plants decreased along the same gradients there was a decrease in the specialization of plants on pollinators and vice versa with both drivers regardless of plant origin decreases in pollinator specialization thereby seemed to be mediated by a species turnover towards habitat generalists however contrary to expectations we detected no interactive effects between the two drivers our results suggest that exotic plants and land use promote generalist plants and pollinators while negatively affecting specialized plantpollinator interactions weak integration and high specialization of exotic plants may have prevented interactive effects between exotic plants and land use still the additive effects of exotic plants and land use on specialized plantpollinator interactions would have been overlooked in a single factor study we therefore highlight the need to consider multiple drivers of global change in ecological research and conservation management,Oecologia,additive effects of exotic plant abundance and land use intensity on plant pollinator interactions
56,during june an exploratory dung beetle survey coleoptera scarabaeidae scarabaeinae was conducted in southwestghana at the southern edge of ankasa conservation area which is a km conserved region of the threatened eastern upper guinean rainforest the survey provided a quantitative assessment of peripheral deforestation effects and an inventory for species on omnivore dung pitfall traps baitedwith pig dungwere placed in both selectively logged and unlogged rainforest as well as in nearby oil palmand cacao plantations the ankasa forest inventory wasmostly comprised of species previously trapped by human dung in thewestern upper guinean rainforest of taõ¨ national park co te dÕivoire however there was relatively low species abundance similarity between the june july assemblages on omnivore dung in taõ¨ and ankasa rainforests and even lower similarity between assemblages of ankasa and the adjacent plantations of species recorded in ankasa forest mostwere absent or rare in plantationswhere assemblageswere numerically dominated by species previously recorded from the west african savannas this replacement plantation fauna showed signiÞcantly lower species richness and diversity but signiÞcantly higher abundance compared with ankasa forest assemblages the results reiterate that forest reserves are essential for the conservation of specialist rainforest dung beetle species,Environmental Entomology,effect of deforestation on a southwest ghana dung beetle assemblage coleoptera scarabaeidae at the periphery of ankasa conservation area
57,the present study aims to characterise the assemblages of drosophilidae sampled from four sites subject to different levels of urbanisation in the city of florianópolis south brazil five samples were collected between august and august and  ve between august and august in each site a gradual change in the dominant species was observed in the urbanisation gradient with an increase in relative abundance of exotic species in urban areas among the native species the relative abundance of drosophila capricorni dobzhansky pavan had an expressive decrease in the other hand the richness in the low urbanisation site increased probably due to the presence of urban gardens the diversity index did not vary signi cantly among sites but its correlation with evenness and richness changed,Neotropical Entomology,changes in brazilian drosophilidae diptera assemblages across an urbanisation gradient
58,searching for indicator taxa representative of diverse assemblages such as arthropods is an important objective of many conservation studies we evaluated the impacts of a wide gradient of disturbance in gabon on a range of arthropod assemblages representing different feeding guilds we examined × arthropod individuals from which focal taxa were separated into morphospecies replication included the understory of sites in each of different stages of forest succession and land use i e habitats after logging old and young forests savanna and gardens we used complementary sampling methods to survey sites throughout the year overall differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were greatest between forest and open habitats and cleared forest invaded by savanna had the lowest abundance and diversity the magnitude of faunal differences was much smaller between old and young forests when considered at this local scale anthropogenic modification of habitats did not result in a monotonous decline of diversity because many herbivore pests and their associated predators and parasitoids were abundant and diverse in gardens where plant productivity was kept artificially high year round through watering and crop rotation we used a variety of response variables to measure the strength of correlations across survey locations among focal taxa these could be ranked as follows in terms of decreasing number of significant correlations species turnover abundance observed species richness estimated species richness percentage of site specific species the number of significant correlations was generally low and apparently unrelated to taxonomy or guild structure our results emphasize the value of reporting species turnover in conservation studies as opposed to simply measuring species richness and that the search for indicator taxa is elusive in the tropics one promising alternative might be to consider predictor sets of a small number of taxa representative of different functional groups as identified in our study,Conservation Biology,changes in arthropod assemblages along a wide gradient of disturbance in gabon

61,objective in the transitional forest savannah zone human pressure on natural resources occurs mainly through converting forests into diverse land use systems land use management has an important impact on soil and its functional role in maintaining ecosystem processes it generally results in dramatic and rapid changes in vegetation that are likely to affect soil invertebrate communities significantly in the context of the sustainable use of natural resources in tropical countries an investigation was conducted in cote divoire to study the impacts of land use type on biodiversity methodology and results data were collected on ant diversity and relative abundance in five land use types i forest in lamto reserve ii rural forest iii food crop plantations iv cocoa and v pineapple plantations with the aim of characterizing ant assemblage in response to land use change standard sampling methods winkler leaf litter extraction pitfall trapping and soil monolith extraction were used to collect ants along three transects of m length per land use type a total of one hundred and eighteen ant species were found in all habitats combined the rural forest was the most species rich habitat species followed in decreasing order by the lamto forest species food crop plantations species cocoa plantations species and pineapple plantations species conclusions and application of findings three main conclusions were drawn from this study i a decrease in terrestrial ant diversity occurred with increasing land use intensification ii food crop lands had levels of ant diversity comparable to those of the forests however there were dramatic changes in the community structure iii the rural forests are near natural and may serve as refuges for ant diversity these findings encourage sustainable types of land use involving agro forestry practices to allow natural recovery processes after agricultural disturbance this approach will help in the conservation of biodiversity,Journal of Applied Biosciences,diversity and abundance of terrestrial ants along a gradient of land use intensification in a transitional forest savannah zone of côte d ivoire
62,huge areas of diverse tropical forest are lost or degraded every year with dramatic consequences for biodiversity human activities such as deforestation fragmentation over exploitation and monoculture practices are the main drivers of tropical forest biodiversity loss investigating of these threats with focusses on changes in species richness or species diversity will be able to minimize any impact of human activities at the early stage in a certain region therefore to know the impact of human activities to dynamic of insect communities in gunung salak west java we measured moth diversity and their structure within communities by comparing the index diversity species richness and species composition across five different habitat types the results showed that the habitat changes due to human activities had changed not only to the moth diversity but also to their structure within communities the number of moth species decreased significantly as well as the number of lower taxa family in the disturbed forest secondary forest agathis forest and transition area within ranges and the composition of the two main families geometridae and noctuidae also showed a major change family geometridae decreased within ranges in the disturbed area but noctuidae increased up to in those areas indeed habitat lost due to human activities such as illegal logging change of land use and land clearing is the main threats to decrease on macro moth diversity and change their structures within communities,Hayati Journal of Biosciences,the impact of human activities to dynamic of insect communities a case study in gunung salak west java
63,habitat loss and fragmentation have turned into the most important threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide here we investigate the effects of habitat fragmentation and drastic changes in tree communities on dung beetle richness and community structure this study was carried out in a severely fragmented km forest landscape of the atlantic forest of north eastern brazil sampling was carried out in forest fragments between september and march with the use of pitfall traps and flight interception traps a total of individuals and species of dung beetle were collected fragment area and isolation were the most significant explanatory variables for predictable and conspicuous changes in dung beetle species richness smaller and isolated fragments presented lower number of species but fragments with lower tree species richness and lower proportion of shade tolerant species were also considerably impoverished in terms of dung beetle species richness the body mass of dung beetles were explained by fragment area and the percentage of emergent trees with smaller and less stratified fragments being dominated by small bodied dung beetles an ordination analysis segregated dung beetle communities between small fragments ha and the control area seventy seven percent of the species were recorded in the control area and of all species were unique to this habitat our findings indicate that large fragments in the atlantic forest appear to consist in a sort of irreplaceable habitats for particular groups of dung beetle species as well as for the integrity of their communities,Biological Conservation,habitat fragmentation alters the structure of dung beetle communities in the atlantic forest
64,a key challenge for tropical conservation biologists is to assess how forest management practices affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions dung beetles scarabaeidae scarabaeinae provide an ideal focal guild for such studies we compared dung beetle assemblages and experimentally assessed rates of dung removal and seed burial in undisturbed forest low intensity selectively logged forest under sustainable forest management and high intensity logged forest not under sustainable management in malaysian borneo in total individuals from species of dung beetle were collected there were no significant differences in abundance biomass or diversity across sites species richness was significantly lower in the high intensity logged sites beta diversity was low of species recorded in undisturbed forest sites were also captured in low intensity sites and in high intensity sites the environmental and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition an average of  of dung was removed over h mean dung and seed removal were significantly lower in the high intensity logged sites dung removal rates were significantly and positively correlated with dung beetle species richness but not with dung beetle biomass or abundance however the biomass of large bodied nocturnal dung beetles was positively correlated with dung removal in contrast to previous studies dung beetle biomass and abundance were not correlated with species richness indicative of density compensation overall dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to low intensity but not high intensity selective logging these differences may be related to changes in the abundance and biomass of particular dung beetle species or guilds rather than community wide measures of abundance and biomass highlighting the need to move beyond simplistic biodiversity ecosystem functioning correlations to understand the functional consequences of habitat modification in high diversity ecosystems,Biological Conservation,biodiversity and ecosystem function of tropical forest dung beetles under contrasting logging regimes
65,in the semi arid steppe rangelands of central turkey festuca valesiaca and thymus sipyleus ssp rosulans have become the dominant species on degraded pastures we hypothesized that decreases in species richness and abundance are correlated with increasing prevalence of these two species therefore our objectives were to determine whether there are patterns in examined vegetation how dominant species contribute to these patterns and how patterns differ between grazed and ungrazed vegetation we determined that protection from grazing increased species richness grazing significantly changed composition through decreasing total plant forb grass and f valesiaca covers while substantially increasing t sipyleus cover topography soil and grazing appear to impact the dominance of plant communities where f valesiaca and t sipyleus prevail these two dominant species had a significant effect in shaping vegetation patterns based on regression analysis alterations in species richness with changes in cover of forbs and shrubs were evident and spatial heterogeneity of f valesiaca and t sipyleus indicated unstable vegetative patterns in heavily grazed pastures and successional changes in protected pastures our study results identify f valesiaca and t sipyleus as indicator species of vegetation suppression in condition assessments of degraded steppe rangelands,Journal of Arid Environments,assessment of grazing effect on sheep fescue festuca valesiaca dominated steppe rangelands in the semi arid central anatolian region of turkey

78,warmer temperatures can alter the phenology and distribution of individual species however differences across species may blur community level phenological responses to climate or cause biotic homogenization by consistently favoring certain taxa additionally the response of insect communities to climate will be subject to plant mediated effects which may or may not overshadow the direct effect of rising temperatures on insects finally recent evidence for the importance of interaction effects between global change drivers suggests that phenological responses of communities to climate may be altered by other drivers we used a natural temperature gradient generated by elevation and topology combined with experimental nitrogen fertilization to investigate the effects of elevated temperature and globally increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on the structure and phenology of a seminatural grassland herbivore assemblage lepidopteran insects we found that both drivers alone and in combination severely altered how the relative abundance and composition of species changed through time importantly warmer temperatures were associated with biotic homogenization such that herbivore assemblages in the warmest plots had more similar species composition than those in intermediate or cool plots changes in herbivore composition and abundance were largely mediated by changes in the plant community with increased nonnative grass cover under high treatment levels being the strongest determinant of herbivore abundance in addition to compositional changes total herbivore biomass more than doubled under elevated nitrogen and increased more than fourfold with temperature bearing important functional implications for herbivores as consumers and as a prey resource the crucial role of nonnative plant dominance in mediating responses of herbivores to change combined with the frequent nonadditive positive and negative effects of the two drivers and the differential responses of species highlight that understanding complex ecosystem responses will benefit from multifactor multitrophic experiments at community scales or larger,Ecology,plant mediated and nonadditive effects of two global change drivers on an insect herbivore community
79,large isolated trees are a prominent part of town planning and the nature of the urban environment poses unique challenges in sampling the arthropod assemblages found on them as part of a larger study on the role of these trees in supporting wider biodiversity we undertook a trial of arthropod sampling methods to compare the relative impact of sampling method versus the species of tree sampled using four species of study trees three sampling methods were trialed an inverted cone based bole trap a compact flight intercept trap and branch bagging and clipping total arthropod abundance richness and diversity were modeled using generalised linear mixed models which showed that in many cases the variation between sampling method was larger than that found between tree species all three of the sampling methods proved to be practical in the field and overcame the challenges faced in sampling urban trees thereby providing the opportunity for more detailed study our findings also highlight the case for a multifaceted approach to sampling arthropods if a complete picture of the community assemblage is to be gained,Journal of Insect Conservation,arboreal arthropod sampling methods for urban trees
80,the way in which species interactions are altered at habitat edges is an emerging concern in conservation biology with some theories predicting edge affected habitats to be less stable and exhibit intensified species interactions relative to interior habitats one little studied interaction is phoresy where an individual of one species attaches itself to an individual of another species for the purpose of dispersal bumble bees bombus spp are important crop pollinators around the world and at least species of phoretic mites have been associated with various bumble bee species here we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced european b terrestris across forest grassland edges in the southern alps of new zealand and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads on these mobile pollinators bumble bees penetrated up to m inside forest fragments with abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat by contrast phoretic mite loads increased towards the forest interior overall phoretic mite loads on b terrestris were greatest in the forest canopy suggesting that this species interaction is intensified in natural habitat compared to that in the anthropogenic land use surrounding forest fragments our data indicate that phoretic loads on bumble bees are elevated in forest canopies the functional significance of altered bumble bee  mite interactions for pollination services at forest edges remains to be tested,Insect Conservation and Diversity,altered species interactions at forest edges contrasting edge effects on bumble bees and their phoretic mite loads in temperate forest remnants
81,honeybees are used as a major agricultural input around the world and their pollination services have been valued at us billion to the united states alone dramatic declines in honeybee populations around the globe however questioned the sustainability of this reliance on a single pollinator species in this study i investigated the response of wild pollinator communities to declining honeybee density and changing land use intensity to determine the potential of wild pollinators to compensate for honeybee loss in increasingly human modified environment i generated a gradient of declining honeybee density using increasing distances from commercial bee hives and conducted flower observations on experimentally grown plants across this gradient i investigate how declining honeybee densities and intensifying land use combine to influence the composition of the pollinator community as a whole then go on to explore individual trends in the most common pollinator species i then analyze how this impacts the transport of viable pollen by the pollinator community and determine how these changes alter seed set in several common plant species i then change my focus away from the composition of the pollinator community and instead investigate how declining honeybee densities and land use intensification influence the structuring of interactions between plants and pollinators within the community i identify the pollen species carried by pollinators and use this to construct a network of pollination interactions i then use this network to analyze how changes in the way species interact influences the pollination services delivered by the pollinator community to different plant groups weeds native plants and crop species my findings show that honeybee declines may have a large impact on community structure and interactions within pollination systems i observed a significant shift in the wild pollinator community composition as honeybee densities declined from a generally bee hoverfly dominated community to one more dominated by large flies this was associated with a significant decline in the total pollen load transported by the community indicating that pollination services may suffer in the absence of honeybees as honeybee densities declined however i also observed a shift toward greater specialisation of pollinators on abundant resources increased pollinator constancy and a higher viability rate of the pollen transported these findings show that although the total amount of pollen transported by the community declined as honeybee densities decreased the probability of this pollen transport resulting in effective pollination likely increased thus i observed no decrease in seed set with honeybee declines in any of the three plant species tested and one of these even showed a significant increase finally i also demonstrated that this change differentially affected different plant types and that the extent of changes to each plant species differed between land use types this reflected changes in the relative abundance of pollen types in different land uses with greater specialisation in the absence of honeybees disproportionately benefiting common species these findings have strong implications for several contemporary issues in pollination biology both locally within new zealand and on a global scale these are discussed in the following sections finally i conclude by discussing the implications of this research on several contemporary issues in pollination biology namely the ability for wild pollinators to compensate for honeybee declines the impact of honeybees on natural new zealand ecosystems the contribution of honeybees to invasive weed pollination and finally the management of surrounding land use types to maximize the effectiveness of wild pollinators,,honeybee declines in a changing landscape interactive effects of honeybee declines and land use intensification on pollinator communities
82,whereas the changes in avian community composition resulting from urban development are well described the specific factors that allow certain species to thrive in urban areas remain poorly understood however the availability of arthropod prey is emerging as a potentially important factor in shaping urban bird communities silvereyes zosterops lateralis arecommonin urban areas and so provide a useful study organism to test the factors that allow somebirds tobecome urban winners wehere present the results of an observational study on the foraging frequency of silvereyes and arthropod prey availability in native and exotic urban trees in dunedin new zealand silvereyes more frequently used individual trees native or exotic that supported the highest level of arthropod abundance silvereye foraging also varied greatly on a seasonal scale silvereyes were able to adjust their seasonal foraging to incorporate exotic vegetation with high arthropod abundances we conclude that the flexibility of silvereyes with regards to foraging and their use of exotic plant species are important factors in their success in surviving urban development,Emu,resource availability and foraging of silvereyes zosterops lateralis in urban trees
83,as post disturbance community response depends on the characteristics of the ecosystem and the species composition so does the invasion of exotic species rely on their suitability to the new environment here we test two hypotheses exotic spider species dominate the community after burning and two traits are prevalent for their colonisation ability ballooning and body size the latter being correlated with their dispersal ability we established spring burn summer burn and unburned experimental plots in a new zealand tussock grassland area and collected annual samples and years before and after the burning respectively exotic spider abundance increased in the two burn treatments driven by an increase in linyphiidae indicator analysis showed that exotic and native species characterised burned and unburned plots respectively generalised linear mixed effects models indicated that ballooning had a positive effect on the post burning establishment density of spiders in summer burn plots but not in spring plots body size had a positive effect oncolonisation and establishment the ability to balloon may partly explain the dominance of exotic linyphiidae species larger spiders are better at moving into and colonising burned sites probably because of their ability to travel longer distances over land native species showed a low resilience to burning and although confirmation requires longer term data our findings suggest that frequent fires could cause long lasting damage to the native spider fauna of tussock grasslands and we propose limiting the use of fire to essential situations,Biological Invasions,big and aerial invaders dominance of exotic spiders in burned new zealand tussock grasslands
84,aim pollination services are at risk from land use change and intensification but responses of individual pollinator species are often variable making it difficult to detect and understand community level impacts on pollination we investigated changes in community composition and functional diversity of insect pollinator communities under land use change in a highly modified landscape location canterbury region south island new zealand methods we trapped insect pollinators every month for year at sites across four land use types of increasing intensity in new zealand gardens with native vegetation blackcurrant orchards dairy farms and rotational cropping farms we investigated changes in pollinator species and functional richness and differences in species and functional composition results under increasing land use intensity both species and functional richness declined markedly changes in functional richness however were overall not significantly different than expected based on the observed declines in species richness nevertheless there was a significant trend towards greater than expected functional richness within less intensive land use types and lower than expected functional richness within intensive land use types the order of species loss under increasing land use intensity was non random as pollinators with a narrow diet breadth large body size solitary behaviour and a preference for non floral larval food resources were lost first main conclusions our study shows that pollinator species bearing particular trait attributes are susceptible to differences in land use our study suggests that pollination services may be more vulnerable to environmental changes and disturbances in more intensive land use types as a result of lower pollinator functional richness,Diversity and Distributions,the winners and losers of land use intensification pollinator community disassembly is non random and alters functional diversity
85,a comparative study on oribatid mite communities was carried out at four sites forming a chronosequence of spruce forest stands stand age and years tharandter wald germany a total of species was found the moderate decline of oribatid species richness at the years old stand together with a strong deviation from the log series model indicate that the community had not recovered from initial disturbance after years close community similarity between the and the years old stands nevertheless suggests a delayed response of the oribatid fauna to strong changes in environmental conditions species richness significantly increased from to years old stand this was accompanied by a strong increase of oribatid abundance that was largely due to the increase of only two species oppiella nova and tectocepheus velatus particularly strong deviation from the log series model at this site suggests that community disturbance becomes most intense at intermediate stages of forest development further analyses revealed an alteration of the feeding structure as well as a stimulation of species that either prefer or are at least able to colonize deeper layers of the soil profile in the years old stand this indicates marked changes in both nutritional conditions and microclimate in the uppermost horizons years after clear cutting a very high c mineralization rate measured in the years old stand confirms the important contribution of decomposition processes to net ecosystem production in young stands however no strong correlation between oribatid mite community variance and environmental conditions could be established by means of a canonical correspondence analysis it is concluded that oribatid mite communities are a fairly conservative element of the decomposer fauna in temperate spruce forests and might thus be an important component in the decomposer systems buffering mechanisms against strong environmental change our data indicate a multifaceted reaction of the oribatid community to long lasting changes in site conditions rather than a straightforward response to certain environmental factors,Soil Biology & Biochemistry,oribatid mite diversity and community dynamics in a spruce chronosequence
86,primary tropical forests are renowned for their high biodiversity and carbon storage and considerable research has documented both species and carbon losses with deforestation and agricultural land uses economic drivers are now leading to the abandonment of agricultural lands and the area in secondary forests is increasing we know little about how long it takes for these ecosystems to achieve the structural and compositional characteristics of primary forests in this study we examine changes in plant species composition and aboveground biomass during eight decades of tropical secondary succession in puerto rico and compare these patterns with primary forests using a well replicated chronosequence approach we sampled primary forests and secondary forests established and years ago on abandoned pastures tree species composition in all secondary forests was different from that of primary forests and could be divided into early and year vs late and year successional phases the highest rates of aboveground biomass accumulation occurred in the first years with rates of c sequestration peaking at ± mg c·ha·yr reforestation of pastures resulted in an accumulation of mg c ha in aboveground standing live biomass over years the year old secondary forests had greater biomass than the primary forests due to the replacement of woody species by palms in the primary forests our results show that these new ecosystems have different species composition but similar species richness and significant potential for carbon sequestration compared to remnant primary forests,Ecological Applications,long term patterns in tropical reforestation plant community composition and aboveground biomass accumulation

88,plantations and secondary forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes yet we have an insufficient understanding of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation and almost none for most arthropods in species rich tropical forests we sampled epigeic arachnids amblypygi araneae opiliones scorpiones and uropygi in primary secondary  years and eucalyptus plantation  years forests in the jari region of northeastern brazilian amazonia we sampled five independent sites in each forest type between january and june collecting a total of individuals adults species including adults species in eucalyptus in secondary forest and in primary forest we compared species richness species abundance distributions and community structure between the three forest types and identified the species that were characteristic of each forest type rarefaction analyses showed that undisturbed primary forest harbored significantly more species and a similar overall abundance as second growth forest while levels of species richness were similar between secondary forest and eucalyptus the species composition and abundance structure of arachnid assemblages was distinct in all three forest types considering all species sampled were only sampled in primary forest in secondary forest and in eucalyptus most species sampled in plantation forests are known to be wide ranging habitat generalists our data indicate that regenerating forests are not biological deserts and of species sampled in primary forest were also captured in secondary and plantation forests respectively and can therefore help mitigate some of the negative effects of deforestation for epigeic arachnids however these replacement habitats do not provide a substitute for primary forest and may fail to conserve many of those species most at risk from extinction,Journal of Arachnology,the value of primary secondary and plantation forests for neotropical epigeic arachnids
89,secondary forests are a vital part of the tropical landscape and their worldwide extent and importance continues to increase here we present the largest chronosequence data set on forest succession in the wet tropics that includes both secondary and old growth sites we performed ha vegetation inventories in sites in northeastern costa rica including seven old growth forests and secondary forests on former pastures ranging from to yr the secondary forest sites were formerly pasture for intervals of  yr aboveground biomass in secondary forests recovered rapidly with sites already exhibiting values comparable to old growth after  yr and biomass accumulation was not impacted by the length of time that a site was in pasture species richness reached old growth levels in as little as yr although sites that were in pasture for yr had significantly lower species richness forest cover near the sites at the time of forest establishment did not significantly impact biomass or species richness and the species composition of older secondary forest sites yr converged with that of old growth these results emphasize the resilience of tropical ecosystems in this region and the high conservation value of secondary forests,Biotropica,rapid recovery of biomass species richness and species composition in a forest chronosequence in northeastern costa rica

91,we examined the short term  years dynamics of stand structure and species composition of two chronosequences of secondary forest stands derived from abandoned cattle pastures  years since abandonment in the luquillo and carite mountains of eastern puerto rico in hurricane georges struck puerto rico affecting both chronosequences stem densities decreased in all sites with a significant effect of age class intermediate aged sites had the greatest decrease in density and the largest change in the distribution of size classes although there was a significant decrease in the small size classes cm dbh due to physical damage from falling debris there was a large increase in the  cm dbh classes due to growth of surviving stems basal area decreased in of the sites and showed only a slight gain in the other sites species richness decreased in all but one site and there was a greater proportional loss of shrub species than tree species multivariate ordination successfully placed the resampled sites within their original ordinations with acceptable stress indicating there was no significant change in species composition or deviation from successional pathways during the period compared with effects of land use hurricanes create minor variation from expected successional pathways however hurricanes contribute to regional and landscape scale variation in both stand structure and species composition,Restoration Ecology,early trajectories of spontaneous vegetation recovery after intensive agricultural land use
92,the carbon storage and conservation value of old growth tropical forests is clear but the value of logged forest is less certain here we analyse observations of individuals from taxonomic groups and species covering up to years of post logging regeneration and quantify the impacts of logging on carbon storage and biodiversity within lowland dipterocarp forests of sabah borneo we estimate that forests lost ca of above ground biomass as a result of logging but despite this high level of degradation logged forest retained considerable conservation value floral species richness was higher in logged forest than in primary forest and whilst faunal species richness was typically lower in logged forest in most cases the difference between habitats was no greater than ca moreover in most studies of species recorded in primary forest were also present in logged forest including species of conservation concern during recovery logged forest accumulated carbon at five times the rate of natural forest and mg c ha year respectively we conclude that allowing the continued regeneration of extensive areas of borneos forest that have already been logged and are at risk of conversion to other land uses would provide a significant carbon store that is likely to increase over time protecting intact forest is critical for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation but the contribution of logged forest to these twin goals should not be overlooked,Biodiversity and Conservation,the high value of logged tropical forests lessons from northern borneo
93,successful regeneration of secondary tropical forest might be crucial in the conservation of rainforests since large areas of primary forest have been destroyed or degraded animal communities might play an important role in restoration of biological diversity in these secondary habitats since some groups have high mobility and capacity for dispersal fruit feeding butterflies were trapped to measure differences between butterfly communities in primary rainforest and disturbed forest habitats of different stage of regeneration including clear cut abandoned farmland newly planted forest and middle aged secondary growth specimens representing species were identified from traps operated for days extremely high values of rarefied species richness were estimated in the clear cut habitat due to the high number of singletons and doubletons this was caused by a gap effect that allowed penetration of canopy and open area species after disturbance the differences between butterfly communities were best demonstrated through ecological composition richness and abundance of indicator groups and habitat similarity based on jaccard s similarity index the results show a clear ability of butterfly communities in degraded forest habitats to regenerate in years after clearance,Journal of Insect Conservation,butterfly community recovery in degraded rainforest habitats in the upper guinean forest zone kakum forest ghana
94,in some tropical regions following the abandonment of agriculture and pastures secondary forests can recover plant species richness and forest structure e g canopy cover biomass however the importance of these secondary forests for fauna is not clear secondary forests can benefit fauna by providing suitable habitats connecting forests fragments and increasing gene flow previous studies of forest regeneration have showed different levels of amphibian recovery in puerto rico  years old secondary forests achieved similar amphibian species richness and composition in comparison with old growth forests while in brazil secondary forests from to years of recovery only recovered of the species of old growth forests we evaluated amphibian recovery in secondary forests in northeastern costa rica by assessing amphibian recovery in secondary forests that vary in age of recovery and in three old growth forests using visual and acoustic surveys our sites varied in terms of their landscape e g amount of surrounding forest and forest characteristics e g forest age aboveground biomass basal area number of tree species number of stems leaf litter depth but there was no relationship between these characteristics and amphibian species richness or species composition we found that amphibians are recovering rapidly in secondary forests in costa rica and even young forests  years had similar species richness and composition in comparison with old growth forests these forests are providing suitable microhabitats conditions for amphibians in addition this study highlights the importance of landscape characteristics the abundance of amphibian species sources e g forest patches and connections between forests appear to be helping the species colonize these sites worldwide the area of secondary forests is increasing and our results show that these habitats are suitable for a diversity of amphibian species suggesting that these forests can help reduce amphibian population and species decline,Biological Conservation,recovery of amphibian species richness and composition in a chronosequence of secondary forests northeastern costa rica
95,anthropogenic activities have resulted in extensive deforestation and forest degradation on many tropical oceanic islands for instance some islands in the solomon archipelago have as little as of primary forests remaining with few of these remnants protected from future land use change we examine the plant species and functional diversity excluding adult canopy trees of sites from four forest land use types two types of primary forest secondary forest and abandoned tree plantations and two common human maintained land use types coconut plantations and grazed pastures across three elevation bands on kolombangara island solomon islands in total we surveyed species from families of which only were non native species richness was lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures and declined with increasing elevation across all land use types functional diversity was similar between primary and secondary forest high richness high evenness and unaltered dispersion and lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures our results suggest that species and functional richness have had divergent responses to land use change in forest land uses indicative of a loss of functional redundancy despite structural and compositional similarities among primary forests and degraded forest land uses full recovery of secondary and commercial plantations has not been achieved we suggest that conservation of kolombangaras forest understory flora will require reserves across the islands elevation gradient and may require active restoration in the future particularly if degrading activities continue at the current rate,Biological Conservation,understory plant species and functional diversity in the degraded wet tropical forests of kolombangara island solomon islands
96,the area of primary forest is decreasing throughout the tropical world and being replaced by secondary forests many policy makers regard these secondary forests as being unworthy of protection since they are too degraded to have any commercial or conservation value because of this many are now being cleared for alternative land uses but there are a variety of types of secondary forest differing in the extent to which they have been disturbed the frequency at which this has taken place and because of their position in the landscape in their capacity to be recolonized from species from intact primary forests this means that some secondary forests may not be as degraded as is supposed and many may have the capacity to recover if protected from further disturbances this study reports on a comparison between remnant forest and frequently and infrequently disturbed secondary forests in lao pdr the frequently disturbed forest had been cleared for shifting cultivation  times in the past years while the infrequently disturbed sites had been cleared only once the study found comparatively small differences in the occurrence of primary forest species in these two types of secondary forest and that they still contained a large proportion of primary forest tree species despite the disturbance history this apparent resilience may be due to the capacity of many species to resprout after disturbances and their ability to recolonize across the present agricultural matrix,Forest Ecology & Management,primary tree species diversity in secondary fallow forests of laos
97,as part of the international globenet project carabid beetles coleoptera carabidae were collected using pitfall traps from four urban four suburban and four rural sites in hiroshima city japan during the summer season in agreement with expectation carabid abundance and species richness decreased significantly from rural to urban sites furthermore no large and only few individuals of medium sized specialist species were collected from the urban environment while many specimens of medium sized and some large sized specialist species were collected from the suburban and rural sites hiroshima city was characterised by medium sized generalist carabids while the suburbs and the rural environments were characterised by small sized generalist beetles these results did not apply at the species level to summarise we found a significant effect of urbanisation on the composition of carabid beetle assemblages in hiroshima city these changes were similar to those found in previous studies performed in sofia bulgaria edmonton canada and helsinki finland thus it appears that urbanisation has some similar and predictable effects on carabid assemblages in various parts of the world,Ecography,changes in carabid beetle assemblages across an urban rural gradient in japan
98,in the present study epiphytic bryophytes were employed as a model system in an integrated way both as bioindicators at species population and community levels and as bioaccumulators of airborne trace elements twenty sites with quercus ilex trees were chosen in a mediterranean area both in urban and natural locations with an altitude ranging from to about m a s l in coastal and inland areas campania italy data on the presence of species cover values and phenology were recorded for each site and the index of atmospheric purity iap was calculated the data matrix of frequency cover x species was analysed by multivariate methods data obtained clearly show that in urban sites the number of species and iap values are lower and that acrocarpous mosses and vegetative reproduction occur more frequently contents of trace elements al as cd co cr cu fe mn mo ni pb ti v zn were measured in four species and concentrations were normalised to the soil pattern by calculating the enrichment factor ef the results show the large contribution of resuspended soil particles to the chemical composition of the analysed bryophytes all the examined species were enriched in cd cu and zn and in some cases showed high ef for pb the differences among epiphytic bryophyte vegetation are discussed in order to evaluate suspected alterations due to human impact and or environmental change,Plant Ecology,biodiversity and trace element content of epiphytic bryophytes in urban and extraurban sites of southern italy
99,the biodiversity of insects within urban areas has been relatively little studied given the large and ever increasing extent of urban areas and that the insect species richness there can be high it is important to know the factors determining that aspect of biodiversity in this study two of these factors namely habitat management and area were considered arboreal and grassland hemiptera and grassland plants were sampled on roundabouts and other road enclosed sites in the town of bracknell hemiptera were sampled using suction sampling and tree beating a significant species area relationship was found for arboreal hemiptera which was strongly related to habitat diversity for both grassland plants and hemiptera grassland management by mowing had a significant effect on species richness despite the management grassland plants showed a significant species area relationship however the effect of management on hemiptera was great enough to outweigh any area effect as the size of open spaces is often constrained in urban areas altering habitat management has a greater potential for enhancing biodiversity for arboreal hemiptera choice of trees for planting is of particular importance white for grassland hemiptera diversity would be increased with a reduction in the intensity of management such a reduction in the frequency of mowing,Basic and Applied Ecology,biodiversity on urban roundabouts hemiptera management and the species area relationship
100,within the goal of defining indicators species or combinations of life history traits for habitat quality in an urban environment we investigated effects of urbanization on the community composition and morphological characteristics of carabid beetles between may and july nine woodlots were sampled along three axes representing urban rural gradients from the centre of the city of hamburg to its rural borders species richness decreased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of the sites but was uncorrelated with the size of the site species assemblages were highly nested making successive loss of species predictable responsivness towards urbanization could not be linked to specific life history traits body length of one species carabus nemoralis declined towards the city centre four species were found at all sites these four species showed differences in fluctuating asymmetry fa at the different sites that could not be interpreted as an indication of responses to habitat suitability fa of the remaining species species negatively affected by urbanization increased towards the city centre and with increasing isolation of a site this matched the prediction that fa indicates habitat quality thus urban effects lead to changes of communities through a predictable loss of species to a reduction in body size in one species and to increased fa in species which are susceptible to urbanization the results indicate that the different sites were islands in an urban matrix rather than parts of a green network which would allow free exchange of plants and animals within the city of hamburg,Basic and Applied Ecology,carabid beetle community composition body size and fluctuating asymmetry along an urban rural gradient
101,the responses of ground beetles to an urbanisation gradient forest suburban area urban park were studied in and near soro south zealand denmark during april october the average number of species per trap did not differ significantly among the three urbanisation stages the average number of forest species was significantly higher in the forest area species trap than in either the suburban spp trap or the urban spp trap areas both the number of open habitat species spp trap and the generalist species spp trap were highest in the urban area the number of predaceous species was highest in the forest area spp trap while the number of omnivorous species was highest in the urban area spp trap multivariate statistical procedures nmds sorensen similarity index also confirmed that species composition changed remarkably along the forest suburban urban gradient the highest number of species s was found at the urban area deviating from trends at other northern hemisphere sites canada finland where the overall species richness was highest at the forest habitats urban green areas including forest patches contribute to the quality of urban life and thus should be conserved apart from their recreational value which is widely appreciated and enjoyed by human inhabitants such green urban spaces provide seemingly adequate habitat for numerous species of ground beetles found in less developed forest areas some distance from the city core,Acta Oecologica,patterns in ground beetle coleoptera carabidae assemblages along an urbanisation gradient in denmark

105,there are many variables within an urban landscape that can be expected to influence faunal diversity we used a mechanistic approach to observe the relative importance of each of these variables in describing the diversity of avian communities in urban and peri urban areas of cape town south africa situated within cape floristic region a global plant biodiversity hotspot we expected to find a strong influence of habitat amount and arrangement across a fragmented urban rural gradient birds were sampled in patches of fragmented cape flats sand fynbos at locations during the middle of summer november january environmental data included on site observations existing gis layers and remotely sensed data bird community composition was related to habitat amount arrangement and quality correlations partial correlations and structural equation analysis showed that habitat amount and arrangement had insignificant effects on species richness across the urban gradient changes in urban density and the presence or absence of the invasive alien tree species acacia saligna blue wattle appeared to be the main drivers of avian species richness increasing urban density decreasing a saligna density and decreasing canopy height correlated with higher avian species richness with confounding variables corrected for for the management of urban biodiversity our results suggest that the most urgent focus should be on retaining the quality remaining areas of native vegetation and particularly containing the spread of a salgina rather than extending current networks with poor quality habitat more generally habitat quality appears to be more important than habitat amount or arrangement in this system we suggest that this observation be encorporated into further research to more effectively predict avian responses to landscape change and that more must be done to adequately capture the critical and complex role of the matrix in terrestrial systems,Biological Conservation,the confounding influence of homogenising invasive species in a globally endangered and largely urban biome does habitat quality dominate avian biodiversity
106,the rapid expansion of the world s urban population is a major driver of contemporary landscape change and ecosystem modification urbanisation destroys degrades and fragments native ecosystems replacing them with a heterogeneous matrix of urban development parks roads and isolated remnant fragments of varying size and quality this presents a major challenge for biodiversity conservation within urban areas to make spatially explicit decisions about urban biodiversity conservation actions urban planners and managers need to be able to separate the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration from patch and local site scale variables for a range of fauna species we address this problem using a hierarchical landscape approach for native terrestrial reptiles and small mammals living in a fragmented semi urban landscape of brisbane australia generalised linear modelling and hierarchical partitioning analysis were applied to quantify the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration patch size and shape and local habitat composition and structure on the species richness of mammal and reptile assemblages landscape structure composition and configuration and local scale habitat structure variables were found to be most important for influencing reptile and mammal assemblages although the relative importance of specific variables differed between reptile and mammal assemblages these findings highlight the importance of considering landscape composition and configuration in addition to local habitat elements when planning and or managing for the conservation of native terrestrial fauna diversity in urban landscapes,Landscape Ecology,multi scaled habitat considerations for conserving urban biodiversity native reptiles and small mammals in brisbane australia
107,effects of urbanization on ground dwelling spiders araneae were studied using pitfall traps along an urban suburban rural forest gradient in debrecen hungary we found that overall spider species richness was significantly higher in the urban sites compared to the suburban and rural ones the increased diversity was due to the significantly more open habitat species in the assemblages at the urban sites this suggests that species from the surrounding matrix grasslands and arable lands penetrated the disturbed urban sites the ratio of forest species was significantly higher in the rural sites than in the suburban and urban ones suggesting that forest species are indeed sensitive to the disturbance caused by urbanization canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the species composition changed remarkably along the urbanization gradient open habitat spiders were associated with the urban sites of higher ground and air temperature forest spiders were characteristic of the rural sites with higher amount of decaying woods our findings suggest that the overall diversity was not the most appropriate indicator of disturbance species with different habitat affinity should be analyzed separately to get an ecologically relevant picture of the effect of urbanization,Landscape Ecology,effects of urbanization on ground dwelling spiders in forest patches in hungary

116,context natural regeneration with broadleaved species and reforestation with coniferous trees are two widely practiced forest regeneration strategies after timber harvesting they lead to different tree species composition and may cause different understory biodiversity but the effects on ground bryophyte composition and diversity are not well known aims we tested whether natural regeneration with broadleaved species and reforestation with spruce induced different diversities of the ground bryophyte populations  years after oldgrowth spruce forest clearcutting in the subalpine regions of southwestern china methods differences between natural stands and plantations were compared through the analysis of paired stands with plots shrub herb quadrats and a total of bryophyte quadrats results naturally regenerated forests were characterized by lower density and cover and lower tree height but higher herbaceous plant height shrub cover and bryophyte diversity they also harbored many more ground bryophytes the species richness of pleurocarpousmosses and fans mats and turfs were significantly higher in naturally regenerated forests frequency difference analysis demonstrated that more bryophyte species preferred ground habitats in naturally regenerated forests than in plantations vs species the canonical correspondence analysis indicated that stand structure attributes were more important determinants of ground bryophyte diversity and abundance conclusion natural regeneration and reforestation resulted in large differences in ground bryophyte populations a larger diversity was observed in the former case and natural regeneration practices can be an effective measure for the protection of ground bryophyte diversity after clearcutting,Annals of Forest Science,regeneration strategies influence ground bryophyte composition and diversity after forest clearcutting
117,currently the one of great threats to tropical biodiversity is the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture and this threat is particularly critical on hainan the largest tropical island in china and a global biodiversity hotspot rubber hevea brasiliensis has been planted on hainan since the s resulting in extensive replacement of native forest and the rate of this transformation has increased with latex prices since the s rubber plantations now cover ca ha on hainan and reach ca m in elevation to investigate the effect of this land use change we compared avian communities between a rubber plantation and a native secondary semi deciduous monsoon forest wefound that species richness was higher in the native forest than in rubber and that community composition differed greatly between the two habitats no strict frugivores were recorded in rubber and no granivores in semi deciduous monsoon forest in both richness and abundance more nectarivores and fewer insectivores occurred in rubber than in the native forest some common forest species as well as protected species were found only in native forest including hainan partridge arborophila ardens red junglefowl gallus gallus emerald dove chalcophaps indica black browed barbet megalaima oorti blue rumped pitta pitta soror puff throated bulbul alophoixus pallidus and chestnut bulbul hemixos castanonotus although ten babbler species were found in the native forest only two were in rubber among the species missing in rubber was the endemic hainan species grey laughingthrush garrulax maesi its endangerment through habitat conversion is of particular conservation concern,Agroforest Syst,species richness and guild composition in rubber plantations compared to secondary forest on hainan island china
118,the present study investigated recolonization patterns of selected soil and litter arthropods following replanting of pasture with rainforest species in the mary river catchment of eastern subtropical australia while extensive research has been conducted in rehabilitated mined sites in australian dry sclerophyll forests very little attention has been paid to rainforest restoration on previously pastoral land we examined the utility of soil and litter arthropod groups for monitoring the progress of restoration and the relationship between arthropod assemblage patterns and environmental factors potentially under the control of those doing the replanting leaf litter was extracted from sites five remnant rainforest five pasture and sites that had been revegetated from to years previously with a diversity of indigenous species ants identified to genus centipedes millipedes isopods amphipods and mites were enumerated and their assemblages described with multi and univariate methods ant genera alone proved unable to distinguish pasture from rainforest and mites identified only to oribatid or non oribatid proved of limited use because these two groups were present in all samples in extremely high numbers that overwhelmed the contributions of other arthropod groups however a coarse taxonomic approach using five arthropod groups ants centipedes millipedes isopods amphipods clearly discriminated between pasture and rainforest and also arranged the revegetated sites between these two extremes simple frequency scores based on the presence absence of these arthropod groups in each of three replicate subplots were sufficient to achieve this separation of site types habitats created by close planting of trees and mulching may accelerate invertebrate colonization and thus promote the rapid establishment of processes and functions characteristic of developing rainforests,Ecological Management & Restoration,using soil and litter arthropods to assess the state of rainforest restoration
119,several studies have shown that there is a strong decline in orang utan densities shortly after logging nevertheless there is little information on whether orang utan densities return to their pre logging values when logged forest is left to recover this study investigates the orang utan density in a year old selectively logged forest and compares it with the orang utan density in a nearby ecologically similar primary forest the results show that the orang utan density did not differ significantly between primary forest and the selectively logged forest since we found no difference in fruit availability between the selectively logged and primary forest we suggest that the selectively logged forest regenerated sufficiently well to sustain pre logging levels of orang utans this study confirms previous studies that suggest fruit availability is the best ecological predictor of orang utan densities and found a positive overall correlation between orang utan density and fruit availability the food attraction hypothesis which explains local fluctuations in orang utan density as a result of variation in fruit availability was not supported,Biological Conservation,a comparison of orang utan density in a logged and unlogged forest on sumatra

135,an important question for tropical forest restoration is whether degraded lands can be actively managed to attract birds we censused birds and measured vegetation structure at stations in young –‐yr old actively and passively restored pasture and old growth forest at las cruces biological station in southern costa rica during ‐min point counts we detected a high diversity— species— of birds using the restoration area surprisingly species richness and detection frequency did not differ among habitats and proportional similarity of bird assemblages to old growth forest did not differ between restoration treatments bird detection frequency was instead explained by exotic grass cover and understory stem density—vegetation structures that were not strongly impacted by active restoration the similarity of bird assemblages in actively and passively restored forest may be attributed to differential habitat preferences within and among feeding guilds low structural contrast between treatments or the effect of nucleation from actively restored plots into passively restored areas rapid recovery of vegetation in this recently restored site is likely due to its proximity to old growth forest and the lack of barriers to effective seed dispersal previous restoration studies in highly binary environments i e open pasture vs tree plantation have found strong differences in bird abundance and richness our data contradict this trend and suggest that tropical restoration ecologists should carefully consider when the benefits of active restoration outweigh the cost of implementation and which avian guilds should be used to measure restoration success given differential responses to habitat structure,Biotropica,avian habitat preference in tropical forest restoration in southern costa rica
136,aim to analyse how the dung beetles scarabaeinae respond to a modified variegated landscape taking into account the biogeographical peculiarities of the mexican transition zone location this study covers cloud forest cf of the sierra norte de puebla mountain range and part of the sierra madre oriental mountain range mexico methods we applied proportional sampling based on the landscape variegation model with scarabaeinae as the indicator group and using two approaches structural units vegetation type and spatial units windows we used two measures  richness and shannon diversity  and applied multiplicative diversity partitioning to obtain independent alpha and beta diversities for the landscape windows and vegetation types we grouped species by biogeographical distribution pattern for the biogeographical analysis and by whether they were originally from cf results the transformation of cf into secondary forest pastures and other types of vegetation increases the scarabaeinae diversity of the landscape in vegetation types and windows this increase is the result of species arriving from the tropical lowlands however the original dung beetle community of the cf dominates at different scales in the number of species abundance and biomass with increasing habitat modification beta diversity increases in the windows and species with the tropical palaeoamerican distribution pattern increase in abundance in vegetation types and windows main conclusions the variegated character of the landscape explains well the distribution and diversity of this dung beetle community the peculiar characteristics of the mexican transition zone have an effect owing to the overlap of fauna with different biogeographical origins the conversion of fragmented landscapes to variegated landscapes could be a conservation goal in human modified mountain landscapes sampling proportional to the area of different types of vegetation and the use of windows offer an alternative experimental design in variegated landscapes,Diversity and Distributions,how dung beetles respond to a human modified variegated landscape in mexican cloud forest a study of biodiversity integrating ecological and biogeographical perspectives
137,functional diversity an important element of avian biodiversity can be examined by quantifying foraging guild composition understanding the ecological processes that underpin functional diversity of birds in oil palm elaeis guineensis landscapes is important because different foraging guilds are likely to be influenced in different ways by land use practices we surveyed birds at sites within oil palm landscapes and at sites within logged peat swamp forest recording species belonging to foraging guilds oil palm landscapes supported a lower abundance of insectivorous granivorous and omnivorous birds than did logged peat swamp forest despite the latter being severely degraded due to intensive timber extraction however abundances of other groups of foraging birds such as raptors and wetland taxa were higher in oil palm landscapes than logged peat swamp forest frugivorous species were more abundant in smallholdings than plantation estates probably because of the presence of native trees foraging guild diversity was explained by stand level attributes such as stand age vegetation cover epiphyte persistence and canopy cover however each foraging guild exhibited unique responses to different oil palm management regimes and stand level attributes only arboreal omnivores and terrestrial frugivores were affected by the proximity of nearby natural forest this diversity of responses implies that the occurrence of particular avian foraging guilds may not be a suitable ecological indicator of best practice palm oil production our study also suggests that multiple conservation measures will be needed in oil palm landscapes irrespective of management regimes including the maintenance of ground layer vegetation cover the pruning of oil palm canopy to permit light penetration to the ground layer re vegetation of parts of oil palm landscapes with native trees and retention of natural and or secondary forest patches within the boundaries of plantations,Ibis,the influence of agricultural system stand structural complexity and landscape context on foraging birds in oil palm landscapes
138,aim anthropogenic land use change is a major driver of the current extinction crisis but the processes through which it acts on biodiversity are complex and still poorly understood here we use several biodiversity metrics to make a comprehensive assessment of the response of an endemic rich bird assemblage to land use change location sao tome´ island sao tome and prncipe africa methods we sampled bird assemblages in point counts stratified across three regions and four land use types species richness was examined using accumulation curves and generalized linear mixed effect models compositional and structural changes were analysed with ordination techniques we used correlations and model selection to identify species traits and environmental variables associated with such changes results at the point level there was a slight decrease of species richness in more intensive land uses however higher dissimilarities within these land uses led them to have higher overall species richness endemics dominated forest environments and although most preferred less disturbed land uses many persisted across all land uses non endemics were virtually absent from forests but became very abundant in the more intensive land uses canopy cover was the best predictor of the shift between endemic and non endemic species and allowed identifying regional differences in the local responses of bird assemblages to land use change main conclusions to better understand biodiversity it is crucial to use several metrics simultaneously in sao tome´ simply using species richness the single most used biodiversity metric could have been misleading as it concealed major shifts in the bird assemblage structure towards an endemism impoverished avifauna despite scarce data on land use cover we demonstrate how landscape context can be vital to understand biodiversity patterns and that highly forested surroundings might overestimate the strict value of more intensive land uses our results raise concerns about the long term persistence of endemic species restricted to islands where forested land uses are being lost,Diversity and Distributions,biodiversity and land use change understanding the complex responses of an endemic rich bird assemblage
139,agriculturally altered vegetation especially oil palm plantations is rapidly increasing in southeast asia low species diversity is associated with this commodity but data on anuran diversity in oilpalm plantations are lacking we investigated how anuran biological diversity differs between forest and oil palm plantation and whether observed differences in biological diversity of these areas is linked to specific environmental factors we hypothesized that biological diversity is lower in plantations and that plantations support a larger proportion of disturbance tolerant species than forest we compared species richness abundance and community composition between plantation and forest areas and between site types within plantation and forest forest stream vs plantation stream forest riparian vs plantation riparian forest terrestrial vs plantation terrestrial not all measures of biological diversity differed between oil palm plantations and secondary forest sites anuran community composition however differed greatly between forest and plantation and communities of anurans in plantations contained species that prosper in disturbed areas although plantations supported large numbers of breeding anurans we concluded the community consisted of common species that were of little conservation concern commonly found species include fejervarya limnocharis microhyla heymonsi and hylarana erythrea we believe that with a number of management interventions oil palm plantations can provide habitat for species that dwell in secondary forests,Conservation Biology,effects of oil palm plantations on diversity of tropical anurans
140,the tropical dry forest region along the western slope of central america represents a biodiverse and fragile area that is under increasing pressure from agricultural production thus threatening the provision of ecosystem services the integrity of these landscapes and the rural communities who depend on them to address this issue we evaluated the influence of common agricultural management practices cropping and livestock systems vs the quesungual slash and mulch agroforestry system qsmas on diverse parameters of soil quality and function we then used this information to identify soil invertebrate bioindicators that represent key aspects of soil quality chemical fertility physical properties aggregate morphology and biological functioning in february of soil sampling was conducted on six hillside farms near the town of somotillo in western nicaragua to assess soil properties and the abundance and diversity of soil macrofauna within four management systems qsmas based on maize production traditional maize cropping system with few trees tc silvopastoral system with low tree density sp and secondary forest sf used as a reference the conversion of forest to agriculture demonstrated the greatest impact of management in this study for example sf presented significantly higher diversity of soil invertebrate taxonomic groups than either tc or sp p and demonstrated the lowest level of soil compaction significantly less than sp p additionally sf demonstrated the highest value of soil quality according to a synthetic indicator that integrates chemical physical and biological aspects of soil quality although overall soil quality under qsmas was lower than sf this system demonstrated the highest abundance number of individuals of soil macrofauna and appeared to at least partially mitigate the negative consequences of forest conversion on soil functioning using the indicator value index which ranks species according to their specificity and fidelity across sites along with farmer consultation we found seven indicator taxa of soil quality that could greatly facilitate future evaluation of land management impacts by farmers and technicians in the region we suggest that the methodology applied is robust and adaptable to diverse agroecological contexts and would allow for more rapid responses to evolving land use issues as they arise,Ecological Indicators,soil macrofauna as indicators of soil quality and land use impacts in smallholder agroecosystems of western nicaragua
141,depending on the mosaic of habitats that is created forest fragmentation can reduce the abundance and diversity of forest birds temperate deciduous forests in south america are rapidly being replaced by pine plantations causing changes in habitats for both breeding and migrant birds we examined differences in avian species richness and abundance in three areas a reserve with continuous tracts of native forest forest fragments and pine plantations four species were negatively affected by fragmentation with their abundance declining from continuous forest to pine plantations fourteen species were not affected by fragmentation and eight had significantly increased abundance in pine plantations compared to continuous forest overall abundance in pooled and ground understorey birds was higher in forest fragments and pine plantations compared to continuous forest the abundance of granivorous species was higher in the pine plantations than in the forest reserve but the abundance of insectivorous species was higher in the forest reserve and in forest fragments than in pine plantations thus forest fragmentation affects birds differentially according to their feeding ecology,Oryx,avian responses to fragmentation of the maulino forest in central chile

160,forest fragmentation is a common disturbance affecting biological diversity yet the impacts of fragmentation on many forest processes remain poorly understood forest restoration is likely to be more successful when it proceeds with an understanding of how native and exotic vertebrates utilize forest patches of different size we used a system of forest fragments isolated by volcanic activity years ago in hawaii to examine how long term fragmentation as well as fragment size and structural features affect the richness of native and exotic bird species the total number of bird species increased rapidly with forest fragment size with most of the native species pool found in patches ha smaller fragments were dominated by native bird species with several exotic bird species found only in the largest fragments suggesting that exotic bird species in this landscape show greater area sensitivity than native species we used airborne scanning light detection and ranging lidar to assess whether fragment area was correlated with estimates of fragment vegetation volume as well as measures of tree height fragment area was highly correlated with vegetation volume maximum tree height and canopy height heterogeneity and these variables were strong predictors of bird richness demonstrating that remote sensing can provide key insights into the relationship between fragment structural attributes and biodiversity indicators overall this work demonstrates the value of conserving small remnant mid elevation forest patches for native birds in hawaii this work also provides insight into how newly created forest patches might be used by native and exotic bird species in hawaii,Biological Conservation,long term effects of fragmentation and fragment properties on bird species richness in hawaiian forests
161,short and long term changes in species composition plant biomass production and litter decomposition after cessation of grazing were examined in a mediterranean grassland with high dominance of annual species and strong seasonality in biomass production short term changes were assessed during three consecutive years in plots previously exposed to different grazing pressures and compared to plots in long term  years exclosures short term cessation of grazing led in the short term to an increase in relative biomass of annual crucifers and tall annual and perennial grasses while biomass of annual legumes annual thistles and short annual grasses decreased consequently similarity increased between vegetation recently excluded from grazing and vegetation in long term protected plots our research showed that in systems with high dominance of grasses and annual species the rapid changes in plant species composition that occur after grazing cessation were associated with a fast recovery of the potential for biomass production to levels found in long term protected plots while litter decompositionrate did not change even after long term cessation of grazing moreover previous history of grazing did not affect plant litter decomposition despite higher litter quality in grazed treatments this study provides new insights about the processes involved in the diverse responses of ecosystem functions resulting from shifts in species composition associated with grazing cessation and land use change in mediterranean grasslands,Plant Soil,recovery of plant species composition and ecosystem function after cessation of grazing in a mediterranean grassland
162,there are concerns over the increasing encroachment of humans domestic livestock and farming onto maputo special reserve because of the potential for habitat modification therefore differences between an undisturbed area of the reserve and a neighbouring farming area are assessed using dung beetle as indicators in each of the two areas pig dung baited pitfall traps were used to sample dung beetle assemblages in two contrasting habitats grassland and forest distributional analysis of the species and individuals that were captured showed that species richness species turnover relative abundance patterns and biogeographical composition differed strongly between both habitats and areas under different land usage however in analyses that apportion variation the greatest amounts were related to habitat rather than land usage even so in both habitats the total and mean number of species per trap was higher in the farmed area than in the reserve although this was a significant trend only in grassland furthermore in grassland widespread species were better represented in the farmed area than in the reserve whereas in forest widespread species were poorly represented compared to grassland also in forest maputaland endemics were better represented in the reserve than in the farmed area further work is necessary to separate the different geographical ecological and land usage factors responsible for the patterns detected in this preliminary study even so there are clearly differences between the maputo special reserve and the farmed area,Journal of Insect Conservation,how might intensification of farming influence dung beetle diversity coleoptera scarabaeidae in maputo special reserve mozambique
163,to test flying fox adaptations to a habitat mosaic with extreme deforestation the abundance habitat choice and feeding behavior of the pacific flying fox pteropus tonganus were investigated across islands of the yasawa archipelago fiji the habitat mosaic is formed by percent tropical dry forest and percent farmland leaving exotic grasslands and stands of leucaena leucocephala to overrun the vast majority of land pteropus tonganus abundance was high bats despite deforestation and hunting roosting sites were restricted to native forest fragments grasslands and stands of l leucocephala were completely void of bats at all times the mean foraging density in farmland was four times higher than in forests and foraging competition was routinely observed in farmland but was extremely rare in forests the author suggests that during the study extensive foraging in farmland was supporting the high p tonganus population additionally the preferential foraging in farmland was responsible for the low foraging densities within forests and dramatically less intraspecies competition for forest resources further research is needed on seed dispersal within forests and to test for seasonal variations in bat abundance and feeding,Biotropica,flying foxes prefer to forage in farmland in a tropical dry forest landscape mosaic in fiji
164,it is estimated that of the argentine northwest piedmont forest has been transformed and the remaining patches are subject to intensive logging the aim of this study was to determine the effect of logging on the understory bird community of piedmont forest in northwestern argentina comparing an area without logging c and an area with logging lo in each area we established circular plots of ha where we measured different vegetation variables and we placed mist nets to capture understory birds basal area of trees with a diameter at breast height cm was significantly lower p in lo producing changes in the vegetation structure towards a more open environment in c we captured of the individuals and species and in lo we captured of the individuals and species of birds the similarity between bird species of the two areas was low s in c we captured only one bird species typical of secondary forests or edges however of the birds captured in lo were typical of secondary forests or edges we found a greater percentage of birds typical of the canopy in lo than in c this is probably because in c bird species remain in the canopy since canopy openness was significantly lower in c p forest management produces changes in the vegetation structure and might cause that bird species associated with the canopy to use the understory since there is a lack of the tree stratum continuity and the entry of bird species of secondary or edge environments,The Neotropical Ornithological Society,unexpected changes in the bird assemblage in areas under selective logging in piedmont forest in northwestern argentina
165,forest ecosystems have been subjected to continuous dynamics between deforestation and forestation assessing the effects of these processes on biodiversity could be essential for conservation planning we analyzed patterns of species richness diversity and evenness of plants and birds in patches of natural forest of quercus spp and in stands of native pinus pinaster and exotic eucalyptus globulus in nw portugal we analyzed data of forest and non forest species separately at the intra patch patch and inter patch scales forest plant richness diversity and evenness were higher in oak forest than in pine and eucalypt plantations in total species of forest plants were observed in oak forest in pine plantation and in eucalypt plantation some forest species such as euphorbia dulcis omphalodes nitida and eryngium juresianum were exclusively or mostly observed in oak forest forest bird richness and diversity were higher in both oak and pine forests than in eucalypt forest evenness did not differ among forests in total species of forest birds were observed in oak forest in pine forest and in eucalypt forest species such as certhia brachydactyla sitta europaea and dendrocopos major were common in oak and or pine patches but were absent from eucalypt stands species area relationships of forest plants and forest birds in oak patches had consistently a higher slope at both the intra and inter patch scales than species area relationships of forest species in plantations and non forest species in oak forest these ndings demonstrate the importance of oak forest for the conservation of forest species diversity pointing the need to conserve large areas of oak forest due to the apparent vulnerability of forest species to area loss additionally diversity patterns in pine forest were intermediate between oak forest and eucalypt forest suggesting that forest species patterns may be affected by forest naturalness,Acta Oecologica,plant and bird diversity in natural forests and in native and exotic plantations in nw portugal

170,there is widespread concern for many understorey and ground dwelling bird species in the philippines that appear intolerant of forest alteration we present density estimates for key bird species in old growth forest advanced and early secondary growth and active cultivation within the puerto princesa subterranean river national park in palawan six species were not recorded in cultivation and the abundance of these and several others increased along the successional gradient from cultivation to old growth forest eleven species including five endemics and three of four threatened species had highest density estimates in old growth forest however several species had high density estimates in the heavily disturbed habitats and every habitat type held highest densities of at least one of the bird species the commonest habitat association across the bird community was a preference for areas containing large trees indicating the importance of retention of such trees in allowing suitable ground and understorey microhabitats to persist old growth forests have the highest conservation value for palawans endemic birds and while some species thrive in the anthropogenic habitats that occur within the park the present extent of cultivation and associated successional stages within its boundaries should not be increased we caution against extrapolation of the abundance figures from the park to the whole island but we suggest that population sizes for the threatened species are likely to be much greater than previously thought we urge authorities to strengthen management within the protected area network in palawan to ensure survival of key species,Oryx,population densities of understorey birds across a habitat gradient in palawan philippines implications for conservation
171,knowledge on the effects of land use on community composition and species abundance is crucial for designing realistic conservation strategies particularly in highly dynamic systems such as mediterranean agricultural mosaics that are subjected to intensive cultivation we investigated these effects on the nocturnal bird species occurring in the study area stone curlew burhinus oedicnemus red necked nightjar caprimulgus ruficollis barn owl tyto alba eurasian scops owl otus scops little owl athene noctua tawny owl strix aluco long eared owl asio otus short eared owl asio flammeus and eagle owl bubo bubo across an agricultural natural habitat mosaic in central spain for three consecutive years shares of vineyards scrubland herbaceous cropland water bodies and roads significantly affected the composition of the nocturnal bird community herbaceous cropland and olive groves which covered of the study area proved to be neutral for all species remnant patches of natural and semi natural scrubland around of the study area and water bodies only of the study area showed a positive effect on eagle owls eurasian scops owls long eared owls and red necked nightjars vineyard of the study area had a negative influence on eagle owls long eared owls and eurasian scops owls our results indicate first that the relative extent of land use types was apparently not related with the presence of nocturnal bird species and second that natural scrublands and water bodies are key habitats for assuring the persistence of nocturnal birds in agricultural mediterranean landscapes current land planning focused toward land use intensification will likely increase the areas of habitats that are neutral or have adverse effects on nocturnal birds,Acta Ornithologica,effects of land use on nocturnal birds in a mediterranean agricultural landscape
172,plantation forestry contributes to the economic growth of many regions but may also produce ecological impacts e g on biodiversity that can be reduced with proper management we assessed the value of eucalypt plantations to favor habitat connectivity at the landscape scale by determining their ability to provide habitat for species associated with the natural vegetation for this purpose we compared diversity and composition of understory vegetation in low management eucalypt plantations in young intermediate ready for harvest and mature stages with pine plantations native forests and shrublands we estimated the true species richness with chao estimators and compared among habitats the average species richness at two different local scales per plot and per site shannon indices and biovolume of herbs shrubs and trees in the understory using anovas or glzs depending on data distributions differences among habitats in understory species composition and functional types were compared with permanova and were graphically represented using nmds ordinations at local scales diversity tended to be higher in native communities native forests and shrublands and lower in plantations lowest in intermediate eucalypt plantations diversity across all study sites was again lowest in eucalypt plantations in intermediate age but was relatively high in other plantations due to a high species turnover in young and mature eucalypt plantations eucalypt plantations were similar to shrublands in understory species composition and functional types when young becoming more distant to them when older and more similar to pine plantations and native forests native forests were the most distinctive community with pine plantations being the most similar to them native forests harbored the rarest species and were also associated with seed dispersal by vertebrates internally ant and wind dispersal were the most common in shrublands and eucalypt plantations given the prevalence of eucalypt plantations in some regions determining and improving if feasible their ability to harbor biodiversity of native communities becomes a crucial goal in order to increase landscape connectivity and favor species persistence at regional scales in the study region eucalypt plantations provide habitat for species typical of shrublands when young but do not contribute significantly to the maintenance of the understory biodiversity associated with native forests considering the distinctiveness of native forests we favor protection and where feasible restoration of native forests over managing eucalypt plantations for biodiversity to best improve conservation outcomes,Forest Ecology & Management,do eucalypt plantations provide habitat for native forest biodiversity
173,conservation management can no longer rely on protecting pristine habitats but must consider the wider landscape this is especially true on oceanic islands where endemic species are believed to be particularly susceptible to the extinction risks that accompany land conversion despite this there is a paucity of studies examining how endemic communities on oceanic islands may be distributed across such human modified habitats taking príncipe island in west africa as a case study we investigate how avian communities vary across the habitats primary forest secondary forest agricultural areas of this globally important centre of endemism here recent policy reforms aimed at poverty alleviation and increased food production are rapidly altering the current land use mosaic across all habitats bird species were encountered survey points in secondary forest and agricultural areas were on average more diverse and held higher overall abundances of birds than those within primary forest this was true for both the entire avian assemblage and the endemic species alone nevertheless two iucn listed species were restricted to primary forest and many other endemics occurred at higher densities within this habitat we demonstrate that agricultural areas and novel habitats such as secondary forest can hold high abundances of endemic species and thus have the potential to act as a resource for biodiversity conservation a double stranded approach to conservation is therefore required that both protects the integrity of the primary forest and controls the rapid changes in agricultural land use to ensure that it continues to support a large component of the endemic avifauna,Journal for Nature Conservation,the importance of novel and agricultural habitats for the avifauna of an oceanic island

176,in tropical and subtropical forests there is limited information about how to integrate sustainable timber management with the conservation of biodiversity we examined the effect of selective logging on the bird community to help develop management guidelines to assure the conservation of biodiversity in forests managed for timber production the study design consisted of control and harvested plots in piedmont and cloud forests of the subtropical montane forests of the andes in northwestern argentina we conducted bird point count surveys combined with distance estimation breeding season bird community composition was more similar between control and logged forest in both the cloud forest and piedmont than between the two elevations probably because neotropical bird communities change dramatically along elevational gradients within each elevation zone community composition changed significantly between harvested and control forests both between and within each elevation zone no significant differences in bird density were detected similarly when we analyzed bird density according to diet guilds no general pattern could be extracted however we found a significantly greater density of cavity nesters and lower of non cavity nesters in control plots probably because most trees that can develop suitable cavities were extracted in logged plots and these plots had a greater structural diversity enabling more nesting resources grouping species according to their nesting habitat requirements has rarely been used in the neotropics and other tropical and subtropical forests but focusing management attention on cavity nesters might address the most sensitive portion of the avian community as well as other species dependent on trees likely to hold cavities,Biodiversity and Conservation,assessing the effects of selective logging on birds in neotropical piedmont and cloud montane forests
177,the amazon region represents more than a half of all tropical forests in the world and has been threatened by many anthropogenic activities including several kinds of timber harvesting the reduced impact logging ril is considered a less destructive method of timber harvesting but there is a general lack of information about the effects on amazonian invertebrates including butterflies we investigated the effect of ril on fruit feeding butterflies by comparing canopy and understory between an area under ril and a control area without ril the canopy fauna is different and significantly richer than the understory fauna showing that sampling only the lower strata underestimates the diversity of fruit feeding butterflies the effects of ril were mainly detected in the understory butterfly assemblage as significant differences were observed in species composition within this stratum effects of the ril regime which include tree cutting skid trails and roads openings are stronger in the understory than in the canopy explaining the reported differences despite the detectable effects of ril on the composition of fruit feeding butterfly assemblages the overall diversity was not affected a similar pattern has been detected in many other groups indicating that a noticeable part of the diversity of many taxa could be preserved in areas under ril management therefore in view of the problems of creating protected areas in the amazon ril is a good alternative to preserve fruit feeding butterflies and surely many other taxa and it might be a desirable economic alternative for the region,Journal of Insect Conservation,the effect of reduced impact logging on fruit feeding butterflies in central amazon brazil

180,understanding the role of land use patterns in determining the distribution of nocturnal birds has important implications for the conservation of these species and for land management one important step for effective conservation is to develop statistical models to assess how the probability of birds presence can be influenced by land use types in order to support decision making in conservation planning at the landscape or regional scale the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of extent and configuration of land use types in determining the distribution of some nocturnal birds of prey strigiformes and the european nightjar caprimulgus europaeus in agricultural landscapes we surveyed six nocturnal birds eurasian scops owl otus scops little owl athene noctua barn owl tyto alba long eared owl asio otus tawny owl strix aluco and european nightjar in listening stations located in nine protected areas of southern tuscany central italy nocturnal birds were present in of the stations where variables relative to the extent and configuration of land use types were measured the probability of tawny owl presence increased with increasing forest cover the probability of little owl presence increased with increasing amount of arable land whilst the probability of eurasian scops owl and long eared owl presence increased with increasing amount of open areas the model of european nightjar showed that the probability of presence increased with increasing amount of forest edge and scrubs our results suggest that heterogeneous agricultural landscapes may favour the coexistence of several nocturnal birds since the different species are each associated with different land use types,Rendiconti Lincei,distribution of nocturnal birds strigiformes and caprimulgidae in relation to land use types extent and configuration in agricultural landscapes of central italy
181,although there is an extensive literature demonstrating the impact of human activities on both species extinction risk and local ecological processes the methodological tools that allow for the visualization and quantification of the intensity of the observed and forthcoming impacts are lacking here we propose a footprint index for french guiana northern atlantic coast of south america which sums up the expected and proven disturbances on biodiversity the index was developed by superimposing geographical and human data including human population densities land use settlements and camps mining and forest activities tracks roads and rivers the relevance of the index as a general measure of anthropic impact on large terrestrial fauna was estimated by investigating the structure of the large terrestrial vertebrate assemblages including primates large frugivorous birds rodents and ungulates in relation to the extent of disturbances the abundance of large terrestrial fauna was assessed using the line transect sampling method in forest sites facing different disturbance levels including hunting logging and fragmentation and consequently different footprint scores a self organizing map was used to combine species abundances and disturbance scores it allowed us to rank species in accordance to their sensitivity towards disturbances identifying the response of fauna to different concomitant threats the index provided correct identification of sites with similar threats which proves it is a relevant estimator of human disturbance in addition the richness of animal communities and abundances of several seed dispersers and predators were negatively correlated to the index e g large monkeys and frugivorous birds r p and r p respectively indicating its reliability in identifying areas where animal communities are disturbed the index could therefore constitute a useful tool to identify areas where ecological processes supported by those species are expected to be disrupted and where they are already disrupted furthermore the footprint index can deal with lack of field data or with only partially valid information and so may directly help land managers forecast and hopefully mitigate forthcoming impacts resulting from the development of human activities,Biodiversity and Conservation,rapid evaluation of threats to biodiversity human footprint score and large vertebrate species responses in french guiana
182,making generalizations about the impact of commercial selective logging on biodiversity has so far remained elusive species responses to logging depend on a number of factors many of which have not been studied in detail these factors may include the natural forest conditions forest types under which logging impacts are investigated but this question has so far remained unexamined in a largescale replicate study we aimed at clarifying the relationship between logging and forest types on leaf litter frogs we contrast three distinct and naturally occurring forest types including wet evergreen moist evergreen and semi deciduous forests selectively logged sites were compared with primary forest sites for each forest type we found that the response of frog communities to logging varies in different forest types in the wet evergreen forest richness was higher in logged forest than primary forest while diversity measures were not different between logged and primary forest habitats in the moist evergreen richness and diversity were higher in selectively logged areas compared with primary forest habitats in the semi deciduous logged forests were characterized by drastic loss of forest specialists reduced richness and diversity these results indicate that the net effect of logging varies with respect to forest type forest types that are characterized by adverse climatic conditions i e low rainfall and protracted dry seasons are more likely to produce negative effects on leaf litter anuran communities for comparisons of the impact of logging on species to be effective future research must endeavor to include details of forest type,Biotropica,differences in the effects of selective logging on amphibian assemblages in three west african forest types

184,little is known about the termite fauna of the different vegetation physiognomies in the cerrado biome it is suggested that the species compositions in grassland and savanna areas are closely related to each other and quite distinct from those of forests this study compared the species composition from five different physiognomies of cerrado and tested the hypothesis that the termite faunas of savannas and grasslands form a distinct group from that of forests the study was conducted in the parque estadual da serra de jaraguá state of goiás brazil termites were sampled from two physiognomies of savanna one natural grassland one pasture and one gallery forest a transect with parcels of x m was established in each physiognomy the relative abundance was inferred by the number of encounters termites were classified in feeding guilds and the dissimilarity in the species composition between the physiognomies was calculated a total of encounters of species of two families were recorded the most abundant feeding guilds were the humivores and xylophages the physiognomies with the largest number of species were rupestrian cerrado species and cerrado sensu stricto the physiognomies had a similar species composition less than dissimilarity mainly the natural open areas the hypothesis of a distinct fauna of termites in forest vegetation was refuted the termite fauna of gallery forest is very different from that of pasture but most species also occur in natural open areas the impact of pasture on the diversity and composition of termites seems to be significant but the impact is even greater on the proportion of the feeding guilds reducing the proportion of xylophages and intermediates,Sociobiology,species composition of termites isoptera in different cerrado vegetation physiognomies
185,dung beetles coleoptera scarabaeoidea in three landscapes in mato grosso do sul brazil dung beetles are important for biological control of intestinal worms and dipterans of economic importance to cattle because they feed and breed in dung killing parasites inside it they are also very useful as bioindicators of species diversity in agricultural or natural environments the aims of this paper were to study the species richness and abundance of dung beetles helping to answer the question are there differences in the patterns of dung beetle diversity in three environments pasture agriculture and forest in the municipality of dourados in the state of mato grosso do sul a total of samplings were carried out weekly from november to november using three pitfall traps in each environment the traps were baited with fresh bovine dung and adult dung beetles from species were captured two from hyborosidae and from scarabaeidae five species were constant very abundant and dominant on the pasture two in the agricultural environment and two in the environment of semideciduous forest most of the species were characterised as accessories common and not dominant the species with higher abundance was ataenius platensis blanchard the indexes of shannon wiener diversity were in the pasture in the agricultural environment and in the area of native forest the medium positive presence of dung beetles in the traps in each environment were and individuals per trap in the pasture agricultural environment and in the native forest respectively the pasture environment presented a higher diversity index the species diversity of dung beetles was superior where there was higher abundance and regularity of resource bovine dung,Brazilian Journal of Biology,dung beetles coleoptera scarabaeoidea in three landscapes in mato grosso do sul brazil
186,we assessed effects of selective logging of rain forest upon a diverse assemblage of folivorous leaf eating marsupials in tropical queensland australia spotlighting censuses of mammal populations were conducted for i yr periods before logging and yr after logging on a ha sire in which an average of trees ha m ha were extracted two formerly logged reference sites were censused concurrently to assess effects of sampling variation and between year population fluctuations on census results lemuroid ringtail possums hemibelideus lemuroides declined markedly in logged forest while three other possums pseudocheirops archeri trichosuras vulpecula pseudocheirus herbertensis and a tree kangaroo dendrolagus lumholtzi did not differ significantly between pre and pen logging censuses folivores char are highly dependent upon primary forest clearly are most vulnerable to logging the magnitude and duration of logging impacts on arboreal mammal populations is probably strongly affected by the level of forest structural damage incurred during logging operations we suggest that ecological and behavioral traits such as the degree of arboreality diet denning requirements and territorial behavior influenced the responses of these marsupials to logging,Biotropica,responses of five arboreal marsupials to recent selective logging in tropical australia
187,grasshoppers are a dominant group of herbivorous insects throughout the world and their high diversity functional importance sensitivity to disturbance and ease of sampling makes them potentially useful bioindicators for land management in australia however the dynamics of grasshopper assemblages are extremely poorly understood here we describe the responses of grasshopper acridoidea eumastacoidea and tettigonioidea assemblages in the kakadu region of the northern territory australia to disturbance associated with mining three questions were addressed in this study i do local grasshopper assemblages show consistent responses to disturbance ii can particular species or functional groups be identified that are reliable indicators of ecological disturbance and iii to what extent do the responses of grasshopper assemblages merely reflect those of vegetation grasshoppers were sampled at sites located in and around the ranger uranium mine representing three habitat types with respect to degree of disturbance i natural sites representing a range of undisturbed savanna habitats ii disturbed sites representing a range of disturbances but with soil intact and iii waste rock six sites undergoing rehabilitation on a constructed landform a total of grasshopper species in genera was recorded during the study with site species richness ranging from five to there were no significant differences between habitat types in site species diversity but multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong correspondence between grasshopper species composition and degree of habitat disturbance using indicator species analysis six species and one functional group were identified as significant indicators of habitat type in relation to disturbance grasshopper responses were correlated with that of vegetation but grasshopper assemblages showed apparently meaningful differentiation among disturbed sites that was not evident on the basis of floristic data our results demonstrate that grasshopper assemblages respond to disturbances associated with human land use and that these responses do not simply reflect those of plants grasshoppers are therefore potentially useful bioindicators of ecological disturbance in australia but further work is required on the extent to which their responses reflect general ecological change,Austral Ecology,grasshopper biodiversity and bioindicators in australian tropical savannas responses to disturbance in kakadu national park
188,secondary forests and exotic tree plantations are rapidly expanding across tropical landscapes yet we currently have a very poor understanding of the value of these human dominated forest landscapes for biodiversity conservation mist netting point counts and transect walks were used to compare the bird communities of these habitats and neighboring primary forest in north east brazilian amazonia the extensive spatial scale of plantations and second growth in our study area enabled us to implement a robust replicated design with survey plots approximately two to three orders of magnitude larger than most previous studies of land use change in the tropics thus minimising the influence of the surrounding landscape species richness was highest in primary forest and lowest in eucalyptus plantations and community turnover between habitats was very high whether based upon matrices of relative abundance or species presenceabsence data and for both point count and mist net data monthly line transect censuses conducted over an annual cycle showed an increase in the detection of canopy frugivores and seed predators during the peak of flower and fruit availability in primary forest but failed to suggest that secondgrowth or eucalyptus stands provide suitable foraging habitat at any time of the year the conservation value of both secondary forest and plantations was low compared to conclusions from previous studies our results indicate that while large scale reforestation of degraded land can increase regional levels of diversity it is unlikely to conserve most primary forest species such as understorey insectivores and canopy frugivores,Biological Conservation,the value of primary secondary and plantation forests for amazonian birds
189,the conversion and loss of primary rainforest in southeast asia is presumed to affect many animal assemblages in terms of their diversity and species composition we studied the responses of non volant small mammals to forest loss and degradation caused by logging and the establishment of large scale oil palm plantations located in the north eastern part of borneo in southeast asia we found that habitat types forest versus plantation were important determinant of species occurrences and assemblage compositions however within forest habitats irrespective of whether logged or unlogged similarities in assemblage compositions of sites close to each other underline the importance of geographic distance in shaping small mammal assemblages in terms of conservation management it is imperative to incorporate the size and overall surrounding environment of a forest into forest management concepts and although not equivalent to areas of primary forest old regenerating secondary forest needs to be considered as an important component for the preservation of small mammal species diversity in contrast oil palm plantations are clearly of little or no importance for the conservation of the non volant small mammal fauna and this habitat may also act as an effective barrier to the dispersal of the small mammals,Mammal Society of Japan,a case study on the effects of disturbance and conversion of tropical lowland rain forest on the non volant small mammals in north borneo management implications
190,the invasion of exotic pasture species into intact woodlands has the potential to affect native fauna by altering habitat structure and ecosystem function the spread of these weeds is generally in concert with cattle grazing so that fauna or habitat change is due to multiple interrelated causes in this study we investigated whether the spread of the introduced pasture grass bothriochloa pertusa and replacement of the native bluegrass b ewartiana in eucalypt woodlands of northern queensland has had an effect on terrestrial vertebrate fauna we located sites that sampled a range of native and introduced pastures cover and investigated the spatial pattern of abundance with canonical analysis of principle coordinates and correlation of the habitat attributes on the ordination space we then selected a subset of four habitat attributes eliminating highly colinear variables and modelled species response to each using an information theoretic approach thirty one species birds one mammal and four reptiles and two summary variables bird abundance and richness had best subset akaike information criteria models with reliable parameters estimates seventeen models contained the b pertusa frequency term and a further had a term relating to upper storey cover tree cover or m though pasture grass cover grazing and habitat features were correlated and thus we cannot ascribe b pertusa as the sole determinant of fauna species change this study has demonstrated that tropical savanna woodlands with changing bothriochloa dominance from native to introduced species have different fauna species composition in particular bird species richness ground nesting species e g rufous songlark cincloramphus mathewsi golden headed cisticola cisticola exilis and terrestrial reptiles e g carlia munda and ctenotus taeniolatus declined disturbance tolerant species such as australian magpie cracticus tibicen and yellow throated miners manorina flavigula increased in abundance in exotic pasture dominated sites as pastoral intensification continues in northern australian rangelands there is a potential for significant change in the relative abundance and composition of vertebrate fauna and the reduction or loss of some species in the landscape,The Rangeland Journal,increased grazing and dominance of an exotic pasture bothriochloa pertusa affects vertebrate fauna species composition abundance and habitat in savanna woodland
191,grazed quadrats were monitored on mileura station western australia from to in order to study the population dynamics of the perennial plants in two of the land systems on the property counts of plants on four quadrats at each of sites were made in and and individual plants were traced for the first three samplings five sites were on the sherwood land system and five on the belele land system the results indicated that the populations of some species in the mulga shrubland increased steadily over the years of the study whereas the populations of other species especially the small short lived shrubs fluctuated over this period a reduction in stocking rate from to was associated with an increase in the population of perennial plants the total numbers for the count were compared with in mean summer rainfall increased between and and this increase may have been associated with the recruitment overall the study showed that commercial stocking although at a lower rate than that recommended by the western australian department of agriculture was compatible with increases in the populations of the perennial components of mulga shrubland in this region,The Rangeland Journal,the population dynamics of some arid zone plants during years of grazing on mileura station western australia
192,increasing global food demand requires the exploration of agricultural production systems that minimise the conflict between food production and biodiversity conservation cattle ranching is a main land use in tropical and sub tropical south american semi arid ecosystems such as the chaco eco region of subtropical argentina one of the most active frontiers of land use change despite open habits being a key component of the chaco landscape conservation studies and policies have focussed on forests in this study bird and mammal communities of three different open canopy livestock producing systems in the semi arid argentinian chaco natural grasslands sown non native pastures and silvopastoral systems are discussed diversity inverse simpson index and species composition multivariate ordinations were measured and species identified that characterise each system indicator species the three livestock systems did not significantly differ in terms of diversity but showed differences in the composition of bird communities natural grasslands had the highest number of bird and mammal indicator species including myrmecophaga tridactyla a high conservation value species these results highlight natural grasslands as a landscape unit with a high conservation value and indicate that they should be explicitly targeted by conservation and land use policies particularly because they represent a small and rapidly decreasing proportion of the semi arid argentinian chaco,The Rangeland Journal,comparison of animal biodiversity in three livestock systems of open environments of the semi arid chaco of argentina

194,elephant are believed to be one of the main ecological drivers in the conversion of savanna woodlands to grassland we assessed the impacts of elephant on large trees ≥ m in height in the southern section of the kruger national park tree dimensions and utilization by elephantwere recorded for individual trees across transects average length of km and m wide sixty per cent of the trees exhibited elephant utilization and were dead as a direct result of elephant foraging behaviour each height class of tree was utilized in proportion to abundance however the size of the tree and the species influenced the intensity of utilization and foraging approach sclerocarya birrea was actively selected for and experienced the highest proportional utilization of all trees interestingly the proportion of large trees that were utilized and pushed over increased with distance from permanent water a result which has implications for the provision of water in the knp we conclude that mortality is likely to be driven by a combination of factors including fire drought and disease rather than the actions of elephant alone further investigation is also required regarding the role of senescence and episodic mortality,Journal of Tropical Ecology,the utilization of large savanna trees by elephant in southern kruger national park
195,the role of state forests in the conservation of the savannah environment of western burkina faso west africa was assessed by considering the customary and fundamental biological components of plant diversity the focus is on the ordinary biodiversity which constitutes the current environment of human populations and which generates their resources overall floristic composition a b c diversities and species accumulation curves of landscape units were compared inside and outside protected areas common species were identified according to their frequencies in landscape units and their local abundance the occurrences of functional life form dispersion etc and human valued current uses potential threats etc traits were compared current land uses outside protected areas have an unequal effect on the various components of plant diversity species richnesses and specific structures were all the more altered for woody species as agricultural pressure is high conversely they were maintained for herbaceous communities for which the proportion of wide ranging species increased the preservation of useful plant species on cultivated lands was obvious for woody species with edible fruits but less tangible for timber and service wood it was deficient for species that furnish other non wood products e g leaves used as food or fodder the conservation of which may be jeopardized where anthropic pressure is high given current land uses and dynamics maintaining conservation areas in land use planning is crucial in order to preserve ordinary biodiversity,Biodiversity and Conservation,ordinary biodiversity in western burkina faso west africa what vegetation do the state forests conserve
196,fire is an important agent of disturbance in tropical savannas but relatively few studies have analyzed how soil and litter dwelling arthropods respond to fire disturbance despite the critical role these organisms play in nutrient cycling and other biogeochemical processes following the incursion of a fire into a woodland savanna ecological reserve in central brazil we monitored the dynamics of litter arthropod populations for nearly two years in one burned and one unburned area of the reserve we also performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine the effects of fire and litter type on the dynamics of litter colonization by arthropods overall arthropod abundance the abundance of individual taxa the richness of taxonomic groups and the species richness of individual taxa formiciade were lower in the burned site however both the ordinal level composition of the litter arthropod fauna and the species level composition of the litter ant fauna were not dramatically different in the burned and unburned sites there is evidence that seasonality of rainfall interacts with fire as differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were more pronounced in the dry than in the wet season for many taxa the differences in abundance between burned and unburned sites were maintained even when controlling for litter availability and quality in contrast differences in abundance for collembola formicidae and thysanoptera were only detected in the unmanipulated samples which had a lower amount of litter in the burned than in the unburned site throughout most of our study period together these results suggest that arthropod density declines in fire disturbed areas as a result of direct mortality diminished resources i e reduced litter cover and less favorable microclimate i e increased litter desiccation due to reduction in tree cover although these effects were transitory there is evidence that the increasingly prevalent fire return interval of only – years may jeopardize the long term conservation of litter arthropod communities,PLoS One,dynamics of the leaf litter arthropod fauna following fire in a neotropical woodland savanna
197,grass populations in tropical savannas are highly resilient in relation to different fire regimes but the mechanisms conferring such resilience have been poorly studied here we examine one such mechanism high adult survival during fire for three perennial grass species in an australian savanna eriachne triseta nees ex steud eriachne avenacea r br and chrysopogon latifolius s t blake the study examined survivorship after years at plots subject to experimental fire regimes experiencing or fires over the study period at theterritory wildlife park near darwin in the northern territory australia mean survivorship was and for e avenacea e triseta and c latifolius respectively for the two species of eriachne mean survivorship was highest e avenacea e triseta in unburnt plots whereas survivorship of c latifolius was highest under highest fire frequency however variation in survivorship among fire regime treatments was not statistically significant for any of the study species this negligible difference in survivorship among regimes points to fire tolerance sprouting ability as an important mechanism contributing to the resilience and persistence of perennial grasses in these savannas,Austral Ecology,fire tolerance of perennial grass tussocks in a savanna woodland
198,the conservation values of old growth forests in landscapes subject to repeated disturbance by fire or logging have received considerable conservation attention however little is known of the conservation values of old growth sites in ecosystems with an evolutionary history of highly frequent disturbance here we address the value of low fire frequency fire years in tropical savannas the world s most fire prone biome in terms of ant biodiversity we do this by comparing savanna ant communities within the territory wildlife park twp near darwin in the australian monsoonal tropics which has experienced a low incidence of fire over years due to active fire exclusion with those of adjacent outside sites experiencing the ambient fire regime of burning every  years ants were sampled using terrestrial and arboreal pitfall traps at sites eight each inside and outside twp more than ants were recorded during the study representing a total of ant species from genera more species in total were recorded outside than inside twp but there was no difference in mean site species richness or abundance and overall species composition was similar all species recorded inside twp are common and widespread throughout the savanna landscapes of the broader region in the absence of active fire exclusion low fire frequency at the territory wildlife park therefore does not appear to have enhanced regional ant conservation values our findings reinforce the importance of targeting fire regimes that are clearly linked to positive conservation outcomes rather than assuming a need for maximum pyrodiversity,Austral Ecology,conservation value of low fire frequency in tropical savannas ants in monsoonal northern australia
199,we investigated the influence of burning frequency and timing on the abundance and diversity of cursorial arachnids in the cerrado savannah of central brazil five areas were subjected to different burning regimes in each area pitfall traps were installed the arachnids were sampled for three days each month from april to october abundance was higher in the control area than in areas subjected to any fire regime species richness was similar in all areas the evenness was lower in the control area the areas subject to fires had significantly higher diversity than the control area although it was not possible to rank areas according to their diversity areas burned in the middle of the dry season tended to have higher diversity than areas burned at the beginning or end of this season indicating that the time at which fire occurs may be more important than the frequency of burning for the diversity of cursorial arachnids in the brazilian cerrado,Journal of Arachnology,effects of experimental fire regimes on the abundance and diversity of cursorial arachnids of brazilian savannah cerrado biome
200,non timber forest products ntfps strongly contribute to livelihood security in the semi arid tropics main factors determining the populations of ntfp providing species are human activities this study examined the impact of land use combined with rates and patterns of debarking and chopping on a ntfp providing tree anogeissus leiocarpa in burkina faso we compared stands in a protected area w national park with those of its surrounding communal area fallows croplands in order to i obtain an indication on the status of the population ii assess its harvesting tolerance iii estimate the sustainability of present management and iv derive which additional management strategies may foster its conservation our results reveal that the stands of a leiocarpa are in healthy states in fallows and in the park in croplands the absence of saplings gives evidence of a declining population nearly all individuals of a leiocarpa were harvested in croplands and fallows while the number of harvested individuals in the park was negligible intensity of debarking and chopping was tree size specific the sprouting ability significantly increased with higher chopping intensity we conclude that despite the land use impact and the intense harvesting stands of a leiocarpa are still well preserved due to the species life history fast growing and high sprouting and due to indirect positive influences of human activities by providing better environmental conditions for its recruitment thus the population of a leiocarpa is not at risk to over harvesting and land use even though it is not protected,Biological Conservation,impact of land use type and harvesting on population structure of a non timber forest product providing tree in a semi arid savanna west africa

204,this study evaluates biotic responses using ants as bio indicators to relatively recent anthropogenic disturbances to mature forest in central amazonia the structure of the ground foraging ant com munity was compared in four habitats that represented a gradient of disturbance associated with dierences in land use ants were collected in undisturbed mature forest in an abandoned pasture in a young regrowth forest situated in a former pasture area and in an old regrowth forest established where mature forest was just cleared and abandoned more ant species were found in mature and old regrowth forest than in the abandoned pasture by contrast ant abundance tended to decrease with forest maturity both pasture and young regrowth forest exhibited a distinct ant species composition compared to mature forest whereas species composition in the old regrowth forest showed greater similarity to that of mature forest in spite of dierences in fallow time between former pasture areas and non pasture areas there is evidence that dierent land management practices do result in dierent rates of recovery of the ant forest fauna after land abandonment in any case recuperation of the ground foraging ant fauna appears to be faster than regeneration of the woody plant community in this sense regrowth forests may be valuable for the conservation of ground foraging ants and perhaps for other components of mature forest leaf litter fauna within the context of a fragmented landscape,Biodiversity and Conservation,effects of forest disturbance on the structure of ground foraging ant communities in central amazonia
205,relatively little information exists on the eects of logging on rain forest organ isms particularly in the neotropics where logging operations have increased dra matically in recent years in this study we determined experimentally the eects of selective logging of a central amazonian forest on ground living ants the experimental design consisted of three ha replicated plots representing control unlogged forest forest logged years prior to the start of the study and forest logged years prior to the start of the study the logging operation removed of the basal area of trees of commercial value or about eight trees per hectare this resulted in a signi®cant decrease in canopy cover and an increase in understorey vegetation density in logged plots relative to controls collection and identi®cation of ants from a total of m samples of leaf lit ter revealed ant species of which were found in the control plots in the plots logged in and in those logged in species richness evenness and mean abundance ants m ÿ per plot did not vary among treatments most of the species found in the control plots were also present in the logged plots how ever population density of many species changed as a result of logging an eect that persisted for at least years after logging species commonly found in sites that were directly disturbed by logging gaps and tracks were rare in the undis turbed forest as revealed by an additional collection of ants these results suggest that the persistence of ant assemblages typical of undis turbed forest is likely to depend on the amount of structural damage incurred by logging thus management techniques that minimize logging impacts on forest structure are likely to help maintain the conservation value of logged forests for ground dwelling ants it is particularly important to minimize the extent of logging roads and tracks created by heavy machinery because these areas appear more prone to invasion by non forest species,Journal of Applied Ecology,responses of ants to selective logging of a central amazonian forest
206,during – raptor assemblages were studied in ten riparian habitats in the arid south west of the northern territory australia the assemblages at different creeks differed in species composition diversity richness and pair density they also changed from year to year in parallel with changes in rainfall and food abundance differences in food abundance probably accounted for much of the spatial and temporal variation in the assemblages although between creek differences in habitat and the availability of nesting resources were also implicated most species appeared to respond to the environmental changes individualistically but differences in pair spacing within and between trophic groups were suggestive of competitive interactions,Emu,the structure of raptor assemblages in riparian environments in the south west of the northern territory australia
207,despite the hegemony of pastoralism over most of australias tropical savannas its impacts upon biodiversity are poorly known there is even less knowledge about the impacts of military training a recent but rapidly expanding alternative land use we compare impacts of these land uses upon mammals birds reptiles and frogs at a site in north eastern australia with sampling from quadrats stratified by four landscape positions upper slope to riparian and three current land use types pastoralism military training and undisturbed prior to exclusion in the whole study area had been subjected to grazing over the course of approximately years so differences observed strictly reflect responses to changed land use largely cessation from grazing over the period of years subsequent to the imposition of the present regime the four classes of vertebrates showed contrasting responses frog distribution was unrelated to land use but strongly associated with landscape position reptiles showed a very strong response to land use type but not to landscape position the total abundance and richness of reptiles was greater in ungrazed i e military and undisturbed than in grazed quadrats the total abundance and species richness of birds varied strongly with landscape position but was unrelated to land use however many individual bird species showed significant responses to land use type and bird species composition was significantly related to both land use type and landscape position the richness of the mammal fauna was weakly related to landscape position and not related to land use type a few individual mammal species showed significant responses to either or both factors but mammal species composition was significantly albeit weakly related only to land use type with due regard to some interpretative constraints in the study design and the history of the site prior to this study these results suggest that pastoralism leads to a substantial rearrangement of the vertebrate fauna and particularly so for reptiles and those mammals and birds associated with the ground and understorey layers given the extent of pastoralism across the tropical savannas these results suggest that this industry has contributed to major and widespread change in the savanna fauna in contrast to pastoralism military land use at least at the relatively low intensity examined here produced little change in vertebrate assemblages,Austral Ecology,responses of vertebrates to pastoralism military land use and landscape position in an australian tropical savanna
208,effects of reclaiming estuarine tideland on soil fauna biodiversity were studied in the yangtze river estuary of china focusing on nematodes the responses of the nematode community to the disturbance caused by reclamation can be summarized as there was no distinct decline in the density of nematodes but the community structure changed greatly the proportions of plant feeders and omnivorous nematodes increased after reclamation whereas the proportions of bacterial feeders and predators decreased more apparent patchiness of nematode distribution was found in the reclaimed terrestrial environment than in intertidal marshes generally agrocenoses have been characterized by low proportions of predator omnivores our study indicated that omnivorous dorylaimids can be markedly abundant in agroecosystems depending on the annual crop rotation and tillage practices the predominant trophic group in cultivated land shifted between omnivorous nematodes and plant feeders implying that the food chain path changed with agricultural processes the maturity index mi provides little information in the present study probably because the mi value embraced information of many disturbances including vegetation succession and changes in soil features the faunal profile representing both enrichment and structural conditions is believed to be effective and more informative for analyzing the nematode successional trends,Applied Soil Ecology,soil faunal response to land use effect of estuarine tideland reclamation on nematode communities

210,when hungary together with nine other central and eastern european countries enters the european union in two major threats will arise to the birds inhabiting agricultural landscapes marginal agricultural land may be abandoned while the remaining area may suffer from intensification to assess the effects of these threats breeding birds were monitored in abandoned extensively and intensively used vineyards and grasslands in hungary using point counts to determine species richness and density species numbers and bird density were highest in extensively used vineyards while bird diversity was highest in abandoned vineyards abandoned vineyards were rich in species and individuals mainly woodland species whereas intensively used vineyards had both fewer species and individuals than the other two vineyard types in grassland four management types were distinguished abandoned extensively intensively grazed and both intensively grazed and fertilised grassland extensive grassland harboured most species bird density and diversity being highest at the abandoned site which was covered by bushes and contained many non grassland species intensively grazed fields had lower species numbers lower density and diversity than extensively grazed grassland but were still much more species rich and diverse than the fertilised fields our results suggest that extensively used farmland holds the highest diversity and abundance of farmland birds conservation efforts aimed at farmland birds should therefore focus on maintaining extensive farming systems,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",relationship between land use intensity and species richness and abundance of birds in hungary
211,pselaphine beetles coleoptera staphylinidae pselaphinae are cosmopolitan species rich and yet poorly studied particularly in the tropics we sampled beetles in three types of primary forest and two types of disturbed forest habitats in eastern thailand to assess the utility of pselaphine beetles as bioindicators of forest disturbance we simultaneously measured leaf litter mass soil moisture soil acidity and canopy cover at each site to infer which environmental factors affect pselaphine beetle diversity and abundance at each site pselaphine beetles were extracted from ten m samples of leaf litter and soil with tullgren funnels we sampled adult beetles representing six supertribes genera and morphospecies of the genera and of the species were undescribed forest types differed significantly in species richness abundance diversity and evenness primary forest had greater numbers of species and individuals and higher diversity indices h′ teak plantation and secondary forest had substantially fewer individuals and species of pselaphine beetles species composition differed between primary and degraded forests canopy cover soil moisture and leaf litter mass positively correlated with beetle species richness and abundance leaf litter mass and soil moisture were the two most important factors affecting the diversity of pselaphine beetle assemblages among the morphospecies collected morphospecies were specific to two or three habitats and morphospecies were found only in a single habitat thus pselaphine beetles appear to have rather narrow habitat requirements and their presence absence was correlated with environmental differences these traits make pselaphine beetles a suitable bioindicator taxon for assessing forest litter diversity and monitoring habitat change,Entomological Science,diversity of pselaphine beetles coleoptera staphylinidae pselaphinae in eastern thailand
212,parks and other protected areas in tropical forests often include secondary forest cropland and pasture documentation of the impact of such anthropogenic disturbance is essential for effective management we re sampled bats within mount isarog natural park minp a protected area in southeastern luzon philippines seventeen years after a survey in old and second growth forest and ill agro pastoral areas was conducted in by employing harp traps and a tunnel trap in addition to mist nets as used ill the earlier study we aimed to document species previously undetected by mist netting alone we documented bat species seven of which were captured exclusively in harp traps and two that were only captured in a tunnel trap this survey resulted in nine new records of bat species for minp bringing the total number to we did not recapture four species documented in all of which were noted in that study as uncommon nineteen species were captured in agro pastoral areas on the south slope including two hipposideros spp not captured at the forested sites,Acta Chiropterologica,bat diversity in tropical forest and agro pastoral habitats within a protected area in the philippines
213,very little is known about the diversity of arthropods in the fast disappearing fragments of natural forests in sub saharan africa this study investigated the influence of forest fragment characteristics on dung beetle species richness composition abundance and diversity and the relationship between dung beetle assemblages and rainfall pattern beetles were sampled through mo using dung baited pitfall traps a total of dung beetles belonging to three subfamilies and species were captured the subfamily scarabaeinae was the most abundant and species rich fast burying tunnellers paracoprids were the most dominant functional group catharsius sesostris copris nepos and heliocopris punctiventris were the three most abundant species and had the highest contributions to dissimilarities between forests with few exceptions dung beetle abundance species richness and diversity were generally higher in larger forest fragments ha than in smaller ones ha and the nature reserve ha forest fragment size had a highly significant positive relationship with beetle abundance but only when the nature reserve is excluded in the analysis dung beetle abundance and species richness showed direct weak relationships with litter depth positive and groundcover negative but not tree density tree species richness and fragment isolation distance dung beetle abundance and species richness were strongly correlated with monthly changes in rainfall results of this study indicate that forest fragments on agricultural lands in the budongo landscape especially medium sized ha ones represent important conservation areas for dung beetles,Biotropica,dung beetle assemblages and seasonality in primary forest and forest fragments on agricultural landscapes in budongo uganda
214,the interaction between land use change and the sustainability of hunting is poorly understood but is critical for sustaining hunted vertebrate populations and a protein supply for the rural poor we investigated sustainability of hunting in an amazonian landscape mosaic where a small human population had access to large areas of both primary and secondary forest harvestable production ofmammals and birds was calculated from density estimates we compared production with offtake from three villages and used catch per unit effort as an independent measure of prey abundance most species were hunted unsustainably in primary forest leading to local depletion of the largest primates and birds the estimated sustainable supply of wild meat was higher for primary kg · km− · yr− than secondary forest kg · km− · yr− because four species were absent and three species at low abundance in secondary forests production of three disturbance tolerant mammal species was times higher in secondary than in primary forest but hunting led to overexploitation of one species our data suggest that an average amazonian smallholder would require ≥ km of secondary regrowth to ensure a sustainable harvest of forest vertebrates we conclude that secondary forests can sustainably provide only of the required protein intake of amazonian smallholders and are unlikely to be sufficient for sustainable hunting in other tropical forest regions,Conservation Biology,hunting for sustainability in tropical secondary forests
215,diversity and similarity of butterfly communities were assessed in five different habitat types from natural closed forest to agricultural lands in the mountains of tam dao national park vietnam for years from to the line transect count was used to record species richness and abundance of butterfly communities in the different habitat types for each habitat the number of species and individuals and indices of species richness evenness and diversity of butterfly communities were calculated the results indicated that species richness and abundance of butterfly communities were low in the natural closed forest higher in the disturbed forest highest in the forest edge lower in the shrub habitat and lowest in the agricultural lands the indices of species richness evenness and diversity of butterfly communities were low in agricultural lands and natural closed forest but highest in the forest edge and shrub habitats the families satyridae and amathusiidae have the greatest species richness and abundance in the natural closed forest with a reduction in their species richness and abundance from the natural closed forest to the agricultural lands species composition of butterfly communities was different among five different habitat types was similar in habitats outside the forest and was similar in habitats inside the forest diversity and abundance of butterfly communities are not different between the natural closed forest and the agriculture lands but species composition changed greatly between these habitat types a positive correlation between the size of species geographical distribution range and increasing habitat disturbance was found the most characteristic natural closed forest species have the smallest geographical distribution range,Journal of Zoology,diversity and similarity of butterfly communities in five different habitat types at tam dao national park vietnam

217,aim studies on habitat fragmentation of insect communities mostly ignore the impact of the surrounding landscape matrix and treat all species equally in our study on habitat fragmentation and the importance of landscape context we expected that habitat specialists are more affected by area and isolation and habitat generalists more by landscape context location and methods the study was conducted in the vicinity of the city of go¨ ttingen in germany in the year we analysed butterfly communities by transect counts on thirty two calcareous grasslands differing in size  ha isolation index  edge to edge distance  m and landscape diversity shannonwiener  which is correlated to percentage grassland in the landscape results a total of butterfly specimens belonging to fifty four species are recorded in multiple regression analysis the number of habitat specialist n ¼ and habitat generalist n ¼ butterfly species increased with habitat area but z values slopes of the speciesarea relationships for specialists z ¼ were significantly steeper compared with generalists z ¼ generalists but not specialists showed a marginally significant increase with landscape diversity effects of landscape diversity were scale dependent and significant only at the smallest scale landscape context within a m radius around the habitat habitat isolation was not related to specialist and generalist species numbers in multiple regression analysis the density of specialists increased significantly with habitat area whereas generalist density increased only marginally habitat isolation and landscape diversity did not show any effects main conclusions habitat area was the most important predictor of butterfly community structure and influenced habitat specialists more than habitat generalists in contrast to our expectations habitat isolation had no effect as most butterflies could cope with the degree of isolation in our study region landscape diversity appeared to be important for generalist butterflies only,Journal of Biogeography,how does landscape context contribute to effects of habitat fragmentation on diversity and population density of butterflies
218,because of the difficulties encountered in detecting many large tropical forest dwelling species in their natural habitat precise figures concerning the distribution number and trends of many populations remain deficient in tropical forests ground surveys are generally carried out by counting objects along straight lines these counts require a strict compliance with the line transect methodology before proper design of the census during careful data collection and after accurate and correct data processing and analysis the census itself in addition the major source of bias when estimating population size and or trends comes from the extrapolation of estimates obtained in small sampling areas to the larger and often incompletely known distribution of the population in the kinabatangan floodplain sabah malaysia helicopter surveys were useful in directly assessing the distribution of orang utans and were a major advantage in the precise estimation of the size of the orang utan population surviving in this region our survey showed that about orang utans remain in the multiple use forests of the kinabatangan floodplain these results provide new evidence on orang utan adaptation to habitat disturbance and indicate the potential of the kinabatangan multiple use forests for orang utan conservation helicopter surveys appear to be a promising alternative to ground survey for precise distribution assessment and for monitoring population trends of apes throughout their entire range in asia and in some parts of africa,Animal Conservation,determination of ape distribution and population size using ground and aerial surveys a case study with orang utans in lower kinabatangan sabah malaysia
219,little is known about the diversity of tropical animal communities in recently fireaffected environments here we assessed species richness evenness and community similarity of butterflies and odonates in landscapes located in unburned isolates and burned areas in a habitat mosaic that was severely affected by the enso el nino southern oscillation event in east kalimantan indonesian borneo in addition related community similarity to variation in geographic distance between sampling sites and the habitat vegetation structure species richness and evenness differed significantly among landscapes but there was no congruence between both taxa the species richness of butterflies was for example highest in sites located in a very large unburned isolate whereas odonate species richness was highest in sites located in a small unburned isolate and once burned forest we also found substantial variation in the habitat vegetation structure among landscapes but this was mainly due to variation between unburned and burned landscapes and variation among burned landscapes both distance and environment habitat vegetation contributed substantially to explaining variation in the community similarity beta diversity of both taxa the contribution of the environment was however mainly due to variation between unburned and burned landscapes which contained very different assemblages of both taxa sites located in the burned forest contained assemblages that were intermediate between assemblages from sites in unburned forest and sites from a highly degraded slash and burn area indicating that the burned forest was probably recolonised by species from these disparate environments we furthermore note that in contrast to species richness alpha diversity the patterns of community similarity beta diversity were highly congruent between both taxa these results indicate that community wide multivariate measures of beta diversity are more consistent among taxa and more reliable indicators of disturbance such as enso induced burning than univariate measures,Oikos,diversity and community composition of butterflies and odonates in an enso induced fire affected habitat mosaic a case study from east kalimantan indonesia
220,calcareous grasslands harbour a high biodiversity but are highly fragmented and endangered in central europe we tested the relative importance of habitat area habitat isolation and landscape diversity for species richness of vascular plants plants were recorded on calcareous grasslands in the vicinity of the city of go¨ttingen germany and were divided into habitat specialist and generalist species we expected that habitat specialists were more affected by area and isolation and habitat generalists more by landscape diversity in multiple regression analysis the species richness of habitat specialists n¼ species and habitat generalists n¼ increased with habitat area while habitat isolation or landscape diversity did not have significant effects contrary to predictions habitat specialists were not more affected by reduced habitat area than generalists this may have been caused by delayed extinction of long living plant specialists in small grasslands additionally non specialists may profit more from high habitat heterogeneity in large grasslands compared to habitat specialists although habitat isolation and landscape diversity revealed no significant effect on local plant diversity only an average of of habitat specialists of the total species pool were found within one study site in conclusion habitat area was important for plant species conservation but regional variation between habitats contributed also an important of total species richness,Biodiversity and Conservation,effects of habitat area isolation and landscape diversity on plant species richness of calcareous grasslands

225,despite the fact that tropical dry forests are being exploited on a large scale for various forest products there has been limited evaluation of the accom panying ecological impacts in particular there is no information on the effects of widespread biomass extraction such as grazing and firewood collection a study was carried out in sariska tiger reserve in northern india to investigate the effects of biomass extraction on forest vegetation composition diversity and structure biomass extraction caused significant changes in forest vegetation structure and species composition in the tree layer but the extent of these changes varied across the three major vegetation types found in the reserve anogeissus dominated slope forest showed significantly lower mean canopy cover tree density tree basal area and height of trees in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites riparian forest showed lower mean canopy cover tree basal areas and number of recorded tree species in disturbed sites scrub forest had lower mean canopy cover tree basal area and tree height there were fewer tall trees but greater number of short trees in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types girths of trees similarly shifted towards lower values in riparian and scrub forest in anogeissus dominated forest disturbed and undisturbed sites did not differ in proportions of trees in various girth classes tree species richness was substantially lower in disturbed sites of anogeissus dominated and riparian forest in comparison to undisturbed sites but was not affected by disturbance in scrub forest understorey species richness was higher in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types but understorey changed structurally only in anogeissus dominated forest overall tree and understorey species composition was significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed sites of anogeissus dominated forest but was unchanged in scrub and riparian forest observed changes in vegetation structure diversity and composition of the different vegetation types due to biomass extraction have implications for biodiversity conservation in tropical dry forest ecosystems and need to be addressed in future forest management planning,Environmental Conservation,effects of biomass extraction on vegetation structure diversity and composition of forests in sariska tiger reserve india
226,we assess the differential impact of logging and enso el niño southern oscillation induced disturbance on the relative butterfly abundance and species richness of range restricted and widespread species within the island of borneo relative abundance and species richness were assessed using rarefaction and species accumulation curves in unburned isolates surrounded by burned forest the burned forest itself and continuous forest unaffected by enso induced disturbance in addition to logged and unlogged landscapes in unburned forest the relative abundance of endemics was significantly higher in unlogged forest than logged forest and significantly higher in unburned forest than burned forest rarefied species richness of range categories was similar bornean endemics or higher other categories in selectively logged than unlogged forest in contrast rarefied species richness of range restricted species was highest in continuous forest intermediate in unburned isolates and lowest in burned forest only two individuals of a single bornean endemic species were found in all the burned forest although species richness was higher in all range categories in continuous forest than in unburned isolates and in burned forest the difference was most pronounced for range restricted species logging and enso induced fires thus have contrasting effects on range restricted species while both increase the relative abundance of widely distributed species at the expense of range restricted species only enso induced disturbance lowers the rarefied number of restricted range species our research highlights the threat that severe enso events pose to geographically restricted classes of biodiversity,Diversity and Distributions,burning and logging differentially affect endemic vs widely distributed butterfly species in borneo
227,arthropod assemblages were examined in lama forest reserve a protected area situated in the dahomey gap southern benin composed of plantations degraded forest and remnants of natural forest the objectives were to compare assemblages in relation to forest type and use to elucidate the value of forest plantations for biodiversity conservation and to identify indicator species for specific forest habitats arthropods were collected over an month period using standardized sets of traps pitfall emergence malaise and flight intercept traps nine different habitats were studied including natural and degraded forest forest plantations tectona grandis and senna siamea of different age and isolated forest fragments our analysis focused on detritivorous and xylophagous arthropods but also included ground beetles and heteropterans totalling species we found no differences in species richness among natural and degraded forest habitats in the centre of the reserve noyau central outside of the noyau central species richness was highest in old teak plantations and isolated forest fragments and lowest in young teak and fuelwood plantations detrended correspondence analysis dca separated three main groups natural forest degraded forest and young plantations and old plantations and isolated forest fragments multiple regression of dca scores of the first two axes on environmental variables identified one natural and three disturbance related predictors of arthropod assemblages in lama forest soil type texture canopy height naturalness proportion of guineo congolian plant species and understorey vegetation cover we identified indicator species for six different forest habitats the highest numbers were found in abandoned settlements and old teak plantations b diversity was similar among the three dca ordination groups degraded forest excluded values for b diversity were relatively high suggesting that all major forest habitats contribute significantly to regional species pools and should therefore be protected to enhance arthropod diversity we propose that management practices in lama forest should aim to encourage the development of species rich understorey vegetation of the guineo congolian phyto geographical region,Biodiversity and Conservation,arthropod diversity in lama forest reserve south benin a mosaic of natural degraded and plantation forests

229,secondary forests growing on cleared lands and tree plantations are becoming increasingly widespread land uses in the tropics previous studies are divided on the conservation importance of these habitats for tropical forest butterflies we use a robust sampling design accounting for both seasonality and vertical stratification to examine fruit feeding butterflies nymphalidae in patches of secondary forest and eucalyptus plantation  orders of magnitude larger than those previously sampled we recorded butterflies and species in trap days species richness was highest in primary forest and lowest in plantations while butterfly abundance showed the opposite response all habitats were distinct in terms of community structure there was a significant interaction between habitat and season based on richness and abundance metrics although not based on community structure secondary forest exhibited higher observed richness than primary forest in the peak of the dry season but not at other times of the year this observation could explain the lack of consensus in previous studies as those reporting higher richness in secondary forest only sampled during the dry season in general habitat quality appeared to be more important than the surrounding landscape in determining butterfly community structure however the community structure of the strong flying charaxinae was related to the amount of primary forest in surrounding landscape there was very poor congruence between the response patterns of richness and abundance among different butterfly subfamilies linear regressions between resource availability and butterfly abundance showed a strong influence of leaf phenology in both primary and secondary forest but no influence of fruit phenology synthesis and applications a lack of seasonal replication and small sampling sizes may have led previous studies to over emphasize the conservation importance of secondary forest and plantations for butterflies we show that these habitats are significantly poorer than primary forest in terms of number of species and hold distinct butterfly communities although quantifying the number of species restricted to primary forest remains difficult these results cast doubt on the presumption that secondary habitats will provide refuge for many of the species being lost through deforestation we therefore strongly urge measures that prioritize the conservation of remaining primary forests where they still exist,Journal of Applied Ecology,the value of primary secondary and plantation forests for fruit feeding butterflies in the brazilian amazon
230,although indigenous farmers and other traditional peoples have disturbed amazonian forests for centuries few studies investigate the effects of these disturbances on biodiversity this short term study investigates how bird assemblages are affected by agricultural practices adopted by the residents of a national park in the brazilian amazon twelve sites in secondary forest four sites in three age categories and sites in primary forest were selected for bird sampling audio visual censuses of birds were conducted in small plots ha of young secondary growth  y middle aged  y and old  y secondary forests each site in secondary forest had a corresponding control site in adjacent primary forest young secondary growth had fewer species than old secondary and primary forests bird species richness was similar inmiddle aged old secondary and primary forests bird communities of young secondary habitat were dominated by species normally found in open habitats such as agricultural fields and igap´o flooded forests the bird species composition of young secondary growth was more similar to that ofmiddle aged forest which in turn was more similar to that of old secondary forests bird species composition differed between young secondary growth and old secondary forests and primary forests and between middle aged secondary and primary forests nectarivore insectivores and frugivore insectivores of monospecific flocks are significantly associated with secondary forests especially in initial stages of forest regeneration in contrast specialized insectivorous birds that join mixed flocks show a significant association with primary forest,Journal of Tropical Ecology,bird assemblages in secondary forests developing after slash and burn agriculture in the brazilian amazon
231,the ongoing destruction of tropical rainforests has increased the interest in the potential value of tropical agroforests for the conservation of biodiversity traditional shaded agroforests may support high levels of biodiversity for some groups even approaching that of undisturbed tropical forests however it is unclear to what extent forest fauna is represented in this diversity and how management affects forest fauna in agroforests we studied lower canopy ant and beetle fauna in cacao agroforests and forests in central sulawesi indonesia a region dominated by cacao agroforestry we compared ant and beetle species richness and composition in forests and cacao agroforests and studied the impact of two aspects of management intensification the decrease in shade tree diversity and in shade canopy cover on ant and beetle diversity the agroforests had three types of shade that represented a decrease in tree diversity high intermediate and low diversity species richness of ants and beetles in the canopies of the cacao trees was similar to that found in lower canopy forest trees however the composition of ant and beetle communities differed greatly between the agroforest and forest sites forest beetles suffered profoundly from the conversion to agroforests only of the beetle species recorded in the forest sites were also found in the agroforests and those species made up only of all beetles collected from cacao in contrast forest ants were well represented in agroforests with of all species encountered in the forest sites also occurring on cacao the reduction of shade tree diversity had no negative effect on ants and beetles on cacao trees beetle abundances and non forest ant species richness even increased with decreasing shade tree diversity thinning of the shade canopy was related to a decrease in richness of forest ant species on cacao trees but not of beetles the contrasting responses of ants and beetles to shade tree management emphasize that conservation plans that focus on one taxonomic group may not work for others overall ant and beetle diversity can remain high in shaded agroforests but the conservation of forest ants and beetles in particular depends primarily on the protection of natural forests which for forest ants can be complemented by the conservation of adjacent shaded cacao agroforests,Biodiversity and Conservation,the contribution of cacao agroforests to the conservation of lower canopy ant and beetle diversity in indonesia
232,despite the importance of considering arthropods in monitoring programs and conserva tion planning given their diversity in terrestrial ecosystems and potential in revealing environmental disturbances most studies on the effects of habitat disturbances in trop ical forests focused on vertebrates plants and a few arthropod groups by sampling sites evenly distributed in four habitat categories continuous mature and secondary for est and large and small secondary forest fragments we investigated how harvestmen opiliones which represent the third largest order of arachnids and have been poorly studied in tropical forests are affected by habitat quality and quantity richness and abundance of rare species were strongly affected by habitat quality first axis of principal component analysis on forest structure increasing in less disturbed mature forests richness total abundance abundance of rare species and of one of the three common species were higher in continuous forest while only total abundance differed between large and small fragments detrended correspondence analysis revealed that just one species increased in abundance in fragments while several others were associated with continuous and or mature forest and that harvestman composition did not vary between large and small fragments our results suggest that harvestmen are strongly affected by habitat quality and quantity probably because compared to other arthropod groups they are relatively uniform in some relevant biological aspects nocturnal predators dependent on microclimatic conditions that present low vagility are probably more indicative of intermediate level disturbances given the absence of species associated with highly disturbed areas,Biological Conservation,harvestmen in an atlantic forest fragmented landscape evaluating assemblage response to habitat quality and quantity
233,biodiversity loss from deforestation may be partly offset by the expansion of secondary forests and plantation forestry in the tropics however our current knowledge of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation is limited to very few taxa and many studies are severely confounded by methodological shortcomings we examined the conservation value of tropical primary secondary and plantation forests for taxonomic groups using a robust and replicated sample design that minimized edge effects different taxa varied markedly in their response to patterns of land use in terms of species richness and the percentage of species restricted to primary forest varying from to yet almost all between forest comparisons showed marked differences in community structure and composition cross taxon congruence in response patterns was very weak when evaluated using abundance or species richness data but much stronger when using metrics based upon community similarity our results show that whereas the biodiversity indicator group concept may hold some validity for several taxa that are frequently sampled such as birds and fruit feeding butterflies it fails for those exhibiting highly idiosyncratic responses to tropical land use change including highly vagile species groups such as bats and orchid bees highlighting the problems associated with quantifying the biodiversity value of anthropogenic habitats finally although we show that areas of native regeneration and exotic tree plantations can provide complementary conservation services we also provide clear empirical evidence demonstrating the irreplaceable value of primary forests,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,quantifying the biodiversity value of tropical primary secondary and plantation forests

235,in the yucatan cenotes or water sinkholes formed by the dissolution of limestone and sur rounded with a characteristic dense layer of heterogeneous vegetation are the main sources of water for plant and animal assemblages we investigated their importance to bats by comparing the assemblage structure and diversity between tropical forest and pas tureland with and without cenotes we set ground level mist nets sub canopy nets and harp traps for nights and caught bats of species and six families forest had a greater bat species diversity and abundance than pastureland as well as rare and threa tened species in forest sites with and without cenotes had a similar bat assemblage struc ture and diversity whereas in pastureland there was a greater species diversity and abundance and number of rare and threatened species at cenotes than sites without cen otes chrotopterus auritus and micronycteris schmidtorum both threatened in mexico and eptesicus furinalis were exclusively captured at cenotes we suggest that it may be the vege tation around cenotes rather than the water bodies per se that attracts many bat species in pastureland cenotes are threatened by nitrate contamination from untreated domestic and animal waste and fertilizers and the removal of vegetation to allow livestock access to water in yucatans agricultural landscapes protection of cenotes and their characteristic vegetation is key not only for bat conservation but also because they represent potential seed sources for the regeneration of the lowland forest in which bats play key roles as poll inators and seed dispersers,Biological Conservation,the importance of cenotes in conserving bat assemblages in the yucatan mexico
236,the future of biodiversity hinges partly on realizing the potentially high conservation value of human dominated countryside the characteristics of the countryside that promote biodiversity preservation remain poorly understood however particularly at the fine scales at which individual farmers tend to make land use decisions to address this problem we explored the use of a rapid remote sensing method for estimating bird community composition in tropical countryside using a two step process first we asked how finegrained variation in land cover affected community composition second we determined whether the observed changes in community composition correlated with three easily accessible remote sensing metrics wetness greenness and brightness derived from performing a tasseled cap transformation on a landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus image as a comparison we also examined whether the most commonly used remote sensing indicator in ecology the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi correlated with community composition we worked within an agricultural landscape in southern costa rica where the land comprised a complex and highly heterogeneous mosaic of remnant native vegetation pasture coffee cultivation and other crops in this region we selected study sites each ha that encompassed the range of available land cover possibilities in the countryside within each site we surveyed bird communities within all major land cover types and we conducted detailed field mapping of land cover we found that the number of forest affiliated species increased with forest cover and decreased with residential area across sites conversely the number of agriculture affiliated species using forest increased with land area devoted to agricultural and residential uses interestingly we found that the wetness and brightness metrics predicted the number of forest and agriculture affiliated species within a site as well as did detailed field generated maps of land cover in contrast ndvi and the closely correlated greenness metric did not correlate with land cover or with bird communities our study shows the strong potential of the tasseled cap transformation as a tool for assessing the conservation value of countryside for biodiversity,Ecological Applications,satellite detection of bird communities in tropical countryside
237,a study was carried out in a tropical scrub forest in india to investigate the effects of extractive activities such as fodder and firewood collection on native bird communities and to study the relative influences of altered vegetation composition and structure the study was based on comparison between six disturbed extracted and four undisturbed non extracted sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method six different variables related to vegetation structure canopy cover basal area average forest height tree density tree height diversity and tree species richness were quantified as was tree species composition there was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites however bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites overall bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites nine of locally abundant bird species showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats of these nine species seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed all seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous canopy cover tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites in both habitats bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest however altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition partial mantels tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure rather than by changes in forest tree composition,Forest Ecology & Management,effects of extractive disturbance on bird assemblages vegetation structure and floristics in tropical scrub forest sariska tiger reserve india
238,aim to evaluate frugivorous butterflies as indicators of forest disturbance in the brazilian atlantic forest location the study area is located in the municipality of cotia são paulo state south eastern brazil °′−°′s °′−°′w methods sampling was done at four sites inside a large forest block the morro grande state reserve and in five forest fragments in an adjacent fragmented landscape butterflies were sampled with portable traps baited with a fermented mixture of banana and sugar cane juice sampling was carried out during the period most favourable for the capture of frugivorous butterflies in south eastern brazil results all richness related results indicated no effect of forest fragmentation on the frugivorous butterfly guild concurring with the suggestion of appreciable resistance of atlantic forest butterflies to habitat modification however species composition discriminated between the two landscapes indicating that fragmentation may have effects beyond simple species richness when species were analysed individually clear patterns of distribution emerged with some species that were very abundant in the fragmented landscape being practically absent in the continuous landscape and vice versa this pattern seems consistent even for some subfamilies main conclusion our findings support the usefulness of the frugivorous butterfly guild as a biological indicator of forest disturbance effects in one of the world’s most threatened ecosystems,Global Ecology and Biogeography,species richness composition and abundance of fruit feeding butterflies in the brazilian atlantic forest comparison between a fragmented and a continuous landscape
239,aim the effects of logging and habitat degradation on the richness and abundance of small mammals in asian rain forests are largely unknown this work compares the species richness dominance and evenness of small non volant mammals between logged and unlogged forests and assesses whether assemblage variability b diversity is similar between forest types location southeast asia northern borneo sabah malaysia sunda shelf methods we surveyed species rich assemblages of small non volant mammals in three unlogged and three logged forests for years at each forest site we sampled a permanently marked transect and two additional sites in three trapping sessions all analyses were performed at both levels to include the effects of local abundances and point estimates separately from the relative abundances of species on a more regional scale results we trapped a total of individuals of species eleven common species accounted for of all captures species richness and diversity were significantly higher in unlogged forest species than in logged forest species this was mainly attributable to the smaller number of rarely recorded species in logged forest five compared with in unlogged forest with a total of fewer than captures however all common species were present in both logged and unlogged forests and our analyses revealed similar patterns of dominance evenness and fluctuations in abundance hence overall assemblage composition in multivariate space did not differ greatly between forest types assemblages of muridae and tupaiidae showed similar population fluctuations in space and time indicating that the ecology of these taxa may be partially driven by the same environmental factors main conclusions although species were distributed patchily within sites analyses at local and regional scales revealed similar patterns in diversity and assemblage variability suggesting that effects of forest modification did not differ extensively locally and regionally but had a profound effect on rare species our results emphasize the importance and conservation value of logged forest stands that are able to hold a large proportion of the small mammals also found in unlogged forests rare and more specialized species are more vulnerable to forest degradation than commonly caught species resulting in the complete loss or a decrease in numbers of certain groups such as arboreal small mammals and viverridae,Journal of Biogeography,effects of rain forest logging on species richness and assemblage composition of small mammals in southwest asia
240,habitat fragmentation and conversion are among the human activities that pose the greatest threat to species persistence and conservation of biodiversity this is particularly true in the neotropics where bats represent important components of biodiversity from taxonomic and functional perspectives and provide critical ecosystem services e g seed dispersal and pollination we assessed the degree to which conversion of lowland amazonian rain forest to agriculture and its subsequent abandonment and secondary succession affect the abundances of populations of phyllostomid bats in the vicinity of iquitos peru ́ during net m h of sampling we captured bats of five families of these were phyllostomids representing species genera and three feeding guilds we focus on the most abundant species of phyllostomids in terms of abundance frugivores dominated assemblages in all habitat types and seasons eight species consistently responded to habitat conversion two species consistently responded to season two species responded consistently to both habitat and season and five species responded to habitat conversion in a season specific manner frugivores and nectarivores were abundant in areas that had been converted to agriculture which suggests that these bats are resilient to extant levels of disturbance and may be important in promoting secondary succession however this result may be scale or context dependent if habitat conversion continues and dramatically reduces the areal extent and increases fragmentation of mature forest then a complex metacommunity dynamic may characterize the region and source populations of bats may become threatened or extirpated locally,Biotropica,phyllostomid bats of lowland amazonia effects of habitat alteration on abundance
241,the extent to which secondary forests occupying degraded and abandoned lands provide suitable habitat for forest adapted species is an important conservation issue in times of vanishing old growth forests we used ants hymenoptera formicidae a functionally important and diverse group of invertebrates to investigate the recovery of soil taxa during secondary forest succession in the atlantic forest of southern brazil we compared the resilience of epigeic vs hypogeic ant assemblages for this purpose we established sites that encompassed a chronosequence from pastures to old growth forests on two contrasting soil types our results are based on a collection of individuals in genera richness and composition of ant assemblages in secondary forests have recovered slowly and have not approached conditions typical of old growth forests the distribution of genera along the successional stages was arranged in a nested pattern where ant genera of younger successional stages were a subset of genera present in older stages edaphic conditions had no influence on the recovery process overall richness of ants was lower at study sites with water logged soils than at sites where soils did not exhibit hydromorphic properties the hypogeic ant assemblage recovered more slowly than the epigeic assemblage our results show that secondary forests do not act as refuges for many forest adapted animals which are currently restricted to discontinuous patches of old growth forest in the highly endangered atlantic forest of brazil moreover estimated recovery times of to several hundred years suggest it would take much longer than previously presumed for complete recolonization,Biological Conservation,do secondary forests act as refuges for old growth forest animals recovery of ant diversity in the atlantic forest of brazil
242,tree plantations of native and exotic species are frequently used to compensate for forest loss in the tropics however these plantations may support lower species diversity and different communities than natural forest we therefore investigated bird communities in stands of natural forest different types of tree plantations and secondary forest in kakamega forest western kenya wecompared birds differing in habitat specialisation i e forest specialists generalists and visitors we recorded significant differences in mean species richness and number of individuals among the different forest types stands of natural forest and plantations of indigenous tree species comprised more species and individuals than plantations of exotic tree species and secondary forest this was caused by a significant decline of forest specialists and generalists from natural forest and indigenous plantations to exotic plantations and secondary forest species composition of the bird communities did not differ between natural forest stands and plantations of a mixture of indigenous tree species but clearly changed between natural forest and plantations of single tree species these findings demonstrate that natural forest areas are needed for the conservation of forest bird diversity but that plantations with a mixture of indigenous tree species can have similarly high conservation value,Forest Ecology & Management,conservation value of forest plantations for bird communities in western kenya
243,secondary and plantation forests are becoming increasingly widespread in the tropics a recent meta analysis on the impacts of land use change on tropical forest dung beetles concluded that regenerating forests can be effective in helping to offset species loss following deforestation however our understanding of the extent to which these results can be generalized to new locations remains very poor we attempted to overcome many of the design limitations that characterize previous studies by collecting spatially independent dung beetle samples from primary secondary and eucalyptus plantation forests in north east brazilian amazonia across a large quasi experimental landscape that minimized confounding edge and fragmentation effects we recorded dung beetles comprising species species richness was significantly higher in primary forest and the majority of species were more abundant there than elsewhere whereas secondary and plantation sites harboured an impoverished subset of primary forest species our data illustrate the low value of tropical secondary and plantation forests for dung beetles in our study area and our conclusions are more pessimistic than those of earlier studies because of differences in the order of species rank abundance and rank biomass patterns re coding community data from abundance to biomass significantly altered the analytical weight of individual species in determining community patterns larger bodied beetles were more prone to local extinctions and abundance declines and this effect was consistent both within and between genera synthesis and applications our study demonstrates that secondary and plantation forests in a large neotropical landscape host exceptionally impoverished dung beetle communities furthermore the depletion of beetle abundance combined with a reduction in average body mass in converted forests is likely to have detrimental consequences for the maintenance of dung beetle mediated ecosystem services in these habitats differences in biogeographical and landscape context and the influence of common limitations in sampling design may explain why many other studies have painted a more optimistic picture of the conservation value of anthropogenic habitats in the absence of further evidence we caution strongly against the claim that forest regeneration schemes on degraded land can effectively offset the loss of species following deforestation and urge that conservation strategies prioritize the protection of remaining areas of primary forest,Journal of Applied Ecology,understanding the biodiversity consequences of habitat change the value of secondary and plantation forests for neotropical dung beetles
244,in view of the continued decline in tropical forest cover around the globe forest restoration has become a key tool in tropical rainforest conservation one of the main  and least expensive  restoration strategies is natural forest regeneration by aiding forest seed influx both into disturbed and undisturbed habitats frugivorous birds facilitate forest regeneration this study focuses on the tolerance of a frugivorous bird community to anthropogenic habitat disturbance within the broader context of natural forest regeneration with conservation purposes it was carried out in the tropical cloud forest of costa ricas talamanca mountains bird community response and tolerance to habitat disturbance was assessed by comparing bird presence and densities along a disturbance gradient ranging from open pastures to closed mature forests birds were censused along nine transects applying the variable width line transect procedure forty relevant frugivorous bird species were observed during h of survey time densities were calculated for species nine species responded negatively to increasing level of disturbance and nine others positively results indicate that large frugivores are generally moderately tolerant to intermediate but intolerant to severe habitat disturbance and that tolerance is often higher for medium and small frugivores it appears that moderately disturbed habitats in tropical cloud forests are highly suitable for restoration through natural regeneration aided by frugivorous birds due to a lack of large forest seed dispersers severely disturbed habitats appear less suitable,Biological Conservation,tolerance of frugivorous birds to habitat disturbance in a tropical cloud forest
245,the sustainability of current harvest practices for high value meliaceae can be assessed by quantifying logging intensity and projecting growth and survival by post logging populations over anticipated intervals between harvests from area inventories of big leaf mahogany swietenia macrophylla covering ha or more at eight logged and unlogged forest sites across southern brazilian amazonia we report generally higher landscape scale densities and smaller population level mean diameters in eastern forests compared to western forests where most commercial stocks survive density of trees ≥ cm diameter varied by two orders of magnitude and peaked at ha− size class frequency distributions appeared unimodal at two high density sites but were essentially amodal or flat elsewhere diameter increment patterns indicate that populations were multi or all aged at two high density sites conventional logging removed – of commercial trees ≥ cm diameter at the time of logging illegally eliminated – of sub merchantable trees and targeted trees as small as cm diameter projected recovery by commercial stems during years after conventional logging represented – of initial densities and was highly dependent on initial logging intensity and size class frequency distributions of commercial trees we simulated post logging recovery over the same period at all sites according to the regulatory framework for mahogany in brazil which raised the minimum diameter cutting limit to cm and requires retention during the first harvest of of commercial sized trees recovery during years ranged from approximately to over retention densities at seven of eight sites at only one site where sub merchantable trees dominated the population did the simulated density of harvestable stems after years exceed initial commercial densities these results indicate that harvest intensity will not be sustainable over multiple cutting cycles for most populations without silvicultural interventions ensuring establishment and long term growth of artificial regeneration to augment depleted natural stocks including repeated tending of outplanted seedlings without improved harvest protocols for mahogany in brazil as explored in this paper future commercial supplies of this species as well as other high value tropical timbers are endangered rapid changes in the timber industry and land use in the amazon are also significant challenges to sustainable management of mahogany,Forest Ecology & Management,what loggers leave behind impacts on big leaf mahogany swietenia macrophylla commercial populations and potential for post logging recovery in the brazilian amazon
246,in the face of widespread deforestation the conservation of rainforest trees relies increasingly on their ability to maintain reproductive processes in fragmented landscapes here we analysed nine microsatellite loci for adults and progeny of the tree dipteryx panamensis in costa rica pollen dispersal distances genetic diversity genetic structure and spatial autocorrelation were determined for populations in four habitats continuous forest forest fragments pastures adjacent to fragments and isolated pastures we predicted longer but less frequent pollen movements among increasingly isolated trees this pattern would lead to lower outcrossing rates for pasture trees as well as lower genetic diversity and increased structure and spatial autocorrelation among their progeny results generally followed these expectations with the shortest pollen dispersal among continuous forest trees m moderate distances for fragment m and adjacent pasture m populations and distances of up to km in isolated pastures mean m variance around pollen dispersal estimates also increased with fragmentation suggesting altered pollination conditions outcrossing rates were lower for pasture trees and we found greater spatial autocorrelation and genetic structure among their progeny as well as a trend towards lower heterozygosity paternal reproductive dominance the pollen contributions from individual fathers did not vary among habitats but we did document asymmetric pollen flow between pasture and adjacent fragment populations we conclude that long distance pollen dispersal helps maintain gene flow for d panamensis in this fragmented landscape but pasture and isolated pasture populations are still at risk of long term genetic erosion,Molecular Ecology,pollen dispersal and genetic structure of the tropical tree dipteryx panamensis in a fragmented costa rican landscape
247,studies on the effects of tropical rainforest fragmentation and disturbance have often focussed on plants and vertebrates such as birds and mammals and seldom on invertebrates despite the latter being among the most biologically diverse groups in these ecosystems spiders are one such group of invertebrate predators that are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change in tropical ecosystems the present study assesses the spider community structure and responses to rainforest fragmentation and degra dation and conversion to shade coffee plantations in the anamalai hills southern western ghats india ten rainforest fragments ranging in size from ha to ha under varying levels of degradation within the indira gandhi wildlife sanctuary and private lands of the valparai plateau and two shade coffee plantation sites were sampled for spiders using visual searches along time constrained belt transects between january and may within a total sampled area of ha individual spiders detections belonging to morphospecies within families and functional groups were recorded the estimated total number of understorey spider species in the study area was ± sd species representing around of the total number of spider species so far described from india overall spider density species richness and species density showed no trend in relation to fragment area across all sites specific comparisons among undisturbed sites indicated however that high altitude sites had fewer species than mid altitude sites and fragments had fewer species than relatively larger continuous forest sites in contrast to the lack of trend in overall species richness and abundance species composition changed substantially in relation to habitat alteration and altitude cluster analysis of bray curtis similarities among sites in spider species composition revealed four distinct clusters high altitude undisturbed sites mid altitude disturbed sites with an undisturbed mid altitude site mid altitude highly disturbed sites with a disturbed site and shade coffee plantation sites spider species such as psechrus torvus and tylorida culta that contributed significantly to the dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed rainforest sites and rainforest and shade coffee sites were identified that serve as useful indicators of habitat alteration,Journal of Insect Conservation,effects of rainforest fragmentation and shade coffee plantations on spider communities in the western ghats india
248,as human population size increases demand for natural resources will increase logging pressure related to increasing demands continues to threaten remote areas of amazonian forest a harvest protocol is required to provide renewable timber resources that meet consumer needs while minimizing negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services reduced impact logging ril may be a viable option to achieve these goals effects of ril m ha and forest physiognomy were assessed for populations of bats from amazonian terra firme forest in brazil at  months postharvest based on meter hours of netting bats were captured representing species genera four families and five feeding ensembles five species one nectarivore and four frugivores responded to management in a consistent manner four were more abundant in logged forest and one was more abundant in undisturbed forest ten species one nectarivore two gleaning animalivores and seven frugivores responded to forest physiognomy in a consistent manner nine were more abundant in closed canopy sites and one was more abundant in gaps three species all frugivores exhibited idiosyncratic responses to management that were contingent on physiognomy using qualitative measures changes in status from common to rare or from present to absent ril elicited negative responses from species mostly rare taxa after accounting for differences in total number of collected individuals control forest harboured seven to more rare species than did forest subjected to ril synthesis and applications in the short term ril generally did not negatively affect populations of abundant bats in contrast reductions in abundance or local extirpation in response to ril generally characterized uncommon or rare species arrangement of ril sites in a matrix of undis turbed forest may allow sourcesink dynamics to mitigate effects of ril on rare or sensitive species and enhance sustainability at a regional scale,Journal of Applied Ecology,effects of reduced impact logging and forest physiognomy on bat populations of lowland amazonian forest
249,with intensifying demands for food and biofuels a critical threat to biodiversity is agricultural expansion into native tropical ecosystems tropical agriculture particularly intensive agriculture often supports few native organisms and consequently has been largely overlooked in conservation planning yet recent work in the neotropics demonstrates that tropical agriculture with certain features can support significant biodiversity decades after conversion to farmland it remains unknown whether this conservation value can be sustained for centuries to millennia here we quantify the bird diversity affiliated with agricultural systems in southwest india a region continuously cultivated for years we show that arecanut palm areca catechu production systems retain of the bird species associated with regional native forest two factors promote this high conservation value first the system involves intercropping with multiple usually woody understory species and thus has high vertical structural complexity that is positively correlated with bird species richness second the system encompasses nearby forests where large quantities of leaf litter are extracted for mulch the preservation of these forests on productive land traces back to their value in supplying inputs to arecanut cultivation the long term biodiversity value of an agricultural ecosystem has not been documented in south and southeast asia our findings open a new conservation opportunity for this imperiled region that may well extend to other crops some of these working lands may be able to sustain native species over long time scales indicating that conservation investments in agriculture today could pay off for people and for nature,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,sustaining biodiversity in ancient tropical countryside
250,the response of tropical fauna tol andscape level habitat change is poorly understood increased conversion of native primary forest to alternative land uses including secondary forest and exotic tree plantations highlights the importance of assessing diversity patterns within these forest types we sampled moths from species of arctiidae saturniidae and sphingidae over a total of trap nights sampling was conducted during the wet season using three light traps at sites within areas of primary forest secondary forest and eucalyptus urograndis plantations in northern brazilian amazonia the jari study region provides one of the best opportunities to investigate the ecological consequences of land use change and this study is one of the first to examine patterns of diversity for a neotropical moth assemblage in a human dominated landscape in lowland amazonia we found that the three moth families responded consistently to disturbance in terms of abundance and community structure but variably in terms of species richness in a manner apparently supporting a life history hypothesis our results suggest that secondary forests and eucalyptus plantations can support a substantial level of moth diversity but also show that these forest types hold assemblages with significantly distinct community structures and composition from primary forest in addition the ability of these converted land uses to support primary forest species may be enhanced by proximity to surrounding primary forest an issue which requires consideration when assessing the diversity and composition of mobile taxa in human dominated landscapes,Journal of Tropical Ecology,diversity and composition of amazonian moths in primary secondary and plantation forests
251,this study examines the effects of deforestation and the habitat value of coffee and regenerated forest for tropical dung beetles a functionally significant insect group pitfall trapping was conducted at sites in a montane region of central peru during april and november december of sites included primary and secondary forest shade coffee regenerated forest and open farms mainly with banana yuca and corn ordination techniques indicated that beetle assemblages in forests regenerated forest and coffee were relatively similar however assemblage compositions in forested areas differed even at similar altitudes under the influence of biogeographical factors and the assemblages at disturbed sites farms coffee were influenced by beetle dispersal from adjacent forests during dry months when beetle activity is low communities at all habitat types tended to converge because fewer unique species were recorded in forests at that time and habitat season generalists were dominant preliminary results also indicate that beetles in shady crops such as bananas responded to plant growth as the banana canopy closed in pro ducing more shade open habitat specialists retreated and forest shade specialists invaded the sites chronosequence data at two of the sites demonstrate the rapid and dramatic changes in species richness and assemblage composition caused by deforestation as forests become increasingly fragmented and open farms continue to expand dung beetles will become more restricted to the remaining fragments and reserves in the mosaic landscape studied here shade crops like coffee act as habitat and corridors for many dung beetle species small farm size and the consequent magnitude of edge effects likely contributed to beetle movement between habitat types and determined the apparent gen eralist nature of many of the dung beetle species in this study,Biodiversity and Conservation,invasion and retreat shifting assemblages of dung beetles amidst changing agricultural landscapes in central peru
252,many tropical forests have been converted for agri or silviculture or a combination of both agro forestry conservation at a landscape scale requires an understanding of the distribution and abundance of native biodiversity in these converted natural ecosystems of which the knowledge is especially poor for african agroecosystems we compared species density and species composition of four plant groups trees and shrubs epiphytic vascular plants mosses and liverworts among three arboreal land use types in southwest ern ethiopia montane rainforest fragments shade tree coffee home gardens and exotic tree plantations species density was significantly higher in forests than in coffee home gardens for all plant groups and in exotic tree plantations for all groups except mosses home gardens had more vascular epiphytic species than plantations whereas the reverse was true for mosses and liverworts the species composition of the forest plots was sometimes more similar to home garden plots than plantation plots and sometimes vice versa fifteen forest plots had however cumulatively more species than a random selection of nonforest coffee home garden and plantation plots even if the plot types complemented each other in terms of habitats for forest plants tree plantations dominated by eucalyptus had many small trees and shrubs in common with forests whereas plantations with cupressus were important substrates for forests mosses and liverworts our results illustrate the importance of undisturbed forests habitats for conservation of species at a landscape scale and that different human made land use types may complement each other in their capacity as additional habitats for forest species,Conservation Biology,complementary roles of home gardens and exotic tree plantations as alternative habitats for plants of the ethiopian montane rainforest
253,assessing the overall biological diversity of tropical rain forests is a seemingly insurmountable task for ecologists therefore researchers frequently sample selected taxa that they believe reflect general biodiversity patterns usually these studies focus on the congruence of a diversity the number of species found per sampling unit between taxa rather than on b diversity turnover of species assemblages between sampling units such approaches ignore the potential role of habitat heterogeneity that depending on the taxonomic group considered can greatly enhance b diversity at local and landscape scales we compared a and b diversity of four plant groups trees lianas terrestrial herbs epiphytic liverworts and eight animal groups birds butterflies lower canopy ants lower canopy beetles dung beetles bees wasps and the parasitoids of the latter two at sites in sulawesi indonesia that represented natural rain forest and three types of cacao agroforests differing in management intensity in total we recorded species patterns of species richness per study site varied strongly between taxonomic groups only  of the variance in species richness of one taxonomic group could be predicted from the species richness of another and on average  of the variance of b diversity of a given group was predicted by that in other groups although some taxon pairs had higher values up to for wasps and their parasitoids the degree of congruence of patterns of a diversity was not influenced by sampling completeness whereas the indicator value for b diversity improved when using a similarity index that accounts for incomplete sampling the indication potential of a diversity for b diversity and vice versa was limited within taxa  and virtually nil between them  we conclude that different taxa can have largely independent patterns of a diversity and that patterns of b diversity can be more congruent thus conservation plans on a landscape scale need to put more emphasis on the high heterogeneity of agroforests and the overarching role of b diversity shaping overall diversity patterns,Ecological Applications,alpha and beta diversity of plants and animals along a tropical land use gradient
254,we examined the effect of traditional swidden agriculture on biodiversity using the litter arthropod top predator the army ant aenictus hymenoptera formicidae as an indicator species in and around an intact tropical rain forest in sarawak borneo malaysia we compared the encounter rates with aenictus colonies among five forest types continuous primary forest isolated primary forest old secondary forest years elapsed after abandonment of the fields young secondary forest years after abandonment and new fallow years after abandonment by intensive area searching in and in total seven aenictus species colonies and six aenictus species colonies were encountered in and respectively the encounter rates were the highest in continuous and isolated primary forests intermediate in old and young secondary forests and the lowest in new fallow year and the interaction between year and forest type were not significant that is abundance of top predators which is rare and likely to be vulnerable to disturbance has never fully recovered even years after the termination of cultivation we discuss forest management strategies to sustain biological diversity,Biodiversity and Conservation,traditional land use associated with swidden agriculture changes encouter rates of the top predator the army ant in southeast asian tropical rain forests
255,vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central guyana using line transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced impact logging ril and three adjacent unlogged sites we censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy dwelling and terrestrial birds three primates one rodent and one tortoise two km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of km ril had ended within months and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of m ha equivalent to only trees ha three of the vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest ril sites two of which were negative large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to ril whereas smaller frugivores granivores folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites we are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species despite this species traits including dietary guild body mass home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses our findings suggest that responsible reduced impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation however our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates and detrimental effects such as hunting were low our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests,Forest Ecology & Management,vertebrate population responses to reduced impact logging in a neotropical forest
256,intensification or abandonment of agricultural land use has led to a severe decline of semi natural habitats across europe this can cause immediate loss of species but also time delayed extinctions known as the extinction debt in a pan european study of fragmented grassland remnants we found differences in the extinction debt of species from different trophic levels present day species richness of long lived vascular plant specialists was better explained by past than current landscape patterns indicating an extinction debt in contrast short lived butterfly specialists showed no evidence for an extinction debt at a time scale of c years our results indicate that management strategies maintaining the status quo of fragmented habitats are insufficient as timedelayed extinctions and associated co extinctions will lead to further biodiversity loss in the future,Ecology Letters,habitat fragmentation causes immediate and time delayed biodiversity loss at different trophic levels
257,community structure and species abundances may be strongly correlated to patterns of forest cover although such patterns are poorly known for tropical dry forest birds especially for those in panamanian dry forests birds were distance sampled during point counts in five dry forest fragments in panama distance from point count to forest edge and forest coverage at three spatial scales and m radius were compared as covariate predictors of the abundance of avian species and guilds each covariate was selected in at least two models of species or guild abundance abundance patterns were consistent with previously reported habitat associations for only two of seven open habitat or forest preferring species that showed forest cover abundance relationships null models best described the abundance of all forest species and the subset of uncommon forest species thus many of these species appear insensitive to the forest cover gradients studied total abundance of open habitat preferring species increased in dry forests with increasing forest coverage within m suggesting that the relationship between their abundance and vegetation structure are spatial scale and habitat dependent nectarivores had lower abundance as forest cover within m increased supporting previous claims that this group is tolerant of forest edges,Journal of Tropical Ecology,abundance of panamanian dry forest birds along gradients of forest cover at multiple scales
258,coffea arabica occurs naturally in the montane rainforests of ethiopia but large areas of these unique forests have been converted to other land uses in the remaining forest wild coffee is managed and harvested with increasing intensity because of rising coffee prices in the world market this study evaluated the impact of coffee management on wild coffee populations and the forest vegetation as a basis for conservation planning in southwestern ethiopia vegetation surveys and yield assessments were carried out in unmanaged natural forest and in managed semi forest coffee sfc systems analyses show that wild coffee density and coffee yields were low in natural forest max kg ha year in sfc systems of the canopy trees and most undergrowth vegetation were removed this stimulated wild coffee growth and strongly enhanced yields max kg ha year but severely disturbed forest structure species richness increased by because of an increase in species of ruderal and secondary vegetation however species richness and abundance of typical forest species declined conservation of the natural forest therefore requires the control of wild coffee management wild coffee certification is discussed as one tool to reconcile conservation measures and the interests of local farmers,African Journal of Ecology,wild coffee management and plant diversity in the montane rainforest of southwestern ethiopia
259,it is important to document changes in the population sizes of species to justify and implement conservation programmes this is often hampered by the absence of historical population count data particularly for tropical animal species here we developed a predictive habitat distribution model phdm for the army ant dorylus wilverthi a keystone species of central african rainforests we applied the model to forest cover data in western kenya from to in order to estimate changes in the distribution and population size over the last century the model was based on a large data set including abundance data of repeatedly monitored mtransects in forest and non forest habitats forest cover within m of the transect lines explained of the variation in abundance of d wilverthi the model predicts that the colony abundance of the army ant exponentially increases with increasing forest cover and that colonies are absent from landscapes with less than forest cover applying the phdmto historical and recent forest cover data predicts a decline in the population size of d wilverthi from to colonies between and under a worst case scenario in which the forest area is reduced to the current national nature reserves the population size would decrease to fewer than colonies which is probably too low to ensure the long term survival of the species synthesis and applications our study demonstrates that the application of a phdm on landcover change time series data may give valuable insights into changes in the population size of species for which no historical population count data are available using this approach we revealed a significant decline in population size of the army ant d wilverthi over the last century high protection status should be applied to all of the remaining forest area to prevent the population becoming regionally threatened and to facilitate long term conservation of this keystone species in kenya,Journal of Applied Ecology,deforestation and the population decline of the army ant dorylus wilverthi in western kenya over the last century
260,saproxylic beetle diversity is high at the cabaneros national park central spain where woodland habitats exhibit remarkable heterogeneity our aim was to explain the diversity of saproxylic beetles focusing on species turnover among mature woodland types we surveyed five woodland types that represented the heterogeneity of the parks woodland habitats beetles were collected using window traps over a period of months the jaccard similarity index was used as indirect value of beta diversity among woodlands and to test the relation between species turnover and geographical distance we also identified the contribution of species turnover to landscape diversity by using a partitioning model moreover the presence of mixed woodlands more than one tree species allowed us to attempt to valorise the effect of tree species coupled with their historical management on species turnover among woodlands finally we looked for different saproxylic beetle preferences for habitat and tree species using an indicator value method we found that saproxylic beetle species composition varied significantly among the studied woodlands the variation in species turnover was independent from the distance among woodlands which suggested that beetle dispersal abilities could not explain this high turnover tree species within woodlands were a key factor that increased diversity turnover in woodlands and consequently the diversity of the park moreover we found saproxylic beetle species that had different habitat and tree species preferences we conclude that woodland heterogeneity highly affected by woodland composition seems to be the driving force for saproxylic beetle diversity in this protected area,Biodiversity and Conservation,explaining the saproxylic beetle diversity of a protected mediterranean area
261,agricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to global biodiversity ecological functions and ecosystem services the rapid expansion of oil palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high biodiversity identifying management approaches that maintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a priority riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas primarily for their positive hydrological impact however they can also support a range of forest dependent species or ecosystem services we surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an oil palm dominated landscape in sabah malaysian borneo the species richness diversity and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm but lower than in adjacent logged forests the community composition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm despite the pronounced differences in biodiversity we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates among land uses we also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm these results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness and dung removal in tropical forests we found weak but significant positive relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity and between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance suggesting that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves synthesis and applications the similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil palm landscapes however the lack of correlation between dung beetle community characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research into spatial variation in biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships and how the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices,Ecology and Evolution,do riparian reserves support dung beetle biodiversity and ecosystem services in oil palm dominated tropical landscapes

263,agricultural intensification is responsible for the dramatic decline of farmland bird populations in the european union eu the joining of eight central and eastern european cee countries to the eu will re structure agriculture there one of the main threats is the intensification of farmland management can agri environmental programs balance the expected decline in bird assemblages of the cee countries if farming will be intensified we studied this question by comparing bird assemblages of extensively and intensively grazed paired fields in three regions of hungary alkali steppes and meadows in central hungary and alkali steppes in eastern hungary bird assemblages varied significantly across regions and grazing intensity intensively grazed sites showed a higher species number and diversity but lower densities than the extensive sites this is probably the consequence of higher landscape diversity of intensive sites which included farm buildings shelters wells and other structures several bird species mainly with european conservation concern showed contrasting responses to grazing intensity in the three regions including key grassland species black tailed godwit limosa limosa redshank tringa totanus skylark alauda arvensis and corn bunting emberiza calandra therefore threat and sensitivity to grassland characteristics are correlating although many of the declining species ofwestern europe are still abundant in hungarian grasslands our results project the threat of the expected intensification this study showed that it is not possible to provide a general grassland management scheme that will favour all bird species in all regions of hungary in the process of integrating to the eu and re structuring agriculture the establishment of scientifically sound schemes is urgent,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",effects of grazing intensity on bird assemblages and populations of hungarian grasslands
264,restoration ecologists are increasingly turning to the development of trait filter models which predict how evolved traits limit species membership within assemblages depending on existing abiotic or biotic constraints as a tool to explain how species move from a regional species pool into a restored community two often untested assumptions of these models however are that species traits can reliably predict species broadscale distribution and that the effects of traits on community membership do not vary between restored and remnant habitats the goals of this study were to determine whether combinations of ecological traits predispose moth species toward recolonization of restored prairies and to assess the degree to which restored prairies contain moth assemblages comparable with prairie remnants in we collected moth species from tallgrass prairie remnants and restorations in central iowa principal components analysis pca was used to identify significant combinations of ecological traits that were shared by groups of moth species logistic regression was then employed to test for significant effects of the trait combinations on the frequency of prairie sites occupied by moth species pca partitioned moth traits into four axes that explained a total of of the variance logistic regression detected significant effects for all four pca axes on the fraction of sites occupied by moths species frequently filtered from the regional species pool into prairies were those that had long flight periods and were multivoltine displayed a feeding preference for legumes but not other forb families and were regionally abundant but relatively small in body size ordination revealed significant differences in moth communities among prairies suggesting that species traits and habitat characteristics likely interact to create observed patterns of species recolonization of restorations thus the optimal approach to restoring the lepidopteran fauna of tallgrass prairies may involve locating prairie plantings adjacent to habitat remnants,Ecological Applications,species traits as predictors of lepidopteran composition in restored and remnant tallgrass prairies

285,with the rapid conversion of tropical forests in asia to plantation forests for timber or biofuel production there is a need to determine if these forests serve any viable role in wildlife conservation we used infrared trip cameras to survey for large terrestrial mammals within an acacia secondary forest matrix being created for pulpwood production in sarawak malaysia we detected at least species of mammals within the matrix and species were detected in both acacia and secondary forest using occupancy modeling to determine important covariates for seven mammal species within the project area six of these species were sensitive to forest type and most were sensitive to the amount of secondary forest within km of the sample point for four species sun bear helarctos melayanus common porcupine hystrix brachyura mousedeer tragulus spp and pig tailed macaque macaca nemestrina the mean distance of detection from large secondary forest blocks was significantly closer than expected from the distribution of sample points most species used acacia forest less frequently than secondary forest possibly for transit or foraging with the exception of bearded pigs sus barbatus sambar rucervus unicolor and civets which were more common in acacia stands the amount of secondary forest preserved within forest plantations seems to be the best measure of conservation potential for these industrial forests forest plantations can provide a conservation value if managed properly and those retaining significant amounts of secondary forest should be eligible for a base level of certification as they comprise a significant portion of the landscape in this region,Biological Conservation,the importance of secondary forest blocks for terrestrial mammals within an acacia secondary forest matrix in sarawak malaysia
286,the alarming rate of deforestation in madagascar is driving some endemic primates to extinction surprisingly anthropogenic habitat disturbance is not always deleterious the effect of disturbance on lemur abundance may be related to diet with frugivorous species more prone to population declines than folivores or insectivores to test the effects of disturbance on lemur abundance and group size we surveyed sites within contiguous forest at ranomafana national park lightly disturbed primary forest vato and heavily logged forest tala we quantified forest structure variables along survey routes and conducted diurnal and nocturnal lemur surveys canopy closure canopy height and understory visibility were greater in vato than in tala we encountered frugivorous lemurs eulemur rufifrons varecia variegata and folivore avahi peyrierasi significantly more frequently in vato than in tala whereas the opposite was true for the insectivorous microcebus rufus rates did not differ statistically for frugivore eulemur rubriventer and folivores propithecus edwardsi hapalemur griseus comparisons across the survey routes suggest that the abundance was heterogeneous within as well as between sites neither group size nor composition differed between sites encounter rates for varecia variegata were positively related to canopy closure and encounter rates for avahi peyrierasi were positively related to canopy height encounter rates for microcebus rufus were negatively related to canopy closure height and understory visibility similar to other studies the results suggest that some lemurs including folivores may cope with anthropogenic disturbance better than others including some frugivores lemur abundance is heterogeneous though even on small spatial scales,International Journal of Primatology,the effects of habitat disturbance on lemurs at ranomafana national park madagascar

288,grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread uses of the rangelands of australia there is limited information on the effects of grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of australia and the establishment of a long term grazing experiment in north eastern queensland at wambiana provided an opportunity to attempt an examination of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of themanipulation of stocking rates the aim was to identify what the relative effects of vegetation type stocking rate and other landscape scale environmental factors were on the patterns recorded sixteen ha siteswere establishedwithin three replicated treatments moderate heavy and variable stocking rates the sites were sampled in the wet and dry seasons in  t and again in  t all paddocks of the treatments were burnt in average annual rainfall declined markedly between the two sampling periods which made interpretation of the data difficult a total of species of vertebrate fauna comprising five amphibian bird reptile and mammal species were recorded there was strong separation in faunal composition from t to t although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between the grazing stocking rate treatments were less well defined therewas a relative change in abundance of bird fourmammal and five reptile species from t to t the generalised linear modelling identified that in the t data there was significant variation in the abundance of species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors this study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did change and that these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking rates the vegetation types on the sites surveyed the burning of the experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of the two surveys it is recommended that the experiment is sampled again but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa i e birds and reptiles to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling and replication of the data this would help to articulate more clearly the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of stocking rates compared with wider landscape environmental changes given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern australia any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should be taken for the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species,The Rangeland Journal,spatial and temporal effects of grazing management and rainfall on the vertebrate fauna of a tropical savanna
289,understanding the response of biodiversity to land use changes is an important challenge for ecologists we assessed the effects of five landscape metrics forest cover number of patches edge density mean inter patch isolation distance and matrix quality and three patch metrics patch size shape and isolation on the number of species and patch occupancy of medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in the fragmented lacandona rain forest mexico we sampled mammal assemblages in forest patches and four control areas within a continuous forest the landscape metrics were measured within a ha buffer and within a ha buffer from the centre of each sampling site a total of species from families was recorded the number of species increased with shape complexity and patch size at the patch scale and with matrix quality within ha landscapes when considering ha landscapes only the number of patches i e forest fragmentation level tended to have a negative influence at the community level different landscape and patch metrics predicted the occurrence of each species within the sites our results indicate that there is a gradient of tolerance to forest cover change from highly sensitive species to those tolerant of or even benefited by forest cover change,Tropical Ecology,landscape and patch attributes impacting medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in a fragmented rain forest
290,the main objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between population densities of the white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus and certain habitat and human characteristics in the tropical dry forest of the tehuacan cuicatlan biosphere reserve tcbr mexico to estimate population density and characterize the habitat we established strip transects x m at four different locations in the tcbr from may to june during the dry season of principal component analyses were used to order the transects using habitat human impact variables and tree species composition estimated average density was deer km ranging from to deer km the variables associated with white tailed deer density were basal area distance to roads distance to the area with largest human population slope aspect and presence of cattle the principal plant species were zapotillo lantana camara chintoborrego vallesia glabra nanche bunchosia biocellata cuachalalate amphipterigyum adstringens and cuajiote amarillo bursera aptera compared to other tropical dry forests estimated white tailed deer densities in the tcbr were lower we discuss the possible effect of these variables on deer density and suggest management actions,Tropical Conservation Science,habitat and human factors associated with white tailed deer density in the tropical dry forest of tehuacan cuicatlan biosphere reserve mexico
291,changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in terrestrial systems are being driven by the synergistic interactions between the loss of native vegetation and land use intensification disentangling the influence of these two processes on species persistence is an important step towards reconciling conservation and agriculture production we investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect the conservation value of cacao agroforests for mammals in an atlantic forest landscape in southern bahia the most extensive area of diverse shaded cacao plantations in brazil although both factors affected the distribution of mammal species management intensification had a stronger effect negatively affecting a larger number of species frequency of domestic dogs an indirect aspect of management intensification negatively affected four species and lower connectivity of shading trees decreased the use of cacao agroforests by three species of conservation concern in comparison the reduced forest cover negatively affected two species of conservation concern our results suggest that controlling domestic dog populations is particularly valuable for large mammal conservation in agroforestry mosaics since it does not affect crop productivity improving shade cover within agroforests on the other hand should be implemented carefully maintaining acceptable yield while promoting canopy connectivity and the recruitment of tree species used by forest dependent mammals however the importance of both local management intensification and local forest cover are likely to be context dependent and changes in their relative importance are likely to occur with different levels of deforestation at the landscape scale,Biological Conservation,forest loss or management intensification identifying causes of mammal decline in cacao agroforests

293,to elucidate effects of fragmentation and degradation of tropical rainforest on negros island philippines on tropical herpetofauna nine tropical rainforest fragments eight limestone and one non limestone ranging in area from five to ha total area ha in south western negros were surveyed using cruising and quadrat sampling methods between december and october a ha limestone plantation forest served as a reference site ten to fifteen of the total species expected in the nine forest fragments taken as a whole had been lost in the previous years these species are known to occur in the tropical rainforest on cuernos de negros and environs in south eastern negros island at altitudes m above sea level the factors responsible for the loss of these species appear to be removal of large trees which decreases canopy cover causing physical changes and forest fragmentation which increases the edge areas however it is not possible to separate the effects of each of these two factors the main factor that was correlated with the number of species in the limestone forest fragments appeared to be area two species of frogs appeared to be represented by relatively moderate population densities the negros cave frog platymantis spelaeus and the common forest frog platymantis dorsalis the burrowing skink brachymeles boulengeri taylori also exhibited a relatively higher density than the other burrowing species of skinks the other herpetofaunal species exhibited low population densities,Environmental Conservation,amphibians and reptiles in tropical rainforest fragments on negros island the philippines
294,forested landscapes in southeast asia are becoming increasingly fragmented making this region a conservation and research priority despite its importance few empirical studies of effects of fragmentation on biodiversity have been undertaken in the region limiting our ability to inform land use regimes at a time of increased pressure on forests we estimated the biodiversity value of forest fragments in peninsular malaysia by studying fragmentation impacts on insectivorous bat species that vary in dependence of forest we sampled bats at seven continuous forest sites and forest fragments and tested the influence of fragment isolation and area on the abundance species richness diversity composition and nestedness of assemblages and the abundance of the ten most common species overall isolation was a poor predictor of these variables conversely forest area was positively related with abundance and species richness of cavity foliage roosting bats but not for that of cave roosting or edge open space foraging species the smallest of fragments ha were more variable in species composition than larger fragments or continuous forest and larger fragments retained substantial bat diversity comparable to continuous forest some fragments exhibited higher bat abundance and species richness than continuous forest though declines might occur in the future because of time lags in the manifestation of fragmentation effects our findings suggest that fragments ha contribute substantially to landscape level bat diversity and that small fragments also have some value however large tracts are needed to support rare forest specialist species and should be the conservation priority in landscape level planning species that roost in tree cavities or foliage may be more vulnerable to habitat fragmentation than those that roost in caves,Biological Conservation,conservation value of forest fragments to palaeotropical bats
295,nested species subsets are a common pattern of community assembly characteristic of many types of fragmented landscapes and insular systems here we describe nested subset patterns of amphibian and reptile occupancy on forest islands in north eastern bolivia we used observed occupancy patterns to differentiate five distributional guilds widespread species rare species poor colonizers area sensitive species and supertramps amphibian occurrences were nested along a forest island isolation gradient and when species from each of the distribution classes were removed from subsequent analyses of nestedness we found that dispersal limited poor colonizers were responsible for the association between nestedness and isolation amphibians associated with the grassland matrix at the study site showed a nested pattern linked with area although this pattern did not scale up to all amphibians and could not be unequivocally attributed to any of the distributional guilds we recognized there were no strong associations between two biological characteristics body size and relative abundance in the matrix and the likelihood of occupancy along either forest island area or isolation gradients the relative importance of isolation in shaping nested patterns of amphibians on these forest islands may be a result of either the greater range in isolation values included in this study compared with many others the long time since isolation in this landscape manifesting a footprint of isolation not apparent in more recently fragmented patches the relatively homogeneous grassland matrix surrounding forest islands that likely provides little refuge for animals moving among forest islands,Animal Conservation,nested species subsets of amphibians and reptiles on neotropical forest islands
296,mammal abundance richness and community structure were examined in fragments of savannah and in gallery forests of south western brazil in order to assess the influence of fragment size and habitat on the communities five savannah fragments and two gallery forests were sampled within the savannah fragments environmental parameters such as tree and shrub densities were measured live traps and pitfalls were used for trapping small mammals larger mammals were recorded from footprints and sightings seventeen species of small mammal and species of large mammal were recorded small mammals were affected by fragment size and isolation whereas larger mammals were not communities of small mammals were better structured in the largest fragments and those in smaller fragments were subsets of the communities in larger fragments gallery forests revealed a rather different assemblage of mammals but also contained species common to both gallery and large savannah remnants data are discussed relating mammal community structure to area size and vegetation structure in an attempt to understand the present conservation status of this fragmented landscape,Journal of Natural History,mammals in a fragmented savannah landscape in south western brazil
297,deforestation in the peruvian pre montane forests has increased alarmingly in recent years particularly fragmentation in these forests takes place against a background of very extensive continuous forest until now no studies have detailed how peruvian small mammals responded to forest fragmentation in this paper we report the results of an assessment of nonvolant small mammal fauna in forest remnants one large fragment and one small fragment and cattle pasture in a disturbed landscape at pozuzo formerly a pre montane tropical forest in central peru in each forest remnant we quantify habitat parameters and identified small mammals to know if there is a relationship between forest remnant size or microhabitat structure and small mammal assemblages in addition we investigated the influence of habitat structure on the presence of small mammal species we did not find any evidence that habitat structure in large fragment was greater than small fragment actually both forest remnants presented habitat features typical of forests subject to higher levels of disturbance we found that abundance of small trees cm dbh was positively associated with the presence of marmosops noctivagus but negatively with the presence of oecomys bicolor likewise the presence of the arboreal rhipidomys leucodactylus was associated with the abundance of larger trees dbh cm we recorded small mammal species in large fragment in small fragment and in cattle pasture no significant differences were found in species richness between both fragments but marsupial abundance in the small fragment was greater than large fragment at pozuzo we recorded species restricted to forest habitat and to forest and cattle pastures however it is necessary to assess more fragments to improve our knowledge about species survival in this landscape,Mammalian Biology,small mammal assemblages in a disturbed tropical landscape at pozuzo peru
298,there are few empirical data particularly collected simultaneously from multiple sites on extinctions resulting from human driven land use change southeast asia has the highest deforestation rate in the world but the resulting losses of biological diversity remain poorly documented between november and march we conducted bird surveys on six landbridge islands in malaysia and indonesia these islands were surveyed previously for birds in the early s when they were extensively forested our bird inventories of the islands were nearly complete as indicated by sampling saturation curves and nonparametric true richness estimators from zero pulau malawali and pulau mantanani to pulau bintan diurnal resident landbird species were apparently extirpated since the early s adding comparable but published extinction data from singapore to our regression analyses we found there were proportionally fewer forest bird extinctions in areas with greater remaining forest cover nevertheless the statistical evidence to support this relationship was weak owing to our unavoidably small sample size bird species that are restricted to the indomalayan region lay few eggs are heavier and occupy a narrower habitat breadth were most vulnerable to extinction on pulau bintan this was the only island where sufficient data existed to analyze the correlates of extinction forest preservation and restoration are needed on these islands to conserve the remaining forest avifauna our study of landbridge islands indicates that deforestation may increasingly threaten southeast asian biodiversity,Conservation Biology,deforestation and avian extinction on tropical landbridge islands

302,limestone karst outcrops in southeast asia are rich in land snails certain groups of land snails in particular prosobranchia species are restricted to limestone and show a high degree of short range endemism karst habitats are however seriously degraded by quarrying logging agriculture and burning the effect of these disturbances on land snail fauna is unknown so we studied paired primary and secondary forest localities on six separate limestone hills in sabah malaysian borneo land snails were sampled with a standard protocol and identified to species level more than individuals belonging to species were recorded in most sites snail diversities did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed plots however pulmonate snails were significantly more abundant at disturbed localities than prosobranch snails whereas abundances for both groups were similar at undisturbed sites because prosobranchia contain many siteendemic species our findings suggest that continued exposure to these disturbances will eventually lead to extinctions in this group,Conservation Biology,effects of karst forest degradation on pulmonate and prosobranch land snail communities in sabah malaysian borneo
303,aim this paper has two objectives first we examine how a variety of biotic abiotic and anthropogenic factors influence the endemic and introduced arthropod richness on an oceanic island second we look at the relationship between the endemic and introduced arthropod richness to ask whether areas with high levels of endemic species richness deter invasions location the work was carried out on a young volcanic island terceira in the azores methods we used standard techniques to collect data on arthropod species richness environmental data were obtained from the cielo climatic model and using gis the explanatory value of environmental variables on a small scale gradient of endemic and exotic arthropod species richness was examined with generalized linear models glms in addition the impact of both endemic and exotic species richness in the communities was assessed by entering them after the environmental variable s to see if they contributed significantly to the final model the hierarchical method results abiotic climatic and geomorphological variables gave a better explanation of the variation in endemic species richness whereas anthropogenic variables explained most of the variation in introduced species richness furthermore after accounting for all environmental variables part of the unexplained variance in the endemic species richness is explained by the introduced species richness and vice versa that is areas with high levels of endemic species richness had many introduced species there is evidence of a somewhat inverse spatial distribution between a group of oceanic type forestdwelling endemic relict arthropods and a group of more generalist endemic arthropods that are able to survive in disturbed marginal sites particularly rich in non indigenous species main conclusions richness of endemic species is mainly driven by abiotic factors such as a climatic axis oceanic type localities with lower temperatures and summer precipitations and a binary variable cald location of sites in caldeiras or ravines whereas richness of introduced species depends on disturbance related factors however after factoring out these major influences there is a correlation between endemic and introduced richness suggesting that  independent of the environmental and geographical factors that affect the distribution of endemic or introduced species  the richest endemic assemblages are more prone to invasion due probably to a facilitation process inconclusive evidence suggests that non indigenous species are limited to those sites unde anthropogenic influence located mainly near forest edges but the rate of expansion of those species to high altitude core pristine sites has still to be tested,Journal of Biogeography,invasibility and species richness of island endemic arthropods a general model of endemic vs exotic species

305,old growth forests are ecologically relevant reservoirs of biodiversity and provide valuable and unique ecosystem functions in the landscape however what constitutes an old growth stand is confusing because the definition depends largely on the forest type under study despite the ecological importance of old growth temperate rainforests in southern chile in comparison to other global forests no attempts have been made to characterize them as a way to assess their structural variability here we characterized old growth stands of valdivian and north patagonian rain forest types located in chiloe´ island chile s using inventory data from permanent plots ha each located in rural landscapes and protected areas of northern chiloe´ island for each stand its age average age of the oldest trees present in each stand and disturbance regimes evidence of recent human impact e g cuttings or fires and tree growth rates were used as defining old growth criteria we characterized the structure tree species richness size density distributions vertical stratification and presence of snags and floristic composition of each stand environmental variables i e temperature distance to coastline and elevation were related to stand structure using multivariate constrained correspondence analysis old growth forests were commonly characterized by a tree basal areas m ha b density of shade tolerant tree species in the emergent and dominant canopy layer c higher tree species richness tree species than successional stands d presence of large canopy emergents cm dbh m tall e high vertical heterogeneity and f minimum stand ages older than years old growth forests showed a distinctive structural variability and floristic diversity influenced both by stand age and disturbance history of the stands structural variability was also related to environmental differences among sites e g air temperature distance to coastline soil types oldgrowth forest features described here can offer a baseline for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old growth forest structure in southern temperate rain forests,Forest Ecology & Management,structural and environmental characterization of old growth temperate rainforests of northern chiloe island chile regional and global relevance
306,as human population continues to increase and intensification of human land use escalates it is important to address the role of urban forest patches in supporting bird communities we related bird species richness and community assemblage to landscape and patch level factors in forest patches in the densely populated metropolitan area of san juan puerto rico in total bird species were observed including resident endemic migratory and introduced species patch size level of urbanization in the surrounding matrix and vertical heterogeneity of forest patches were the most important variables in explaining species richness patch size had the highest predictive power in explaining species richness for all groups except migrants which were best predicted by patch level factors vegetation heterogeneity the degree of matrix urbanization was correlated negatively with endemic species richness but positively with introduced species endemic species were particularly sensitive to landscape factors patch size matrix urbanization and canopy texture introduced species richness was not dependent on any patch level factors eight species were relatively unaffected by urbanization whereas two species were only found in large forest patches and two species were sensitive to urban development seven species demonstrated a preference for small patches recommendations for land managers and conservation agencies to maintain a high bird species richness and diversity include preserve both large and small forest patches limit urban development near forest patches manage forest patch structure to maintain vertical heterogeneity and maintain forest patches with different vegetation types,Biological Conservation,landscape and patch level factors influence bird communities in an urbanized tropical island
307,the residual effects of logging on forest fauna and flora have been well studied in other regions of the world with many investigations finding that recovery of species richness and abundance can occur within one or two decades after the logging event in this study we use ant assemblages to compare logged years and unlogged mixed dipterocarp forest in the sinharaja forest reserve a world heritage site in sri lanka species richness and abundance were higher in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest but not significantly so species assemblages on the other hand were significantly different and were associated with different environmental variables in the logged and unlogged forest the findings from this study corroborate other studies that have shown that species composition in logged forest does not appear to return to unlogged forest composition even after three to six decades have passed since this study was not a before and after comparison it is difficult to confirm whether the differences arise from the residual effects of logging or from the general patchiness of species distribution in tropical forest however the cumulative results do suggest that there is a residual effect of logging on ant species composition in this forest even after more than years of regeneration,Forest Ecology & Management,investigating residual effects of selective logging on ant species assemblages in sinharaja forest reserve sri lanka
308,the diversity and the feeding guilds of birds in three different habitats secondary forest oil palm plantation and paddy field were investigated in riparian areas of the kerian river basin perak malaysia point count observation and mist netting methods were used to determine bird diversity and abundance a total of species of birds from families were recorded in the three habitats species diversity measured by shannons diversity index was and in the secondary forest the paddy field and the oil palm plantation respectively the vegetation diversity and the habitat structure were important determinants of the number of bird species occurring in an area the relative abundance of the insectivore insectivore frugivore and frugivore guilds was greater in the forest than in the monoculture plantation in contrast the relative abundance of the carnivore granivore and omnivore guilds was higher in the plantation the results of the study show that the conversion of forest to either oil palm plantation or paddy fields produced a decline in bird diversity and changes in the distribution of bird feeding guilds,Tropical Life Sciences Research,avian diversity and feeding guilds in a secondary forest an oil palm plantation and a paddy field in riparian areas of the kerian river basin perak malaysia

316,eufriesea violacea blanchard is a very seasonal euglossine species more frequently found in the southern and southeastern regions of brazil a number of studies have revealed large variations in the abundance of males of this species present in atlantic forest remnants throughout both regions in this paper we report variations in the abundance of e violacea males sampled in several forest patches of different sizes ranging from to ha and we propose that this species is possibly sensitive to the reduction in size of forest remnants surveys were carried out in nine forest remnants of atlantic rainforest located in northern paraná state southern brazil male euglossine bees were collected with an entomological net when visiting scent baits between am and pm from october to december of and a total of e violacea males were captured in the nine forest fragments studied the number of bees attracted to scent baits in each forest patch varied from zero to a very high association r was detected between the forest patch size and the visitation rate of e violacea males at different sites with the highest mean number of males visiting baits sampling being observed for bees from the largest forest remnant although alternative hypothesis should not be discharged for the decline in the abundance or absence of e violacea in small forest patches our results indicate that populations of this euglossine species need larger forest areas for existing,Neotropical Entomology,eufriesea violacea blanchard hymenoptera apidae an orchid bee apparently sensitive to size reduction in forest patches
317,natural small xeric hill prairies in forested landscapes throughout the midwest united states often contain high diversity and unique species of some organisms because of their unusual landscape context and microclimate we measured the diversity richness and abundance of the bee communities of five hill prairies located in northeastern iowa and we compared these to values for large prairie preserves in northwestern iowa using a monte carlo resampling approach to standardize sampling effort between habitat types we also measured the diversity and richness of the flowering forb communities at the hill prairies and we quantified percentage of the landscape at a km radius in different landscape elements bee diversity at the five hill prairies spanned the range of diversity values for large prairies preserves so although the hill prairies are small  ha their bee communities are not uniformly depauparate compared to larger western prairie preserves bee diversity was significantly related to flowering forb diversity and may have been influenced by landscape features within kmparticularly the percentage of agricultural row crops and open water which may negatively affect bee diversity at the sites iowas hill prairie bee communities were largely composed of widespread eastern species although about of the bee species have more northern or western ranges and appear to be taking advantage of the regions unique habitat features given the dependence of the bee communities on the plant diversity of the sites management of the plant community to maintain its diversity will also likely benefit bee diversity,Biological Conservation,bee communities hymenoptera apoidea of small iowa hill prairies are as diverse and rich as those of large prairie preserves
318,though it is undoubted that tropical bees are influenced by habitat composition few studies have investigated the relative importance of both local and landscape level habitat parameters in supporting large and diverse bee communities the conservation of native bee communities within agroforestry landscapes is particularly urgent given the importance of pollination services within these systems in this study we examined tropical bee communities within a largely deforested shade coffee growing region in chiapas mexico we used regression tree modeling to examine the response of bee functional groups to local and landscape level habitat management our models revealed that the most predictive factors for bee abundance and species richness were the number of tree species the number of tree species in flower and the canopy cover of the local agroforestry landscape solitary bees were most abundant in habitats with high canopy cover while social bees were most abundant in habitats with greater tree species richness cavity nesting and wood nesting bee abundance was positively affected by the amount of canopy cover in the farm while ground nesting bees were most abundant in habitats with a large number of tree species in flower our results demonstrate that across bee sociality groups nesting guilds and tribes the most critical factor impacting native bee communities was within farm local vegetation management these results reveal the important role that agroforestry managers can have on biodiversity conservation and the potential contribution they can make by creating resource rich agricultural matrices specifically our findings highlight the importance of diverse overstory tree management in supporting native bee communities within tropical agroforestry systems,Biological Conservation,impacts of coffee agroforestry management on tropical bee communities
319,the effect of habitat fragmentation on the structure of orchid bee communities was analyzed by the investigation of the existence of a spatial structure in the richness and abundance of euglossini species and by determining the relationship between these data and environmental factors the surveys were carried out in four different forest fragments and one university campus richness abundance and diversity of species were analyzed in relation to abiotic size of the area extent of the perimeter perimeter area ratio and shape index and biotic characteristics vegetation index of the fragment and of the matrix of each of the locations studied we observed a highly significant positive correlation between the diversity index and the vegetation index of the fragment landscape and shape index our analysis demonstrated that the observed variation could be explained mainly by the vegetation index and the size of the fragment variations in relative abundance showed a tendency toward an aggregated spatial distribution between the fragments studied as well as between the sampling stations within the same habitat demonstrating the existence of a spatial structure on a small scale in the populations of euglossini this distribution will determine the composition of species that coexist in the area after fragmentation these data help in understanding the differences and similarities in the structure of communities of euglossini resulting from forest fragmentation,Neotropical Entomology,habitat fragmentation effects on the orchid bee communities in remnant forests of southeastern brazil
320,retention of habitat fragments within the urban matrix can provide critical resources for the maintenance of regional biodiversity while still providing socio economic value euglossini bees are important components in a community as they are important pollinators for economically valuable plants as well as hundreds of orchid species however some species are very sensitive to environmental impacts like urbanization this study presents the role of antique urban fragments in a historical city in brazil and compares it with a conservation area on the aspects of orchid bee assemblage such as richness composition and abundance four fragments inside the city of ouro preto and three inside parque estadual do itacolomi peit were sampled for euglossini bees sorensen similarity index was used to compare community composition the mantel test was applied to verify the hypothesis that an urban center is a barrier for the mobility of the individuals fourteen euglossini species from the region were registered close to of the sampled bees were collected from the peit sampling areas the fragments presented differences in euglossini richness and abundance a majority of the sampled fragments were dominated by the eulaema cingulata fabricius eulaema nigrita lepeletier and euglossa securigera dressler species we found differences on community composition between the fragments localized in peit and those located in the urban center the data suggest that there is a possible flux of individuals between the sampled fragments the various small forest fragments in ouro preto primarily in backyards may also serve as stepping stones between sampled fragments,"Ecology, Behaviour and Bionomics",old fragments of forest inside an urban area are able to keep orchid bee hymenoptera apidae euglossini assemblages the case of a brazilian historical city
321,mountain forest ecosystems in the andes are threatened by deforestation increasing fire frequencies lead to fire degraded habitats that are often characterized by a persistent fern dominated vegetation little is known about the consequences of these drastic changes in habitat conditions for pollinator communities in a rapid diversity assessment we collected individuals of two major groups of insect pollinators bees and butterflies moths with pan traps and compared pollinator diversities in a spatial block design between forest interior forest edge and adjacent fire degraded habitats at eight sites in the bolivian andes we found that bee species richness and abundance were significantly higher in fire degraded habitats than in forest habitats whereas species richness and abundance of butterflies moths increased towards the forests interior species turnover between forest and fire degraded habitats was very high for both pollinator groups and was reflected by an increase in the body size of bee species and a decrease in the body size of butterfly moth species in fire degraded habitats we conclude that deforestation by frequent fires has profound impacts on the diversity and composition of pollinator communities our tentative findings suggest shifts towards bee dominated pollinator communities in fire degraded habitats that may have important feedbacks on the regenerating communities of insect pollinated plant species,Diversity,human induced disturbance alters pollinator communities in tropical mountain forests
322,many temperate deciduous forests are recovering from past logging but the effects of logging legacies and environmental gradients on forest insect pollinators have not been well studied in this study we asked how pollinator abundance and community composition varied with distance from logging roads and elevation in old logged years ago and young logged  years ago southern appalachian forests insect pollinators were sampled at previously logged sites along an elevation gradient at distances from logging roads during summer and spring using pan traps in summer many pollinator groups were more abundant in younger forests and closer to logging roads likely due in part to more light availability and a greater abundance of floral resources near roads total bee abundance was greater near logging roads but only in younger forests suggesting that the role of roads in providing nectar and other resources may diminish as forests mature in spring many pollinator families were less abundant at mid distances  m from roads compared to road edges m but abundances were generally the same at m from the road as at road edges two important bee families apidae and andrenidae were strongly associated with high elevations in spring our results suggest that logging legacies may provide supplemental resources such as food and nesting sites to insect pollinators during the summer months especially with the effects of roads often extending at least m into young forests,Southeastern Naturalist,logging legacies affect insect pollinator communities in southern appalachian forests
323,pollinator plant relationships are found to be particularly vulnerable to land use change yet despite extensive research in agricultural and natural systems less attention has focused on these interactions in neighboring urban areas and its impact on pollination services we investigated pollinator plant interactions in a peri urban landscape on the outskirts of the san francisco bay area california where urban agricultural and natural land use types interface we made standardized observations of floral visitation and measured seed set of yellow starthistle centaurea solstitialis a common grassland invasive to test the hypotheses that increasing urbanization decreases rates of bee visitation viable seed set and the efficiency of pollination relationship between bee visitation and seed set we unexpectedly found that bee visitation was highest in urban and agricultural land use contexts but in contrast seed set rates in these human altered landscapes were lower than in natural sites an explanation for the discrepancy between floral visitation and seed set is that higher plant diversity in urban and agricultural areas as a result of more introduced species decreases pollinator efficiency if these patterns are consistent across other plant species the novel plant communities created in these managed landscapes and the generalist bee species that are favored by human altered environments will reduce pollination services,PLoSONE,pollinator interactions with yellow starthistle centaurea solstitialis across urban agricultural and natural landscapes
324,bees and other insects provide pollination services that are key to determining the fruit set on coffee plantations these pollination services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors both social and economic to better understand these different factors we assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in santander colombia we quantified the effect of key ecological drivers on pollinator community composition such as the method of farm management either conventional or organic and the surrounding landscape composition specifically the proximity to forest we found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the local pollinator fauna open pollination accounted for a ± increase in final coffee fruit set and that the various pollinators are affected differently by the differing factors for example our findings indicate that conventional farm management using synthetic inputs can promote pollinators especially if they are in close proximity to natural forest fragments this is particularly true for stingless bees honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the conventional management of farms factors associated with greater numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover lower tree densities smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom and younger coffee plantations a forested landscape close to farms appears to enhance these factors giving increased stability and resilience to the pollinating bees and insects however we found that organic farms also support diverse pollinator communities even if distant from forest fragments the contribution of honeybees to pollination value us ha of coffee is greater than that of stingless bees us ha of coffee since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers and types of pollinators attracted to farms we have analysed the statistically significant social factors that influence farmers decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices these include the availability of technology the type of landowner whether married couples or individual owners the number of years of farmers formal education the role of institutions membership of community organizations farm size coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm it is hoped that the use of our holistic approach which combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers of pollination will help provide evidence to underpin the development of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into sustainable agricultural practices,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",ecological and social drivers of coffee pollination in santander colombia
325,successful conservation of pollination services depends upon an understanding of the processes that influence pollinator diversity within the landscape as well as the relationship between pollinator community composition and the provision of services in this study the influence of landscape simplification on the composition of pollinator communities and the provisioning of pollination services to cultivated strawberry was evaluated fragaria xananassa additionally the relative pollination efficiency for the five most common bee genera visiting strawberry flowers was measured pollinators were collected during bloom with pan traps on commercial farms all growing the same strawberry variety in the finger lakes region ny usa the farms were chosen to represent a gradient in the proportion of agricultural land uses in the surrounding landscape from to landscapes with greater proportions of agricultural area had lower pollinator abundances and species richness while yield was positively correlated with pollinator abundance species richness had little effect on the level of pollination services this conclusion was supported by the finding that visitor identity did not explain pollination efficiency in strawberry our results show that a high proportion of agricultural land in the landscape negatively impacts wild pollinators and pollination services to strawberry,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",landscape simplification decreases wild bee population services to strawberry

327,land use change frequently reduces local species diversity species losses will often result in loss of trait diversity with likely consequences for community functioning however the converse need not be generally true management approaches that succeed in retaining species richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity we evaluated this possibility using bee communities in a california agroecosystem we examined among site patterns in bee species diversity and functional trait diversity in a landscape composed of a mosaic of semi natural habitat organic farms and conventional farms we sampled bees from all three habitat types and compiled a data base of life history functional traits for each species although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms functional diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat nesting location below ground vs above ground was the primary trait contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and natural habitat reflecting observed differences in availability of nesting substrates among habitat types other traits including phenology and sociality were also associated with species occurrences or dominance in particular site types these patterns suggest that management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee communities synthesis and applications although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species rich bee communities components of bee functional diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes regardless of farming practice maintenance of natural habitat and or the addition of natural habitat elements to farms is therefore important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems,Journal of Applied Ecology,contrasting patterns in species and functional trait diversity of bees in an agricultural landscape
328,agriculture now constitutes  of terrestrial land use globally by enhancing habitat suitability and connectivity restoration within agricultural landscapes could have a major influence on biodiversity conservation however habitat management within intensive agricultural landscapes may primarily boost abundances of common highly mobile generalists rather than vulnerable or endangered species we studied pollinator community response to small scale habitat restoration in the intensively farmed central valley of california to determine whether restoration could also promote more specialized less common and or less mobile species composition of pollinator communities was assessed in five experimental and control unrestored sites before and after restoration of native plant hedgerows over an year period using a before after control impact design we characterized bee and fly species based on functional response traits floral specialization habitat specialization abundance body size and sociality bees only known to influence the response to habitat change we modelled how species occurrences changed with habitat restoration over time as modulated by their response traits we found that hedgerows not only significantly enhanced occurrences of native bee and syrphid fly species but that as hedgerows matured they had a greater positive effect on species that were more specialized in floral and nesting resources and smaller less mobile synthesis and applications unlike previous studies that suggest habitat restoration in agricultural landscapes only benefits mobile generalist species our results suggest that small scale habitat restoration can promote species whose traits likely render them particularly vulnerable to habitat degradation thus even within highly intensive agricultural landscapes small scale habitat restoration can be a conservation management tool however tailoring habitat enhancements to promote certain species or guilds may be critical for their success as a conservation intervention in agricultural landscapes,Journal of Applied Ecology,small scale restoration in intensive agricultural landscapes supports more specialized and less mobile pollinator species
329,urbanization and agricultural intensification of landscapes are important drivers of global change which in turn have direct impacts on local ecological communities leading to shifts in species distributions and interactions here we illustrate how human altered landscapes with novel ornamental and crop plant communities result not only in changes to local community diversity of floral dependent species but also in shifts in seasonal abundance of bee pollinators three years of data on the spatio temporal distributions of bee species show that seasonal patterns of abundance and species richness in human altered landscapes varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in which floral resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months these findings demonstrate that anthropogenic environmental changes in urban and agricultural systems here mediated through changes in plant resources and water inputs can alter the temporal dynamics of pollinators that depend on them changes in phenology of interactions can be an important though frequently overlooked mechanism of global change,Global Change Biology,temporal dynamics influenced by global change bee community phenology in urban agricultural and natural landscapes

337,recent changes in agriculture intensification or abandonment have resulted in a critical reduction of semi natural grasslands in eastern europe subalpine semi natural grasslands in transylvania romania harbour a high diversity of plants and invertebrates including endemics and are considered refugia for numerous threatened open land species we investigated effects of land abandonment by examining species richness species abundance proportion of open land endemic and threatened vascular plants gastropods and diurnal and nocturnal lepidoptera in extensive hay meadows initial stage and three seral stages of succession early stage of abandoned hay meadow naturally growing birch forest and mature forest in the mountainous region of baisoara in transylvania a total of species vascular plants gastropods diurnal and nocturnal lepidoptera were found in the study sites four replicates per successional stage the four taxonomic groups differed in their response to the abandonment of hay meadows each stage of succession harboured the maximum species richness for one taxonomic group extensive hay meadows for vascular plants abandoned hay meadows for diurnal lepidoptera birch forests for nocturnal lepidoptera and mature forests for gastropods in all four taxonomic groups the complementarity of species composition increased with successional age whereas the number of characteristic open land species decreased with successional age the four successional stages did not differ in proportion of red listed plant and diurnal lepidoptera species in nocturnal lepidoptera however the proportion of red listed species increased with successional age furthermore successional stages did not differ in number of plant species endemic to the carpathians and eastern europe our results indicate the high conservation value of all stages of subalpine grassland succession for the indigenous biodiversity of transylvania to prevent losses of characteristic species we suggest a rotational grassland management program that maintains different successional stages,Biological Conservation,effects of abandonment of subalpine hay meadows on plant and invertebrate diversity in transylvania romania
338,the paper deals with the long term development years of oribatid communities acari during grassland succession following the conversion of arable fields the study was carried out on a chronosequence of temperate grassland sites in the lahn dill bergland central hesse germany the space for time substitution method was applied increasing abundance at early stages of the conversion process until the age of  years points to release from the stress exerted by arable management saturation of abundance and richness indicates strong limiting forces acting upon the oribatid community at intermediate and late stages of succession the continuous increase in the dominance of surface dwelling and non specialized species suggests a considerable change in the nature of these limiting forces during the successional process general regression model grm analysis revealed an increasing impact of external factors on the oribatid community during grassland succession and a shift in the major driving forces determining oribatid abundance from soil conditions to vegetation conditions and then to a combined effect of both soil and vegetation conditions,Applied Soil Ecology,long term succession of oribatid mites after conversion of croplands to grasslands
339,this study focuses on the long term changes of collembolan communities occurring after the conversion of arable land to managed grassland we analysed collembolan communities at grassland sites of different age that had been gradually converted over a period of yr abundance and biomass responded rapidly and very positively to the conversion of arable land to grassland while species richness was not affected collembolan assemblages changed only little during grassland maturation the impact of land use change on community structure was more obvious at the functional level because the colonization processes observed in our study mostly relied on hemiedaphic species vegetation and soil parameters were good predictors of collembolan community structure during development of managed grassland the present study demonstrated that past landscape patterns and processes like land use conversion and subsequent succession had a considerable impact on the present day pattern of species richness and community composition of collembola within a landscape our results strongly differ from those obtained for other invertebrate groups highlighting on the one hand the very diverse reactions of invertebrates to a common factor and on the other hand the need to survey more than one taxa in order to draw conclusions on effects of land use change on faunistic communities,Ecography,response of collembolan communities to land use change and grassland succession
340,declining populations of uk grassland flora and fauna have been attributed to intensification of agricultural management practices including changes in cutting fertilizer grazing and drainage regimes we aimed to develop field margin management practices that could reverse declines in intensively managed grassland biodiversity that would have application in the uk and europe here we focus on one aspect of grassland biodiversity the beetles in four intensively managed livestock farms in south west england m wide field margins in existing grasslands were managed to create seven treatments of increasing sward architectural complexity this was achieved through combinations of inorganic npk fertilizer cattle grazing and timing and height of cutting to examine the potential influence of complexity on faunal diversity beetles were identified to species level from suction samples taken between and and their assemblage structure was related to margin management floral assemblages and sward architecture beetle abundance and species richness and evenness were influenced by margin management treatment and its interaction with year correlations with sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses were also found functional groups of the beetles showed different responses to the management treatments in particular higher proportional abundances of seed flower feeding guilds were found in treatments not receiving npk fertilizer the assemblage structure was shown to respond to margin management treatments sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant forbs and grasses the most extensively managed treatments were characterized by distinct successional trajectories from the control treatment synthesis and applications this study provides management options suitable for use within agri environment schemes intended to improve faunal diversity associated with intensively managed lowland grasslands field margins receiving either no management or a single july silage cut were shown to support greater abundances and species richness of beetles although subtler modifications of conventional management may also be beneficial for example the absence of npk fertilizer while maintaining grazing and silage cutting systems,Journal of Applied Ecology,the potential of grass field margin management for enhancing beetle diversity in intensive livestock farms
341,the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of contrasting agricultural practices in organic and conventional farming local factors and to evaluate the influence of surrounding landscape features regional factors on plant assemblages taking into account habitat structure plants were inventoried in crop fields and woody hedgerows boundary and centre of conventional and organic sites habitat structure agricultural practices and landscape characteristics were quantified for each habitat hedgerow boundaries contained a higher number of plant species than adjacent habitats although many of them were exotics however exotics comprised a decreasing proportion of species richness from field to hedgerow centre many of the exotic species were shared between crop fields and adjacent boundaries there was a clear difference in species richness and composition between the organic and conventional study sites fields and woody hedgerows situated in organic sites consistently harboured more native and exotic plant species than those in conventional systems numerous species were only found in organic hedgerows and included several long lived herbaceous forest species at the larger scale level old fields areas with sparse shrubs and trees re colonizing cleared land were the only habitats that significantly influenced the species composition of hedgerows particularly exotic species conversely farm type was a significant predictor of native species richness,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",plant diversity in crop fields and woody hedgerows of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes
342,the target rate of afforestation in ireland over the next years is ha per year which would result in an increase of the forest cover from the current to in order to promote sustainable forest management practices it is essential to know the composition and conservation value of habitats where afforestation is planned and the effects of subsequent planting upon biodiversity the objectives of this study were to investigate changes in vegetation composition and diversity of grasslands years after afforestation with sitka spruce picea sitchensis and determine the primary ecological and management factors responsible for these changes species cover environmental and management data were collected from afforested and unplanted improved and wet grassland site pairs in ireland our results indicate that years after tree planting there were significant changes in richness composition and abundance of species competitive and vigorous grasses were more abundant in planted than in unplanted sites as were generalist species found in both open and wooded habitats while small stature shadesensitive species were less abundant vascular plant species richness and shannons diversity index were higher in unplanted wet grassland than in the planted sites bryophyte species richness was higher in planted improved grassland than in unplanted sites the differences were primarily the result of the exclusion of grazing ground preparation changes in nutrient management and drainage for afforestation drainage ditches provided a temporary habitat for less competitive species but the overall effect of drainage was to reduce the diversity of species dependent on wet conditions variance partitioning showed differences in the relative influences of environmental and management variables on biodiversity in the two habitats probably due to the greater pre afforestation grazing pressure and fertilisation levels in improved grasslands the differences in biodiversity between planted and unplanted grasslands indicate that afforestation represents a threat to semi natural habitats where distinctive and highly localised plant communities could potentially occur,Biodiversity and Conservation,the early effects of afforestation on biodiversity of grasslands in ireland
343,plantations of exotic conifers are a potential threat to natural ecosystems in the argentinean patagonia and a major cause of native forest loss in chile we examined species diversity and composition of three different functional groups understory vascular plants epigeal beetles and birds in paired stands of relatively undisturbed nothofagus dombeyi forest and coniferous plantations we also characterized the structure of each stand exotic plantations generated significant impacts on biodiversity diminishing species richness abundance and diversity and generating modifications in assemblage composition replacement of n dombeyi forests by conifer plantations led to a homogenization of habitat structure at the stand scale the largest impact was detected on understory plants followed by the beetle and bird assemblages supporting the view that the least vagile assemblages are most affected by habitat replacement the most relevant modifications caused by the plantations on the structure and composition of the studied assemblages were a reduction in evenness in plants and beetles an increase of exotic species richness from to in plants and from none to one species in birds and a loss of rare and specialist species in all three assemblages our findings suggest that plantations with more open canopy could favor biodiversity by increasing individual abundance and species richness of all three assemblages,Forest Ecology & Management,effects of exotic conifer plantations on the biodiversity of understory plants epigeal beetles and birds in nothofagus dombeyi forests
344,the effect of stocking rate on the species richness abundance and functional diversity of vascular plants butterflies and grasshoppers was examined in a seminatural upland pasture in central france over a year period Æ ha plots were continuously grazed by charolais heifers at Æ high stocking rate Æ intermediate and Æ low livestock units lu ha to evaluate botanical diversity percentage cover of all plant species was estimated in late july in ten fixed m · m quadrats per plot butterflies were counted on three occasions between late june and early august along three fixed m long transects per plot using the pollard walk with grasshoppers being recorded on two occasions along the same transects diversity patterns of the three taxa were affected by stocking rate for plants species abundance changed more than species number abundance of forbs became higher under the low compared with the high stocking rate stress tolerant grasses were also more abundant in plots grazed at the low stocking rate while an opposite trend was observed for competitive grasses butterflies consistently responded to alterations in vegetation composition especially to the dynamics of nectar plants the species richness of grasshoppers also increased in plots at the low stocking rate the low and intermediate stocking rates were suitable for providing a high diversity of the three taxonomic groups the results suggested that at least butterfly diversity would peak in vegetation taller than that of vascular plants,Grass and Forage Science,how does grazing intensity influence the diversity of plants and insects in a species rich upland grassland on basalt soils
345,organic pasture management includes a focus on mixed livestock grazing restrictions on nutrient inputs and livestock pest control these are all factors which influence the environment of soil invertebrates in this study soil macrofauna mesofauna and microfauna were collected from duplicate and year old organic and conventional legume based sheep grazed pasture systems pastures in both systems had received the same annual input of reactive phosphate rock and elemental sulphur and were stocked with the same numbers of sheep the major difference between the two systems was absence of the chemical control of livestock pests on the organic system resulting in lower sheep liveweights two ungrazed pastures which had not received any nutrient inputs for years were also sampled as part of the study to provide an additional contrast no significant differences in either the diversity or abundance of the soil invertebrate community were found between the organic and conventional systems despite the use of chemicals in the conventional system the lack of difference suggests that many of the observed and reported responses to organic managementreflect altered nutrient inputs and grazingmanagement which were thesamein the current study rather than the cessation of chemical controls in the organic system in contrast the invertebrate community in the unfertilised ungrazed pasture was distinctly different from both the grazed systems the ungrazed pasture had a higher diversity with more new zealand endemic species than the grazed pasture this included twice as many large oribatida as soil pore size increased the lower litter quality from the lack of nutrient inputs in the ungrazed pasturewasreflected in both lower earthworm abundance and the nematode channel ratio indicative of a higher proportion of fungal than bacterial feeding nematodes than the grazed pasture we conclude that organic management when limited to a comparison of livestock pest control is not beneficial to soil invertebrates management practices such as stocking rates and fertiliser regime by altering the soil physical environment and food resources are more important in influencing invertebrate populations in this soil some would argue these altered management practices are an integral part of an organic production system,Pedobiologia,soil fauna in sheep grazed hill pastures under organic and conventional livestock management and in an adjacent ungrazed pasture
346,the area of semi natural grasslands in bulgaria has decreased tremendously in the past century due to agricultural intensification or abandonment as these grasslands host valuable biodiversity conservation measures are needed for their sustainable maintenance we studied the effect of pastureland abandonment on plant communities at the ponor mt a part of the balkan mts bulgaria data on floristic composition vegetation structure and several abiotic parameters were collected in randomly located m plots in canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to analyse how species composition is related to abiotic and land use factors analyses of covariance ancovas were used to test for the effects of sheep grazing vs abandonment on vegetation structure and composition the main environmental factors explaining the compositional variation were related to the altitude sheep grazing and soil depth pastureland abandonment led to an increase in vegetation height and of the richness of mesophytes and leafy plants and red list species grazed plots had higher total species richness more xerophytes rosette forming and spring flowering species to ensure the persistence of the species of both the open grasslands and mid successional grassland communities the management should be carried out in an extensive way and with a zonation regime,Plant Biosystems,effect of land abandonment on the vegetation of upland semi natural grasslands in the western balkan mts bulgaria
347,livestock grazing impacts on insect populations in a variety of ways for phytophagous insects the impact is primarily a result of altering the structure and species assemblage of vegetation however not all species react in similar ways and even within an order there may be winners and losers from different grazing regimes a long term replicated controlled experiment comprising four grazing treatments was established within an upland acid grassland area in scotland auchenorrhyncha were sampled by suction sampling and sweep netting in the fifth year following the start of the treatments a significant treatment effect was apparent in the suction samples with auchenorrhyncha abundance being three to four times higher in the ungrazed plots compared to the other treatments abundance was also highest from the ungrazed plots in the sweep net samples but this effect was not statistically significant redundancy analysis rda showed that a suite of species which are typical of shaded positions responded with increased abundance in the ungrazed plots the findings demonstrate that the assemblages found in ungrazed areas can be vastly different to those found in even lightly grazed areas and therefore underline the benefits of varied grazing regimes in maximising diversity furthermore the work underlines the benefit of employing multiple sampling methods,Insect Conservation and Diversity,grazing impacts on auchenorrhyncha diversity and abundance on a scottish upland estate

354,aim this study was conducted to investigate the potential of predicting alpha diversity and turnover rates of a highly diverse herbivorous insect family geometridae based on vascular plant species richness and vegetation structure location the study was carried out on the south western slopes of mount kilimanjaro within a wide range of habitats between and m elevation methods the floristic and structural composition of the vegetation was recorded at plots of m geometrid moths were sampled manually at light sources located at the plot centres principal components analysis redundancy analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore how alpha diversity and species turnover of geometrid moths are related to vegetation structure and plant species richness results alpha diversity of geometrid moths was significantly correlated with species diversity patterns in the most common vascular plant families r and with plant structural parameters r but not with overall floristic diversity species turnover of geometrid moths was strongly linked to diversity changes in a range of plant families explained variance less strongly to changes in vegetation physiognomy and only weakly to overall floristic diversity changes in elevation were a better predictor of both alpha diversity and species turnover of geometrid moths than any principal component extracted from the vegetation data main conclusions vegetation composition diversity and structure all showed significant correlations with the diversity and species composition of geometrid moth assemblages nevertheless in most cases relationships were indirect via environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity which influenced both vegetation and moth fauna possible direct links between geometrid diversity and potential food plants were much weaker the lack of a significant correlation between overall plant species richness and geometrid diversity indicates that tropical geometrid moths may not be very selective in their food plant choice accordingly a clear correlation between floral diversity and herbivore species richness must be regarded as overly simplistic and the diversity of vascular plants cannot universally be used as a suitable biodiversity indicator for diverse insect taxa at higher trophic levels,Journal of Biogeography,determinants of diversity in afrotropical herbivorous insects lepidoptera geometridae plant diversity vegetation structure or abiotic factors
355,in an attempt to reconcile wildflower cultivation with plant diversity conservation we investigate the effect that different augmentation techniques including ploughing and burning have on the plant diversity of the fynbos biome we evaluated the effects of two ploughing intensities followed by augmentation at one site and augmentation without ploughing at another on the plant diversity in overberg sandstone fynbos on the agulhas plain south africa results showed that plant diversity was the highest in areas which were either shallow ploughed and augmented or augmented only thus these treatments appear not to have a significant negative effect on plant diversity at least in the short term deep ploughing however was detrimental to plant diversity results could be explained by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis i e intermediate levels of disturbance prevent the competitive exclusion of subdominant species the conclusion drawn from this study is that low intensity cultivation of commercial fynbos species can be diversity friendly but high intensity disturbance practices should be avoided,South African Journal of Botany,the effect of ploughing and augmenting natural vegetation with commercial fynbos species on the biodiversity of overberg sandstone fynbos on the agulhas plain south africa
356,habitat fragmentation and disturbance are known to impact animals and plants in different ways depending on species’ characteristics and the type and scale of habitat modification involved in contrast direct or indirect ramifications on mutualistic relationships between plants and animals are less clear possibly because general patterns are confounded by the diffuse nature of many of these interactions here we examine how fragment size and or severe disturbance of a kenyan mountain cloud forest affects the frugivore community and seed removal of a large seeded bird dispersed tree of the forest interior for three consecutive years forest deterioration reduced avian visitation and seed removal rates independent of fragment size consistently so despite strong temporal variation in fruit production over the three year study in disturbed forest fragments seed removal rates were on average times lower than in more intact ones strong differences in both visitation and seed removal rates were largely attributable to shifts in frugivore assemblages characterized by loss or reduced abundance of the most effective seed dispersers most of which were forest specialists although some disturbed fragments benefited from visits of non forest dependent seed dispersers such ‘resilience’ was not predictable or reliable in time or space we conclude that disruption of seed disperser seed interactions in highly fragmented and disturbed tropical forests may be persistent in time when resiliency is inadequate possibly posing long term effects on tree communities,Oikos,habitat disturbance reduces seed dispersal of a forest interior tree in a fragmented african cloud forest

366,two pressing questions for forestry and conservation biology are whether periodic logging in forest ecosystems significantly changes biodiversity and whether the changes can be mitigated through appropriate harvest methods such questions of timber resource management however are rarely applied to nonpest insect species particularly in temperate forest systems we studied the effects of timber harvest on species richness abundance and community composition of forest lepidoptera moths moths were sampled in forest stands occurring in two watersheds managed and wilderness in southeastern ohio during summer stands were chosen from one of four management categories clear cut selectively logged unlogged and wilderness specifically we tested the following predictions shifts in moth community composition would be affected by postharvest changes in stand structure and floristic composition variation in species richness would be determined by the magnitude of the logging disturbance and unlogged stands within managed landscapes would contain different species assemblages compared to wilderness stands canonical correspondence analysis cca revealed significant compositional differences among moth communities sampled from forest stands differing in harvest regime variation among moth communities was mainly attributable to postharvest changes in stand floristic composition rather than stand structure postdisturbance shifts in moth community composition were related to the magnitude of displacement of a given forest stand to earlier successional stages we also found that both species richness of the overall moth community and several feeding guilds were significantly lower in clear cut stands but species richness did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged stands thus selective logging appears to be a better strategy for timber harvest when concern is for maintaining species richness of lepidoptera within stands finally although no differences were detected in overall species richness or abundance of moths sampled from stands in managed or wilderness watersheds the cca suggested that the surrounding landscape influenced the variation in community composition within and among forest stands therefore we suggest that the long term maintenance of lepidopteran species diversity and community composition within temperate deciduous forests managed for timber may ultimately depend on successful regeneration of harvested stands to precut floristic composition as well as the preservation of larger areas of unlogged forests,Ecological Applications,effects of timber harvest on forest lepidoptera community guild and species responses
367,we investigated the short term effects of forest clearcutting on land snails terrestrial gastropods in forest stands along small streams in sweden two different silvicultural treatments were applied at each site clearcutting across the stream channel and buffer strips m wide on each side of the stream additionally we studied reference sites in unlogged riparian forests along similar sized streams all sites were studied before logging and then years after logging after clearcutting the number of individuals in a m sample from each site decreased on average from to and the mean number of species per sample decreased from to most species were negatively affected but there were also clear differences in sensitivity there were correlations between species survival and ground moisture at the wettest clearcut sites with an almost intact bryophyte cover the land snails were unaffected by clearcutting this result suggests that wet or moist forest floors can serve as refugia even at very small spatial scales e g shallow hollows crevices if this is an important mechanism the spatial distribution of small habitats could be important for the long term survival of the snail fauna or other small dispersal limited organisms at clearcut sites in the buffer strips the number of individuals decreased but not the number of species indicating that buffer strip retention is a good practice for protecting land snails in riparian forests the varying effectiveness of the buffer strip could partly be explained by the proportion of the remaining basal area emphasizing that buffer strips could be even more effective if efforts are made to avoid heavy damage by windthrows,Conservation Biology,effects of buffer strip retention and clearcutting on land snails in boreal riparian forests
368,in present day european landscapes many forest plant species are restricted to isolated remnants of a formerly more or less continuous forest cover the two major objectives of this study were to determine the relative importance of habitat quality mainly in terms of soil parameters habitat configuration patch size and isolation and habitat continuity for the distribution of herbaceous forest plant species in a highly fragmented landscape and to examine if groups of species with different habitat requirements are affected differently deciduous forest patches in northwestern germany were surveyed for the presence of a large set of forest species for each patch habitat quality configuration and continuity were determined data were analysed by redundancy analysis with variation partitioning for effects on total species composition and multivariate logistic regression for effects on individual species for two different data sets baserich and base poor forest patches overall we found strong effects of habitat quality particularly of soil ph water content and topographic heterogeneity in the base rich forest patches and of calcium content and disturbance in the base poor patches but only relatively weak effects of habitat configuration and habitat continuity however a number of species were positively affected by patch area and negatively affected by patch isolation furthermore the relative importance of habitat configuration tended to be higher for species predominantly growing in closed forests compared to species occurring both in the forest and in the open landscape,Journal of Vegetation Science,effects of environment habitat configuration and forest continuity on the distribution of forest plant species
369,the birds of the comoro islands were largely neglected until the first major scientific expedition was carried out by benson in benson this expedition took great steps in elucidating the taxonomic status of many species since work has focussed mainly on grand comore with the majority of data collected in two expeditions by the belgium royal museum for central africa in louette et al and these expeditions did much to identify patterns of distributions and abundances of key endemic species distinguishing critical areas for conservation bijnens et al louette louette et al stevens et al anjouan has been even more neglected than grand comore most work has focussed on the critically endangered anjouan scops owl otus capnodes since its rediscovery in safford moorcroft however patterns of species richness and distributions of endemic species remained unknown the work of this report sought to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of birds of the comores identifying the patterns of current species richness on grand comore and anjouan and to compare these with that found by previous expeditions to compare the patterns found with that of butterflies and to identify a suitable indicator for bird species richness with which to carry out rapid biodiversity assessments with these appropriate strategies for conserving the biodiversity of the comores can be suggested the avifauna is thought to be relatively complete however it is possible a number of stenotopic endemic species of lower altitudes are now extinct since the complete deforestation of lower altitudes stevens et al grand comore is the centre of endemism of the four islands five island endemics exist of which four are confined to the slopes of karthala otus pauliani humblotia flavirostris zosterops mouroniensis and dicrurus fuscipennis nesillas brevicaudata can also be found on la grille a m crater to the north of karthala there are a further four species endemic to the comoros archipelago and endemic subspecies butorides striatus a coastal species and cyanolanius madagascarinus which has not been observed since are not included fodies which were identified only to genus level are treated here as an endemic subspecies as foudia eminentissima dominates in forested areas and so it is expected that the majority of fodies recorded represented this species finally non endemic species may be found which are predominately confined to the non forested lower slopes they are thought to have colonised only recently since human arrival the endemic species are thought to have arrived in a double invasion firstly from mainland africa and then a second wave of madagascan origin louette in contrast anjouan has only one island endemic species o capnodes which was rediscovered in safford and a further three comorian endemics columba polleni turdus bewsheri and alectroenas sganzini a population of a sganzini also exists on aldabra however here it will be considered here as an endemic species to the comoro islands,Biodiversity and Resource-use Assessment and Environmental Awareness,conservation comores biodiversity and resource use assessment and environmental awareness
370,the primary effects of climatic conditions on invertebrate litter communities and the secondary effects of different forest types were distinguished by using the sierra palm as a control in a natural experiment along an elevational gradient in the luquillo mountains these mountains have three well defined forest types along the gradient with the palm occurring as stands within each forest palm litter samples were richer in nutrients particularly phosphorus than nonpalm litter significantly so at higher elevations where leaching would have been expected in nonpalm litter mineral concentrations were significantly lower at higher elevations animal abundance mirrored the pattern of mineral amounts and declined significantly in mid and high altitude forests but did not decline with increasing elevation in palm stands a pulse of post hurricane litterfall was reflected in the high abundance of coleoptera and isoptera the following year the species richness of communities margalefs index declined with increasing elevation in nonpalm forest litter but was remarkably similar in palm litter at all elevations palm litter communities were more similar to each other sørensens index than nonpalm communities which became less similar with increasing elevation the differences observed from the lower slopes to the summits in animal abundance species richness and the uniformity of communities are better explained by the contribution of forest composition to the chemical and physical nature of litter and forest heterogeneity rather than to direct effects of temperature and rainfall differences,Journal of Animal Ecology,separating the effects of forest type and elevation on the diversity of litter invertebrate communities in a humid tropical forest in puerto rico
371,widespread and rapid losses of tropical rain forests have made understanding the responses of species to rain forest fragmentation an area of major concern in this study we examined the impacts of habitat fragmentation on the species richness and faunal composition of butterflies in tropical rain forests in sabah borneo we analysed patterns of both α and β diversity to assess the relative importance of differences in patch size isolation and vegetation structure on the diversity and similarity of species assemblages we used additive partitioning to assess the relative contributions of intact forest and forest remnants to overall species richness at a landscape scale and we examined which traits of species best predicted their responses to fragmentation species richness and diversity in rain forest remnants was significantly positively related to remnant size and significantly negatively related to isolation in keeping with theories of island biogeography species assemblages at different sites were significantly nested with those species most adversely affected by forest fragmentation having a narrow range of larval host plants and to a lesser extent being large bodied no species endemic to borneo was recorded in forest remnants smaller than ha but even the smallest remnant ha supported species with geographical distributions confined within sundaland west malaysia and the islands of the sunda shelf although assemblages were significantly nested they departed substantially from perfect nestedness with some species recorded only or predominantly in small relatively depauperate remnants as a result there was substantial β diversity among sites which was related to variation in both fragment size and vegetation structure at the landscape scale diversity within sites was less than that between sites and the majority of the diversity between sites was related to variation in fragment size synthesis and applications substantial diversity was added to the assemblage of butterflies in bornean rain forests by virtue of species differences among fragments which were related mainly to differences in patch size and vegetation structure the data reported indicate that despite having lower species richness relatively small and isolated remnants of rain forest make a substantial contribution to regional diversity small isolated forest remnants are generally accorded low conservation status and given little protection with the result that they often disappear over time because of continued anthropogenic disturbance the results of this study indicate that the conservation value of small remnants of forest in particular their contribution to environmental heterogeneity should not be overlooked,Journal of Applied Ecology,impacts of rain forest fragmentation on butterflies in northern borneo species richness turnover and the value of small fragments
372,human altered landscapes dominate the planet yet little is known about their capacity to sustain plant functional diversity most conservation orientated studies of such landscapes focus on species diversity whereas less attention is given to functional traits and their conservation we examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in three forest habitats understorey tree fall gaps and riverbanks and three deforested habitats pasture roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks each replicated in three human dominated landscapes in southern costa rica we focus on six categorical traits related to forest regeneration reproduction and dispersal pollination mechanism dispersal mechanism growth form fruit type fruit size and seed size we compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and deforested habitats and how three pollination states bat bird and bee pollination and three dispersal states fur bird and monkey dispersal of conservation interest were distributed across these landscapes only one trait state was missing from forest and none was missing from deforested habitats understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor forested and deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits pasture riverbanks and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree fall gaps for multiple traits there were more compositional similarities between forested and deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was used bat bird and bee pollinated plants and plants with bird and monkey dispersed fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with fur dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity,Journal of Ecology,the diversity and conservation of plant reproductive and dispersal functional traits in human dominated tropical landscapes

375,habitat loss is known to be the main cause of the current global decline in biodiversity and roads are thought to affect the persistence of many species by restricting movement between habitat patches however measuring the effects of roads and habitat loss separately means that the configuration of habitat relative to roads is not considered we present a new measure of the combined effects of roads and habitat amount accessible habitat we define accessible habitat as the amount of habitat that can be reached from a focal habitat patch without crossing a road and make available a gis tool to calculate accessible habitat we hypothesize that accessible habitat will be the best predictor of the effects of habitat loss and roads for any species for which roads are a major barrier to movement we conducted a case study of the utility of the accessible habitat concept using a data set of anuran species richness from ponds near a motorway we defined habitat as forest in this example we found that accessible habitat was not only a better predictor of species richness than total habitat in the landscape or distance to the motorway but also that by failing to consider accessible habitat we would have incorrectly concluded that there was no effect of habitat amount on species richness,Landscape Ecolology,accessible habitat an improved measure of the effects of habitat loss and roads on wildlife populations
376,in this study we compared ground beetles carabidae from a range of different forest frag ments along an urbanization gradient in brussels belgium we address the following ques tions i how does the degree of urbanization in the surrounding habitat affect forest beetles and does it interact with the effects of patch size and distance to forest edge ii do these factors have a different effect at the level of individual species habitat affinity groups or total community during we sampled forest plots in forest patches ranging in size from to ha the beetles were captured using transects of pitfall traps from the edge to a distance of m into each woodland and identified to species level effects of urbanization forest size and forest edge were evaluated on total species number abundance and habitat affinity groups and ten abundant widespread model cara bid species overall the effects of urbanization forest size and edge effects slightly influ enced total species richness and abundance but appeared to have a major effect on ground beetle assemblages through species specific responses more urbanized sites had significantly fewer forest specialists and more generalist species large forest fragments were favoured by forest specialist species while generalist species and species frequently associated with forest forest generalists dominated the smaller forests forest edges mainly harboured generalist species while forest specialist species were more frequent into the forests if the forest patches were large enough otherwise they disappeared due to the destruction or impoverishment of their habitat our results show the importance of differ entiating between habitat affinity especially habitat generalists versus specialists the lat ter having a higher value in nature conservation and merely the quantity of species represented in human dominated areas,Biological Conservation,the effects of forest patch size and matrix type on changes in carabid beetle assemblages in an urbanized landscape

382,land use change is considered one of the most radical and extensive disturbances that have influenced plant distributions and diversity patterns in forest understorey communities in much of europe and eastern north america in forests growing on former agricultural land local species diversity and community differentiation among sites are generally reduced compared with ancient forests i e forests with no historical record of agriculture yet no study has determined how the compositional differences created by former land use change over time as the forest sites recover fromformer agricultural use here we resurveyed vegetation plots half of the plots in ancient and half in post agricultural forest to demonstrate how three decades of forest development have changed the compositional differences between post agricultural and ancient forest sites the impact of land use history and survey date was tested on two measures of species diversity and two measure of community divergence the data indicate that the imprint of former agricultural land use persisted over time yet not through compositional stability parallel and strong vegetation shifts occurred in both ancient and post agricultural forest the species diversity decreased and local species cover strongly diverged which indicates community drift the observed understorey changes did thus not support the commonly accepted model of community development in post agricultural forests i e the diversity did not increase and the vegetation did not become more similar to the ancient forest vegetation over time the changes in species composition were associated with an increase of common competitive species at the expense of ancient forest indicator species the source populations of ancient forest species have been gradually depleted so the recovery of post agricultural forests becomes even more precarious synthesis while land use history is likely to persist as the primary predictor of local species diversity and community divergence other environmental drivers may additionally structure forest understorey communities and lead to biotic impoverishment and pervasive species reordering on the time scale of only decades,Journal of Ecology,unexpected understorey community development after years in ancient and post agricultural forests

385,two contrasting trajectories for vegetation restoration in agricultural landscapes are secondary succession following cropland abandonment that can regenerate woodlands passive restoration and conversion of cropland to tree plantations active restoration which have mostly focused on pine species in the mediterranean basin we compared the effects of these two contrasting trajectories of vegetation restoration on bird assemblages in central spain vegetation structure differed in the two restoration trajectories pine plantations attaining higher tree cover and height and m respectively but lower strata complexity than secondary shrubland and holm oak woodland which attained and m of tree cover and height respectively bird species richness differed in stands under active or passive restoration trajectories the former collecting a higher total number of species species per ha plot than the latter species per plot the number of forest species increased with vegetation maturity in both restoration trajectories but especially in stands under active restoration the occurrence of woodland generalist species increased and of species inhabiting open habitats decreased in actively restored stands being some of these latter species of high conservation priority in the european context but relatively common at the regional level bird species inhabiting pine plantations had broader habitat breadth at the regional level than those inhabiting secondary shrublands and woodlands maximum regional density did not differ between both restoration trajectories but it increased with development of the herbaceous layer only at the secondary succession trajectory the relative importance of species of european biogeographic origin was higher in mature pine plantations of total bird abundance than in mature holm oak woodlands whereas that of mediterranean species was considerably higher in the latter than in the former bird assemblages of relatively small patches of pine plantations are unable to reflect the regional avifauna in contrast with the relationships between local and regional assemblage characteristics that can be found in isolated natural forests we conclude that programs of vegetation restoration should base upon a range of approaches that include passive restoration active restoration with a variety of tree and shrub species and mixed models to conciliate agricultural production vegetation restoration and conservation of target species,Forest Ecology & Management,differential effects of vegetation restoration in mediterranean abandoned cropland by secondary succession and pine plantations on bird assemblages
386,extensive agriculture and timber exploitation are the principal causes of forest destruction in ivory coast this country has an annual deforestation rate of to which is the highest in africa most ivorian forests consist of protected areas and of forest fragments embedded in a secondary landscape composed of a mosaic of cultivated fields fallows and perennial crops plantations southwestern côte divoire which is our study area is one of the rare areas where we can still find significant continuous forests blocks classified forests of goin débé and cavally and taï national park this part of ivorian forest is rich in narrow endemic species so called sassandriennes species and is one of the hotspots of biodiversity considering the floristic characteristics of the study area the human pressure which also extends to protected areas and the disastrous consequences on the biodiversity it becomes a critical issue to assess the impact of forest fragmentation on floristic composition and diversity results of this study indicate that impact of isolation and further direct human disturbances on forest fragments lead to an increase of secondary and pioneers strategies and liana life forms however resilience of a high proportion of primary species including sassandriennes endemics in fragments induce an increase in global richness and diversity and demonstrate that promoting their conservation in southwestern ivory coast can substantially contribute to general conservation of plant species political authorities and conservation agencies should become aware of the urgent need of appropriate conservation policy for these forest fragments,Candollea,diversity family dominance life forms and ecological strategies of forest fragments compared to continuous forest in southwestern côte d ivoire
387,as the destruction and severe disturbance of primary tropical forest continues it is important to understand how these forests may recover from perturbations considerable work has been done on above ground recovery but below ground processes are less well understood to determine changes in root mass during tropical secondary succession in lowland forests of central borneo samples were taken from stands of increasing ages since abandonment of agriculture and y with a primary forest control six plots from y old stands and three from all other ages root mass and elemental concentrations were determined and soils were chemically analysed there was no increase in root mass with stand age for fine root mm diameter or small root mm diameter mass but there was a trend for coarse root mass  mm diameter to increase with stand age negative correlations were shown between root mass and soil nutrient status fine root c concentrations increased with stand age but there was no clear effect of stand age on fine root n or p fine root mass did not increase significantly with stand age suggesting a rapid recovery instead soil nutrient status appeared to be the most important factor controlling root mass of the soil nutrients measured in this study n had a stronger control over root mass than p suggesting that this element may be limiting during secondary succession in tropical lowland forests of borneo,Journal of Tropical Ecology,below ground secondary succession in tropical forests of borneo
388,madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot threatened by habitat loss which is detrimental to the future survival of forest dwelling herpetofauna for conserva tion purposes it is essential to determine how species respond to different types of anthropogenic habitat alteration we conducted standardized field surveys a variation of visual encounter survey to assess species richness abundance and diversity among forest clear cut and orchard habitat types in montagne des francais north madagascar forest sites proved to be very different from clear cut and orchard sites with regards to habitat structure lizard species richness abundance and diversity were significantly lower in clear cut sites with only of the observed forest diversity recorded this shift in species occurrence suggests that lizards are particularly sensitive to this type of habitat alteration orchard cultivation did not affect lizard species richness to the same extent as of the observed forest diversity was recorded in this habitat type furthermore lizard abundance was significantly higher in orchard habitat these observations indicate that although anthropogenic activity can have an adverse effect on the lizard fauna of a given site it will seldom lead to a total loss of diversity as species typical of pristine forest specialists are replaced by species adapted to secondary habitats often generalists our results support the contention that anthropogenic habitat alteration can have a strong negative influence on lizard communities researchers should continue to identify which species may be lost or become more vulnerable in future as a result of population decline in response to anthropogenic habitat alteration,Animal Conservation,effects of anthropogenic activities on lizard communities in northern madagascar
389,we study how endemic native and introduced arthropod species richness abundance diversity and community composition vary between four different habitat types native forest exotic forest of cryptomeria japonica semi natural pasture and intensive pasture and how arthropod richness and abundance change with increasing distance from the native forest in adjacent habitat types in santa maria island the azores arthropods were sampled in four m long transects in each habitat type arthropods were identified to species level and classified as azorean endemic single island endemic sie native or introduced the native forest had the highest values for species richness of azorean endemics sies and natives and also had highest values of azorean endemic diversity fishers alpha in contrast the intensive pasture had the lowest values for endemic and native species richness and diversity but the highest values of total arthropod abundance and introduced species richness and diversity arthropod community composition was significantly different between the four habitat types in the semi natural pasture the number of sie species decreased with increasing distance from the native forest and in the exotic forest the abundance of both azorean endemics and sies decreased with increasing distance from the native forest there is a gradient of decreasing arthropod richness and abundance from the native forest to the intensive pasture although this study demonstrates the important role of the native forest in arthropod conservation in the azores it also shows that unmanaged exotic forests have provided alternative habitat suitable for some native species of forest specialist arthropods particularly saproxylic beetles,Journal of Insect Conservation,the effects of land use change on arthropod richness and abundance on santa maria island azores unmanaged plantations favour endemic beetles
390,we studied lizard assemblages assessing abundance richness and nestedness in a fragmented landscape of central chile including native temperate forest forest fragments and commercial pine plantations fragmentation and plantations increase the availability of edge habitats triggering both the support of additional lizard species absent at the continuous forest and the nestedness of lizard assemblages where interior habitats of forest and plantations are nested subsets of habitat edges a vulnerable lizard liolaemus tenuis thrives at fragments in abundance similar to the continuous forest therefore remnants ought to be considered in the conservation of lizard assemblages,European Journal of Wildlife Research,lizard assemblages in a fragmented landscape of central chile
391,inferences about species loss following habitat conversion are typically drawn from short term surveys which cannot reconstruct long term temporal dynamics of extinction and colonization a long term view can be critical however to determine the stability of communities within fragments likewise landscape dynamics must be considered as second growth structure and overall forest cover contribute to processes in fragments here we examine bird communities in amazonian rainforest fragments of  ha beginning before the fragments were isolated in the s and continuing through using a method that accounts for imperfect detection we estimated extinction and colonization based on standardized mist net surveys within discreet time intervals  preisolation samples and  post isolation samples between preisolation and all fragments lost species in an area dependent fashion with loss of as few as of preisolation species from ha fragments but up to in ha fragments analysis of individual time intervals revealed that the result was not due to gradual species loss beginning at isolation both extinction and colonization occurred in every time interval in the last two samples and extinction and colonization were approximately balanced further of species netted before isolation were detected in at least one fragment in although a small subset of species is extremely vulnerable to fragmentation and predictably goes extinct in fragments developing second growth in the matrix around fragments encourages recolonization in our landscapes species richness in these fragments now reflects local turnover not long term attrition of species we expect that similar processes could be operating in other fragmented systems that show unexpectedly low extinction,PLoS ONE,understory bird communities in amazonian rainforest fragments species turnover through years post isolation in recovering landscapes

395,although partial harvesting has been proposed as a measure for maintaining compositional and structural characteristics of natural old growth stands it has not been rigorously evaluated the first objective of this study was to compare forest composition and structural characteristics after killing a portion of canopy trees and after partial cuts in boreal mixedwoods of eastern canada by natural disturbances the second objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the partial harvest treatments in meeting the silvicultural objectives of increased growth of residual stems and advances in regeneration higher densities of shade intolerant species were found after partial cuts when comparedwith naturally disturbed stands similar diameter distributions of residual living trees and densities of shade tolerant species were found following all disturbances increase in growth was similar for all height classes m  m  mand m of balsam fir abies balsamea advance regeneration in naturally disturbed and partially cut stands in the overstory trembling aspen populus tremuloides white birch betula papyrifera white spruce picea glauca and balsam fir had growth increases after partial cuts whereas black spruce picea mariana did not this study provides evidence that partial cutting in these mixedwood stands may emulate the effects of natural mortality resulting from natural partial disturbances by retaining key compositional and structural attributes and inducing increased growth rates in residual trees,Forestry,effects of partial cutting and partial disturbance by wind and insects on stand composition structure and growth in boreal mixedwoods
396,parallel declines in insect pollinated plants and their pollinators have been reported as a result of agricultural intensification intensive arable plant communities have previously been shown to contain higher proportions of self pollinated plants compared to natural or semi natural plant communities though intensive grasslands are widespread it is not known whether they show similar patterns to arable systems nor whether local and or landscape factors are influential we investigated plant community composition in pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms across ireland in relation to the local and landscape context relationships between plant groups and local factors farming system position in field and soil parameters and landscape factors e g landscape complexity were investigated the percentage cover of unimproved grassland was used as an inverse predictor of landscape complexity as it was negatively correlated with habitat type diversity intensive grasslands organic and conventional contained more insect pollinated forbs than non insect pollinated forbs organic field centres contained more insect pollinated forbs than conventional field centres insect pollinated forb richness in field edges but not field centres increased with increasing landscape complexity unimproved grassland within and km radii around sites whereas non insect pollinated forb richness was unrelated to landscape complexity pollination systems within intensive grassland communities may be different from those in arable systems our results indicate that organic management increases plant richness in field centres but that landscape complexity exerts strong influences in both organic and conventional field edges insect pollinated forb richness unlike that for non insect pollinated forbs showed positive relationships to landscape complexity reflecting what has been documented for bees and other pollinators the insect pollinated forbs their pollinators and landscape context are clearly linked this needs to be taken into account when managing and conserving insect pollinated plant and pollinator communities,PLOS ONE,organic farming and landscape structure effects on insect pollinated plant diversity in intensively managed grasslands
397,it is a globally important challenge to meet increasing demands for resources and at the same time protect biodiversity and ecosystem services farming is usually regarded as a major threat to biodiversity due to its expansion into natural areas we compared biodiversity of bees and wasps between heterogeneous small scale farming areas and protected forest in northern coastal belize central america malaise traps operated for three months during the transition from wet to dry season farming areas consisted of a mosaic of mixed crop types open habitat secondary forest and agroforestry mean species richness per site alpha diversity as well as spatial and temporal community variation beta diversity of bees and wasps were equal or higher in farming areas compared to protected forest the higher species richness and community variation in farmland was due to additional species that did not occur in the forest whereas most species trapped in forest were also found in farming areas the overall regional species richness gamma diversity increased by with the inclusion of farming areas our results suggest that small scale farming systems adjacent to protected forest may not only conserve but even favour biodiversity of some taxonomic groups we can however not exclude possible declines of bee and wasp diversity in more intensified farmland or in landscapes completely covered by heterogeneous farming systems,PLOS ONE,high bee and wasp diversity in a heterogeneous tropical farming system compared to protected forest
398,context understanding the variability of vegetation distribution and its determinants is a central issue for addressing the effects of edges on ecological processes recent studies have revealed inconsistencies in the patterns of responses to edge effects that raise important questions about their determinants we investigated the edge effect response patterns by adapting a recently proposed continuous approach to the case of small forest fragments in southwestern france methods we surveyed forest understory vegetation composition species richness and percent cover and abiotic variables soil temperature moisture ph and canopy openness along transects across hard forest edges we tested five statistical models to describe the response pattern of each variable over all transects and per transect we then compared the response patterns as a function of the attributes of the edge orientation topography and adjacent land cover and forest patch size results over all transects a general decreasing trend was observed for all variables as the distance from the edge increased in the individual transects we evidenced a large variability in the response patterns that was not related to edge attributes or to patch size,Annals of Forest Science,patterns of forest vegetation responses to edge effect as revealed by a continuous approach
399,mediterranean type ecosystems are one of the most affected environments by habitat loss and fragmentation due to urban development however only few studies have evaluated the effects of urbanization on the biodiversity of remnant fragments in these ecosystems this study aims to evaluate the effects of urban development over small mammal assemblages inhabiting isolated forest fragments of an urban area of chilean mediterranean zone we compared abundance and richness of small mammal assemblages of six remnant fragments within an urban matrix and six fragments similar in area and habitat characteristics with those of urban area but surrounded by a rural matrix we found that small mammal assemblages differ considerably among fragments types urban vs rural with lack of endemic species from urban fragments and with high proportion of introduced rodents in urban fragments furthermore abundance of small mammals was higher in rural than in urban fragments in urban areas small mammal abundance and richness were not correlated with any of the explanatory variables assessed woody cover flora heterogeneity fragment area perimeter area ratio however in rural fragments small mammal richness was negatively correlated with flora heterogeneity and the abundance of small mammals was positively correlated with perimeter area ratio these results reveal important differences within the effects of fragmentation over small mammal assemblages among the two types of fragments assessed our findings suggest that in forest fragments isolated by urbanization larger areas with good quality habitats are not sufficient to maintain native small mammal population,Urban Ecosystems,small mammal assemblages in fragmented shrublands of urban areas of central chile

415,in cultural landscapes there are often negative biodiversity consequences of agricultural abandonment and subsequent scrub and forest encroachment due to homogenization and the loss of early successional habitats the common forestry practice of removing understory vegetation to prevent fire hazard fuel management probably has the side effect of ameliorating these consequences but it is uncertain whether it effectively restores habitats for early successional species here we examine the influence of time since fuel management and management frequency on butterfly assemblages using a chronose quence of cork oak quercus suber stands spanning about years overall species richness increased immediately after management and abundances peaked about  years later while both declined there after for about  years to pre disturbance levels richness and abundances were also much higher in recurrently managed stands most life history groups showed successional trends similar to the overall species richness and abundances though consistent positive effects of fuel management were only observed for species with univoltine life cycle herbaceous layer feeding larval overwintering and inter mediate body size individual species were largely associated with recent and recurrent management though a few specialists occurred most often in undisturbed stands these findings suggest that fuel man agement at years intervals is strongly positive for butterfly assemblages in landscapes under land abandonment however to maintain the overall forest biodiversity it is critical that patches of undis turbed habitat are also retained at the landscape scale,Biological Conservation,forest fuel management as a conservation tool for early successional species under agricultural abandonment the case of mediterranean butterflies

429,andean forests are subjected to strong hábitat disturbance and fragmentation due to the creating of pasture and crop monocultures especially coffee in addition there is little information available concerning the ability of these forest relicts to maintain their biodiveristy this study was conducted in a coffee ranching farm in the municipality of tarso antioquia colombia using dung beetles are a bioindicator group three inventories in three habitats were conducted each via a transect with nine pitfall traps baited with pig feces during hours a total of individuals belonging to species and genera were collected onthophagus curvicornis n and oxysternon conspicillatum among the habitats in terms of richness abundance or diversity but they did differ in biomass the assemblage was dominated by diggers with some endocoprids and no roller species indicating the high degree of disturbance to the forests the coffee plantation was the habitat with the highest diversity perhaps due to a greater food supply the biomass differences documented were probably a result of habitat disturbance and fragmentation leading to the dominance of o conspicillatum suggesting that the presence of this species in this area will be indispensable for maintaining ecosystem functionality,Actualidades Biologicas,estructura de un ensamblaje de escarabajos coprofagos coleoptera scarabaeinae en tres sitios con diferente uso del suelo en antioquia colombia
430,the simplification of agricultural landscapes through the increase in cropped area has caused the loss of habitats for many species that fulfil important ecosystem services such as pest control and production evidence for detrimental effects on ecosystem services is scarce particularly in tropical regions we studied the effect of the percentage of cropped land in the landscape and altitude in tropical agro ecosystems in relation to crop pest regulation and yield in the colombian andes we established potato solanum tuberosum plots along gradients of altitude and increasing proportion of cropped area to assess the effects on herbivores their natural enemies potato production and overall biodiversity increasing altitude and percentage cropped land reduced the richness and abundance of herbivores and their natural enemies except for the specialist guatemalan potato moth tecia solanivora which showed the opposite response potato yield was negatively affected by the presence of the guatemalan potato moth which increased in density as the percentage of cropped land and altitude increased other herbivores and natural enemies did not affect yield synthesis and applications tropical landscapes at lower altitude or with smaller areas of cropped land suffered less from the presence of the potato moth which had a negative effect on yield our results suggest that conservation of natural habitats like the endangered andean ecosystems would benefit farmers through ecosystem services such as reduced pest damage higher yield and increased functional biodiversity,Journal of Applied Ecology,landscape simplification and altitude affect biodiversity herbivory and andean potato yield
431,forestry practices mainly the clear cutting and establishment of young plantations are two main drivers that increase fragmentation and change forest structure in many tropical forests the consequences of these practices on the structure and composition of carabids on andean ecosystems are not well understood in the northeastern colombian andes we studied changes in the composition and diversity of carabid assemblages in four different types of plant coverages affected by disturbance we found a considerable change among plant coverage types in terms of carabid composition diversity and abundances where these three ecological parameters showed a strongly structure and similar patterns observed principally in boreal forests we found that carabid diversity and abundance were higher in the regenerating forests as the oak forest and gallery forest than in the natural forest as the undisturbed forest stenotopic species were associated with undisturbed forest in contrast eurytopic species were more abundant and associated with the oak forest therefore the disturbance caused by the logging involved a loss of specialist species and an increase of generalist species in the disturbed areas the local patterns caused by the disturbance might be related to the regional distribution of carabids species due to strongly association of some species with particular habitats the regional distribution of specialist and generalist species might be determined by abiotic and biotic conditions as a result of different events that lead the dispersal of carabids species,,unpublished data of the response of ground beetles coleoptera carabidae in the northeastern colombian andes to habitat modification

433,restoration of degraded forest ecosystems is critical to conservation but it is unknown if all components can be successfully restored despite the obvious dependence of plant dwelling arthropods on plants there are few empirical tests to show if restoring the plants also restores the plant dwelling arthropods or if other factors inhibit recolonisation this paper tests the congruence in reassembly trajectory between these two groups and the role of dispersal capabilities on arthropod recolonisation using hemiptera plants and arthropods were sampled along a chronosequence of individual mine pits representing increasing ages since restoration works and surrounding unmined forest changes in the richness composition and structural complexity of the vegetation are described these data are compared to hemiptera sampled by beating and vacuuming over months following the initial establishment of vegetation the richness of plant species remains at a plateau as pits age and below that found in unmined forest in contrast some structural attributes of the vegetation in pits become more similar to the forest with time as pits age dead vegetation below cm thickens and living midstorey vegetation thins plant species composition changes with time but is not tracking directly toward unmined forest the abundance and richness of hemipteran species remain constant as pits age ∼ species at a similar value to that in the forest recolonisation by hemiptera that are brachypterous with permanently reduced wings is markedly slower than for winged taxa that said the compositions of plant and hemipteran species follow a similar trajectory after mining i e there is high congruence between the two taxa hemipteran species composition in the oldest pits sampled year old is not tracking directly toward that found in unmined forest we conclude that for plant dwelling arthropods the early stages of reassembly are characterised by a high abundance of a generalist species and the slow recolonisation by specialist taxa and fauna with limited dispersal abilities e g brachypters thereafter return to a composition similar to that prior to the disturbance depends upon the progress of vegetation reassembly to obtain plant dwelling arthropod assemblages characteristic of unmined forest restoration must reinstate the plant species and structural complexity of the vegetation found in the forest particularly long lived species and ground covers,Forest Ecology & Management,restoration of a forest ecosystem the effects of vegetation and dispersal capabilities on the reassembly of plant dwelling arthropods
434,although large areas of relatively undisturbed forests are essential for preserving biodiversity opportunities for conservation in human dominated landscapes must not be overlooked agroforestry systems such as shaded coffee plantations are known to be more compatible with biodiversity conservation than other more drastic land transformations in recent times however modernization of coffee cultivation has influenced its conservation values adversely we evaluated adult butterfly diversity in coffee plantations around a protected area pa in the western ghats india we sampled transects that varied in distance from the pa and in proportion of silver oak grevillea robusta an exotic timber species we also had two transects within the pa we used a combination of line transects and fruit bait traps to sample butterflies micro climatic variables temperature humidity and light intensity and other habitat variables e g canopy cover tree diversity herb species richness were recorded for each transect we analyzed the effect of these variables on the abundance and species richness of butterflies overall as well as in different families feeding guilds and size classes proximity to the pa significantly influenced the abundance and richness of butterflies in coffee planta tions with transects close to the pa having higher abundance and richness than transects further away also in terms of butterfly species composition similarity to forest declined with increasing distance among the habitat variables only canopy cover had a significant effect on abundance and richness and the effect was negative these patterns with some exceptions were also reflected for different families and feeding guilds the proportion of silver oak had no apparent effect on butterflies this study demonstrates that coffee plantations can act as a buffer for butterfly fauna within a certain radius of a pa they have great potential as auxiliary tools and can significantly complement conservation efforts that are currently centered on pas,Animal Conservation,adult butterfly communities in coffee plantations around a protected area in the western ghats india
435,pitfall traps are commonly used to examine differences in reptile communities among habitat types and disturbance regimes that differ in structure however capture rates and probabilities may be influenced by habitat structure which invalidates comparisons of relative abundance among habitat types to assess whether pitfall traps provide accurate reflections of density and whether habitat structure affects capture probabilities we trapped at six sites in various jarrah forest habitat types in south western australia then intensively searched m total removal plots around each pitfall grid to obtain absolute densities of reptiles pitfall captures were significantly correlated with numbers on total removal plots for hemiergis initialis and lerista distinguenda indicating that pitfall traps provided accurate reflections of density for these species capture probabilities of h initialis and l distinguenda and all reptiles combined showed no significant correlations with any structural variables indicating that capture probabilities were consistent across sites we conclude that trapping provided accurate estimates of relative abundance for some species and that capture probabilities were not influenced by vegetation structure because many studies use trapping to estimate abundances among habitat types we encourage researchers to investigate how vegetation structure influences capture probabilities so that general patterns can be determined we also suggest improvements for any future studies,Wildlife Research,does habitat structure influence capture probabilities a study of reptiles in a eucalypt forest
436,the cape floristic region cfr south africa is a biodiversity hotspot challenged by intensive wine pro duction innovative approaches are being explored to opti mize wine production without compromising biodiversity as organic farming enhances biodiversity conservation in many other regions the aim here was to assess the potential of organic vineyard management for conserving cfr soil surface arthropod diversity pitfall traps were used to sample arthropods in three study areas each of which included an organic vineyard an integrated vineyard and a natural vegetation reference habitat overall arthropod morphospecies richness was highest in natural sites fol lowed by organic vineyards and then integrated vineyards the same trend was seen for predators saprophages and phytophages the ability of organic vineyards to sustain more morphospecies than integrated vineyards were par tially due to higher non crop vegetation complexity and less intense management in the organic vineyards arthropod assemblages were similar in organic and integrated vine yards while both land uses differed greatly from natural sites variation among natural vegetation assemblages in different study areas was also much greater than among assemblages of cultivated sites organic vineyard manage ment has the potential to make an important contribution to arthropod conservation in the cfr at the field scale however at the landscape scale natural habitat supports a much wider variety of morphospecies and the preservation of natural fragments in the vineyard landscape may be the most effective measure to increase biodiversity in the winelands,Journal of Insect Conservation,surface active arthropods in organic vineyards integrated vineyards and natural habitat in the cape floristic region
437,during the summer and fall of while documenting snow leopard panthera uncia abundance mccarthy et al we collected ancillary camera trap photos taken in the tien shan mountains of kyrgyzstan and assessed their usefulness for biodiversity surveys of larger animal species the study was conducted in separate areas one that had been declared a strictly protected national park and a second that had no formal protection but was used as a hunting reserve by foreign interests by using pairs of cameras placed for days in both areas we photographed of probably occurring large kg mammal species identified in a country wide review of the species that appeared in photographs also were identified genetically from simultaneously collected scat samples two species identified by the genetic sample were not photographed photo rates differed between areas and corresponded to independent abundance estimates for snow leopards from fecal genetic individual identification and for argali ovus ammon and siberian ibex capra ibex both from visual surveys the photo rates of ungulates were highest and those for large carnivores were lowest in the strictly protected area which suggested an effect from illicit control of predators by occupants of the surrounding villages in contrast in the unprotected area where hunting was managed and local residents and visitors were few the species diversity and photo rates for most species were higher our use of ancillary camera trap photos was valuable for authenticating species presence and sometimes for documenting differences in species abundances between areas with different conservation histories in addition this study indicates the importance of continued outreach and collaboration with villagers to ensure effective wildlife conservation within kyrgyz national parks,Mountain Research and Development,assessing variation in wildlife biodiversity in the tien shan mountains of kyrgyzstan using ancillary camera trap photos
438,there is increasing evidence that passive faunal recolonisation of restored areas can take decades or even centuries reducing benefits to biodiversity fromrestoration thus there is a need to develop restoration and management strategies that facilitate and accelerate faunal recolonisation this requires identification of habitat features that act as filters to slow or prevent recolonisation and whether those filters are temporally unidirectional or dynamic we investigated successional patterns of reptiles and mammals in restored mine pits in southwestern australia to identify potential filters to faunal recolonisation we sampled reptiles and small mammals using trapping grids across each of four restoration ages and years old and unmined forest and assessed vegetation structure to identify animalhabitat relationships mammal communities in restored areas converged on unmined forest communities as restoration matured and all species recolonised rapidly indicating there were no filters to mammal recolonisation in contrast reptile communities did not converge in the same way indicating there were filters that slowed or prevented reptile recolonisation we identified three reptile species that were slow or failed to recolonise restored areas and a fourth species that rapidly recolonised but disappeared as restoration matured we identified low coarse woody debris cwd volumes and high overstorey stem densities as likely filters the former is a unidirectional filter thatwill decrease gradually over long time frames possibly centuries while the latter is a dynamic filter that fluctuates in its intensity over short time frames of years synthesis and applications our study adds to growing evidence that filters to faunal recolonisation may be widespread in restored areas with important implications for restoration practices firstly examining individual species may more effectively identify filters than examining community successional patterns secondly filters can persist over long time frames possibly centuries so management such as the provision and accelerated development of cwd may need to occur over similar time frames lastly filters can be dynamic and repeated management interventions such as thinning may be required to overcome these filters the growing evidence for filters suggests that facilitating faunal recolonisation is more complex than simply returning vegetation to restoration sites,Journal of Applied Ecology,identifying unidirectional and dynamic habitat filters to faunal recolonisation in restored mine pits
439,identifying and protecting ‘‘keystone structures’’ is essential to maintain biodiversity in an increasingly human dominated world sacred forests i e natural areas protected by local people for cultural or reli gious regions may be keystone structures for forest birds in the greater himalayas but there is limited understanding of their use by bird communities we surveyed birds and their habitat in and adjacent to six tibetan sacred forests in northwest yunnan china a biodiversity hotspot our goal was to understand the ecological and conservation role of these remnant forest patches for forest birds we found that sacred forests supported a different bird community than the surrounding matrix and had higher bird species richness at plot patch and landscape scales while we encountered a homogeneous matrix bird community outside the scared forests the sacred forests themselves exhibited high heterogeneity and supported at least two distinct bird communities while bird community composition was primarily driven by the vegetation vertical structure plots with the largest diameter trees and native bamboo groves had the highest bird diversity indicating that protecting forest ecosystems with old growth characteristics is important for himalayan forest birds finally we found an increased bird use of the sacred forests and their edges during a severe drought year in yunnan indicating that sacred forests may serve as refuges during extreme weather years our results strongly indicate that sacred forests represent an important opportunity for himalayan bird conservation because they protect a variety of habitat niches and increase bird diversity at multiple spatial scales,Biological Conservation,sacred forests are keystone structures for forest bird conservation in southwest china s himalayan mountains
440,although biological conservation has traditionally focused on the protection of pristine areas it is becoming increasingly evident that efforts should also be made toward the maintenance of biological diversity in human managed ecosystems we evaluated the potential role of scattered remnant trees in enhancing ant diversity in agricultural lands within a biodiversity hotspot namely the cerrado savan nas of central brazil ant collections were performed in beneath and away from the crowns of a native tree species growing in planted pastures soy fields and in small ha savanna reserves significantly more ant species were found beneath than m away from scattered trees the magnitude of this effect was similar in soy fields and in pastures at all scales of our analyses except at the landscape scale where the effect was comparatively greater in soy fields most of the species that occurred more frequently beneath than away from trees nest on ground indicating that the conservation value of scattered trees goes beyond the mere protection of arboreal ant species soy plantations presented a particular species poor ground dwelling fauna when compared with savannas whereas differences in the number and composition of arboreal species were less marked in contrast the diversity of arboreal and ground dwelling ants recorded in and beneath pasture trees was nearly as high as the one found in savannas it is suggested that pasture trees can have an important value for ant conservation off reserves particularly in regions where most of the native vegetation has already been cleared,Biotropica,the potential role of scattered trees for ant conservation in an agriculturally dominated neotropical landscape
441,the effects of a perturbation gradient on a patagonian rodent community were assessed over the course of a year by comparing the community parameters in natural and different disturbed environments in the central chilean patagonia the studied habitat types were mature forest second growth forest forest plantations and agricultural grassland we recorded eight species of sigmodontine rodents abrothrix longipilis abrothrix olivaceus chelemys macronyx geoxus valdivianus irenomys tarsalis loxodontomys micropus oligoryzomys longicaudatus and reithrodon auritus most species experience an increment in abundance from summer to autumn with a notable decrease in winter and spring the grassland showed lower species abundance than the mature forest however we did not detect significant differences in diversity evenness or species richness among the forest habitats our results suggest that rodents basically distinguish between forested and open areas but not the specific plant composition of each habitat thus the change in land use in the central chilean patagonia has not significantly affected the community parameters of diversity evenness or species richness,Mammalia,assessing rodent community responses in disturbed environments of the chilean patagonia
442,aims to assess the influence of human induced disturbances on bird communities study design longitudinal study place and duration of study four forests kion zaraninge kwamsisi kwahatibu msumbugwe and gendagenda in panganisaadani ecosystem from october to january methodology eight permanent transects each m long stratified into forest core and forest edge habitats were used in each forest to identify types and quantify levels of human induced disturbances determine bird species composition diversity and richness and abundance therefore three circular plots each m radius were allocated at beginning middle and end of each transect the level of disturbance was assessed using four disturbance indicators tree lopping human trails pit sawing and animal snaring while bird species were identified by sight and call one way analysis of variance was used to test for differences in bird abundance between forests moreover shannon wiener diversity index h was calculated for each forest to assess species diversity and evenness and bray curtis cluster analysis was used to determine similarity in bird species composition between the forests results a total of individuals composed of bird species distributed in ten orders were recorded the level of pit sawing and lopping differed significantly between forests p with msumbugwe being more disturbed than the rest bird abundance differed significantly between the forests p with the highest abundance occurring in msumbugwe as expected species richness and diversity were greater in least disturbed forests kiono zaraninge and kwamsisi kwahatibu than in the highly disturbed forest but forest dependent species were not significantly different between the study forests apparently only pit sawing was found to correlate with bird abundance p whereas similarities in species composition were evident with kion zaraninge and gendagenda exhibiting much overlap conclusion increasing forest disturbances seems to negatively impact on distribution of birds thus challenging conservationists to devising sustainable forest management strategies in order to sustain bird diversity and abundances in these unique forests,British Journal of Applied Science & Technology,human induced disturbances influence on bird communities of coastal forests in eastern tanzania
443,coarse woody debris cwd is a critical functional and structural component of forest and woodland ecosystems providing habitat for many species and is an important consideration in forest and woodland restoration cwd is very slow to develop naturally so to accelerate the return of cwd dependent species to restored areas cwd is commonly returned manually however few studies have tested the effectiveness of such a strategy we investigated whether the provision of cvvd heaped into habitat piles of varying density piles ha was effective in accelerating recolonisation by reptiles frogs and mammals into year old restored bauxite mine pits in south western western australia both reptile and mammal communities and the abundances of some individual species differed significantly between unmined and restored forest but the provision of cwd had only a weak effect in accelerating recolonisation acritoscincus trilineatus abundance showed a weak positive relationship with habitat pile density and both cryptoblepharus buchananii and christinus mannoratus species that are very rare in restoration were recorded adjacent to habitat piles in two and one mine pits respectively the weak effects of cwd in accelerating recolonisation were likely due to the differences in vegetation between unmined and restored forest resulting in restored forests being primarily inhabited by generalist species that did not require cwd and the highest habitat pile densities being of log densities in unmined forest suggesting that cwd dependent species perceived all mine pits as having similarly low levels of cwd compared to unmined forest our results suggest that the provision of cwd in restored areas is critical to accelerate recolonisation of cwd dependent fauna but this will require consideration of both cwd spatial connectivity and temporal continuity spatial connectivity would be best achieved through cwd densities that approximate those in reference ecosystems whereas temporal continuity will be harder to achieve particularly in systems where cwd is slow to develop and will require the development of innovative techniques and long term management however ensuring the spatial connectivity and temporal continuity of cwd in restored areas should greatly increase their biodiversity value,Forest Ecology & Management,does coarse woody debris density and volume influence the terrestrial vertebrate community in restored bauxite mines
444,edge effects are a widespread and ubiquitous ecological phenomenon yet they remain poorly studied across edges between restored and natural forests to address this lack of knowledge we studied vertebrate communities across edges between ‐year old restored mine‐pits and adjacent unmined forest in the jarrah eucalyptus marginata forest of south‐western australia we found that mammal communities showed no edge response but reptile communities did overall reptile abundance and morethia obscura abundance were higher in unmined forest along edges egernia napoleonis abundance was lower in unmined forest along edges while pogona minor abundance was lower in restored mine‐pits along edges predictive models were unable to predict species edge responses due to the lack of knowledge of the ecology of jarrah forest reptiles but proved useful in identifying potential ecological mechanisms behind observed edge responses and suggested that potential mechanisms were likely different for each species our study is the first to show edge responses in both habitats forming the edge between restored and natural forests emphasizing the importance of studying both habitats forming the edge our results also suggest that despite being poorly studied edge responses are common across edges between restored and natural forest and result from a variety of ecological mechanisms an increased understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving edge responses across edges between restored and natural forests will improve our ability to integrate restored areas into cross‐landscape management and ultimately improve our ability to manage landscapes for biodiversity conservation,Austral Ecology,edge effects across boundaries between natural and restored jarrah eucalyptus marginata forests in south western australia
445,we studied the influence of different livestock grazing intensities and habitat types on small mammals in the knersvlakte south africa the knersvlakte belongs to the succulent karoo biome a biodiversity hotspot we placed a total of plots in areas of two grazing intensities moderate and intensive and two major habitat types quartz fields and loamy soils on these plots we carried out small mammal live trapping traps during four nights and estimated the cover of different vegetation layers in total small mammal individuals from ten species were caught during trap nights all species occurred on loamy soils but only four in quartz fields the small mammal community on intensively grazed plots was a subset of that on moderately grazed plots the most abundant species on loamy soils were macroscelides proboscideus and rhabdomys pumilio and in quartz fields m proboscideus and gerbillurus paeba generalised linear models revealed that habitat type had the strongest influence on abundance and diversity of small mammals vegetation cover mainly had indirect influences via the habitat type on abundance diversity and the body condition of small mammals overall the intensities of livestock grazing showed no effect on abundance and diversity,Journal of Arid Environments,effects of livestock grazing and habitat characteristics on small mammal communities in the knersvlakte south africa
446,we investigated the land snail fauna of rain forests on the eastern slopes of pico biao on bioko island in the gulf of guinea thirty seven plots were studied along an altitudinal transect reaching from sea level lowland rain forest to an altitude of m mossy forest a total of specimens were col lected and were assigned to land snail species eleven species were new records for bioko at least of the recorded species are endemic to bioko the degree of endemism was high in mossy forest and in lowland rain forest but lower in montane forest species richness showed a hump shaped distribution along the altitudinal gradient with a maximum at m a s l species richness peaked in forests in which there had been selective logging more than years ago indicating that some disturbance may have beneficial effects on biodiversity species richness was correlated with the thickness of leaf litter the availability and quality of suitable microhabitats is more important for the occurrence of snail species than gradients of otherwise often decisive environmental parameters like temperature which are strongly correlated with altitude a lack of clustering of the occurrences of dif ferent snail species along the altitudinal gradient indicated a gleasonian meta community structure with individualistic responses of the various species to environmental parameters no negative co occur rence patterns that might provide evidence for interspecific competition could be detected the fre quent coexistence of morphologically similar and presumably ecologically equivalent congeneric species may indicate that such equivalents do not exclude each other as predicted by the neutral theory of biodiversity however current knowledge about individual snail species is too scanty to exclude the possibility that niches of congeneric species differ in some details,Journal of Molluscan Studies,species richness and meta community structure of land snails along an altitudinal gradient on bioko island equatorial guinea
447,we investigated the infiucnce of anthropogenic disturbance on the structure of arboreal formicidae communities in se asian lowland forests included were a primary forest and three disturbed forests whieh had been cut for crop planting and abandoned and yr after agricullural use for natural regeneration ant communities of at least individuals of one tree species were sainpied from each forest type by fogging diversity and community structure differed clearly among forest types during the course of forest regeneration ant communities became more and more similar to those ol the primary forest a surrogate analysis shows thai ant communities of the primary lores cannot be distinguished from randomly composed communities this is in contrast to the theoretical expectations according to which ant communities should be structured by interspecific competition ihat lead to a large degree of predictability however a deterministic pattern of ant communities is found in the disturbed forest this indicates that human disturbance not only changes the faunisiic composition of ant communities but could also change the dynamics of the whole system the transition from stochastic o deterministic communities might be of general importance for understanding the mechanisms structuring communities in disturbed habitats,Ecography,anthropogenic disturbance changes the structure of arboreal tropical ant communities

450,as a part of the central arizona phoenix long term ecological research project we determined how land use alteration influenced spider and harvestman diversity we sampled spiders in six habitat types desert parks urban desert remnants industrial agricultural xeric and mesic residential yards and tested how habitat type and productivity affected spider diversity and abundance as expected agricultural fields and mesic yards were more productive than the other xeric habitats these more productive habitats were characterized by higher abundances but lower spider diversity and were dominated by lycosidae wolf spiders followed by linyphiidae sheet web weavers the increase in wolf spider abundance was positively correlated with habitat productivity and negatively correlated with the abundance of other predatory arthropods that might compete with or prey upon wolf spiders temporal changes in productivity affected spider abundance after an el ni n over tildeo winter may spider abundance was five times higher than after an extremely dry winter may the differences in spider abundance between agricultural fields and the four xeric habitats were profound in but moderate in suggesting an interaction between the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on spider populations compared with xeric habitats the el ni n over tildeo effect was less profound in agricultural sites suggesting that human land modification mollifies seasonal effects we suggest that habitat structure and productivity alteration may change community structure as the urban or agricultural habitats favor one or a few preadapted taxa over many others incorporation of large fragments of natural habitats into future landscape planning in urban environments may be important for conservation of rich spider communities,Ecological Society of America,urbanization and spider diversity influences of human modification of habitat structure and productivity
451,biodiversity conservation of grasslands in the face of transformation and global climate change will depend mainly on rangelands because of insufficient conservation areas in regions suited to agriculture transformed vegetation pastures crops and plantations is not expected to conserve much biodiversity this study examined the impact of land use on the plant diversity and community composition of the southern drakensberg grasslands in south africa which are threatened with complete transformation to pastures crops and plantations the main land uses in this high rainfall region are ranching or dairy production under private tenure using indigenous grassland pastures eragrostis curvula kikuyu and ryegrass and maize plantation forestry communal tenure maize and rangelands and conservation plant diversity and composition were assessed using whittaker plots transformed cover types were depauperate in species and ranged from kikuyu · species m and ryegrass · to pine plantation · e curvula pasture · commercial maize · and communal maize · with the exception of pine plantations these communities supported mostly exotic of species or ruderal indigenous species and made little contribution to plant species conservation abandoned communal cropland reverted to an indigenous grassland almost devoid of exotic species within c years it was predicted that frequently cultivated sites maize and ryegrass would support less diversity than long lived pastures kikuyu and e curvula this was contradicted by the relatively high species diversity of communal maize fields which was attributed to a lack of herbicides and the depauperate communities of kikuyu and of e curvula pasture which were attributed respectively to a dense growth form and a severe mowing regime pine plantations harboured fourfold more indigenous species per plot than other transformed types species were mostly shade tolerant grassland relics that had persisted for years since planting and some forest colonizers indigenous species were unlikely to be maintained because of aggressive invasion by the exotic rubus cuneifolius and severe disturbance associated with tree harvest and replanting the richness of indigenous grasslands was expected to differ in response to grazing pressure but they differed only in composition grasslands were dominated by grasses despite the richness of herbaceous species the dominance ofthemeda triandrawasreduced under livestock grazing in favour of more grazing tolerant species exotic specieswere inconspicuous except for the dicotyledonrichardia brasiliensis a subdominantunder communal grazing southern drakensberg grasslands are probably now stocked with livestock six to fold higher than during pre settlement times a grassland protected forc yearssupported twofold greater richness species plot  than grazed grasslands suggesting that a year history of increased mammalian grazing had already reduced plant diversity synthesis and applications land acquisition is costly thus conservation of plant diversity in the southern drakensberg requires a policy that inhibits transformation of rangelands this can be achieved by enhancing their economic viability without changing the vegetation composition their inherent value must be recognized such as for water production the viability of commercial ranches can be improved by increasing their size conservation efforts need to be focused on plant taxa that only occur on unprotected rangelands,Journal of Applied Ecology,influence of land use on plant community composition and diversity in highland sourveld grassland in the southern drakensberg south africa

463,understanding local forest needs in cameroon in the village of nkolbibanda kilometers south of the cameroon capital of yaoundé cifor research is providing a better understanding of the environmental needs and priorities of the communities living next to the ottotomo forest reserve covering an area of hectares the reserve was gazetted by the french colonial government in and remains off limits to human activities other than the occasional collecting of non timber forest products the inhabitants of nkolbibanda belong to the ewondo ethnic group and are largely dependent upon agriculture for food and income their primary sources of food include shifting cultivation some plantation crops such as cocoa and increasingly palm oil traditional forest products and bush meats such as palm rats porcupines and antelope at the time the reserve was gazetted traditional territories were not taken into account including those traditionally accessed by the people of nkolbibanda but in the past years the population in the area has grown considerably putting considerable pressure on local natural resources and resulting in increasing levels of conflict between communities and the reserve management cifor has been playing a leading role in improving relations between local communities local ngo s and forest administrators the current multidisciplinary landscape assessment mla project led by cifor researcher marieke sassen aims to enhance this process we hope the outcomes of this project will serve as a basis for improved dialogue between all stakeholders and lead to better decisions about the management of the reserve and the surrounding area sassen said using an approach developed in east kalimantan indonesia sassen and her team of researchers undertook a survey in involving both conventional biodiversity surveys and an assessment of local people s needs and perceptions the mla approach aims at enhancing the understanding between development practitioners local policy makers and forest communities it will also help improve policy decisions that affect the local population and enhance the long term sustainability of the forest and it s inhabitants marieke and her team have used a variety of research methods to explore the importance people attach to their tropical rainforest landscape conducted with men and women both young and old these methods include different forms of meetings for example community meetings help compile historical data such as land use and village history while exercise meetings provide a valuation of landscape elements and animal species and their uses other techniques include participatory mapping meetings and field surveys and require building high levels of collaboration and trust with participants not surprisingly the initial analysis of survey results has shown that the forest is the second most important landscape unit behind the village this raises one of the most challenging aspects of cifor s research how to help villagers find the right balance between improving their food production and their need to sustain forests as an important source of land and of products that can be harvested people are aware of forest functions they know for example that trees protect the forest how seed dispersal is necessary for tree regeneration and how certain animals play an important role in this they also know which activities damage the forest including many they practice themselves like cutting down trees and burning however when it comes to their own activities they feel they do not have a choice if they want to practice agriculture and sustain themselves as one elder men said that is just the way we are we eat something until it is finished and then we just find something else sassen says this demonstrates now people have their own ways of adapting to changing conditions they also blame outsiders for damage to the forest by cutting down trees illegally in the reserve and on their land or by poaching game or using poison to catch fish marieke said many respondents spoke of this outsider issue arguing that while they should not have to change their own traditional activities certain activities by outsiders should be prohibited driving the increasing level of unsustainable practices has been the dramatic rise in recent years of the price of goods associated with the cash economy basic essentials such as soap petroleum matches and children s schooling place an increasing burden on the villagers to find cash one of the major challenges is to develop sustainable practices within the forestry reserve paramount to this is ensuring constructive dialogue at all levels between stakeholders cifor is assisting this by aligning the current and future needs of forest mangers and villagers as well as assisting policy makers to work closely with stakeholders we give as much information as possible to the community and provide explanations about how involvement in the research will benefit them in the long term it is important to overcome any levels of mistrust sure it s too early to give a definite thumbs up to the mla project but i think i can safely say cifor s work is improving relations between ngo s forest managers and local villagers i hope that by building on this and past cifor activities we can influence future decisions about the management of the reserve mh

465,maintaining agricultural diversity is important for the conservation of rare species and for preserving underlying ecosystem processes on which smallholder farmers rely the positive effects of crop diversity are well documented in tropical systems but the conservation potential of arid agricultural systems is less clear this study assesses the impact of three arid agroforestry systems on plant diversity and functional richness in south sinai egypt mountain orchard gardens modern town gardens and low desert date palm gardens we surveyed plants cultivated and wild within gardens and control plots of natural habitat and allocated each plant eight biological traits that are recognised as being linked with major ecosystem processes species diversity was quantified using three measures hill s numbers and total species diversity was significantly higher within gardens than in the surrounding habitat at all three levels of diversity and across the three agroforestry systems species similarity was high between gardens and the surrounding habitat and there was a strong overlap in the functional traits of wild plants and cultivated non tree species despite the clear presence of trees within the gardens the community weighted trait means cwms showed that chamaephyte perennials were the dominant life forms in both the gardens and the natural habitat functional richness differed between the three agroforestry systems but was significantly higher within the gardens functional richness has been linked to increased productivity and cwms showed that plants within the gardens were considerably taller than outside suggesting higher biomass accumulation these findings suggest that bedouin agricultural practices are not having a negative effect on the flora of the region and that the continuation of these indigenous farming practices can actively benefit rare wild plants in the region on a wider scale this study supports the view that smallholder farms and homegardens can be valuable tools in conservation preserving local species and maintaining ecosystem functioning,Basic and Applied Ecology,traditional agricultural gardens conserve wild plants and functional richness in arid south sinai

470,the maintenance of species diversity in modified and natural habitats is a central focus of conservation biology the ibera nature reserve inr protects highly diverse ecosystems in northeastern argentina including one of the largest freshwater wetlands in south america livestock grazing is one of the major disturbances to these ecosystems however its effect on ant diversity is poorly known the objective of this work was to study the effect of savanna versus grassland and grazing on the structure and composition of subtropical terrestrial ants focusing on the particular response of the native red imported fire ant solenopsis invicta buren unbaited pitfall traps were used to capture worker ants in grazed and nongrazed sites fifty ant species were collected the savanna showed more species individuals biomass and functional groups of ants than the grassland s invicta was the most frequently captured and numerically dominant species however camponotus punctulatus punctulatus mayr showed the highest biomass grazing simplified vegetation structure in both habitats but its impact on vegetation seemed only to promote a higher total biomass especially in the grassland and or functional groups favoring occurrence of hot climate specialists in the savanna this study revealed that habitat type strongly affected the organization of the terrestrial ant assemblages at the inr however as in other studies we did not find clear evidence that habitat modification by grazing significantly affected terrestrial ant assemblages the weak grazing influence could be the consequence of the short enclosure time as to recover the original ant communities the differential response of ant species to habitat type and or the resilience of ants,Annals of the Entomological Society of America,habitat and grazing influence on terrestrial ants in subtropical grasslands and savannas of argentina
471,land use intensification in forests is a main driver of global biodiversity loss although historical state of land use differs between subtropical and temperate zones gradients of land use intensities similarly range from unmanaged to very intensively managed forests irrespective of similar land use forces in both climate zones comparative studies on land use effects are still rare such studies are however promising in discov ering more general impacts and geographical specifics of land use intensification we studied litter dwelling invertebrates along a gradient of increasing land use intensity in subtropical forests in southern brazil and temperate forests in central europe using similar sampling designs effects of land use intensity on the entire community were analyzed on the level of orders and feeding guilds in both climate zones a similar number of indi viduals were caught when standardizes to pitfall trap days but taxa richness was higher in the subtropics moreover community composition differed between both climate zones in both regions land use intensity did not affect taxa richness but invertebrate abundance was affected in opposite ways while increasing land use intensity resulted in a decrease of invertebrate abundance in the subtropics an increase was observed in the temperate zone and this was mostly consistent regarding different feeding guilds man agement practices should take into account that the effect of land use intensity on biodi versity can differ drastically among climatic regions,Biodiversity and Conservation,the impact of forest management on litter dwelling invertebrates a subtropical temperate contrast
472,new patterns and trends in land use are becoming increasingly evident in europe’s heavily modified landscape and else whereas sustainable agricul ture and nature restoration are developed as viable long term alternatives to intensively farmed arable land the success of these changes depends on how soil biodiversity and processes respond to changes in management to improve our understanding of the community structure and ecosystem functioning of the soil biota we analyzed abiotic variables across sites and biological variables across sites in the netherlands one of the most intensively farmed countries the data were derived from the dutch soil quality network dsqn a long term monitoring framework designed to obtain ecological insight into soil types sts and ecosystem types ets at the outset we describe sts and biota and we estimate the contribution of various groups to the provision of ecosystem services we focused on interactive effects of soil properties on community patterns and ecosystem functioning using food web models ecologists analyze soil food webs by means of mechanistic and statistical modelling linking network structure to energy flow and elemental dynamics commonly based on allometric scaling we also explored how predatory and metabolic processes are constrained by body size diet and metabolic type and how these constraints govern the interactions within and between trophic groups in particular we focused on how elemental fluxes determine the strengths of ecological interactions and the resulting ecosystem services in terms of sustenance of soil fertility we discuss data mining food web visualizations and an appropriate categorical way to capture subtle interrelationships within the dsqn dataset sampled metazoans were used to provide an overview of below ground processes and influences of land use unlike most studies to date we used data from the entire size spectrum across orders of magnitude using body size as a continuous trait crucial for understanding ecological services multimodality in the frequency distributions of body size represents a performance filter that acts as a buffer to environmental change large differences in the body size distributions across ets and sts were evi dent most observed trends support the hypothesis that the direct influ ence of ecological stoichiometry on the soil biota as an independent predictor e g in the form of nutrient to carbon ratios and consequently on the allometric scaling is more dominant than either et or st this provides opportunities to develop a mechanistic and physiologically ori ented model for the distribution of species’ body sizes where responses of invertebrates can be predicted our results highlight the different roles that organisms play in a number of key ecosystem services such a trait based research has unique strengths in its rigorous formulation of fundamental scaling rules as well as in its verifiabili ty by empirical data nonetheless it still has weaknesses that remain to be addressed like the consequences of intraspecific size variation the high degree of omnivory and a possibly inaccurate assignment to trophic groups studying the extent to which nutrient levels influence multitrophic inter actions and how different land use regimes affect soil biodiversity is clearly a fruitful area for future research to develop predictive models for soil ecosystem services under different management regimes no simi lar efforts have been attempted previously for soil food webs and our dataset has the potential to test and further verify its usefulness at an unprecedented space scale,Advance in Ecological Research,a belowground perspective on dutch agroecosystems how soil organisms interact to support ecosystem services

477,urban nature is crucial for the quality of human life both within cities and beyond in many developed cities the numbers of restoration through revegetation projects have rapidly increased over the decades however the extent to which revegetated habitats perform compensatory roles for remnant habitats is poorly understood we compared butterfly and ground beetle assemblages among three park types five remnant parks four newly established parks and five old established parks and seven built up sites in tokyo central japan butterflies were classified into woodland or open land and into patch dependent or matrix dwelling species for both taxa remnant parks and built up sites had the highest and lowest species richness and abundance respectively although the richness and abundance of open land and matrix dwelling butterflies did not differ among the three park types those of woodland and patch dependent species were significantly highest in remnant parks in short after years established parks did not attain the same insect assemblages as those in remnant parks these results illustrate that whist revegetation is an effective and fast acting conservation measure for generalist species i e widely distributed species this value is limited for specialists in highly urbanised landscapes therefore even small remnant woodlands provide important refuges for urban wildlife remnant protection programs at the early stage of city development would decide the fate of urban biodiversity,Biodiversity and Conservation,woodland remnants as an urban wildlife refuge a cross taxonomic assessment

479,historically where forest habitats are deemed as the pristine landscape state anthropogenic habitats such as managed grasslands or open spaces are often perceived to be antagonistic and of secondary conservation priority traditionally studies on biodiversity responses to ecological variation i e edge effect have mostly focused on forest habitats yet recently there has been increased attention on communities beyond the forest edge in an effort to better understand how interactions between forests and adjacent habitats may potentially affect regional biodiversity however in europe and the mediterranean basin a biodiversity hotspot areas with high landscape heterogeneity and high edge density there is a paucity of studies analysing the community responses across forest and beyond edge habitats across ecotones in a protected area of central italy we investigated the responses of ground dwelling arthropods araneae spiders chilopoda centipedes and carabidae ground beetles which were differentiated into habitat specific guilds forest edge and grassland species across a forest grassland ecotone we investigated the extent to which a habitat edge influenced communities of arthropods associated with either the forest or grassland and how far from the edge this effect penetrated into each habitat twelve m transects perpendicular to a forest grassland edge were established and arthropods were sampled at nine progressive distances across the ecotone an indicator species analysis was used to detect species significantly associated with forest edge belt or grassland habitats which were assumed representative of the respective communities logistic models of indicator species richness and abundances were used to describe responses of grassland and forest communities across the ecological boundaries we found that grassland and edge habitats had habitat specialists and higher species richness compared to the forest habitat moreover the occurrence of grassland specific species was influenced by the presence of an edge up to m from the habitat border in contrast forest associated indicator species were not affected by proximity to the habitat edge rather individuals typical of forest habitats tended to spill over into grassland habitats these findings support the hypothesis that in a forest grassland mosaic forest species are less sensitive to an edge and influence the community beyond the forest edge and into the grassland more than the reverse i e the effect was asymmetric from these data we estimated that a minimum grassland habitat width of m is necessary for grassland species to maintain a core area that is relatively unaffected by the spillover of species from adjacent forest habitats incorporating the directional influences of adjacent communities on each other allows for an empirical assessment of habitat vulnerability that doesn t a priori value the conservation of one habitat over another,Biodiversity and Conservation,asymmetrical responses of forest and beyond edge arthropod communities across a forest grassland ecotone
480,moderate grazing by cattle increases the heterogeneity of soil and vegetation this has been suggested as an ecologically sustainable mean of managing natural environments endangered by tree encroachment such as heathlands our study was performed to test the impact of grazing intensity on soil macroinvertebrate communities in heterogeneous landscapes in a private property eligible to the natura european network of special protection areas within the brenne natural regional park indre france we sampled macroinvertebrates along a broken line crossing different land use types from pasture to pine forest passing through a besom heath erica scoparia heathland at levels of cattle pressure we hypothesized that i litter dwelling mostly arthropods and mollusks and soil dwelling macroinvertebrates mostly earthworms would respond in an opposite manner to various grazing intensities and ii intermediate cattle pressure pastured heath would increase soil and community heterogeneity the results supported the first hypothesis which was explained by land use impacts mediated by soil properties however our results supported only partly the second hypothesis since maximum dissimilarity whether in the composition of soil macroinvertebrate communities or in soil features was observed in only one out of the two pastured heaths where cattle pressure was intermediate,Pedosphere,soil macrofaunal communities are heterogeneous in heathlands with different grazing intensity
481,the impacts of four different management systems on diversity of ground foraging ants were examined to assess potential for conservation of biological diversity in human influenced agricultural or agroforestry systems using a variety of indices diversity was measured along a gradient of anthropogenically disturbed habitats the gradient in terms of increasing levels of disturbance ranged from primary rain forest abandoned cacao plantations productive cacao plantations to banana plantations the primary forest and abandoned cacao plantations were situated in a reserve and the productive cacao plantations and banana plantations were located on privately owned land within km of the reserve in the sarapiqui valley of costa rica to sample ground foraging ants we placed tuna baits along the ground in each habitat although tuna baits attract a generalist assemblage of ants that may be better able to adapt to more disturbed sites diversity of this community was significantly reduced with increased disturbance ant diversity was not different for forest and abandoned cacao sites except in terms of evenness with the forest having a more even distribution of species forest and abandoned cacao sites were significantly more diverse than both productive cacao and banana plantations the latter two did not differ significantly from each other in terms of diversity but there was considerable variability within each of these habitat types the results of this study suggest that conservation of diversity may be possible in a mosaic of different land uses but further studies such as those addressing the importance of scale and nearby source populations are necessary before management practices can be implemented,Ecological Applications,the effects of management systems on ground foraging ant diversity in costa rica

483,although it is widely assumed that protected areas conserve species that would not survive elsewhere this assumption is seldom tested the aim of the study was to determine the respective roles of a nature reserve and commercial and subsistence rangeland in preserving terrestrial arthropods and reptiles in xeric succulent thicket in the eastern cape south africa faunal diversity on a nature reserve the great fish river reserve complex was compared with a historically overgrazed commercial farm an intensively managed conservatively stocked commercial farm and a communal grazing area terrestrial arthropods and reptiles were caught in paired pitfall traps inside and outside the nature reserve specimens being sorted into recognizable taxonomic units rtu the taxa occurring in each land management unit were compared using rtu diversity a hierarchical richness index hri community similarity and uniqueness the nature reserve contained more rtu and a greater hri than adjacent land for most arthropod groups and also supported more unique taxa than the other study localities snakes and lizards in contrast were almost twice as abundant in the communal grazing area as elsewhere although reptile species diversity was similar at all localities each individual locality contained fewer than of the total number of arthropod rtu and of the total reptile rtu the communal grazing area contained only of the total number of arthropod rtu collected in the study area nineteen of the ant of the weevil of the spider and of the grasshopper rtu and of the reptiles were shared by the three land uses six new weevil species and probably several new arachnid species were collected but all the new weevils were confined to the nature reserve the communal grazing area differed most from the nature reserve in richness and community composition followed by the conservatively stocked commercial farm the historically overgrazed commercial farm was most similar to the nature reserve the communal grazing area was characterized by xeric adapted reptiles and predatory arthropods whose ranges are centred in the semi arid parts of south africa in contrast the nature reserve and commercial farms supported more mesic adapted reptiles and herbivorous arthropods synthesis and applications the data show how protected areas are key to conserving those species that decrease under heavily grazed and disturbed conditions however they also illustrate that diverse land use mosaics promote gamma diversity in the xeric succulent thicket of south africa conservation policies that include protected space in the wider environment and conserve habitat diversity are likely to both promote regional richness and support scarce species,Journal of Applied Ecology,comparing biodiversity between protected areas and adjacent rangeland in xeric succulent thicket south africa arthropods and reptiles
484,protected forest areas of sulawesi are gradually being replaced by intensively used agroforestry systems and farmland especially in lowland and sub montane regions studies on the impact of these man induced changes on biodiversity are of urgent conservation concern we compared the fruit feeding butterfly assemblage of a natural hill forest to that of a disturbed hill forest representing a mosaic of old secondary forest and recently abandoned or active subsistence farms overall species richness seemed highest in the disturbed site but both abundance and diversity of endemic butterflies were significantly higher in the natural forest although the butterfly assemblage showed a clear vertical structure in the natural forest vertical stratification was no longer pronounced at the disturbed site comparative studies based on diversity estimates from ground samples should consider not only the scale at which sampling is carried out and influences from nearby habitat patches in the surrounding landscape mosaic but also possible behavioural changes in stratified species after forest modification this study shows that higher overall species richness does not imply higher species distinctiveness and indicates that the contribution of land use systems to global biodiversity should be evaluated with caution even when relatively high species richness estimates are found,Biodiversity and Conservation,forest use and vertical stratification in fruit feeding butterflies of sulawesi indonesia impacts for conservation

487,the ecological effects of anthropogenic deforestation on wild animals in tropical regions are a global concern we investigated the effects of various forest uses on small mammal communities in sarawak malaysia by comparing study plots in six forest types fragmented primeval forest abandoned fallow at three developmental stages new young and old rubber plantation and primary forest an analysis of forest microhabitat structure revealed three distinctive groups primary forest new fallow and other forests these were characterized by canopy openness the basal area density and species richness of trees and vegetation types within a m radius of each plot in total individuals of small mammals from species were captured small mammals in new fallow formed a distinctive group in an analysis of species composition with high emergence of human associated rats and arboreal treeshrews however small mammal communities in the other five forest types did not differ considerably rubber plantation patches affected the populations of a rodent and a treeshrew our results suggest that the various forest uses studied here except for new fallow do not have severe effects on small mammal communities however the invasion of human associated species into primary forest may cause unfavorable or unexpected consequences such as negative effects on natural forest and animal diversity,Forest Ecology & Management,the effects of various forest uses on small mammal communities in sarawak malaysia
488,over the past few decades the montane forests of peninsula malaysia have been severely impacted by the cultivation of exotic crops and urban sprawl to guide conservation initiatives montane bird communities were studied to determine their response along a disturbance gradient with the aim of identifying key factors influencing their distribution habitat types surveyed included primary and secondary montane forests a tea plantation rural and urban areas in cameron highlands and fraser s hill response variables included species richness and density quantified via point counts and mistnet surveys explanatory variables measured were related to vegetation structure food abundance and land use cover estimated true species richness was higher for pristine and minimally disturbed sites lower in tea plantation and lowest in heavily developed town centres nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed that both vegetation structure e g canopy density and land use cover e g proportion of forest cover influence species distribution certain invasive lowland birds were tolerant of extreme development and native montane birds in general endured only slight habitat disturbances a simulation indicated that montane forest dependant species richness started to decline when more than of the canopy cover was lost less than a third of the species richness remained when more than of the canopy cover was cleared the logistic regression model suggested that sensitive species nested lower were restricted to montane habitats and foraged in mid or high canopy the dominance of lowland invasives in highly developed urban sites reveals that homogenisation of bird communities can occur even at higher altitudes in a s l the results indicated that native montane birds communities are sensitive to habitat loss and degradation thus any development in the highlands must proceed with minimal disturbance to montane forests of which keeping the canopy cover intact should be a crucial consideration,Biological Conservation,high sensitivity of montane bird communities to habitat disturbance in peninsular malaysia
489,the sustainable management of the w regional park and its peripheral areas is based on a trade off between conservation and the generation of economic income for local populations this work is a pilot study for the identification of ecological indicators to monitor ecosystem health in sudanian savannah ecosystems ecological indicators are needed to warrant the efficiency of the protection measures particularly in the mosaic landscapes of the peripheral areas two insect families coleoptera scarabaeidae cetoniinae and lepj doptera nymphalidae were trapped along transects crossing landuse units submitted to various human pressures none hunting traditional and intensive crops grazing in two countries burkina faso and benin plant species richness was found to be correlated with the abundance of four fruit feeding insect species and with the fruit feeding butterflies species richness but not with the cetoniinae species richness the abundance of nymphalidae species generally dropped with human activities but that of cetoniinae species followed the intermediate disturbance theory the likely impact of the various management practises on the general ecosystem health is discussed as is the potential value of fruitfeeding insects as bioindicators and the points that still need to be clarified,Biological Conservation,identification of ecological indicators for monitoring ecosystem health in the trans boundary w regional park a pilot study
490,under the hypothesis that bat diversity would be lower in the early stages of secondary succession and that species affected negatively by habitat modification would be more frequent in later successional stages we evaluated how bats use vegetation stands representing four stages of secondary succession following disturbance caused by slash and burn agriculture and selective logging we compared bat richness abundance and diversity and found that none of these variables was different among stages or rainy seasons however of the most common bat species two were significantly more abundant in stands at the early stages of secondary succession while the opposite was true for three other species canopy cover mainly explains these patterns rainy season had no effect on the abundance of the common species the results of this study indicate that although some frugivorous species were very abundant in the younger stands the majority of the rare species were captured in older stands the absence of rare and habitat specialized species from young successional stages close to primary forest suggests that for effective bat conservation in landscapes modified by human activity areas with original vegetation should be maintained to ensure the survivorship of sensitive to deforestation species,Animal Conservation,bat diversity and abundance associated with the degree of secondary succession in a tropical forest mosaic in south eastern mexico
491,plantation forests and second growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics we sampled the leaf litter herpetofauna of primary secondary and eucalyptus plantation forests in the jari river area of northeastern brazilian amazonia we used four complementary sampling techniques combined samples from consecutive years and collected leaf litter amphibians species and lizards species we analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity species abundance distributions and community structure primary rainforest harbored significantly more species but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second growth forest or plantations plantation forests were dominated by wide ranging habitat generalists secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat amphibian communities in secondary forests and eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct and was dominated by open area species although plantation forests are relatively impoverished naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna nevertheless secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation,Conservation Biology,the value of primary secondary and plantation forests for a neotropical herpetofauna
492,the threatened forest habitats of the tropical andes are reportedly being modified and destroyed faster than their lowland tropical counterparts but impacts on the hyper diverse resident avifauna have received little systematic study we present a baseline analysis of the effects of habitat modification on birds in a lower montane forest landscape in ecuador comparing avian community composition in landscape elements subjected to different levels of human modification primary forest secondary forest edge habitat and agricultural land we use data from a point count survey of counts at sites to test whether community composition and density of birds with different reported habitat preferences and foraging strategies change among landscape elements species richness and diversity were lowest in agricultural land but on some measures equally low in primary forest richness and diversity peaked in secondary forest and edge habitat but ordination and density analysis revealed clear differences in their species composition while secondary forest contained mostly forest preferring species edge habitat harboured a mix of forest and open land birds there was a clearly structured gradient in species composition across landscape elements with densities of habitat specialists foraging guilds and families varying considerably from primary forest to agricultural land agricultural land was characterised by an assemblage of widespread abundant species very different from that in core forest habitats as such while the majority of montane forest birds appear resilient to a certain level of habitat modification they cannot persist and are displaced where forest has been cleared outright we argue that for andean montane forests preservation of mature secondary forest offers flexibility in supplementing preserved primary forest areas to provide sufficient habitat for the persistence of this incredibly diverse but severely threatened bird community,Biodiversity and Conservation,how resilient are andean montane forest bird communities to habitat degradation
493,a widely accepted biodiversity crisis in the tropics has been recently challenged by claims that secondary forests will gradually restore biodiversity losses this prediction was examined for the herpetofauna in quintana roo mexico quantitative sampling transects of reptiles was undertaken monthly january september along a vegetation gradient covering induced grasslands and regrowth and primary rain forests a total of species was found being present in and five showing dependence on mature forests lizards contributed per cent of the individuals observed reptile abundance and snake species richness was highest in primary forests even though the lower abundance and richness did not differ between regrowth forest and induced grasslands multivariate ordinations and anosim tests displayed clear differences in assemblage structure among vegetation types mainly caused by contrasting abundances of lizard species having distinctive arboreal or terrestrial habits there was no evidence that snake assemblages differed between secondary forests and induced grasslands microhabitat availability had a key role in shaping species composition through the vegetation gradient our results dismiss the hypothesis that secondary forests can act as reservoirs of primary forest reptile diversity on the basis that many taxa depend largely on habitat quality and have specialized life history traits and that biological succession does not guarantee the recovery of assemblage complexity,Biotropica,secondary rain forests are not havens for reptile species in tropical mexico
494,conservationists have proposed that maintaining key elements of the original land cover type in modified landscapes may mitigate the detrimental effects of land cover change on residual species we tested this hypothesis for aquatic insect communities in tank forming bromeliads in forested and non forested habitats in costa rica bromeliad tanks hold much of the standing water in this region and therefore provide an important resource for insects with aquatic larval stages we quantified the relative importance of land use type and the bromeliad specific local environment on the insect community and also the effect of land use type on this local environment insect species responded to both land use type and the local environment with these variables explaining a total of of species densities the local environment independently explained of insect densities while land use type explained mainly through its modification of the local environment local environmental conditions were strongly correlated to land use type r with non forest habitat having a higher average temperature a greater variation in temperature and a lower density of bromeliads our results indicate that the land use type in which bromeliads occur influences the relative densities of insects by altering the local environment of bromeliads therefore maintaining bromeliads under land use conversion will not necessarily maintain the bromeliad insect community of the original forested habitat,Ecoscience,the impact of land use change on larval insect communities testing the role of habitat elements in conservation
495,tropical rainforests in southeast asia are decreasing rapidly because of conversion to agricultural lands which in turn leads to an increase in mosaic landscapes little is known about the effects of these anthropogenic changes on bat fauna or feeding behaviour to better explore anthropogenic effects on bats chiroptera we investigated the diversity and feeding habits of bats in an intact lowland dipterocarp forest and surrounding areas of varying vegetation types the total sampling effort using mist nets m h resulted in the capture of bats representing species simpson s index of diversity was relatively high in primary forests compared to secondary forests orchards and oil palm plantations the capture rate of two frugivorous bats clearly differed among the four vegetation types and these species were never caught in orchards or oil palm plantations in addition the capture rate of microchiropterans was notably lower in oil palm plantations than in the other three vegetation types these results indicate that many bat species rarely use agricultural land for feeding and these plant communities are not suitable for maintaining bat diversity however the data on the feeding habits of three megachiropterans that were frequently captured in orchards and oil palm plantations indicate that agricultural plants are their primary food sources orchards and oil palm plantations may be inadequate habitats for most frugivorous and insectivorous bats but these plant communities may provide important food sources for certain species of megachiropterans,Raffles Bulletin of Zoology,bat diversity in the vegetation mosaic around a lowland dipterocarp forest of borneo
496,loss of tropical forests is a major cause of biodiversity loss worldwide although drastic modification of the habitat has been shown to negatively affect amphibians we are far from a complete understanding of the response of amphibian communities to deforestation we studied frog assemblages in a gradient of forest modification in a humid area of costa rica where the primary forest has been partially converted into pasture the study area is a mosaic of primary palm forest abandoned pasture covered by secondary forest and pasture species richness was assessed by randomized walk surveys and audio strip transects we also measured ecological features to evaluate the relationship between landscape alteration and amphibian distribution the study area hosted a large number of amphibian species we focused our monitoring on six anurans leptodactylus labialis eleutherodactylus fitzingeri e diastema hyla rosenbergi h microcephala and cochranella granulosa three species l labialis h rosenbergi and h microcephala were most abundant in pasture areas with livestock presence while e fitzingeri e diastema and c granulosa were associated with primary forest most of the variation in community structure was explained by the joint effect of forest alteration and presence of livestock whereas forest specialists suffer direct negative effect from deforestation generalist species can take advantage of forest alteration and the presence of farm animals species that are able to take advantage of the new environmental characteristics associated with human modifications of landscapes will come to prevail in the new communities,Zoological Science,deforestation and the structure of frog communities in the humedale terraba sierpe costa rica
497,habitat clearance and fragmentation is increasingly threatening the biodiversity of tropical rainforests however the response of many insect species even of key organisms is still little understood using an extensive data set spanning over four years we analyzed the effects of clearance and fragmentation of a congo guinean rainforest in western kenya on the abundance and the raid rates of two species of swarm raiding army ants which are considered keystone organisms of tropical rainforests the abundance of army ants was measured by transect monitoring and by short term pitfall trapping while raid rates were measured by long term pitfall trapping over a period of five months dorylus wilverthi was the most abundant army ant in undisturbed rainforest and its abundance and raid rate strongly declined in small forest fragments in contrast the abundance of dorylus molestus increased with decreasing fragment size and compensated for the decline of d wilverthi in terms of abundance and ecological functionality i e raiding rates d molestus appears to have a higher ability of using the agricultural land surrounding the kakamega forest than d wilverthi which may explain the species specific differences in the susceptibility to habitat fragmentation our study demonstrates that habitat fragmentation may have a differential effect on two ecologically highly similar keystone species moreover it shows that species compensation might help in maintaining an important ecosystem function i e raiding by swarm raiding army ants in fragmented tropical rainforests,Biological Conservation,species compensation maintains abundance and raid rates of african swarm raiding army ants in rainforest fragments

499,in coastal california the invasive argentine ant linepithema humile displaces nearly all above ground foraging native ant species the loss of native ants following invasion by argentine ants homogenizes these faunas natural habitats invaded by l humile have lower beta diversity compared to comparable uninvaded areas argentine ant abundance in the seasonally dry mediterranean environments of this region correlates strongly and positively with soil moisture for this reason the displacement of native ants across natural and artificial moisture gradients often resembles an edge effect the magnitude of which is inversely proportional to the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of l humile the direct effects of argentine ant invasions in natural environments are therefore amplified by inputs of urban and agricultural run off indirect ecological effects of these invasions arise from the loss of large bodied ants arid adapted ants and behavioral repertoires unique to particular native ant species further research is needed to quantify how these aspects of functional homogenization affect invaded communities the close association between l humile and moist soils suggests that at least in arid regions control strategies might be aimed at reducing urban run off in order to maintain functionally diverse communities of native ants,Biological Conservation,homogenization of ant communities in mediterranean california the effects of urbanization and invasion
500,the soil fauna is often a neglected group in many large scale studies of farmland biodiversity due to difficulties in extracting organisms efficiently from the soil this study assesses the relative efficiency of the simple and cheap sampling method of handsorting against berlesetullgren funnel and winkler apparatus extraction soil cores were taken from grassy arable field margins and wheat fields in cambridgeshire uk and the efficiencies of the three methods in assessing the abundances and species densities of soil macroinvertebrates were compared handsorting in most cases was as efficient at extracting the majority of the soil macrofauna as the berlesetullgren funnel and winkler bag methods although it underestimated the species densities of the woodlice and adult beetles there were no obvious biases among the three methods for the particular vegetation types sampled and no significant differences in the size distributions of the earthworms and beetles proportionally fewer damaged earthworms were recorded in larger  cm soil cores when compared with smaller ones  cm handsorting has many benefits including targeted extraction minimumdisturbance to the habitat and shorter sampling periods and may be the most appropriate method for studies of farmland biodiversity when a high number of soil cores need to be sampled,European Journal of Soil Biology,evaluating the efficiency of sampling methods in assessing soil macrofauna communities in arable systems
501,to examine the impact of urbanisation on arthropod biodiversity carabid coleoptera carabidae assemblages were studied over years along a ruralurban gradient representing increasing levels of human disturbance carabids were collected by pitfall trapping during their whole activity period in lowland oak forest patches in and near the city of debrecen eastern hungary over two seasons  carabid activity density was significantly higher in the rural than in the two other areas but there was no significant difference in species richness measured as mean number of species caught trap the proportion of forest specialists significantly decreased from the rural towards the urban area and the proportion of forest specialist species was significantly higher in the rural and suburban areas than in the urban one in contrast the relative activity density of generalist species significantly increased along the ruralurban gradient both the relative number of openhabitat species and their activity density were significantly higher in the urban forest fragments than in the suburban and rural ones the patterns found were consistent between the years multidimensional scaling indicated pronounced changes in species composition along the gradient the assemblages in urban forest fragments were more variable than in the other areas a large proportion of the variation in overall activity density species richness and the proportion of carabids with different habitat affinities could be explained by structural habitat variables percentage cover by canopy leaf litter herbs and decaying wood and prey availability,Acta Oecologica,time consistent rearrangement of carabid beetle assemblages by an urbanisation gradient in hungary

503,the establishment of grassy strips at the margins of arable fields is an agri environment scheme that aims to provide resources for native flora and fauna and thus increase farmland biodiversity these margins can be managed to target certain groups such as farmland birds and pollinators but the impact of such management on the soil fauna has been poorly studied this study assessed the effect of seed mix and management on the biodiversity conservation and functional value of field margins for soil macrofauna experimental margin plots were established in in a winter wheat field in cambridgeshire uk using a factorial design of three seed mixes and three management practices spring cut herbicide application and soil disturbance scarification in spring and autumn soil cores taken from the margin plots and the crop were hand sorted for soil macrofauna the lumbricidae isopoda chilopoda diplopoda carabidae and staphylinidae were identified to species and classified according to feeding type diversity in the field margins was generally higher than in the crop with the lumbricidae isopoda and coleoptera having significantly more species and or higher abundances in the margins within the margins management had a significant effect on the soil macrofauna with scarified plots containing lower abundances and fewer species of isopods the species composition of the scarified plots was similar to that of the crop scarification also reduced soil and litter feeder abundances and predator species densities although populations appeared to recover by the autumn probably as a result of dispersal from neighbouring plots and boundary features the implications of the responses of these feeding groups for ecosystem services are discussed synthesis and applications this study shows that the management of agri environment schemes can significantly influence their value for soil macrofauna in order to encourage the litter dwelling invertebrates that tend to be missing from arable systems agri environment schemes should aim to minimize soil cultivation and develop a substantial surface litter layer however this may conflict with other aims of these schemes such as enhancing floristic and pollinator diversity,Journal of Applied Ecology,can arable field margins be managed to enhance their biodiversity conservation and functional value for soil macrofauna
504,arthropods were inventoried in crop fields and adjacent woody hedgerows of organic and conventional farms situated in south central ontario canada the objective was to assess the total abundance family richness and composition of beneficial and phytophagous arthropods in the farming systems and to examine the contributions of the vegetation present and landscape features on arthropod abundance and composition two hundred and forty sticky traps were installed sites and sweep net collections were conducted sites in crop fields and adjacent woody hedgerows of organic and conventional sites a total of individual arthropods belonging to families were recorded during the study no spatial autocorrelation was detected among the arthropod samples the study showed that beneficial and phytophagous arthropod abundance differed between organic and conventional sites only with sweep net but family richness did not beneficial arthropods were more abundant in woody hedgerows while phytophagous arthropods were more abundant in crop fields this study also demonstrated a strong relationship between plant and arthropod composition habitats total old field cover total hedgerow length and shannon diversity index all within m radius in the surrounding landscape influenced arthropod composition but were not leading factors in explaining richness and abundance it is therefore of prime importance to consider both local factors management practices and local vegetation and regional factors such as landscape features as explanatory variables when attempting to explain biodiversity,Ecoscience,arthropod diversity as affected by agricultural management organic and conventional farming plant species and landscape context
505,the growing pressure placed by human development on natural resources creates a need for quick and precise answers about the state of conservation of different areas thus identifying and making use of ecological indicators becomes an essential task in the conservation of tropical systems here we assess the effects of small scale disturbance on terrestrial arthropods and select groups that could be used as ecological indicators in the brazilian atlantic forest arthropods were sampled within a continuous forest in the serra do mar state park southeastern brazil both in disturbed and undisturbed areas of the reserve the abundance of exotic species was higher in the disturbed site and this pattern seems to be an adequate indicator of anthropogenic disturbance species richness of araneae carabidae scarabaeidae staphylinidae and epigaeic coleoptera pooled was higher in the undisturbed site while that of fruit feeding butterflies was higher in the disturbed site species richness was not significantly correlated between any pair of taxa in contrast species composition was significantly correlated among most groups and clearly discriminates the disturbed from the undisturbed site moreover fruit feeding butterflies and epigaeic coleoptera composition discriminated disturbed and undisturbed sites even when species were grouped into higher taxonomic levels which may be a way of overcoming the difficulty of identifying arthropod species from poorly studied species rich ecosystems potential applications for these indicators include the choice and evaluation of sites for the establishment of natural reserves elaboration of management plans and the assessment of ecological impacts due to human activities either for the purposes of licensing or legal compensation,Biological Conservation,selecting terrestrial arthropods as indicators of small scale disturbance a first approach in the brazilian atlantic forest
506,understanding the fate and turnover of the pools that comprise dissolved organic nitrogen don in soil is key to determining its role in ecosystem functioning we investigated seasonal changes of dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don concentrations within four molecular weight mw size fractions across an altitudinal gradient from lowland to montane systems and quantified individual amino acids and amino acid constituents of oligopeptidic n as well as nitrate and ammonium we tested two ideas first that don is more abundant than din in low productivity relative to high productivity grassland ecosystems and second that the abundance of peptides and amino acids is likewise greater in low than high productivity grassland the most productive site had a history of inorganic fertiliser application and hence in this site alone din was more abundant than don plant productivity varied fold between the other sites and don was generally at higher concentrations in the sites of lower productivity both in absolute terms as well as relative to din with a large increase observed in spring the fraction containing the highest concentration of the don had a mw of kda and in summer and autumn this fraction was more abundant at the lowest productivity site we conclude that relationships between the abundance of don relative to din and ecosystem productivity is dependent on season and hence more complex than previously suggested and that peptides are a dynamic and potentially nutritionally significant component of don,Soil Biology & Biochemistry,seasonal variation in soluble soil carbon and nitrogen across a grassland productivity gradient

508,the brazilian atlantic forest is currently reduced to about of its original range among the components that make up its great diversity there are species with the potential to be bioindicators which can be very important for conservation oriented studies this study compares the species composition abundance and sex ratio of terrestrial isopods in sites that show different anthropogenic disturbance histories and are located within four reserves in the atlantic forest of southwestern brazil our study explores these crustaceans as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance the influence of one of the following factors was explored in each protected area history of vegetation harvesting trail management eucalyptus planting and edge effect a total of individuals of six species atlantoscia sp benthana werneri lemos de castro pseudodiploexochus tabularis barnard pudeoniscus obscures lemos de castro styloniscus spinosus patience and trichorhina sp were captured in pitfall traps the composition of isopod species was different between most of the contrasting sites within reserves and was similar among the less disturbed sites of different reserves the total number of isopod individuals and the sex ratio were not different between the contrasting sites within most of the reserves and only the sex ratio of atlantoscia sp differed between contrasting sites of one protected area upon an individual analysis of each species s spinosus an exotic species was most abundant in more disturbed sites the distributions of b werneri and atlantoscia sp over time were relatively synchronous except where s spinosus was abundant our results also indicate that the exotic species s spinosus may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by disturbance so differences in abundance of this species may be useful for bioindication a change in the spatial and temporal structure of oniscidea communities caused by anthropogenic disturbance may have a cascade effect on ecological cycles because terrestrial isopods play a fundamental role in nutrient cycling,Zoological,the effects of four types of anthropogenic disturbances on composition and abundance of terrestrial isopods isopoda oniscidea
509,the new forest national park is a hotspot for biodiversity in the uk a long history of grazing by ponies in the new forest landscape has created a diverse mosaic of habitats that are of international significance we investigated patterns of species diversity and composition across the new forest landscape by sampling soil leaf litter and ground macrofauna from woodland grassland and heathland plots across the entire landscape we used a spatially replicated design of hand sorted soil pits winkler extraction of leaf litter and pitfall traps we concentrated on diversity patterns of the following target groups coleoptera formicidae isopoda chilopoda diplopoda opiliones and lumbricidae the most striking difference in species assemblages is between wooded and open areas woodlands are the most diverse habitats and have a distinct assemblage largely due to those leaf litter invertebrate species which are only present under a closed canopy open areas are less diverse with diversity particularly low in the wet grasslands however the open areas do have a distinct fauna especially in the wet and dry heaths which are home to a number of rare species particularly of formicidae we discuss the potential conservation problems facing the new forest and how these might affect soil macrofauna biodiversity in the future and conclude that climate change over grazing and land use changes represent the largest threats although a relatively stable landscape which benefits from protection under uk law changes in grazing intensity or management practices in the new forest particularly for some of the habitats of european importance e g wet heathlands could negatively affect soil macrofauna biodiversity climate change may also exacerbate biodiversity decline as a result of increased grazing intensity or changes in management,Biodiversity and Conservation,biodiversity of soil macrofauna in the new forest a benchmark study across a national park landscape
510,calcareous grasslands are among the most species rich plant communities in europe with a particularly high nature conservation value during the past centuries their distribution has markedly decreased at least partly due to urbanization thus we investigated the effects of urbanization on species diversity along a spatio temporal urbanization gradient from traditionally managed grassland to areas affected by urban developments which was situated in the plains northwest of munich germany both a rlq analysis linking species and environmental traits and a redundancy analysis of the plant community features showed that soil disturbance soil sealing and mean temperature explained most of the environmental variation along the gradient the species in urban habitats showed increased insect pollination earlier flowering and prolonged seed longevity while urbanization favored short lived species with dysochorous dispersal the reference grasslands harbored more wind pollinated perennials with effective vegetative spread and relatively large short lived seeds compared to the urban sites traditionally used grasslands had a higher species diversity more threatened species and a lower proportion of nonnatives we conclude that even under conservation management urban habitats are not capable of maintaining the original biodiversity however we also found threatened species occurring exclusively in urban sites hence urbanization decreased the area and diversity of traditional calcareous grasslands but it also established niches for endangered species which are not adapted to the living conditions in calcareous grasslands,Biodiversity and Conservation,species diversity and life history traits in calcareous grasslands vary along an urbanization gradient
511,the high biodiversity of soil ecosystems is often attributed to their spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales but studies on the small scale spatial distribution of soil macrofauna are few this study investigates differences between species assemblages of soil and litter invertebrates and plants using multivariate ordination and indicator species analysis for eleven microhabitats in an ash field maple woodland partially converted to conifer plantation microhabitats are divided into standard ones representing the main body of uniform litter and additional localised microhabitats species accumulation curves suggest that for inventory work targeting additional microhabitats is more efficient but for comparative work standard microhabitats are preferred vegetation showed more distinctive species assemblages than soil and leaf litter invertebrates and was strongly influenced by environmental variables deadwood habitats were found to have a distinct composition from other microhabitats within the leaf litter comprising a high proportion of saproxylic species an early successional microhabitat had distinct plant and soil fauna many of which had been previously associated with ruderal habitats seepages had a distinct earthworm fauna comprising species rarely sampled in standard soil biodiversity surveys the leaf litter in the plantation area was overall species poor providing support for removal of the conifers,European Journal of Soil Biology,microhabitat heterogeneity enhances soil macrofauna and plant species diversity in an ash field maple woodland

513,earthworms are of immense ecological and economic importance however we lack detailed understanding of the geographical distributions and habitat preferences of the uks native species natural england funded the soil biodiversity group sbg natural history museum to sample earthworms in semi natural habitats across england compile a database of earthworm species records from all available sbg research projects and assess the conservation status of the british fauna with the assistance of a team of trained volunteers from across the country sites were sampled using a standardised sampling protocol all specimens were identified and these results were combined with the earthworm species records from nine previous sbg projects the final dataset contains individual specimen records including immatures of which were identified to species these specimens were from samples collected at sites in habitat types across england and scotland the dataset represents the largest and most comprehensive dataset of species records of british earthworms the most numerous species was allolobophora chlorotica of identified specimens in the dataset followed by aporrectodea caliginosa and lumbricus castaneus the ten most abundant species represent of all identified specimens twelve species each represent less than one percent of the dataset while five species were not collected at all endogeic earthworms species that live in the topsoil and feed on soil tend to be most abundant in disturbed soils and sites with higher soil ph arable land field margins pasture and amenity grasslands in contrast epigeic earthworms species that live in leaf litter or humus and feed on leaf litter are more closely associated with woodland habitats and sites with more acid soils three criteria were used to assess the conservation status of each species local population size geographical range and habitat specificity nine species are classified as common twelve as rare and six helodrilus oculatus lumbricus friendi allolobophora cupulifera dendrobaena pygmaea eisenia andrei and aporrectodea limicola as extremely rare furthermore an examination of published records and the nhm collections suggest that the extremely rare species have each been collected fewer than ten times in the british isles and may therefore warrant being classified as vulnerable or imperilled in conservation terms however the status of these six species must be treated with caution until further research is undertaken to determine whether they still persist at the sites where they were previously recorded and whether other populations in similar habitats can be found,Natural England Commissioned Report,earthworms in england distribution abundance and habitats
514,land use change is the biggest driver of biodiversity loss worldwide but studies of land use change rarely consider below ground biodiversity my phd project aims to develop statistical models of how soil biodiversity will respond to predicted future changes in land use in the uk it uses an integrative approach combining new data collection and analysis of existing data collated from published papers and unpublished datasets from the natural history museum soil biodiversity group these data cover a range of habitats across the uk and show that ph is a major driver of earthworm distribution however ph is compounded by the influence of underlying geology soil type and land use history the heathland restoration techniques used at the isle of purbeck recare site has resulted in a gradient of ph measures from to on the same soil type providing an opportunity to study the influence of ph on earthworm diversity with less confounding factors this can then be used as a calibration to the dataset compiled from many studies,,unpublished data of macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity from purbeck heathland restoration soil biodiversity sampling
516,tropical land use intensification is rapidly increasing in regions that harbour high levels of biodiversity thus posing a serious threat to the stability and resilience of tropical ecosystems and the important ecosystem services that they provide we compared functional group richness and functional dispersion in litter invertebrate communities among four different land use systems ranging in intensity from primary degraded lowland forest to oil palm agriculture in two landscapes on sumatra indonesia we then investigated the consequences for functional stability and community resilience by calculating functional redundancy and response diversity of sampled communities from primary degraded forest to intensively managed oil palmsystems we found a decrease in species richness and a reduction in density but weaker effects on functional group richness and an increase in functional dispersion although we detected no significant alteration of response diversity functional redundancy of litter invertebrate communities decreased clearly by losing of functionally redundant species due to land use change our results indicate that land use change fromtropical rainforest to oil palmagriculture can alter both taxonomic and functional diversity of litter invertebrate communities resulting in the loss of functional redundancy and thus functional stability of these ecosystems however we also show that land use systems of intermediate management intensity such as jungle rubber agroforestry could serve as reservoirs of functional diversity and stability in monoculture dominated production landscapes,Biological Conservation,functional diversity and stability of litter invertebrate communities following land use change in sumatra indonesia

518,the chemical composition of terricolous lichens top soil and abundance and diversity of lichen communities were assessed at eight sites in the pechora basin during the summer of and to assess local impacts of oil and gas operations sites close to industrial areas were compared with areas considered to be pristine the broad objective of the study was to identify changes in the chemistry of a suite of lichens that could be caused by pollutants from the industrial sites in particular increases in the ratios of k mg and k ca mg are indicators of acid deposition and increased n indicates increased n deposition lead was also measured in lichens other elements measured were ba ca cd cu k mg na ni pb sr and zn in top soils the pechora basin north eastern european russia includes the north and east of the komi republic and a major portion of the nenets autonomous region it is bounded by the ural mountains to the east and by the timan range to the west the area has extensive natural resources both renewable e g forests and non renewable e g minerals coal oil and gas there were limited modifications in the chemistry of lichens and top soils and lichen diversity close to an oil and gas industrial complex here there were elevations of lead and nitrogen concentrations in lichen apices and in the apical basal nitrogen ratio in flavocetraria cucullata with lower lichen diversity in epigeal and epiphytic lichens elevated concentrations of ba and ca were found in soil ash over the cm horizon probably as a result of local emissions from construction activity and gas flaring rather than from long range transport virtually all other sites remained unmodified and reflected background concentrations the ecological impacts of the measured pollution loads were low as elemental concentrations were generally below detection limits except for one industrial site where there were signs of an early indicator of industrial activity,Ecological Indicators,an assessment of pollution impacts due to the oil and gas industries in the pechora basin north eastern european russia
519,community structure and relative abundance of species of small mammals and forest birds were compared among three types of residual forest stands and unharvested control forest co treatments were young and old mosaics a checkerboard pattern of residual and logged forest units of ha each and megablocks residual stands of ha isolated within a logged area of ha relative abundances were also used to establish habitat use models hums we found no statistical difference in species relative abundances between treatments and cos although small sample sizes limited statistical power hums explained a large amount of variation in habitat use for mammal and bird species mean ranging between and variance partitioning emphasized the importance of stand structure characteristics as the principal predictors of abundance for censused species our results suggested that mosaics and megablocks are both suitable configurations to maintain studied species because no species exhibited lower relative abundances in such residual forest stands than cos we suggest that residual forest stands planning should shift from a strictly landscape perspective toward a more holistic approach that considers residual forest structure as well as landscape characteristics,Canadian Journal of Forest Research,effects of stand structure and landscape characteristics on habitat use by birds and small mammals in managed boreal forest of eastern canada
520,two large scale forestry experiments in quebec sylviculture et amenagement forestiers ecosysystemique safe and alberta ecosystem management by emulating natural disturbance e mend were established in the late s to test the effects of alternative silvicultural strategies e g partial cutting oil biodiversity in northern boreal forests we collected spiders in pitfall traps years after the application of partial cutting treatments ill deciduous stands at emend and years after similar treatments in deciduous stands at safe although we are aware of the challenges imposed by disparate locations and whole scale experimental methods our objective was to compare the effects of partial cutting oil spider assemblages diversity and community composition and ill doing so to formulate a few general statements overall species individuals were collected from alberta and species individuals from quebec of these species were common to both regions ordination and indicator species analyses revealed a distinct effect of geographic separation the spider assemblages in deciduous stands within the boreal plains ecoregion of alberta and the boreal shield ill quebec were distinct however the effects of partial cutting oil spider assemblages within each project were similar removal of of trees shifted a characteristic old growth fauna toward one more typical of clearcuts indicator species analysis also revealed the dominance of wolf spider lycosidae species in clearcuts within both experiments and we present evidence that clear cutting homogenizes spider assemblages old growth forests contain spider faunas that are easily disrupted by moderate partial cutting in the face of intense harvesting practices managing for the maintenance of biodiversity and conservation of spider faunas in northern forests will require retention of old growth forests,Canadian Entomologist,effects of experimental harvesting on spider araneae assemblages in boreal deciduous forests
521,studies of beetle fauna are very sparse and episodic especially in the middle lithuania data from ukmerg adminsitrative district is quite insufficient as only one comprehensive research related to coleoptera was performed and published dvilevicius et al that was one of the main reasons for doing an extensive beetle field research using pitfall traps in forests near ukmerg town and vaitkukis village in  and a part of the data is presented in this article,New and Rare for Lithuania Insect Species,new records of rare species of coleoptera found in ukmergė district in
522,effects of clear cutting on biodiversity have mainly been studied in the short term although knowledge of longer term effects are often more important for managers of forest biodiversity we assessed relatively long term effects of clear cutting on litter dwelling land snails a group with slow active dispersal and considered to be intolerant to microclimate changes in a pair wise design we compared snail abundance species density and species composition between old seminatural stream side stands and matched young stands developed years after clear cutting using a standardized semi quantitative method we identified all snail specimens in a l subsample of a pooled litter sample collected from small patches within a x m plot in each stream side stand from the young stands a mean of shells and species was extracted which was significantly higher than the shells and species found in old forests only two of the species encountered showed a stronger affinity to old than to young forests in short term studies of boreal stream side forests land snail abundance is reduced by clear cutting our results indicate that this decline is transient for most species and within a few decades replaced by an increase we suggest that local survival in moist stream side refugia makes the land snails able to benefit from the higher ph and more abundant non conifer litter in young than in old boreal forests our results highlight the importance of longer term studies as a basis for management guidelines for biodiversity conservation,Biological Conservation,different long term and short term responses of land snails to clear cutting of boreal stream side forests
523,repeated fertilization of forests to increase biomass production is an environmentally controversial proposal the effects of which we assessed on breeding birds in stands of young norway spruce picea abies in an intensively managed forest area in southern sweden our results show that fertilized stands had more species and more individuals than unfertilized stands compared with stands under traditional management the further intensification of forestry by repeated applications of fertilizers thus seemed to enhance species richness and abundance of forest birds we cannot conclude at this stage whether the response in the bird community was caused by changes in food resources or increased structural complexity in the forest canopy due to the skid roads used for the application of the fertilizers future studies should focus on structural and compositional effects of fertilization processes during the entire rotation period and at assessing its effects in a landscape context,AMBIO,can repeated fertilizer applications to young norway spruce enhance avian diversity in intensively managed forests
524,most studies of small mammal responses to habitat alterations focus on dominant species with a resulting lack of information for rare species jumping mice order rodentia dipodidae tend to be rare in small mammal trapping studies thus little is known of their response to habitat alterations such as clear cut logging we examined the spatial distribution of meadow jumping mice zapus hudsonius captured in upland habitat types forest interior forest edge and logged forest in the boreal forest of southeastern yukon canada meadow jumping mice were the third most common rodent captured and consistently constituted of captures in all of the habitat types meadow jumping mice may not be rare in some boreal mammal assemblages significantly less animals were captured in the forest interior compared to the forest edge or logged forest p a preference or avoidance of sharp habitat edges created by logging was not detected logged areas may be more preferred over unlogged areas by meadow jumping mice because they provide relatively diverse and abundant food resources and cover to provide data more useful for biodiversity conservation we suggest that studies of small mammals in forest ecosystems deploy a variety of trap types and sample at sufficient intensity to provide information on both dominant and rare species,Mammalian Biology,spatial distribution of meadow jumping mice zapus hudsonius in logged boreal forest of northwestern canada
525,in the process of implementing sustainable management in the eastern canadian boreal forest we tested two selection cutting methods and compared them with two widely used practices in the boreal forest clearcutting with protection of the advanced growth and soils and irregular shelterwood cutting leaving small merchantable stems we used old growth irregular stands as references in comparing the impact of these silvicultural treatments on the diversity and abundance of beetles three groups were targeted saproxylic flying beetles epigaeic saproxylic beetles and epigaeic non saproxylic beetles a sampling design including pitfall traps and multidirectional flight interception traps was deployed in a total of beetles was captured including taxa distributed among families we found that clearcutting with protection of the advanced growth and soils and irregular shelterwood cutting leaving small merchantable stems had a greater impact on beetle communities than both selection cuttings canopy opening as well as the presence of snags and downed woody debris appear as important attributes for several saproxylic and non saproxylic species beetle communities in selection cuttings remained more similar to those found in controls these silvicultural treatments are new tools to implement ecosystemic and sustainable management in irregular boreal forests,Silva Fennica,alternative silvicultural practices in irregular boreal forests response of beetle assemblages
526,in boreal black spruce forests of eastern canada a cohort model of ecosystem management has been proposed whereby a combination of both partial and more intensive cutting are used to emulate old growth stands and the re establishment of stands following severe wildfire as with other approaches to coarse filter conservation partial cutting is hypothesized to maintain and potentially recreate plant and animal assemblages consistent with a range of natural variability in this study we used ground dwelling spiders araneae to evaluate whether partial cutting and a cohort model of ecosystem management are sufficient to preserve biodiversity found in mature and over mature boreal black spruce stands prone to paludification we compared the spider fauna individuals representing species in replicated partial cuts clear cuts and uncut control stands with a chronosequence of mature and over mature naturally regenerated stands years since the last fire stands in total in the same region of the northern clay belt in quebec canada in stands that were old growth prior to cutting harvesting had strong repercussions on spider assemblages that were not attenuated by less intensive partial cutting the most obvious changes in spider assemblages were related to increased recruitment of species that were nearly absent in uncut stands several cosmopolitan species that were widely distributed among stands prior to harvest increased in cut stands spider assemblages collected following either cutting methods were not consistent with assemblages found within the chronosequence and thus fell outside the observed range of natural variability however we did not observe a similar recruitment effect for spider species in younger stands with relatively higher levels of retention we demonstrate that the interaction between stand age prior to cutting the degree of paludification as well as remnant basal area are important considerations when evaluating the efficacy of partial cutting to maintain forest spider assemblages and biodiversity at large in black spruce stands we also suggest that retention levels in partial cuts will have to be substantially increased to maintain spider communities within their range of natural variation in managed forested landscapes however partial cutting with higher levels of retention particularly in younger stands may be useful in coarse filter management particularly for establishing or accelerating spider assemblages towards those found in old growth stands,Forest Ecology & Management,partial cutting does not maintain spider assemblages within the observed range of natural variability in eastern canadian black spruce forests
527,we examined the response of breeding songbird communities years after four vegetation management treatments were applied post treatment vegetation was characterized by manually interpreting large scale aerial photography and estimating proportional cover of eight vegetation classes songbird abundance was assessed by territory mapping using gis layers number of registrations and average vegetation proportions were compared among treatments ordination of the relative abundance of the most frequent bird species suggested differences between vision® and untreated areas these results show that effects of vegetation management on songbirds may be more persistent than previous studies suggest and that monitoring should continue,The Forestry Chronicle,response of breeding songbirds to vegetation management in conifer plantations established in boreal mixedwoods
528,there is a risk that short term studies either underestimate disturbance effects because of time lagged responses including both time lagged extinctions and colonizations or overestimate them because of fast recovery to evaluate the conservation effectiveness of tree group retention in this case buffer strips along streams we studied the bryophyte community once prior to and twice after logging comparing one buffer and one clear cut plot ha in each of riparian sites we asked whether time lagged responses or recovery processes had dominated the period between two re inventories and years after logging focusing both on the whole community and on species of conservation concern although there were examples of recovering species in both clear cuts and buffer strips the similarity in species composition to predisturbance conditions had decreased in the second re inventory even if the buffer strips displayed more time lagged colonizations and local extinctions over the later period compared to the clear cuts the overall species composition in the buffer strips was still significantly more similar to the prelogging conditions than the clear cuts the red listed species had mostly declined during the first period and the number of red list species per plot mostly species growing on dead wood was rather stable at of predisturbance levels in clear cuts and in buffer strips in the last re inventory synthesis and applications we show that most extinctions of red list species occurred soon after disturbance and that the conclusions drawn from a study carried out years after the disturbance did not change profoundly years later although the species composition in the buffer strips continued to change over time sensitive species survived much better in buffer strips than in clear cuts which supports the practice of retaining buffer strips for terrestrial species too this knowledge should encourage managers to find ways of increasing the efficacy of this practice one obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition,Applied Ecology,do time lagged extinctions and colonizations change the interpretation of buffer strip effectiveness a study of riparian bryophytes in the first decade after logging
529,fragmented urban forest remnants are characterised by sharp edges and are bordered by various land use types which may have a considerable effect on the fauna and flora at forest edges and into forest interiors to investigate the effects of differentially contrasting edges low vs intermediate vs high on carabid beetle assemblages in urban boreal forests we placed pitfall traps along a gradient from m into three matrix types secondary forest vs grassland vs asphalt up to m into urban forest patches in the cities of vantaa and helsinki southern finland individual species and carabid beetle assemblages were strongly affected by edge contrasts and distance from the forest edge the strongest effect on individual species was caused by high contrasting edges generalist and open habitat species were favoured or not affected while forest specialists were affected negatively effects of the abundances of potential prey and competitors on the carabid beetles were also evaluated forest and moisture associated carabid species were negatively to neutrally associated with springtail abundances while generalist and open habitat and dryness associated species were more positively related to springtail abundances a potential food source in terms of potential competitors forest and moisture associated carabid species were negatively and or neutrally affected by ant and wood ant numbers while generalist and open habitat species were neutrally to positively associated with these taxa it appears that carabid beetle habitat associations are more important in the responses of these beetles across edges of different contrast than are the prey and competitor numbers collected there we recommend the creation of soft or low contrast urban edges if the aim of urban management is to protect forest carabids in cities,Journal of Insect Conservation,forest edge contrasts have a predictable effect on the spatial distribution of carabid beetles in urban forests
530,green tree retention prescriptions have been proposed as a silvicultural technique for reducing the negative impacts of clearcutting on mature forest associated species while still promoting habitat for early successional species we evaluated the effectiveness of green tree retention for conserving mature forest associated generalist and early successional songbirds in aspen stands that were years post harvest we compared species occupancy estimates at sites where green tree retention levels were exceeded canopy cover met or below recommended retention guidelines we also compared the relative importance of these levels of green tree retention to forest stand age in explaining songbird occurrence with the exception of red eyed vireos our results suggest that current green tree retention guidelines are ineffective at increasing site occupancy of mature forest associated songbirds in aspen harvest units additionally site occupancy of early successional and generalist songbirds were unaffected by these levels of retention rather site occupancy probabilities for most forest birds showed a clear association with age since harvest years however the strength and direction of the association varied by species our research highlights the importance of considering forest stand age when assessing the impact of silvicultural prescriptions on forest songbirds future management objectives in aspen forests should reflect the value of clearcutting to early successional and generalist bird species while recognizing that green tree retention as measured in our study does little to promote occupancy of the mature forest associated bird community,Forest Ecology & Management,songbird response to green tree retention prescriptions in clearcut forests

535,biodiversity in managed plantations has become an important issue for longterm sustainability of ecosystems the environmental effects of plantations comprised of fast growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated on one hand monocultures have been said to exhaust resources resulting in decreased biodiversity conversely it has been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding forests increasing biodiversity in order to clarify the effects of planting eucalyptus trees on species composition diversity and functional type of understory vegetation in yunnan province a field trial was implemented to compare eucalyptus plantations eps with two other local current vegetation types secondary evergreen forests ses and abandoned farmlands afs each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational ranges low  meters above sea level masl medium  masl and high  masl sample sites within each elevational range had similar environmental characteristics slope aspect etc thus we sampled three vegetation types at each of three sites at each of three elevations for a total of plots we calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as analyses of variance anova and indicator species analysis we found that fast growing introduced eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the se plots being essentially absent from the ep and af plots the understory plant diversity did not correlate with the altitude gradient significantly eucalyptus plantations eps have a simpler community structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests ses similar to natural state or abandoned farmlands afs no variable significantly explained variation of the understory shrub layer but soil moisture holding capacity and overstory coverage were significant in explaining variation of the understory herb layer suggesting that the study of soil physical properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in eucalyptus plantations and other local current vegetation types,New Forests,understory plant diversity assessment of eucalyptus plantations over three vegetation types in yunnan china
536,diversity of ground beetle coleoptera carabidae assemblages and sub assemblages was compared between reafforested woodland grassland and intensively cultivated fields at chongli county in northern china an array of eight pitfall traps per plot was used to sample the beetles on four replicate plots for each habitat replanted conifer woodland and semi natural grassland harbored very similar beetle assemblages these had significantly lower rarefied species numbers than the distinctly different assemblages recorded in cultivated fields with differences in alpha diversity being less pronounced for large and predatory species carabid activity density levels were higher in both woodland and grassland than in fields with this trend being most pronounced for predatory and large species to conserve high levels of gamma diversity it is important to maintain a mosaic of agricultural areas and semi natural habitats the latter also form a potential source for predatory species important in pest control it appears that woodland specific species are rare in the study area or they have not been able to reach and colonize the newly established woodland sites it can also be concluded that morphological and ecological traits allow important insights into underlying ecological principles of overall diversity patterns,Restoration Ecology,ground beetle coleoptera carabidae assemblages of restored semi natural habitats and intensively cultivated fields in northern china
537,deforestation is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss globally large areas of primary forest have been replaced by secondary forests and plantations and changes in tree species composition have often led to alteration of plant and animal communities that were associated with those primary forests hong kong has experienced a long history of deforestation and may be one of the pioneers in using exotic tree plantations for forest restoration in asia in this study we sampled herpetofaunal assemblages in native secondary forests and exotic lophostemon confertus plantations by transect surveys pitfall traps and coverboards amphibians were more abundant in secondary forests than in plantations while the abundance of reptiles and species compositions of both amphibians and reptiles were similar in both forest types body condition of the most common reptile sphenomorphus indicus indian forest skink was similar between secondary forests and plantations however higher proportions of s indicus exhibited autotomized or missing tails in secondary forests than in plantations which may be related to higher percentages of rock and wood cover on the forest floor potentially increasing the chance of escape from predators in secondary forests secondary forests may provide a better habitat for herpetofauna we suggest that planting of a mixture of native tree species and thinning of exotic trees may be favorable management efforts to enhance biodiversity in future plantation in south china,New Forests,terrestrial herpetofaunal assemblages in secondary forests and exotic lophostemon confertus plantations in south china
